It’s unclear what caused the explosion, but Putin on Monday blamed it on Kyiv and called it a “terrorist attack” that could not be left unanswered.\n\nThe intense bombardment that followed over the next two days killed at least 19 people and leveled civilian targets across the country, drawing global outrage. The strikes also caused major damage to power systems across Ukraine, forcing people to reduce consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts.\n\nPutin said that while he did not regret the strikes and believes that Russia’s actions were correct, he did recognize that “what is happening now is unpleasant.”\n\nPutin also defended his partial mobilization of Russians that began in September, telling reporters it is expected to end in two weeks and that some 222,000 troops had already been drafted into the army.\n\nThe mobilization got off to a chaotic start last month, sparking rare protests throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands of people – mostly fighting-age men – fled Russia, pouring into neighboring countries like Georgia and Kazakhstan to avoid conscription.\n\nPutin also said that Russia does not seek to “destroy” Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Western leaders have previously alleged. His comments come seven months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion and as Moscow attempts to annex four Ukrainian regions in violation of international law.\n\nThe Russian leader was speaking at a rare news conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, where Putin had traveled for a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a regional intergovernmental organization made up of former Soviet states.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the signing ceremony with separatist leaders in Moscow on September 30 Contributor/Getty Images\n\nWhen asked if he would meet with US President Joe Biden, Putin told a reporter that he “does not see the need for negotiations.”\n\nBiden was asked a similar question in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this week. The US President said he did not see “any rationale” for meeting his Russian counterpart, though he said he would perhaps make an exception to discuss the fate of imprisoned American basketball star Brittney Griner.\n\nRussian setbacks in Kherson\n\nRussian authorities said civilian evacuations would begin Friday in the occupied southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, where the Kremlin has suffered a string of defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces.\n\nFurther to the east, Russia’s embattled forces have managed to make some small gains in Donetsk, toward the city of Bakhmut, aided in large measure by Wagner mercenaries, or private military contractors. Moscow likely views the city a jumping-off point toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – the largest urban areas held by Ukraine in Donetsk, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\nBakhmut is currently under Ukrainian control, but it has been bombarded by Russian artillery for months. Reports from pro-Russian analysts and in Russian state media alleged that Kyiv had begun withdrawing some forces from the city, but CNN could not independently verify those claims. Ukrainian officials have not commented on them, but they have noted that Bakhmut is being fiercely contested.\n\nMeanwhile, the outlook for Russian forces in Kherson and the northeastern region of Luhansk remain bleak. Kyiv has continued to make significant gains along the western side of the Dnipro River, a major waterway that flows across Ukraine and Eastern Europe, as they push toward the city of Kherson.\n\nA man walks near anti-tank obstacles in the frontline town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region on Tuesday. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFighting near Kherson city continued to rage on Friday. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-backed administration in Kherson, said Moscow’s forces were “courageously and professionally holding back the daily attempts of the militants of the Kyiv regime to break through the defenses.”\n\nThough Stremousov said civilians should be at a “safe distance from the hostilities” and that Kherson residents appeared to have begun evacuating. The governor of the eastern Russian region of Rostov, Vasily Golubev, said Thursday that local authorities were preparing to receive residents of Kherson fleeing the front lines, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Golubev said the first group of evacuees would arrive on Friday.\n\nGolubev’s comments came after Russia’s deputy prime minister confirmed Moscow would assist with evacuation efforts, heeding calls from the head of the Kremlin-backed administration in Kherson who had pleaded for help.\n\nA destroyed apartment remains is seen Tuesday in Bakhmut. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere is now concern that Ukrainian citizens in occupied territory may be forced to go to Russian territory against their will. Reports emerged early in the war of tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians being forcibly sent to so-called “filtration centers” before being moved to Russia. Moscow denounced the claims as lies, alleging that Ukraine has hindered its efforts to “evacuate” people to Russia. But allegations of these centers stirred painful memories of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s forced deportation of millions from their homelands.\n\nOver the summer, Ukrainian officials in the contested region of Zaporizhzhia appealed to citizens who were in Russian-occupied territory to move away from front lines and into other Ukrainian-controlled territory. If that option was not possible, they advised Ukrainians to use Crimea or Russian territory as a transit route toward Ukraine or a friendly country.\n\nThose on the frontlines in Kherson are now being advised by Ukrainian officials to avoid traveling to Russia altogether.\n\n“Under no circumstances should you go to the Russian Federation,” warned Oleksandr Samoylenko, a top Ukrainian official in the Kherson region, on Friday. Samoylenko said that Ukrainian forces were only targeting Russian positions and equipment using high-precision weapons.\n\nSamoylenko’s and his deputy, Yurii Sobolevskyi, both accused Russia of trying to Ukrainian citizens out of the region so they could repopulate it with “zombies who are 100% loyal to Moscow.” Sobolevskyi alleged that a similar scheme was carried out in Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nKherson is one of four regions Russia is now attempting to annex from Ukraine. The others are Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine and Donetsk and Luhansk, two eastern Ukrainian regions where fighting against Russian-backed breakaway republics has raged since 2014.", "authors": ["Anna Chernova Uliana Pavlova Mick Krever Olga Voitovich", "Anna Chernova", "Uliana Pavlova", "Mick Krever", "Olga Voitovich"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/us/giant-sequoia-tree-grove-yosemite-fire", "title": "Yosemite Park fire: Evacuation orders issued as fire threatens ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA growing wildfire that threatens a famed giant sequoia tree grove in California’s Yosemite National Park has forced officials to issue evacuation orders for a nearby community, officials said Friday.\n\nThe Washburn Fire has swelled to nearly 500 acres as it burns near the lower portion of Mariposa Grove, Yosemite park officials said. Firefighters are working from the ground and air to suppress the blaze, and park officials said the grove will remain closed until further notice.\n\nAmid the fire’s expansion, park officials urged people in Yosemite’s Wawona campground and community to evacuate.\n\nMariposa Grove is home to more than 500 giant sequoia trees, which can grow to over 250 feet tall. And while the grove was founded in 1857, they existed long before that, with some believed to be more than 2,000 years old.\n\nYosemite is one of the most visited national parks in the US, drawing more than 3.3 million people in 2021. It encompasses nearly 1,200 square miles in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in eastern California.\n\nMeanwhile, California crews are also battling the Electra Fire, which has scorched more than 4,400 acres across Amador and Calaveras counties, also in the Sierra Nevadas, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe blaze prompted the state’s first night-water-drop operation via helicopter Wednesday, when about 12,000 gallons of water were dumped on the flames, Cal Fire Battalion Chief Isaac Sanchez told CNN.\n\n“The helicopter was brought in to assist in the cooling and containment of a firing operation which had taken place earlier in the afternoon,” Sanchez said. “While assigned to this operation, the helicopter identified additional areas where the fire had crept over the containment lines and was able to aid in their full extinguishment and containment.”\n\nThe western US has been ravaged by wildfires in recent years, exacerbated by drought conditions tied to climate change. In California alone, more than 2.5 million acres were destroyed in nearly 9,000 fires last year, according to Cal Fire.\n\nLast month, officials in Southern California said they were bracing for another challenging summer and fall amid a shortage of firefighting crews and increased workloads.\n\nThe threat is not limited to California. Robert Garcia, the US Forest Service’s fire chief for the Angeles National Forest, said the summer months are off to a “concerning start.” Firefighting resources have been mobilizing since March to Arizona and New Mexico, where the Black Fire just became the state’s second-largest blaze in history.\n\n“Southern California typically has a fire season of historically late June and then into the fall,” Chief Garcia told CNN last month. “But we’re seeing activity now year round.”", "authors": ["Taylor Romine"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/03/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/9353494002/", "title": "Ukraine recap: Nuclear plant fire extinguished after Russian attacks", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Thursday, March. 3. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Friday, March 4, as Russia's invasion continues in the region.\n\nAuthorities in Ukraine said Friday that a fire at Europe's largest nuclear plant after enduring heavy shelling from Russian forces in the southern of Enerhodar has been extinguished.\n\nIn a statement, Ukraine's regional military administration said there was damage to the compartment of reactor No. 1 at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar, but it does not affect the safety of the power unit, adding that operational personnel are ensuring its safety.\n\nNo information was immediately available about casualties. Ukrainian officials said that radiation levels in the area weren’t at dangerous levels.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said late Thursday that she had spoken to her counterpart in Ukraine, and said the \"plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.\"\n\nA White House official said President Joe Biden spoke with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday about the situation at the nuclear plant. The latest information shows no indications of elevated levels of radiation, but officials are monitoring the situation closely, the official said.\n\nIn an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Zelenskyy said he feared an explosion that would be “the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe.”\n\n“Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops,” he said. “Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.”\n\nThe assault renewed fears that the invasion could damage one of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and set off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 65 miles north of the capital.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for an emergency meeting of the U.N.

Wolfsthal, former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, tweeted that the Zaporizhzhia power plant was \"inherently more safe and protected than the Chernobyl.\"\n\nJames M. Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. echoed Jennex's assessment of the danger posed by the Russian attack, saying the fire could result in a \"Fukushima-style meltdown.\"\n\nIn that nuclear incident in Japan, a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 destroyed the Fukushima plant’s cooling systems, triggering the meltdown of three reactors and the release of large amounts of radiation, and causing more than 160,000 people to evacuate.\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster, while geographically close, was caused by a different process, Acton told USA TODAY. It was caused by operator error and led to a different level of danger — a situation where the nuclear fuel explodes.

The yacht was recently seized by Germany. The White House called Usmanov \"a close ally of Putin.''\n\nThe Biden administration is also imposing travel restrictions on 19 Russian oligarchs and their 47 family members and close associates. According to the White House, those oligarchs are known for directing, authorizing, funding or supporting Russia’s foreign policy. The administration has taken steps to place visa restrictions on the group.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the sanctions are cutting off Russia's access to technology and the global financial system, and that they are having a deep impact.\n\n“The goal is to maximize the impact on Putin and Russia and minimize the harm and loss to our allies and friends around the world,” Biden said. “Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nFormer Fox producer charged with violating sanctions against Russia for its 2014 takeover of Crimea\n\nFormer Fox News producer Jack Hanick was charged with sanctions violations and lying to the FBI in the first such indictment arising from sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Justice Department said Thursday.\n\nAccording to court documents unsealed in federal court in Manhattan, the 71-year-old Hanick worked for years for Konstantin Malofeyev even after the Russian oligarch was sanctioned for financing Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nThe indictment said Hanick, a U.S. citizen, “knowingly chose to help Malofeyev spread his destabilizing messages by establishing, or attempting to establish, TV networks in Russia, Bulgaria and Greece, in violation of those sanctions.”\n\nThe indictment comes a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the launch of a task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions and restrictions the U.S. and its allies have imposed for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nUkrainians in U.S. granted temporary protection from deportation\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Thursday announced temporary protected status for Ukrainians living in the United States, which will shield them from deportation for the next 18 months, as Ukraine continues to face ongoing attacks from Russia.\n\n“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”\n\nIndividuals must have continuously lived in the U.S. since March 1 to be eligible for TPS, DHS said. That would apply to approximately 30,000 Ukrainian nationals. Those who attempt to travel to the U.S. after March 1 do not qualify for TPS.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nRussia hammering Ukraine's southern cities\n\nUkraine’s major cities have come under heavy bombardment, a senior Defense Department official said. About 90% of the 150,000 combat forces Putin deployed to Ukraine’s borders are now inside the country, said the official, who described military movements on condition of anonymity.\n\nHeavily populated southern cities along the Black Sea and Sea of Azov were among primary targets as Russia's campaign threatened to cut off shipping. Hennadiy Lahuta, governor of Kherson Oblast, said the government building in the Black Sea port city of Kherson, with a population of almost 280,000, was seized by Russian troops. Units were also bearing down on Mykolaiv, 40 miles to the northwest and home to almost half a million Ukrainians, The New York Times reported. U.S. officials said Russia had fired 480 missiles at Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces failed to capture Mariupol, a city of 450,000 on the Azov Sea, and had \"resorted to a blockade, creating a humanitarian disaster,\" the Ukrainian military said. Food, water and even electricity have been cut off, women and children halted from evacuating. In the vital energy-producing southern city of Enerhodar, a hub on the Dnieper River, Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts, Mayor Dmytro Orlov said.\n\nThe Ukraine military said four large landing ships and three missile boats were moving through the Black Sea in the direction of the Odesa and its 1 million residents. Russian sailors were firing on civilian ships and taking prisoners, according to the military.\n\nRussia has acknowledged that nearly 500 of its troops have been killed in the war and about 1,600 wounded. Ukraine, which has not released casualty figures for its own armed forces, has estimated Russian troop losses at up to 9,000.\n\nUkraine’s State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died, though it was impossible to verify the claim. The U.N. human rights office said it had recorded 227 deaths, including 15 under age 18, and 525 injured, since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24.\n\nZelenskyy says 16,000 foreign volunteers have answered call to fight for Ukraine\n\nUkraine has sent out a call for foreign volunteers to join its fight against the Russian invaders, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there has been a strong response.\n\nIn a video posted online, Zelenskyy said the first 16,000 fighters from other countries \"are already on their way to protect freedom and life for us, and for all.''\n\nWhile many governments are limiting their involvement in the war to sending weapons and other forms of aid, which Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for, others have gone a step further.\n\nThe Czech Republic said Thursday it won’t get in the way of its citizens who decide to join international brigades to help Ukraine. Serving in a foreign army is punishable by a prison term in the Czech Republic, but Prime Minister Petr Fiala said those who fight for Ukraine in this war would be pardoned by President Milos Zeman, with him co-signing it.\n\nCongressmen want oligarchs' assets 'repurposed' to benefit Ukraine\n\nReps. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) and Joe Wilson (R-SC) introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday to seize any assets from oligarchs whose wealth is linked to the corruption of Vladimir Putin’s repressive regime and “repurpose” them to help Ukraine.\n\nThe legislation authorizes the Biden administration to confiscate any property – including luxury villas, yachts and airplanes – valued over $5 million from Russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the U.S. government for their involvement in the Kremlin’s invasion and human rights violations in Ukraine.\n\nAny funds gained from asset sales must then be used to benefit the Ukrainian people through the provision of military and humanitarian assistance, post-conflict reconstruction and technology to ensure the free flow of information in Ukraine, the two lawmakers said.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nWhite House seeks $10 billion for Ukraine\n\nThe White House on Thursday requested $10 billion from Congress to aid Ukraine. Much of the aid to Ukraine would be used to support the country’s military in its fight against the Russian invasion, though a significant portion would also go toward humanitarian assistance for Ukrainians fleeing violence or who have been made food insecure by the attack.\n\n“To continue this important work and further support the Ukrainian people, we are requesting $10 billion to deliver additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks,” Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a blog post.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\n1 million have fled in 'swiftest exodus this century'\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled the fighting. The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, where residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the city's train station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed. The Ukrainian government said at least 34 people were killed and 285 injured, including 10 children, during the shelling of Kharkiv.\n\nIn one week, more than 2% of Ukraine’s population has been forced out of the country, according to a tally from the United Nations, which called the mass flight one of the \"swiftest refugee exodus this century.\"\n\nPutin siege tactics could bring mass destruction, death to Ukraine\n\nPutin's military forces seem poised to adopt siege tactics that could result in enormous civilian deaths and infrastructure damage after their initial assault has failed to topple the Ukrainian government, officials and experts say. The Ukrainian cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol have come under heavy bombardment from airstrikes and artillery – similar to tactics Putin used in Syria and Chechnya.\n\n\"A siege is likely and may last as long as several weeks,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Armed Services Committee. \"He’ll try to wear down resistance in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other major cities, hitting civilian centers with massive explosives, airstrikes and missiles.\" Read more here.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nPutin nuclear talk sparks run on iodine pills\n\nFighting in the vicinity of the former Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine followed by news Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had put his nuclear arsenal on alert has prompted a rush on iodine in some European countries. In Belgium, Pharmacists’ Union’s Michael Storme told the press agency Belga that druggists there had given away 30,000 packs of iodine tablets Monday alone. Some pharmacies in Finland were running out of iodine tablets, which can protect the thyroid gland from the effects of radiation.\n\nThe U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission notes that it is a “very specialized protection\" and says evacuation is the most effective measure because it \"protects the whole body from all radionuclides and all exposure pathways.\"\n\nZelenskyy: Russian soldiers are 'confused children'\n\nIn a video address to the nation early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to keep up their resistance but didn’t comment on whether the Russians have seized any cities.\n\n“They will have no peace here,” Zelenskyy said, calling on the Russian soldiers to “go home” and describing them as “confused children who have been used.” He said that for Ukrainians this was a patriotic war that won't end until the Russians have been driven out.\n\n\"Wherever they go they will be destroyed,\" Zerenskyy said. \"They will not have one quiet moment. The occupiers will receive only one thing from Ukrainians – resistance. Fierce resistance.\"\n\nBlack and brown refugees are being turned away at European borders\n\nAs increasing reports indicate people of color fleeing Ukraine are facing discrimination at the border, the crisis has once again highlighted a double standard in the way nations treat refugees based on country of origin, race, religion and more, academics and refugees say.\n\nMany of the same European nations that turned away refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia in the past are now largely welcoming refugees from Ukraine.\n\n\"It's great that Europe is being welcoming toward Ukrainian refugees. That should be the response,'' said Nell Gabiam, an associate professor at Iowa State University who studies forced migration. \"But it would be even better if that response was applied across the board toward all refugees who are fleeing persecution and war.\"\n\nFilippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, commended governments and citizens for their \"extraordinary acts of humanity and kindness\" but acknowledged some refugees have faced \"a different treatment\" at the border.

And on Monday, the Department of State urged all Americans to leave Russia, which could affect some collegians studying abroad.\n\nThe developments are especially striking given that universities celebrate their openness to cultural exchange, even with controversial governments such as China or Saudi Arabia. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine is testing how far the commitment to intellectual diversity can go in the face of war.

Only 34% of the country's population is fully vaccinated, according to WHO data.\n\n– Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden banned Russia from US airspace. Here's what the area covers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the U.S. is closing off airspace to all Russian flights during his State of the Union address Tuesday, a decision with a sprawling geographic impact because of the numerous territories in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe move is a part of a global effort aimed at isolating Russia from the rest of the world. Cutting off Russian flights to the U.S. will impact airspace over the lower 48 states, Hawaii, Alaska and the American-controlled territories that expand across much of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThose territories include Palau and the Marshall Islands. And under the Compacts of Free Association, a series of treaties between the United States and those territories, the U.S. has access to and controls much of the airspace surrounding the islands.\n\n– Celina Tebor\n\nReport: China asked Russia to delay Ukraine invasion after Olympics\n\nSenior Chinese officials told Russian officials back in February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Times, citing a Western intelligence report and quoting senior Biden administration officials and a European official, said that the Chinese officials had \"some level of direct knowledge about Russia’s war plans or intentions\" before the invasion started last month.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing on Feb. 4 before the Winter Games kicked off in Beijing. According to the Times, it's not clear if conversations about the invasion took place in the meeting between Xi and Putin.\n\nAfter their meeting last month, both leaders issued a joint statement highlighting what they called “interference in the internal affairs” of other states, as Xi and Putin faced criticism from the United States over their foreign and domestic policies.\n\nThe relationship between China and Russia has grown over the past few decades, and the two nations opposed a further expansion of NATO. When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, China called for peace between the two countries and said the U.S. and its allies were worsening the conflict.\n\n– Charles Ventura, Asha C.

The evacuation zones did not include the town of Mariposa.\n\nA Red Cross evacuation center has been established at an elementary school in Mariposa, Cal Fire said.\n\nThe blaze comes as much of the US has been experiencing an extreme heat wave this week, with parts of California seeing temperatures in the triple-digits.\n\nWildfires scorching the western US in recent years have become more common due to worsening drought conditions fueled by climate change. In California alone, more than 2.5 million acres were burned in nearly 9,000 fires last year, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCouple left with ‘just the clothes on their back’\n\nNick Smith told CNN his parents’ home burned down as a result of the fire. His parents, Jane and Wes Smith, lived in their Mariposa home for 37 years, he said.\n\n“It’s pretty sad to see the house that I grew up in and was raised in gone,” he said. “It hits hard.”\n\nA firefighter runs to extinguish flames from the Oak Fire in Mariposa County on Friday. Noah Berger/AP\n\nSmith told CNN that his father is a Mariposa sheriff and was working on the fire when his mother, Jane, had to evacuate. She had time to load their horses and get out of the area, according to Smith.\n\n“They had just the clothes on their back and the shoes on their feet,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, the couple is staying with friends and family. Smith created a verified GoFundMe to support his parents and help them overcome their loss.\n\n“They lived in their home for over 37 years, and now have lost everything,” Smith wrote on the GoFundMe. “37 years of memories, generations of family treasures, and countless more sentimental things. Although these are materials, it is devastating to lose everything literally in the blink of an eye without notice.”\n\nThe blaze is a few dozen miles southwest of Yosemite National Park’s southern edges, though the park is closer when measured by a straight line.\n\nThe Oak Fire is the largest of California’s currently active wildfires of note, which numbered at least six Saturday morning, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe second-largest, the Washburn Fire, has burned in and near southern Yosemite National Park for more than two weeks. It had burned more than 4,850 acres and was 79% contained by Saturday morning, according to InciWeb, a US clearinghouse for fire information.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Rebekah Riess Sara Smart Andy Rose", "Jason Hanna", "Rebekah Riess", "Sara Smart", "Andy Rose"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/weather/yosemite-washburn-fire-sequoia-tuesday", "title": "Washburn Fire: Firefighters are gaining ground in fight to protect ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith giant sequoias under threat from a wildfire spreading at Yosemite National Park in California, firefighters are in a race to protect them and a nearby community as more dry hot weather bears down on the region.\n\nProgress has been made in battling the Washburn Fire, which is 22% contained and has charred at least 3,221 acres, according to an update Tuesday morning on the fire management site InciWeb.\n\nMore than 500 fire crew personnel are on scene, some of whom are using bulldozers to clear lines while others are creating backfires – a preemptive controlled burn of brush and dead wood to starve the blaze of flammable material – to protect the park and its Mariposa Grove, home to hundreds of giant sequoias.\n\nState Highway 41 is being used to stop the fire’s western advancement, with fire crews cutting away at brush to minimize any chances of the fire leaping across. Such efforts are “working very well currently,” said Matt Ahearn, Operations Section Chief with California Interagency Incident Management Team 13.\n\nThe eastern portion of the fire is causing the most concern with spot fires, which are intense but moving slowly, Ahearn said.\n\n“If you look at our progression maps, this fire is not moving quickly at all,” he said. “What it’s doing is producing extreme heat and just sitting there and billowing and just pumping smoke out of it, which is producing the large smoke columns you are seeing from many miles away.”\n\nFirefighters conduct backfiring operations near the South Entrance on July 11 in Yosemite National Park, California. National Park Service//Getty Images\n\nThe firefighting plan is going well, Ahearn said. The fire is staying on the outskirts of Mariposa Grove and is not expected to advance any further in, he said.\n\nEfforts however are complicated by an expected run of dry, hot weather that can fuel the blaze. High temperatures in the area are expected to reach into the 90s Fahrenheit with no precipitation forecast, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSprinkler system around Grizzly Giant sequoia\n\nTo get ahead of the spread of the fire, which was first spotted on July 7 near the park’s Washburn Trail and doubled in size over the weekend, aircraft are being used to cover areas with fire-retardant chemicals.\n\nAnd fire crews have installed a sprinkler system to dampen the ground around the 209-foot-tall Grizzly Giant sequoia, with water from a small pool feeding sprinklers set up near the tree’s base, footage from Yosemite Fire and Aviation Management shows.\n\n“We’re trying to give it some preventative first aid really, and make sure that when the fire – if the fire – comes over here, that this tree is protected,” said Garrett Dickman, a forest ecologist with the National Park Service at Yosemite.\n\nAlthough giant sequoias are resilient and can withstand some amount of wildfire, blazes this large can be too much, Yosemite spokesperson Scott Gediman told CNN.\n\n“Fire is important, in fact it’s critical for giant sequoias for them to have the seeds come out of the cones, to regenerate the soil, provide habitat for animals. … But it’s these high-intensity fires that are causing the damage,” he said.\n\nThe cause of the fire has yet to be determined, but park superintendent Cicely Muldoon said Monday, “There was no lightning on that day, so it’s a human-start fire and it’s under investigation.”\n\nTo the northwest, campgrounds and residents of the community of Wawona have been forced to leave due to their proximity to the fires and a mandatory evacuation order remains in effect. The southern entrance to Yosemite has been closed.\n\nStructures under threat include the Wawona Hotel, the park’s oldest hotel established in 1856. Fire management teams have also wrapped the historic Galen Clark cabin in protective foil, Gediman said.\n\nOfficials said Monday residents would be able to return when the threat of fire has been turned back as well as when the danger of dead trees falling onto roads has subsided.\n\n“One hundred percent suppression, we’re putting this one out,” Incident Commander Josh Boehm told residents. “We’re working day and night to get you and our firefighters home safely.”", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/us/five-things-december-27-trnd", "title": "5 things to know for Dec. 27: Snowstorm, Ukraine, China, Extreme ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Snowstorm\n\nDays into a deadly winter storm that disrupted travel nationwide, officials in Buffalo, New York, are plowing roads to get to stranded drivers and make way for emergency services. At least 27 people have died as a result of the storm in New York’s Erie County, many of them in Buffalo, which was buried under 43 inches of snow and slammed with severe blizzard conditions. Last week’s winter weather travel mess continues to linger into this week, with more than 3,900 flights within, into or out of the US canceled as of Monday night – a majority of them operated by Southwest Airlines, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Frustrated travelers complained about long wait times to speak with representatives and problems with lost bags. One passenger told CNN her family was on the phone for 10 hours with Southwest.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nRepeated attacks by Russia on Ukraine’s power grid have left the capital of Kyiv in the dark, a potentially deadly risk to people who use lifesaving medical devices. Russia’s persistent assault on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has, at least temporarily, left millions of civilians without electricity, heat, water and other critical services in the freezing winter months. Russian President Vladimir Putin is now calling for negotiations in his war – even as his own foreign minister gave Ukraine an ultimatum over four occupied regions, according to Russian state media. A Ukrainian presidential adviser fired back in a tweet, saying, “Putin needs to come back to reality.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia will try to make the last few days of the year “dark and difficult.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 12-year-old boy needs breathing treatments to survive.

China\n\nChina will drop Covid-19 quarantine requirements for international arrivals beginning on January 8 – a major step toward reopening its borders that have shut off the country from the rest of the world for nearly three years. Inbound travelers will only be required to show a negative Covid test result obtained within 48 hours before departure, China’s National Health Commission announced late Monday. Currently, travelers are subject to five days of hotel quarantine and three days of self-isolation at home. Restrictions on airlines over the number of international flights and passenger capacity will also be removed, according to the announcement. China has sealed its borders since March 2020 to prevent the spread of the virus, keeping itself in global isolation even as the rest of the world reopened and moved on from the pandemic.\n\nScenes in major Beijing crematorium tell a different story from official Covid death numbers (December 2022) 03:15 • Source: CNN Scenes in major Beijing crematorium tell a different story from official Covid death numbers (December 2022) 03:15\n\n4. Extreme weather\n\nWeather-related tragedies have not been limited to the US. In northern Japan and in other parts of the country, heavy snow has left at least 17 people dead and more than 90 others injured over the Christmas weekend, authorities said. Japan has seen increasingly adverse weather conditions in recent years, including a heat wave this summer. And in the Philippines, floods triggered by heavy rains killed at least eight people in the southern provinces and forced thousands of residents to evacuate, disrupting Christmas celebrations. Nearly 46,000 people sought shelter in evacuation centers, according to data from the Social Welfare Ministry.\n\n5. Immigration\n\nThere are nearly 1.6 million asylum applications pending in US immigration courts and at US Citizenship and Immigration Services – the largest number of pending cases on record, according to a recent analysis of federal data. Immigration courts have seen a massive increase in asylum cases from fiscal year 2012, when there were 100,000 pending cases. The asylum seekers are from 219 countries and speak 418 different languages, according to the group that conducted the analysis. About three out of 10 are minors and the leading countries of origin include Guatemala, Venezuela, Cuba and Brazil. Meanwhile, some state officials remain at odds with President Joe Biden’s administration over the country’s immigration policy. In the latest sign of the dispute, several busloads of migrants were dropped off outside of the residence of Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington, DC, in freezing weather on Christmas Eve.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\n2022 left some of our favorite foods in the garbage heap of history\n\nFrom the McRib to the Choco Taco, here are six foods we lost this year.\n\nLizzo broke down in tears after flutist James Galway sent her a message\n\nCelebrities, they’re just like us.\n\nA meteorite that crashed in Somalia had two new minerals in it\n\nMeet scientists’ latest discoveries, elaliite and elkinstantonite.\n\nBuccal fat removal is taking over social media\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the controversial cosmetic surgery.\n\nA cryptocurrency scam is costing Americans millions of dollars\n\nIt’s called “pig butchering,” and it has nothing to do with farm animals.\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nKathy Whitworth, the winningest golfer in history, died at age 83 while celebrating Christmas Eve with family and friends, her longtime partner said.

Ian also knocked out power for hundreds of thousands in the Carolinas Friday into early Saturday.\n\nEric Silagy, president and CEO of Florida Power & Light Company, said it could take up to a week from Sunday before power is restored in storm-damaged counties. And some customers may not be back on the grid for “weeks or months” because some buildings with structural damage will need safety inspections first.\n\nMeanwhile, river flooding may continue inland well into next week, forecasters warned.\n\nIn western Florida’s Arcadia – dozens of miles inland – river flooding still covered part of the town like a lake on Saturday, making a state highway invisible and swallowing all but the roof of a gas station, a CNN crew there saw. Near Sarasota, a possible levee break forced officers to evacuate a neighborhood early Saturday over flooding concerns.\n\nLive updates: Recovery efforts begin in Florida and the Carolinas\n\nIn hard-hit Fort Myers, where storm surge swallowed vehicles and many homes’ first levels, Rob Guarino is hosting friends in his high-rise apartment who lost everything.\n\n“A few of them are staying with me now. They just have nowhere to go,” Guarino told CNN’s Boris Sanchez Saturday morning.\n\nBy Saturday evening, Ian was a post-tropical cyclone, continuing to weaken across southern Virginia, and it could drop several more inches of rain over parts of West Virginia and western Maryland into Sunday morning, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ian smashed into southwest Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, pulverizing coastal homes and trapping residents with floodwaters, especially in the Fort Myers and Naples areas. It pushed inland into Thursday, bringing strong winds and damaging flooding to central and northeastern areas.\n\nThe hurricane then made another landfall Friday in South Carolina between Charleston and Myrtle Beach as a Category 1 storm, flooding homes and vehicles along the shoreline and eventually knocking out power for hundreds of thousands more in the Carolinas and Virginia.\n\nMore than a million customers in Florida still did not have power Saturday evening, and more than 99,000 did not have power in North Carolina, according to poweroutage.us.\n\n‘We can’t hold on anymore’\n\nIn Florida’s Fort Myers Beach, where a furious storm surge wiped out homes and left little but debris, shaken survivors are coping with what they saw and mourning those they’ve lost.\n\nKevin Behen, who rode out the storm on the second floor of a building in Fort Myers Beach, told CNN Friday night he knew of two men who died making sure their wives escaped a home which had begun to flood.\n\n“These guys pushed their wives out the windows to where a tree was,” Behen said. “They just looked at their wives and they said, ‘We can’t hold on anymore. We love you. Bye,’ and that was it.”\n\nA broken section of road and destroyed houses are seen in Matlacha, Florida, on Saturday, October 1.

Andrew West/USA Today Network In pictures: Hurricane Ian slams the Southeast Prev Next\n\nAbout 90% of the island “is pretty much gone,” Fort Myers Beach Town Councilman Dan Allers said Friday. “Unless you have a high-rise condo or a newer concrete home that is built to the same standards today, your house is pretty much gone.”\n\n“I’ve been in this community since the mid-70s, I was on the police department for 25 years, worked a lot of storms, this is by far the worst one I’ve ever seen,” Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN’s Jim Acosta Saturday evening.\n\n“As tough as this storm is, people are in good spirits and they’re determined not to be defeated,” the mayor added.\n\nSanibel and Captiva islands, meanwhile, have been cut off from the mainland after parts of a causeway were obliterated by the storm.\n\nThose living in western Florida’s Charlotte County are “facing a tragedy” without homes, electricity or water supplies, said Claudette Smith, public information officer for the sheriff’s office.\n\n“We need everything, to put it plain and simple. We need everything. We need all hands on deck,” Smith told CNN Friday. “The people who have come to our assistance have been tremendously helpful, but we do need everything.”\n\nHow to help victims of Hurricane Ian\n\nFurther south, in Naples, Brandon and Dylan Barlow were clearing out their grandfather’s flooded home Saturday morning. Dylan, who lives nearby, recalled watching the storm from his own home and realizing a canal by their grandfather was rising too quickly for comfort.\n\n“I didn’t ask him if we could pick him up; I told him we’re picking him up,” Dylan Barlow recalled Saturday. “So we took the car. We got to his house, and by the time we got him out of the house, there was already maybe 2 feet of water.\n\n“And we drove back in the water, and it was very close, but we got him out of there and we got him back to my mom’s house safely.”\n\nFlorida areas ‘unrecognizable’\n\nAt least 66 deaths suspected to be related to Ian have been reported in Florida, including about 35 in Lee County, according to the sheriff there. The toll also includes 12 in Charlotte County, eight in Collier County, five in Volusia County, three in Sarasota County, one in Polk County, one in Lake County, one in Manatee County, according to officials.\n\nFrom Florida’s coastal shores to inland cities such as Orlando, dangerous flooding has forced locals into dire circumstances. In one Orlando neighborhood where deep water has covered roads, some residents traveled by boat to assist others.\n\nLocal and state officials rescued and evacuated more than 1,070 people from flooded areas in southwest and central Florida and transported 78 people from a flooded elderly care facility, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office said in a news release Saturday.\n\nThe US Coast Guard also performed rescues, according to Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson, but post-storm conditions remained a huge challenge, he told CNN Friday.\n\n“We’re flying and we’re operating in areas that are unrecognizable. There’s no street signs. They don’t look like they used to look like. Buildings that were once benchmarks in the community are no longer there,” he said.\n\nThe Coast Guard was also preparing a waterborne operation for Sunday to help people evacuate Pine Island, the Lee County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post.\n\nAnd in western Florida Saturday, concerns over a possible levee break forced sheriff’s officers to go door-to-door in the Sarasota-area community of Hidden River to warn residents of possible flooding there, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nThe problem could pose flooding issues to roughly 70 homes on the east side of the Hidden River neighborhood, the sheriff’s office later added, and encouraged those residents to consider evacuating.\n\nSouth of Hidden River, about 150 additional people also had to be evacuated because of intruding water in the city of North Port, which already had thousands of flooded homes, Fire Chief Scott Titus said.\n\nDamage in the Carolinas\n\nIn North Carolina, four storm-related deaths were reported by Saturday afternoon, the governor’s office said, including a man who drowned when his truck went into a flooded swamp; two people who died in separate crashes; and a man who died of carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator in a closed garage, the governor’s office said.\n\nAn aerial picture taken on Friday shows the only access to the Matlacha neighborhood destroyed in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers, Florida. Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNo deaths were reported in South Carolina, the governor there said.\n\nThe storm has flooded homes and submerged vehicles along South Carolina’s shoreline. Two piers – one in Pawleys Island and another in North Myrtle Beach – partially collapsed as high winds pushed water even higher.\n\nEdgar Stephens, who manages the Cherry Grove Pier in North Myrtle Beach, was steps away when a 100-foot section of the pier crashed into the ocean. The people who own the pier are committed to rebuilding, Stephens said, but it could take months to obtain all the needed materials.\n\nFlood waters are suctioned from inside a restaurant near where Hurricane Ian made landfall in Georgetown, South Carolina, on September 30, 2022.

But the restaurant proved successful and they stayed, putting down roots in the community they now call home.\n\nBy the end of 2021, all they had left was that store.\n\nFor most of last year, the family had been adjusting to the changes the Covid-19 pandemic forced on the restaurant: navigating takeout orders instead of in-house diners, shutting down their lunch buffet and relying on federal financial aid to make ends meet.\n\nThe day Gill Dhanoa went to get her first Covid-19 vaccine – a Monday, when the restaurant is usually closed – the familiar plaza where their business is located flashed on the news. Their store sits across the street from a King Soopers, where a mass shooting was unfolding. The gunman killed 10 people – some shoppers, others employees – ranging from 20 to 65 years old.\n\nIn the days after the massacre, Gill Dhanoa’s family handed out food to the grieving crowds that cycled through the memorials.\n\nMonths later, when a vicious blaze charred thousands of acres in a matter of hours, the restaurant offered shelter to the employees who were forced to evacuate. Gill Dhanoa’s family homes – where she lived with her husband and teenage son, where her parents lived with her brother and a third, a rental home – were swallowed by the flames.\n\nGurjeet Gill Dhanoa's home, before and after the Marshall Fire. Courtesy Gurjeet Gill Dhanoa\n\n“These four walls are home right now,” she said, standing inside her restaurant.\n\nIn the ashes of her home, only a few items remained intact: a stack of buttons, a salt and pepper shaker, some coins, a horseshoe, a towel rack.\n\nThe Marshall Fire, fueled by powerful winds last Thursday, leaped into suburban neighborhoods across southern Boulder County and ravaged parts of Superior and Louisville, wiping out more than 1,000 homes.\n\nThe blaze came at the heels of a traumatic year for a place often referred to as the “Boulder Bubble,” a nod to the healthy, utopian-like lifestyle many residents take pride in and that some say is removed from surrounding realities.\n\nBut if anything, locals here say the tragedies they’ve experienced in the last year reflect growing national crises – including the global pandemic, a rise in gun violence and climate change – that no community is immune to, and which some residents say can be curbed or prevented.\n\n“I wish these things weren’t happening. I’m devastated that they do happen. And I think we have had enough experience in our country to know that there are things that we can do to prevent them from happening,” said Kellie Brownlee, 29, a graduate instructor at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nThose things include measures to prevent further gun violence, boosting vaccination numbers to help curb further surges and tuning into climate action to better address recurring natural disasters like wildfires, Brownlee said.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking when it comes into your community, but it also brings to light the fact that this will affect all of us at some point,” she said.\n\nA mourner leans on a cross while holding a flag outside a memorial at a King Soopers Grocery store on March 26, 2021 in Boulder, Colorado. Chet Strange/Getty Images\n\nSirens, again and again\n\nJust a few blocks from the University of Colorado Boulder, Jeff Gamet said it was often sirens rushing by his home that tipped him off to the tragic events that took place in the community.\n\nThe freelance writer heard authorities rush by in early March when a party on nearby University Hill escalated to what Boulder police called a “riot,” involving hundreds of people violating Covid-19 restrictions. When officers arrived and attempted to break up the crowds, they were hit with bricks and rocks, police said. At least 10 people were arrested.\n\nDays later, Gamet heard helicopters and police vehicles speed by again, this time heading to the scene of the shooting at the King Soopers store.\n\nA mental health resource center was set up following the shooting for people impacted by the rampage, including victims’ families, store employees, first responders and others across the Boulder community. The center continues to offer mental health counseling, comfort dogs, art therapy, walking groups and acupuncture.\n\nGamet visited a memorial for the victims in the days after the shooting – a brief exception to a year he largely spent in his home, dodging the coronavirus so he wouldn’t pass it on to his immunocompromised parents. Looking around at the memorial after the shooting, he said he found vivid reminders of the other crisis.\n\n“We’re all wearing masks,” Gamet said. “So we had that emotionally devastating incident and underlying it, we were still trying to deal with a pandemic.”\n\nAmid another nationwide case surge and the rapid spread of the virus, Gamet found out last month he had come in contact with a known Covid-19 case in the community. His father tested positive but has since recovered.\n\nBoulder County recently recorded a spike in new Covid-19 infections, according to county data. Roughly 83 people were hospitalized with the virus on January 7, up by more than 50% from two weeks earlier, the data shows.\n\nDays after a Christmas spent in quarantine, Gamet said he found himself preparing to evacuate, in case the Marshall Fire came close.\n\n“There’s been so much going on,” he said. “There were days where I’d be in the middle of my routine and I would just cry.”\n\nHoping for a brief respite, he attempted to order his favorite local snack: Boulder Popcorn. But the Heuston family, which ran the popular popcorn business out of their garage, lost their Louisville home in the Marshall Fire.\n\n“That’s the first home we ever bought. We raised our kids in that home,” said Chris Heuston, who said her husband started the popcorn business with their daughter. All that’s left now of their home of 27 years, she said, “is just ashes in a concrete hole.”\n\nWithout any warning from local officials, the family watched the flames approach last week and had just minutes to grab some belongings, Heuston said. By the time she ran out of her home, which was filled with smoke and soot, she could see the fire in the field behind her home.\n\n“I just wish I had 15 more minutes to grab a few more things that meant something,” she said. Safely sheltering at a friend’s house several miles away, she watched the flames swallow her home on live television, after a news crew set up cameras nearby.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Unbelievable': video shows people inside historic windstorm 01:48 • Source: CNN 'Unbelievable': video shows people inside historic windstorm 01:48\n\n‘We’re constantly in crisis mode’\n\nThe recent blaze and the rapid spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant have also stretched thin the local school system, which is combating teacher absences, navigating what a safe return to school should look like and helping staff and families who lost everything in the flames, said Randy Barber, chief communications officer for the Boulder Valley School District.\n\n“It’s been overwhelming,” Barber said. “We’re constantly in crisis mode.”\n\nThe district reopened its doors after the winter break on Wednesday, Barber said, after getting the buildings in working condition again – including by purifying the smoke-filled air inside and restoring electricity. District officials, Barber added, have prioritized having students in class throughout the pandemic as a means of family support.\n\n“It’s incredibly important for families that are going through such unthinkable things to have a place for students to be able to go that’s safe, that’s stable,” Barber added. “For there to be some level of normalcy in these families’ lives.”\n\nAt least 42 employees lost their homes in the Marshall Fire, Barber said. More than 480 families in the district have reported some kind of impact from the blaze. The district is coordinating to provide necessary resources to students who need them, including laptops, school supplies and counseling support.\n\nA home burns after a fast moving wildfire swept through the area in the Centennial Heights neighborhood of Louisville, Colorado, on December 30, 2021. Marc Piscotty/Getty Images\n\nMuch of the fire damage was in and around Louisville and the town of Superior, where some former Boulder residents found refuge after a massive flood in 2013 that wiped out hundreds of homes, said Grace Peng, a scientist who used to live in Boulder County. Those areas were also where many used to look to for more affordable options than what was offered in the city of Boulder, which is now one of the most expensive areas in the nation.\n\nBut prices in recent years shot up in those areas as well, residents say, and the loss of structures means an even larger affordable housing crisis is on the way because of the housing shortage.\n\n“There are a lot of people that have no place to live now and they can’t afford to get a place here. What are they going to do?” said Gamet, the freelance writer. “Are these people just going to move away and be gone from the community?”\n\nA day-by-day recovery\n\nAfter the series of traumatic events, what many in the community may be feeling is a “sense of groundlessness,” said Sona Dimidjian, a psychology professor and director of the Renée Crown Wellness Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\n“Like the ground has been pulled out from under them,” Dimidjian said. “I think it’s important for people to know that’s part of experiencing a traumatic event like this.”\n\nFor the Gill family, the past year in Boulder County seems to point to a dangerous reality the nation is heading to, said Mandip Gill, Gurjeet’s brother.\n\n“I think this last year, year and a half, has just been trending towards our new normal,” he said. “I don’t think any of us are equipped to handle what’s happening. And I think we’ve all learned that by the surge of (the) mental health crisis.”\n\nGrappling with what happened will be a long term process for the community, Dimidjian said, and it’s important residents and those impacted know there are mental health services and counselors in the community that can offer guidance and support.\n\nFor many here, that process has only just begun.\n\nGamet said an unwavering routine and a large support system of friends have helped him cope. Humor and positivity are helping Gill Dhanoa combat the shock since losing her home. And a GoFundMe page has been set up for her family.\n\nHeuston’s family spent the days after the blaze making family dinners, watching movies and assembling puzzles, hoping to revive a small sense of normalcy. Despite all the things lost, Heuston is thankful they’re all still here.\n\n“One of the things the pandemic taught us too is how much our health and our families and our lives mean, and it’s finding some of that beauty in our world every day,” she said. “Because if not, how do you keep going?”", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/01/08"}]}

According to Deseret News, more than 6,000 people signed a petition asking Utah State University to bar Kirk from coming onto its campus on Sept. 30 for another of his events.\n\nKirk has become a national figure as a conservative influencer and as the founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that pushes for conservative politics on high school and college campuses.\n\nIn 2024, he spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he gave a speech focusing on what Kirk says he heard from young people around the U.S.\n\nKirk's ongoing tour\n\nThe shooting happened as Kirk was set to kick off a nationwide tour of debates in colleges across the United States. Named “The American Comeback Tour,” the tour was set to make stops at Colorado State University, the University of Minnesota, among other campuses.\n\nApart from the tour, Kirk was also scheduled to debate progressive influencer Hasan Piker at Dartmouth College on September 25. On his live stream, Piker reacted to the shooting in horror and expressed fear to his followers that he could be similarly targeted.\n\nKirk grew Turning Point into a national heavyweight\n\nKirk has been a rising star within the Republican Party over the last ten years, growing his own online profile and expanding Turning Point USA into a power broker within the GOP.\n\nA speech he delivered at the 2016 Republican convention helped introduce him to a national audience.\n\nThen 22 years old, Kirk energized the Cleveland crowd with an applause line that the GOP was “the party of youth and diversity.\" He volunteered a to-the-point slogan irreverent for its time: “Big government sucks.”\n\nIn the two presidential election cycles since then, Kirk's organization has become a nationwide political player, regularly hosting swing-state events.\n\nThe group is controversial even among Republicans. Its leaders have sought to oust those they disagree with. During the 2024 election cycle, Kirk publicly criticized the leadership of former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and called on his donors to stop giving to the national party. McDaniel stepped down months later.\n\nKirk himself has pursued provocative political positions, such as a social media campaign to discredit the civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. He has encouraged traditional gender roles, praising the values of \"marriage and motherhood\" for young women.Turning Point now boasts allies at the very top of the GOP's chain of command.\"Charlie Kirk and Turning Point have been a major reason why the conservative movement is finally growing a spine,\" Donald Trump Jr. said in a written comment to The Arizona Republic in 2024. \"Turning Point's influence has grown because they pick the right fights, work their butts off, and they don't apologize for it. ...

Now what?", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump took the oath of office Monday morning, starting his second term with a triumphant and decisive comeback.\n\nThe 47th president didn't miss a beat in getting his government up and running.\n\nHe moved back into the White House residence and launched a hailstorm of executive orders to kick off his presidency.\n\nHis Cabinet is beginning to come together, with the first member, Marco Rubio, quickly and decisively confirmed by the Senate Monday evening.\n\nTrump is not the only one gearing up for a new chapter in Washington. On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are expected to meet with the new president as Republican lawmakers start working on legislation to advance his agenda. They must do that while figuring out how to navigate ultra-thin margins in both chambers.\n\nNew Cabinet begins to take shape\n\nOnce his presidency became official, Trump could formally nominate members of his Cabinet. Senators must review and approve these nominations.\n\nThe second Trump administration got a quick and resounding win scored away with Rubio’s unanimous confirmation as Secretary of State hours after the inaugural ceremony.\n\nRubio, who is expected to embody his and Trump’s peace-through-strength mentality and take a hawkish approach to foreign policy, said the incoming administration wants to see a ceasefire in Ukraine but that negotiations would be “complicated.”\n\n“Russia’s the aggressor in this conflict, but this war needs to end, and ultimately that’s the complexity of foreign policy,” Rubio told reporters Monday after the vote. “You don’t always get a choice between a great choice and a bad one. Sometimes you get two bad choices, and you’re trying to figure out which is the one that will save the most lives and preserve the most stability.”\n\nMore confirmations are expected to follow this week, putting additional personnel in place to carry out Trump’s agenda. And it looks like even some of Trump's more controversial Cabinet picks may fare okay.\n\nTrump’s nominee for Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, entered the confirmation process amid allegations of sexual assault, financial mismanagement and drinking on the job. Democrats laid into him about these concerns and other issues at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week.\n\nBut Republicans, including Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa who had previously been seen as a potential swing vote, offered mostly softball questions and high praise, signaling that Hegseth stands a decent chance at confirmation in the GOP-controlled chamber. The panel met Monday evening and voted his nomination out of committee 14-13 along party lines.\n\nWhen asked whether he was worried about Hegseth’s relative inexperience, Armed Services Committee Chair Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said he was not.\n\n“I think he’s got a lot of knowledge and, frankly, we need to shake things up in the Pentagon,” he said.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a former environmental lawyer up for secretary of Health and Human Services, and Tulsi Gabbard, nominated for director of National Intelligence, are among the nominees still expected to face scrutiny in their confirmation processes.\n\nExecutive orders flying\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders.\n\nHe started by freezing additional regulations until he has more control of the vast federal government, which he aims to fill in the coming months with political appointees. He then put a freeze on hiring for federal jobs.\n\nThen he rescinded 78 of President Joe Biden’s executive orders and withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accords, an agreement among most nations to fight climate change. He also signed orders preventing “government censorship of free speech” and the “weaponization of the government.”\n\nAfter he returned to the White House, he pardoned around 1,500 people charged with crimes related the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol; declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border; changed the constitutionally mandated right to birthright citizenship; and designated cartels as \"foreign terrorist organizations.\"\n\nLike most presidents, expect Trump to continue to sign executive orders in his first days in office, as it is the fastest way to start implementing his goals in the federal government, especially on major campaign promises.\n\nHe has held off on immediately imposing tariffs on trade partners such as China, Canada and Mexico – an often-repeated campaign pledge that he mentioned again during his inaugural address.\n\n“I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families,” Trump said during his inaugural speech. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.”\n\nCongress plots next moves\n\nAfter all the pomp and circumstance, Congress will turn to putting Trump’s agenda into law under the new GOP trifecta.\n\nThe lawmakers plan to pass legislation to restrict migration across the southern border, boost domestic energy production, extend Trump’s 2017 tax policies and implement new ones.\n\n“Republicans are hard at work on our legislative priorities,” Thune, R-S.D., told Trump during a speech at the inaugural luncheon Monday. “Among other things, we’re focused on extending tax relief for American families, lifting burdensome Biden administration regulations, building up our military and securing our border.”\n\nHowever, the House and Senate have been at odds about how to advance the bills. The members will use a process called “reconciliation” which allows them to pass laws without Democratic support in the upper chamber as long as the policy is related to revenue or spending.\n\nGiven the tiny margins in the lower chamber, House leaders want to pass the whole agenda in one big bill, while the Senate has been pushing for two bills that would allow members a quick win on border and energy bills and give them time to navigate tricky taxation questions. But leaders on both sides say they will try to pass one bill and switch to two if that fails.\n\nLawmakers also face the additional challenge of dealing with the debt limit, which is expected to be met on Tuesday. Johnson agreed to raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion and cut spending by $2.5 trillion, along with passing Trump’s agenda. That’s going to be a tricky needle to thread, as raising the debt ceiling is always politically fraught – and dozens of sitting members that Johnson will need to rely on have never voted for such an increase.\n\nJohnson has said he wants to pass the package by April. In the meantime, the majority is moving forward on legislation that meets its goals and can get Democratic support. The Senate finalized the Laken Riley Act on Monday night, which would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain noncitizens who commit certain crimes.

First lady Jill Biden and former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also delivered speeches, the latter telling Democratic delegates that \"the future is here.\"\n\nOn Monday and throughout the rest of the convention, Democrats will be focused on how a potential Harris-Walz administration would address inflation, the southern border, abortion rights and other top debates facing the nation.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the Democratic convention in Chicago.\n\nProtestors for Palestinians 'have a point,' Biden says\n\nIn one of his most forceful calls for a cease-fire in Israel and Gaza, Joe Biden acknowledged the crowds outside the convention protesting his administration’s response to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n“Those protestors out in the street, they have a point,” Biden said. “A lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides.”\n\nBiden said he and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken have been working to bring Israeli hostages home, provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians, and “finally, finally deliver a cease-fire and end this war,” the president said while pounding the podium with his fist.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nBiden says he’s not angry at the people who called on him to step down\n\nJoe Biden in his remarks made clear that he’s not angry at the Democrats who expressed concerns and urged him to step down following his dismal debate performance in June.\n\n“It's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your President.

After being told by doctors “with 100% certainty” that they would lose their baby, the pair said they had to wait days until Amanda Zurawski was “sick enough” to receive abortion care.\n\n“I’m here tonight because the fight for reproductive rights isn’t just a woman’s fight,” said Josh Zurawski. “This is about fighting for our family and, as Kamala Harris, says our future.”\n\nJoining the Zurawskis was Kaitlyn Joshua of Louisiana and Hadley Duvall of Kentucky, who each shared their own emotional stories.\n\n“I can’t imagine not having a choice,” said Duvall, who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather and became pregnant at 12 years old. “But today, that’s the reality for many women and girls across the country.”\n\n\"What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child?\" Duvall added.\n\nThe group’s appearance and joint remarks come as reproductive rights weigh heavily on the first post-Roe presidential election.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nAndy Beshear says reproductive rights on the line in 2024\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who was on the shortlist to be Harris’ vice president, accused former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance of attacking reproductive rights.\n\n“Here's the thing, Trump and Vance simply don't believe in your freedom. Trump says people are absolutely thrilled that women have their basic rights eliminated. JD then says women should stay in violent marriages and the pregnancies resulting from rape are simply inconvenient…That's not inconvenient, it's just plain wrong,” he said.\n\nThe former president has backed individual states setting their own abortion restrictions, but he has often celebrated the three Supreme Court justices he appointed who were pivotal in overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nBeshear said that Harris knows “we must move beyond anger, extremism and division, that everyone has dignity and deserves respect.”\n\n“We're going to win by staying true to our values of compassion, empathy and doing right by our neighbors,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep.

Jamie Raskin, D-Md., in his speech said little about Harris, opting to use the majority of his time on stage to condemn Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nRaskin, who served on the House committee investigating the insurrection following the 2020 election, described violent details from that day, including rioters’ chants of, “Hang Mike Pence.”\n\n“Someone should have told Donald Trump that the president’s job under Article II of the Constitution is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,” Raskin told the crowd, “not that the vice president is executed.”\n\nIn an election where fears about democracy are among voter anxieties, Raskin raised alarms about a potential second Trump administration.\n\n“Make no mistake, a man who uses fraud, theft and violence to take power will commit any crime to keep it,” Raskin said.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nClyburn praises Biden for backing Harris\n\nRep.

Wow, there's a lot of energy in this room, just like there is across the country,” she said. “Something is happening in America. You can feel it - something we've worked for and dreamed of for a long time.”\n\nClinton, who unsuccessfully ran for president against Trump in 2016, said that the party is writing a “new chapter in America’s story.” Harris could be the country's first female president.\n\n“My friends, the future is here,” she said. “I wish my mother and Kamala's mother could see us. They would say, keep going.”\n\nShe also knocked Trump, saying that it is no surprise the former president “is lying about Kamala's record. He's mocking her name and her laugh sounds familiar, but we have him on the run now.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nOcasio-Cortez references cease-fire in convention address\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., praised Harris on stage, citing a variety of the vice president’s priorities – including “working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a member of the House’s progressive “Squad,” has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war has raged on. Some members of that progressive wing have faced pressure from constituents for taking similar positions, including Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri and Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, who each lost in primary elections this year.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWashington Democrats celebrate 'Cowboy Kamala'\n\nWashington Democrats stood out in the convention crowd for their illuminated cowboy hats, “Cowboy Kamala” sashes and friendship bracelets.\n\n“It’s wonderful to be unified and looking good,” said Karyn Kenyatta Russell, a delegate and daughter of Boston Celtics legend Bill Russell. “Beyoncé goes across generations.”\n\nWashington Democrats might wear the cowboy hats again Thursday especially if Beyoncé makes a surprise appearance.

And as you guys know, a lot of good stuff has happened in this building, especially in the nineties. You young people, google Michael Jordan and you can read all about it.”\n\nBut on a more serious note, Kerr said good leaders are those who tell the truth, possesses knowledge and expertise, and care for and love the people they are leading.\n\n“When you think about it that way, this is no contest with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” Kerr said. “I see all those qualities. They have devoted their lives to serving other people.”\n\nKerr encouraged the crowd to get out and vote for Harris and Walz in November.\n\n“And after the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry. We can tell Donald Trump night night!” he said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nUnited Auto Workers president Shawn Fain calls Trump a 'scab'\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain called former President Donald Trump a 'scab' during a speech at the Democratic National Convention, which has heavily featured union leaders in its first night of speeches.\n\n\"That's not just my opinion, that's a fact. All we have to do is look at the track record,\" Fain said. \"When Donald Trump was president, corporate America ran wild. Donald Trump did not bring back the auto industry.\"\n\nThe union leader said the 2024 election \"comes down to one question.\"\n\n\"Which side are you on?\" Fain said. \"On one side, we have Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the working class. On the other side, we have Trump and Vance, two lap dogs for the billionaire class who only serve themselves.\"\n\n-- Melissa Brown\n\nNew York Gov. takes swing at Trump, NY conviction\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul touted Harris’ and Walz’s ticket – an took a swing at Trump, a native of her home state.\n\n“Donald Trump was born a New Yorker but ended up a fraud, a philanderer and a felon,” Hochul said of the former president, who in May was found guilty on 34 counts by a New York jury.\n\n“He wasn’t raised with the New York values that I know,” Hochul continued, later adding, “Trust me America, if you think you’re tired of Donald Trump, talk to a New Yorker.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nDemocratic National Convention to criticize Project 2025 in nightly segment\n\nMichigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow kicked off a nightly recurring segment at the Democratic National Convention highlighting Project 2025, the conservative agenda designed by the Heritage Foundation for a possible second Trump administration.\n\n\"Whatever you think it might be, it is so much worse,\" McMorrow said after lugging an oversized copy of the policy blueprint onto the Chicago stage.\n\nMcMorrow decried the document as an \"expansion\" of presidential powers designed to turn President Donald Trump into a \"dictator.\"\n\n\"If Donald Trump gets back into the White House, he's going to fire civil service workers like intelligence officers, engineers and even federal prosecutors if he decides that they don't serve his personal agenda,\" McMorrow said. \"They're talking about replacing the entire federal government with an army of loyalists that answer only to Donald Trump.\"\n\n-- Melissa Brown\n\nLaphonza Butler praises Harris, says they share things in common\n\nCalifornia Senator Laphonza Butler said in her remarks to convention attendees that her and Harris “share a lot in common.”\n\n“We both graduated from historically Black colleges, me from Jackson State University, the Vice President from Howard University. We were both raised by mothers who worked fiercely to provide for us, and we both believe that every single one of us has the power to change the world when we choose to do it together,” she said.\n\nShe added that Harris, a former prosecutor, looked towards a “better future.”\n\n“For her, it wasn't just a professional oath, it was a battle cry, and let's be clear to her opponents, this way of seeing the world, the idea of fighting for someone other than yourself, is unthinkable,” she said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho performed at the Democratic convention?\n\nThe opening night of the Democratic convention featured multiple musical performances.

I know Kamala, and she feels the importance of this work in her bones,\" Bass said. \"When Kamala meets a young person you can feel her passion, you can feel her heart and you can feel her fearlessness. That is what defines a commitment to children: being willing to fight fiercely for every child. And trust me, Kamala has done that her entire life.\"\n\n− Melissa Brown\n\nUnion leaders take the convention stage\n\nA group of leaders from some of the nation’s largest labor unions appeared Monday to pledge their support for Harris.\n\n“We’re all in for Kamala Harris because Kamala Harris has always been all in for us,” said April Verrett, president of the Service Employees International Union and one of six union presidents to deliver joint remarks.\n\nMembers of their unions, a traditionally left-leaning voting bloc, stand to have a pivotal role in this year’s election.\n\nThe fight for blue-collar workers’ backing was highlighted last month as well during the GOP’s convention, during which Teamsters President Sean O’Brien gave remarks on stage.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nOhio Rep. Joyce Beatty slams Donald Trump running mate JD Vance\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, criticized former President Donald Trump’s running mate and fellow Ohioan JD Vance Monday night.\n\n“JD Vance likes to talk about how he’s from Ohio, but as soon as he could, he ran away to Yale and Silicon Valley, cozying up with billionaires,” she said. \"While JD Vance and Donald Trump have been sharing conspiracy theories from the darkest corners of the Internet, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have been busy expanding access to the Internet.\"\n\nBeatty, a staunch supporter of Biden's, also touted the administration's work on the CHIPS Act to bring jobs to central Ohio.\n\n− Jessie Balmert\n\nDick Durbin knocks Donald Trump’s handling of the economy\n\nIllinois Sen.

The former president posted a fake image of the renowned singer/songwriter asking people to vote for Trump, something that has not happened and almost surely never will happen; Swift endorsed Joe Biden four years ago and criticized Trump for promoting division.\n\nAn altered photo of Swift in an Uncle Sam top hat - falsely labeled \"Taylor Wants You To Vote For Donald Trump\" - was part of a Trump Truth Social post on Sunday that also included pictures of supposed \"Swifties For Trump.\"\n\n\"I accept,\" Trump said in the post.\n\nNo comment from Trump, Swift, or their publicists on promoting fake images.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nBarack Obama: 'It's good to be home'\n\nOne of the most anticipated nights of the 2024 Democratic convention will be Tuesday when former President Barack Obama returns to the stage where two decades ago a barely 40-something Senate candidate launched himself into America's history books.\n\n\"It's good to be home in Chicago,\" Obama said in a post Monday evening on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nAt the kickoff of the convention, the 44th president said he looks forward to joining party faithful to \"share what's at stake in this election, and why VP Harris and running mate, Gov.

Biden returns to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware on Sunday\n\nDemocrats are expected to pay tribute to the five-decade political career of Biden on Monday night. Yet Harris has a delicate line to walk to honor the man who named her vice president yet distancing herself from Biden’s unpopular handling of inflation and the economy.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nNo, it's not clear Taylor Swift and Beyoncé will make a convention appearance\n\nYou might have heard a rumor that two mega-stars – Taylor Swift and Beyoncé – are making appearances at the Democratic convention.

Biden dropped out of the presidential race last month after several Democratic lawmakers, donors and others in the party expressed concerns about the president since his dismal debate performance in June.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s claims Monday at the Democratic National Convention, Biden jabbed Trump's \"stability\" to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocratic convention (James Taylor's version)\n\nKicking off the first night of the Democratic convention is award-winning singer-songwriter James Taylor.\n\nHis performance comes before the night’s keynote speaker, President Joe Biden. Taylor and Biden have appeared together in the past, including at a fundraising event in December, when Biden was still running for reelection.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump sticks to the script – mostly – in attacking Harris\n\nTrump on Monday pretty much stuck to the issues when it came to critiquing Harris' economic policies, alleging they would lead to more inflation, higher taxes, less domestic energy production, and an over-regulated economy.\n\n\"Kamala puts America last - I put America first,\" Trump said during remarks at Precision Custom Components in York, Pennsylvania, the start of a week-long series of events counter-programming the Democratic convention.\n\nTrump still found time to refer to his opponent as \"Comrade Kamala,\" despite admonitions from fellow Republicans that he stick to the issues and avoid personal attacks. The former president also drifted off-topic to attack another prominent Democrat, President Joe Biden. He spoke at length about a House Republican impeachment report, though it seems unlikely the GOP will pursue a case against Biden now that he is out of the presidential race.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHarris calls for raising corporate tax rate to 28%\n\nKamala Harris would propose raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% if she’s elected president in November, her campaign said on Monday.\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson James Singer said the tax increase would be aimed at putting money “back in the pockets of working people and ensure billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share.\"\n\nThe proposal follows a broader economic plan Harris laid out last week seeking to ban price gouging on food and groceries, lower prescription drug costs and aid first-time homebuyers, among other measures. Harris was asked by a reporter on Sunday about how she planned to pay for the tax credits and suggested at the time that they would pay for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\n\n– Karissa Waddick and Francesca Chambers\n\nAbortions at the DNC?

Addison\n\nJohn Fetterman is skipping the DNC. Here’s why\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., told The Free Press that he is skipping the Democratic National Convention, dismissing speculation that it has to do with his pro-Israel stance.\n\n“I’ve got three young kids, and they’re out of school,” he said. “That’s four days I can spend with my children.”\n\nFetterman has become one of his party’s most outspoken supporters of Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year. He’s on an island apart from his Democratic peers, who have struck a balance between supporting Israel’s interest in self defense and condemning the attacks on the Gaza Strip.\n\nFetterman told the Press that his decision to skip the convention was “made well before” the June 27 presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.

Sanders’ is expected to focus his message on the economy and removing money from politics.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance doesn't want to talk about the polls (especially this week)\n\nDonald Trump usually loves to talk about polls — at least the ones with good numbers for him — but running mate JD Vance is more reticent on the subject.\n\nEspecially now that Kamala Harris is moving up in a number of surveys.\n\nDuring a campaign event Monday in Philadelphia, Vance demurred when asked about polls that show a statistical tie in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, a month after surveys had given Trump leads of around 4.5 percentage points over President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Our job is to win the trust of the American voters, not public opinion polls,\" Vance said.\n\nMany Trump officials believe Harris will get a bounce in the polls during her convention this week; they are doing what they can to minimize it.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nProtest groups hit Chicago streets for Democratic National Convention demonstration\n\nA day of demonstrations and marches is underway as delegates to the Democratic National Convention formally begin meeting Monday, with organizers of one group saying they hoped to stage one of the largest anti-Gaza war marches seen nationally.\n\nHundreds of people began gathered at Union Park early Monday, a half mile from the convention hall, before planning to march several miles along nearby streets. They had not yet begun marching as of 11 a.m. Central Time. Demonstrators playing music and periodically chanted \"free, free Palestine\" as they assembled.\n\nBy noon local time, the crowd had swelled to about 1,000 people.\n\nRead more on the Monday demonstrations.\n\n— Trevor Hughes, Michael Loria and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nTim Walz surprises Democrats on first day of Democratic National Convention\n\nA convention hall burst into gasps and cheers as vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz took the stage in a surprise visit to the Democratic National Committee’s Hispanic Caucus meeting Monday morning.\n\nIt was one of a series of unannounced appearances Walz made in an effort to rally attendees as the convention kicked off its first day of activities. He also stopped by a meeting of the Black Caucus and the Wisconsin and Pennsylvania delegation breakfasts meeting Monday.\n\nWalz touted the positive energy and joy he’s feeling out on the campaign trail since he joined Harris on the party's presidential ticket and he pushed those in attendance to keep working to get Democrats elected this fall.\n\n“This is challenging work. This is hard. There's a lot at stake,” he told the Hispanic Caucus as attendees swarmed closer to the stage to take pictures and video. “But that's no different than a lot of people live their lives. It can be challenging and hard, but you can do it with a sense of optimism and, what (Harris) is doing, with a sense of joy, with a sense of joy. To smile.”\n\n“(Republicans) are on her because she laughs,” Walz scoffed. “My God, I'll take someone who laughs any damn day of the week.”\n\n— Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\n1968 Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago\n\nIn the lead up to this year's Democratic convention — particularly before President Joe Biden exited the race — 2024 felt a lot like 1968.\n\nAnti-war protests. A divided Democratic Party. An unpopular candidate.\n\nFlashbacks of bloody clashes between police and anti-Vietnam War demonstrators outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago during that chaotic summer weighed heavily on the minds of Democrats earlier this year.\n\nRead more on similarities and differences between 2024 and 1968.\n\n— Michael Collins, David Jackson and Michael Loria\n\nShapiro says his Jewish faith didn’t factor into VP discussions\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro refuted former President Donald Trump’s claims that he was not chosen as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee because of his Jewish faith.\n\n“Antisemitism played absolutely no role in my dialogue with the vice president,” Shapiro told the media after delivering remarks to the Pennsylvania Delegation at the Democratic convention Monday morning.\n\n“He’s trying to use me and he’s trying to use other Jews to divide Americans further,” Shapiro said. “He is the least credible person when it comes to standing up against hatred and bigotry.”\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nMemories of talk show politics: Phil Donahue dies at 88\n\nFollowers of this week's Democratic convention may want to pause and reflect on the death of a fairly influential political figure: Television talk show host Phil Donahue.\n\nIn the spring of 1992, as then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton marched toward the Democratic presidential nomination, he included afternoon television talk shows in his media strategy, including a contentious interview with Donahue.\n\nThe high-rated afternoon host peppered Clinton with questions about \"character issues,\" drawing boos from his crowd and admonitions from the candidate.\n\nClinton — who is scheduled to address this week's convention in Chicago — made a complaint that current politicians still echo: “There are real problems in this country, and there are people who’d like to hear them discussed. I’ve done my best to do it, and it’s very difficult.”\n\nDonahue, who always defended his questioning of public officials, died Sunday at age 88.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nWalz wades into swing state rivalry: Wawa or Sheetz?\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz found himself smack dab in the middle of one Pennsylvania’s mostly hotly contested debates on Monday morning: Wawa or Sheetz.\n\nWhile telling the Pennsylvania delegation at the Democratic convention about his trip through the swing state on Sunday, Walz lauded the popular convenience store and gas station Sheetz. Some in the crowd responded by chanting the name of the rival chain, Wawa. He received some boos from the Wawa contingent in the delegation.\n\n“Here’s my thing – Kwik Trip. In the Midwest it’s Kwik Trip,” Walz answered to laughs.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWhy Jon Tester, Sherrod Brown and Jacky Rosen are skipping the Democratic convention\n\nMontana Sen. Jon Tester is headed to a party this week. It's just going to be Pearl Jam's instead of Vice President Kamala Harris' in Chicago.\n\nTester joins vulnerable Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jacky Rosen of Nevada in skipping the Democratic National Convention to focus on their must-win races instead, their campaigns confirmed. At least a couple House Democrats facing similar political headwinds back home are skipping a trip to the Windy City, too.\n\nRead more on the Democrats skipping the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week.\n\n— Jessie Balmert\n\nPennsylvania campaign stop: Harris brings back Chuck Taylors as she makes 2024 campaign her own\n\nWhat's on the Democratic convention's schedule for Monday?\n\nThe convention's first night will pay tribute to the 81-year-old Democratic president, and other Democratic heavyweights, such as Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton, are also expected to speak at the convention.\n\nThe convention speaker schedule is subject to change and a full list of speakers will be released at a later time.

The Secret Service says it's ready. Local leaders say they're ready. Residents? Maybe not so much.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 delegates, politicians and party activists are expected to attend this week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, with possibly tens of thousands of demonstrators marching through the streets.\n\nFences, barricades and parked snow plows have already limited movement in key downtown areas, with helicopters buzzing overhead.\n\nRead more on how Chicago is preparing for the convention.\n\n— Trevor Hughes, Terry Collins and Michael Loria\n\nBiden has changed course over his 50-year career. None of that compares to his 2024 choice.\n\nJoe Biden wasn’t ready to go away.\n\nHe’d had his eyes on the presidency for years. Now it was his, and he wasn’t about to quit. So he raised campaign money, put together a campaign team and hit the campaign trail. He was running for another term and, he was convinced, he was going to win.\n\nA bad night on a debate stage in Atlanta changed everything. Now, just seven weeks later, he will address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention on Monday, not as the party’s presidential nominee but as an outgoing president passing the torch to a potential successor and a new generation.\n\nRead more on Biden's decision to withdraw from the race.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nSome Trump voters are denying Harris' progress — but others say they're worried\n\nMany supporters of former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, who attended a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on Saturday expressed skepticism about Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' rise in the polls. They projected confidence that Trump has the race under control.\n\nOthers, though, were nervous.\n\nThe MAGA movement’s mood Saturday, a month into a changed race that has seen Harris surging nationally and in key swing states, percolated the arena with a mix of emotions.\n\nRead more on the mood from Saturday's Trump rally.\n\n— Zac Anderson and David Jackson\n\nWait, Kamala Harris is already the nominee?\n\nTraditionally, delegates from all 50 states and the U.S. territories assemble at a convention and elect their chosen party's candidate for president. It's a time to trumpet achievements, criticize opponents' policies, and rally behind their leaders to build enthusiasm for Election Day.\n\nDemocrats are still going to lay out their vision for the country during the Democratic convention. But the actually nominating process looks different this year. That's because the DNC confirmed Harris/Walz during a virtual roll call on Aug. 5 due to ballot deadlines in some states, with 99% of the participating delegates supporting Harris.\n\nHarris and Walz accepted the nomination a day later, but they will formally accept at the convention. Democrats are expected to have a ceremonial vote at the convention for the ticket, but their nominations are already final.\n\n— Marina Pitofsky and C. A. Bridges\n\nHow to watch the Democratic convention\n\nThe convention will air live on its website, from the United Center in Chicago between 6:15 p.m. and 11 p.m. Eastern (5:15 p.m. to 10 p.m Central) on Monday, and 7 p.m to 11 p.m. Eastern (6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Central) the other days.\n\nThe USA TODAY Network and news outlets will livestream the convention and most will broadcast the major speeches live.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nDemocratic National Convention reveals theme for each night of Chicago event\n\nThe Democratic National Committee announced the nightly themes for this week's convention in Chicago, which will culminate with Kamala Harris accepting the party's nomination for president.\n\nThe title of the four-day convention is \"For the People, For Our Future,\" with Democrats hoping to use the festivities to introduce Harris and Tim Walz to the nation.\n\nThe convention kicks off Monday with the theme \"For the People.\" Tuesday's theme is \"A Bold Vision for America’s Future,\" and Wednesday's convention theme is \"A Fight for our Freedoms.\"\n\nThe convention will conclude Thursday night with the theme \"For our Future.\"\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden, Obama, Clintons to headline Democratic National Convention speakers\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are among the headline speakers at next week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, according to a source familiar with the plans. Former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is also slated to deliver a speech.\n\nBiden will speak Monday night during an opening evening of the convention that will pay tribute to the 81-year-old Democratic president, who last month ended his reelection campaign. Hillary Clinton will also address the convention Monday.\n\nObama is expected to speak Tuesday night, while Bill Clinton will deliver remarks Wednesday night before Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz gives his address\n\n— Joey Garrison and Rachel Barber\n\nIs Michelle Obama speaking at the Democratic convention?\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama will address the Democratic National Convention in her native city of Chicago on Tuesday, multiple sources have confirmed with USA TODAY.\n\nMichelle Obama, one of the most popular Democratic figures, joins an all-star lineup, including her husband, former President Barack Obama, who are rallying the party faithful in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is surging in polls ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nThe party's theme on Tuesday is slated to be \"A Bold Vision for America’s Future.\"\n\n— Joey Garrison and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhere is the DNC?\n\nThe convention will be in Chicago, just 90 miles south of Milwaukee, where the Republican National Convention was recently held.\n\nThe Democratic Party has held a national convention every four years since 1832 to nominate its chosen candidates, and Chicago has a storied history of hosting conventions on both sides of the political aisle dating back to 1860, with the nomination of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Sun-Times, this will be the Windy City’s 26th political convention.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nWhat happens at the DNC?\n\nUnlike the RNC, the DNC decided to confirm their nominee during a virtual roll call on Aug. 5 to satisfy ballot deadlines in several states. According to a press release, 99% of participating delegates supported Kamala Harris in the virtual roll call, and Harris and Walz accepted the nomination a day later.\n\nHowever, Harris has not yet formally accepted the nomination, which she will do at the convention in Chicago.\n\nIn the meantime, there is still plenty left to do for the Democratic delegates. The DNC offers them a chance to adopt and unify a comprehensive party platform, taking a stance on issues like reproductive rights, immigration and economic policy. They'll also have a kind-of ceremonial vote for Harris, but her position as Democratic nominee is already final\n\nThe Democratic Party will post updates on its convention website, which can be found at demconvention.com.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nDonald Trump plans counterprogramming during the DNC\n\nAs Trump prepared to speak to voters in Wilkes-Barre over the weekend, he and aides finalized plans to counter this week's proceedings at the Democratic convention − and to play defense as Harris basks in the glow of her formal nomination to the presidency.\n\nTrump aides said they believe Harris will gain in the polls in the wake of the convention that kicks off Monday – most major party nominees do − and they are working to counteract that as the election heads into the final two months.\n\nTrump, vice presidential nominee JD Vance, and other campaign officials will conduct a series of anti-Harris events in key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. The former president is expected to campaign every day of the week, Monday through Friday.\n\n— Zac Anderson and David Jackson\n\nWhen did Joe Biden drop out?\n\nJoe Biden announced on Sunday, July 21 that he would not seek reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\n— USA TODAY Network", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/08/jd-vance-visit/85572030007/", "title": "JD Vance to kick off UK visit with transatlantic tensions high", "text": "Jarrett Renshaw\n\nReuters\n\nLONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance kicks off a trip in the United Kingdom with a meeting with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday that will bring renewed scrutiny of Vance’s sharp criticism of Britain and its governing Labour Party.\n\nVance, his wife, Usha, and their three young children are expected to land in London at the start of a trip that includes staying with Lammy at Chevening, the country residence used by the foreign minister.\n\nThey will later stay in the Cotswolds, a picturesque area of English countryside and a popular retreat for wealthy and influential figures, from footballers and film stars to media and political figures.\n\nThe visit to the United Kingdom comes amid heightened transatlantic tensions, domestic political shifts in both countries and increased attention on Vance's foreign policy views as he emerges as a key figure in President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nA source familiar with the planning described the trip as a working visit that will include several official engagements, meetings and visits to cultural sites. Vance is also expected to meet with U.S. troops.\n\nVance has championed an America First foreign policy and once said last year's election victory for the centre-left Labour Party meant Britain was “maybe” the first “truly Islamist” country with a nuclear weapon. He also attacked the United Kingdom for undermining freedom of speech and placing the “basic liberties of religious Britons in the crosshairs.\"\n\nLammy once called Trump a \"far right extremist\" and a \"neo-Nazi\" but since coming to power has brushed off his remarks as “old news.\"\n\nDespite their differences, the pair has developed a warm friendship, bonding over their difficult childhoods and shared Christian faith, according to two officials familiar with the relationship.\n\nLammy attended Mass at the vice president’s Washington residence during a visit in March, and the two leaders met again in Rome in May for Pope Leo XIV's inaugural Mass, the officials said.\n\nThe bilateral meeting on Friday lacks a formal agenda, officials said, but is likely to touch on the Ukraine and Gaza crises, along with trade issues.\n\nThe United Kingdom has been pushing Trump to support Ukraine in its war with Russia and to accelerate efforts to bring a humanitarian crisis in Gaza to an end. But Lammy is unlikely to press aggressively, said Bronwen Maddox, a director at the think tank Chatham House.\n\n\"It's a chance to get UK perspective in there, but they're not looking for conflict,\" Maddox said, adding that British officials are content with the trade deal they struck with Trump.\n\n\"I don't mean this is any cynical way, but the UK is glad of relationships where it can get them with the Trump administration,\" she added.\n\nVance's visit comes shortly after Trump traveled to Scotland for a private visit that included meetings with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who struck a framework trade agreement with the U.S. imposing a 15% import tariff on most European Union goods.\n\nTrump is also scheduled for a full state visit to the United Kingdom in September, making him the first elected political leader in modern times to be hosted for two state visits by a British monarch.\n\nVance's winter vacation earlier this year in Vermont was disturbed by throngs of protestors angered by the administration's anti-immigration policies and handling of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nA coalition of trade unions, pro-Palestinian demonstrators and climate activists are reportedly warning that Vance will face similar backlash in Britain in the coming days.\n\n(Reporting by Jarrett RenshawEditing by Colleen Jenkins and Lincoln Feast)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/08"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/07/24/trumps-twitter-threats-wont-get-him-kicked-off-social-network/825406002/", "title": "No, Twitter will not ban Trump, here's why | AP News"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2022/11/03/u-2-bono-book-tour/8254637001/", "title": "U2's Bono book tour kicks off in front of star-studded audience", "text": "NEW YORK – U2 lead singer Bono recalled a lifetime’s worth of stories in perhaps the performance of a lifetime Wednesday night.\n\nThe artist and activist, born Paul Hewson, kicked off his \"Stories of Surrender\" book tour in front of a sold-out crowd of just under 3,000 inside New York City’s Beacon Theatre. The 14-city trek is in support of his memoir, \"Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story.\" Bono stripped away the \"spaceships\" of U2’s stadium production for minimal furniture and three musicians – cellist Kate Ellis, harpist Gemma Doherty and producer Jacknife Lee.\n\n\"I guess you could call (the move to a smaller venue) transgressive,\" Bono, 62, teased before an audience that included former President Bill Clinton, Tom Hanks, Katie Holmes, Ed Burns and Christy Turlington. \"I’m never without my band. But I have their permission for one night.\"\n\nAfter thanking the Edge, who was also in attendance, Bono launched into \"Vertigo,\" sending the crowd into a sing-along frenzy. The singer spent nearly two hours on stage, encore included, seamlessly weaving stories from his memoir into the anthems that made him a household name. It was a tightly scripted show, yet the performance offered a level of intimacy fans of U2 may never experience at a typical concert.\n\nThe most intimate moments involved Bono’s reflections on his parents. His mother, Iris, died when he was 14, suffering an aneurysm at her father’s funeral; the singer joked that the incident is almost \"too Irish.\" His father, Brendan Robert Hewson, is a central figure in the show. Throughout the performance, Bono transports the audience to their local pub in Dublin, where \"Da\" always begins their sparse conversation with the same question: \"Anything strange or startling?\"\n\nHewson, a tenor who revered classical music, found it strange that Luciano Pavarotti sought out Bono to collaborate on music. And when Bono and the Edge brought Hewson to Italy for a performance with Pavarotti, the father was startled (and skeptical of) the idea of meeting Princess Diana. Bono gleefully recalls the moment in their trailer, as his father was snacking on a charcuterie board when he unexpectedly met the then Princess of Wales.\n\n\"800 years of oppression, forgotten about in eight seconds,\" he recalled as the crowd roared with laughter. Bono added that whenever he wonders about the usefulness of the royal family, he remembers that moment.\n\nIn between renditions of \"Pride (In the Name of Love),\" \"Desire\" and \"Beautiful Day,\" Bono called the band’s fame \"currency.\" Bono wanted to use that currency for good, launching the ONE campaign and then meeting elected officials in Washington.\n\n\"(The politicians) all said, 'We work for the people who elected us,'\" he recalled. \"We learned that we had to meet people where they were. So, we went to shopping malls.\"\n\nThat led to the creation of (RED) in 2006, partnering with brands to fight the AIDS pandemic. And Bono believes it wouldn’t have been as successful without the help of those officials.\n\n\"Tonight, of all nights, I want to thank Nancy and Paul Pelosi,” the artist said, naming the house speaker and her husband for their allyship in his charitable causes. He also thanked Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nBono wrapped with \"City of Blinding Lights\" and a message of hope: \"America is still in the process of being created,\" he said.\n\nAn audience member shouted, \"Thank you!\" as he finished the sentiment. And for practically the first time all night, Bono veered off script and responded: \"Thank you, America.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/25/council-member-crista-carlino-removed-democratic-caucus/84356554007/", "title": "Council Democrat apologizes after caucus ousts her over leadership ...", "text": "Democrat City-County Council member Crista Carlino became the fourth member of the council to call for Mayor Joe Hogsett's resignation on June 17.\n\nCarlino also called for the resignation of Council President Vop Osili and Vice President Ali Brown that evening, implying that Osili limited the scope of a probe into Hogsett's administration.\n\nCarlino's Democratic colleagues voted to oust her from the caucus on June 24 after allegedly demanding that she produce proof that Osili limited the scope of the investigation.\n\nTwo Democrats have said they're open to admitting her back into the caucus.\n\nThe Indianapolis City-County Council's Democratic caucus ousted one of its own members June 24 in the wake of fallout from an investigation into Mayor Joe Hogsett's administration's handling of sexual harassment claims.\n\nCrista Carlino, who recently called for Hogsett, Council President Vop Osili and Ali Brown to resign and implied Osili limited the scope of the investigation, was removed after a vote of a majority of her colleagues, according to two council members who told IndyStar about the meeting.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the ouster, Carlino apologized for \"any undue stress and disappointment my actions caused\" the Democratic caucus.\n\nThe move represents a major fracture in the party.

She was thought to be a strong contender to earn Republican President Donald Trump's endorsement in the race.\n\nWithout Bird in the race, Trump could look to lend his support to one of the other candidates currently vying for the GOP nomination.\n\nWhat is America250, the group hosting Donald Trump's event in Des Moines?\n\nJuly 4, 2026 marks the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, making it the nation's semiquincentennial.\n\nPlanning for America's 250th birthday party started nearly nine years ago by an act of Congress, when the 2016 U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission Act was passed.\n\nIt established a commission to plan for the observance and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the nation's founding, charged with overseeing related celebrations ranging from the local- and state-level to national and international spheres.\n\nTrump also issued an executive order Jan. 29 establishing a White House Task Force on \"Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday,\" charged with providing \"a grand celebration\" marking the July 4 anniversary.\n\nAmerica250, the nonprofit arm of the effort, is hosting Trump's appearance in Des Moines.\n\n\"On July 4, 2026, our nation will commemorate and celebrate the 250th anniversary, of the signing of the Declaration of Independence,\" the group says on its website. \"The journey toward this historic milestone is an opportunity to pause and reflect on our nation’s past, honor the contributions of all Americans, and look ahead toward the future we want to create for the next generation and beyond.\"\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Here's what to know about CPAC, and what Musk said.\n\nWhat is CPAC?\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is an annual conservative movement and gathering of political activists, pundits, elected officials and public intellectuals. This year's event began on Thursday and runs through Saturday, with President Donald Trump expected to speak on the final day.\n\nThe event, held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Maryland, across the river from the nation's capital, began in 1974 with an inaugural speech by then-California Governor Ronald Reagan. It became a launching pad for the conservative trailblazer who won the presidency in 1980.\n\nThis year's CPAC has featured a bevy of Republican heavy hitters including Steve Bannon, a popular Trump ally who once served as his chief strategist, who spoke after Musk on Thursday. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Attorney General Pam Bondi took the stage on Friday.\n\nWhy did Elon Musk wave a chainsaw?\n\nBillionaire and special government employee Elon Musk made his debut at the Conservative Political Action Conference late Thursday to speak about his efforts to cut government spending and downsize the federal workforce as the unofficial leader of DOGE.\n\nThe tech mogul and Tesla CEO appeared on stage for an interview with TV personality Rob Schmitt wearing a gold chain, black \"Make America Great Again\" hat and mirrored sunglasses.\n\nAs he appeared on stage, Musk waved a blinged-out chainsaw gifted to him by Argentina's President Javier Melei, alluding to his cost-cutting efforts, telling the crowd \"this is the chainsaw for democracy.\"\n\n\"Legalize comedy ... It seems like we should have a good time, you know,\" he added.\n\nMusk, who never removed his shades during the interview, critiqued the Biden administration, called the legacy media an echo chamber that he believed should be defunded by the federal government.\n\nMusk also agreed when Schmitt said that that he and the Trump administration have faced rhetoric for \"screwing with things that aren't supposed to be messed with.\"\n\n\"We're fighting the matrix big time here,\" Musk said. \"It's got to be done.\"\n\nLori Comstock is a New Jersey-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/08/31/8-ways-to-engage-with-annie-leibovitzs-new-exhibit-at-crystal-bridges/70712301007/", "title": "8 ways to engage with Annie Leibovitz's new exhibit at Crystal Bridges", "text": "Are you even a celebrity if you haven't been photographed by Annie Leibovitz?\n\nThe American photographer has been documenting celebrities, musicians, political figures and everyone in between since her career kicked off the 1970s.

Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nSouthwest, Air France, Lufthansa, Qantas and China Air were among those affected by the “network issue” at Amadeus.\n\n\"Amadeus technical teams took immediate action to identify the cause of the issue and restore services as quickly as possible,\" the IT firm said in a statement to CNN. \"That action is ongoing with services gradually being restored.\"\n\nMORE FLIGHT PROBLEMS: Ryanair axes 18,000 more flights, slammed for 'persistently misleading passengers'\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos (story continues below)\n\nStill, the glitch had affected some passengers among the affected carriers at airports across the world, including London Heathrow, Seoul Incheon, Frankfurt and Zurich. In the U.S., it had affected some of Southwest's airports, such as Baltimore/Washington, Washington Reagan National and Dallas Love.\n\nPassenger complaints surfaced Thursday morning on social media. One flier complained of long lines at the Air France counters in Paris.\n\n“The booking system is down waiting now for more than 100 minutes,” a passenger going by the name of Cornelia Altrichter‏ on Twitter said about her Thursday morning experience at the Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.\n\nIn the U.S., several Southwest passengers took to social media with their own tales of disruptions caused by technical problems.\n\nSouthwest acknowledged the problem to USA TODAY’s Today in the Sky blog, but said it did not expect the glitch to have a widespread effect on flights.\n\n“Beginning around 4:30 a.m. CT today, our reservations system vendor Amadeus began experiencing outages, impacting Southwest Airlines along with other airlines,” Southwest spokesman Chris Mainz said. “We have been experiencing widespread, intermittent issues with several of our applications since that time. We are not experiencing any major delays to our operation at this time.”\n\nBack in Europe, London's busy Heathrow Airport was among those where airlines faced sporadic issues.\n\n\"A small number of airlines are experiencing problems across the world & we're working closely with them to solve the issue,\" Heathrow said in a Thursday morning reply to a passenger there.\n\nBloomberg News added Amadeus \"it couldn’t comment on the extent of the disruption,\" but it appeared most airports suffered short-lived disruptions. \"Dublin airport said its systems were down for about 12 minutes, while Manchester in northern England reported a 15-minute failure. The knock-on effect on flights could have lasted much longer, based on previous outages,\" Bloomberg wrote.\n\nBut, in what hopefully was a sign of a quick recovery from the glitch, Qantas -- the Australian carrier that was among those affected -- told CNN it was already recovering from the problem.\n\n\"Amadeus -- a check in system for passengers -- went down and now has come back up. Check in was resumed quite quickly,\" Qantas spokesman Stephen Moynihan said to the news network.\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 (more) cool aviation photos\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/business/airlines-outlook-5g-truce", "title": "Major airlines say the 5G doomsday scenario is over | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAirline executives breathed a sigh of relief to their investors Thursday, saying they believe the threat to their operations from the rollout of 5G technology is now behind them.\n\nAlthough AT&T and Verizon have agreed only to temporarily delay 5G deployment at major airports, the CEOs of American and United both said there will now be a resolution of the dispute without thousands of delayed, diverted or canceled flights. They had been predicting those dire consequences earlier this week.\n\n“It’s taken a while to get to the right spot, but I feel like we’re in the right spot,” said Doug Parker, the CEO of American Airlines. “I don’t think you’re going to see any material disruption going forward because of this.”\n\n“While I wish it happened earlier, the good news is we now have everyone engaged, the FAA and DOT at the highest levels, the … aircraft manufacturers, airlines and the telecoms,” said Scott Kirby, the United CEO. “While we don’t have a final resolution quite yet, I’m confident we’ll get there.”\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission auctioned off the C-band spectrum to US wireless carriers last year — an $81 billion sale that would allow them to provide robust – and lucrative – 5G service. But the airlines soon started screaming that use of that technology near airports could interfere with aircraft radar altimeters, an instrument that tells pilots how high their plane is off the ground. Altimeters are crucial for landing airplanes in low-visibility conditions.\n\nThat could have meant widespread, continual and costly schedule disruptions – perhaps delaying tens of thousands of flights a year. It could have costs billions of dollars to the industry that has lost tens of billions in the last two years due to the pandemic.\n\nCanceled or delayed flights, no matter the cause, are costly. Just two weeks of disruptions during the recent holiday travel season caused by lack of staff due to Omicron cases and bad weather cost Delta $80 million. This had the potential to create schedule disruptions unlike anything seen in decades.\n\nAfter a couple of temporary 5G service delays, the White House and the telecoms this week reached a deal to delay the rollout of the technology near airports until there can be a consensus on how to address the potential problem.\n\nThe telecom companies sounded less than pleased with the truce.\n\n“We are frustrated by the FAA’s inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner,” AT&T spokesperson Megan Ketterer. CNN is owned by AT&T.\n\nBut the airline executives voiced confidence there can be an agreement in short order that will satisfy all parties.\n\n“The technical experts that are working on it tell us it’s really not that complicated once they all are able to share information and work on it,” Parker said Thursday. “So they seem encouraged that we’ll be able to address this in a way that allows for full deployment of 5G, including near airports. I don’t expect until we get to the point that everyone is really comfortable that you’ll see anything turned on near airports, because no one wants to go through this again.”\n\nThere are still some problems for regional airlines that fly smaller planes, including American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express. Faye Malarkey Black, president of the Regional Airline Association said her member are still waiting to see what rules will apply in cases of bad visibility for their flights.\n\n“Manufacturers for regional aircraft have submitted those same plans to the FAA,” Black told CNN. “They have not heard word back. We don’t know when they’ll hear word back.”\n\nBut, after a number of international airlines US suspended flights because of 5G concerns, most of those flights have resumed.\n\nA new problem is the last thing airlines needed\n\nThe 5G had loomed large as the latest massive problem for an industry that has been dealing one massive problem after another for nearly two years of the pandemic. American, United and Delta alone have reported combined losses of $36.5 billion, excluding special items since the start of 2020. Southwest, which had gone 47 years without posting an annual loss, is about to report its second straight annual loss next week.\n\nBut hope may be on the horizon for America’s airlines. Despite the rise of Omicron, the airlines say bookings are for this year’s spring break period and they remain hopeful for a strong summer. Most are projecting a return to profitability in 2022.\n\nLeisure domestic travel is almost back to pre-pandemic levels, even though business travel is still down from where it was before the pandemic. American said Thursday that small and medium business travel was roughly 80% of where it stood pre-pandemic, and travel by large corporate customers was still down 60%.\n\nStill, the timing of the Omicron surge actually came at the best possible time for the airlines, despite the problems it caused during the holidays, said Philip Baggaley, chief airline credit analyst for Standard & Poor’s.\n\n“It was bad it hit during the holidays because it mucked up operations,” he said. “But because it involved holiday plans that had already been made, passengers plowed ahead. The demand was there.”\n\nAnd January and February are historically the slowest time of the year for air travel, so the impact on bookings is limited, he said.\n\n“The next six weeks were a lost cause anyhow,” he noted.\n\nHowever Baggaley said there have been previous times during the pandemic that things looked like they were on the verge of a turnaround for airlines, only to have that slip through their fingers.\n\n“I think the expectation for an upturn in bookings in the spring and summer and a return to profitability is a reasonable base case,” said Baggaley. “But a lot of other things can happen.”\n\nAmong the worries for the airlines is another variant that again cuts into demand for air travel, further restrictions on international flights. They also face uncertainty about higher fuel costs, the second highest cost for airlines after wages and benefits. And they face higher labor costs as they prepare for negotiations with their unions, many of which have angry membership complaining they are at a breaking point after a most difficult two years.\n\nSo the truce in the 5G battles is a relatively rare piece of good news for an airline industry which really didn’t need any more bad news.\n\n– CNN’s Pete Muntean and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/17/uk/queen-funeral-cancellations-gbr-intl", "title": "Hospital appointments, flights and hotels canceled as Britain ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nAs Britain grinds to a national standstill ahead of Monday’s funeral for Queen Elizabeth II, it is grappling with an uncomfortable conundrum: what should, and what shouldn’t, be canceled out of respect for the monarch?\n\nSporting fixtures and cultural events have been almost entirely suspended on Monday, the day of UK’s first state funeral since Winston Churchill’s death in 1965. Museums, banks, businesses, shops and schools will also close on what is now a Bank Holiday.\n\nBut while those closures were mostly anticipated following the demise of a monarch whose reign lasted seven decades, others have caused more serious consequences – leaving some Brits mystified and angry.\n\nNon-urgent hospital appointments across the country have been pushed back due to staffing shortfalls, adding to an already unprecedented waiting list for health care in Britain. Holidaymakers have seen their accommodation plans torn up, travelers are warned that flights will be disrupted to avoid noise over London, and funerals and food banks are braced for disturbances.\n\n“It’s sad the Queen’s gone, but potentially leaving someone to get worse is not helpful,” said photographer Dan Lewsey, who told CNN his mother’s check-up after a cancer diagnosis was postponed by a hospital in Shropshire, western England. “Normal life should be able to carry on to an extent.”\n\nThe confusion reflects a country that has wrestled with how best to honor the Queen. Despite decades of planning for Elizabeth II’s passing, the government has declined to issue firm guidance on what should and should not go ahead during the period of national mourning, leaving many decisions up to providers.\n\nThat has resulted in wildly different approaches from companies and services. Brits have been asked not to cycle or go without weather updates; Some, like a supermarket’s decision to lower the noise of its checkout beeping, has been ridiculed online. But others have left people fretting over essential provisions.\n\n“The closure of essential services like food banks, scheduled hospital appointments and funeral services does not pay respect to the Queen. It’s a mark of disrespect to the British public,” said Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, a political activist and the author of “This Is Why I Resist.”\n\nAn image of the Queen is displayed on a bus stop in Edinburgh. Robert Perry/Getty Images\n\nHospitals and holidays disrupted\n\nThe suspension of some medical treatments caused widespread concern. “It’s of course very sad the Queen died, and a funeral is important, but we are asking people to give up potentially life-saving medical treatment for the aristocracy,” Marcia Allison, 39, told PA Media after learning that her 69-year-old father had seen a dentist’s appointment canceled on Monday.\n\n“It’s abhorrent to ask people like himself to lose their teeth for an unelected head of state in the 21st century. This isn’t democratic,” she told the news agency.\n\nBank holidays affect staffing across the country and have left many hospitals unable to fulfill their appointments. The Aneurin Bevan University Health Board in southeast Wales has apologized for the “unavoidable disruption,” telling patients it is “postponing all planned appointments and clinics” for Monday.\n\nIt comes at a particularly difficult time for patients. Britain’s National Health Service has been operating under severe strain; a record 6.8 million people are waiting for treatment, according to the latest figures from the British Medical Association (BMA), and there are concerns that the queue could be swelled further by Monday’s cancellations.\n\nThe BMA’s arm for representing junior doctors also expressed anger that the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG) delayed exams on Monday. “Junior Doctors spend months dedicated to revising for these exams. Delays cause a significant mental toll, as well as potentially affecting training progression,” the BMA said.\n\nAn NHS spokesperson said that “as with any Bank Holiday, NHS staff will work to ensure that urgent and emergency services, including urgent dental and GP appointments, are available — and patients will be contacted by their local trusts, if necessary, regarding their existing appointments.”\n\nBut while missed hospital appointments are typically the result of sudden staffing shortfalls, numerous companies have also taken the decision to cancel their regular services on Monday, often leaving customers in the dark.\n\nA record number of people are waiting for hospital appointments in the UK. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nCenter Parcs, a company that operates several resorts around the UK, attracted criticism around the country on Wednesday after it announced plans to close on Monday, leaving guests without accommodation.\n\nThe company has since reversed its plan to remove guests from sites for one day, but still will not allow customers to arrive and check into their accommodation on Monday, meaning some have been forced at short notice to find alternative places to stay.\n\n“It’s come out of the blue,” said David Grierson, 33, who had plans to drive the length of England this weekend and arrive at Center Parcs in Cumbria on Monday. “We now need to find some extra accommodation … we’re seeing upwards of £200 ($230) a night (and) around the Center Parcs area, the availability is very poor.\n\n“It’s a little bit disproportionate, what they’ve done,” Grierson told CNN. “I would totally understand if they made some changes on the day, but to lock people out once were already on the road has stunned us.”\n\nCenter Parcs told CNN: “We believe that this was the right to thing do and this decision was taken as a mark of respect and to allow as many of our colleagues as possible to be part of this historic moment.” A company spokesperson added that messages sent from the company’s social media account, warning guests they must “remain in their lodges” on Monday was “a mistake.”\n\n“Guests are of course allowed out of their lodges,” the spokesperson clarified.\n\n‘Coming up with it as they go’\n\nPublic places have meanwhile been dealing with the question of how, and how not, to honor the monarch. Images and tributes to the Queen are virtually impossible to avoid in British cities; bus stops, train stations, shop windows and advertising boards bear her face. During her life, the Queen became probably the most recognizable woman ever to have lived — yet she has been even more visible in death.\n\nSome tributes, however, have seemed more natural than others. Guinea Pig Awareness Week was postponed to avoid clashing with the monarch’s funeral. An image of the late Queen surrounded by cans of baked beans in a British supermarket attracted mild ridicule online. Another supermarket chain, Morrisons, confirmed to CNN it had lowered the volume of the “beeps” made when an item is scanned at checkout, out of respect to the late Elizabeth II.\n\nNumerous companies and groups have joined Center Parcs in issuing perplexing advice. British Cycling apologized after it “strongly” recommended that people do not ride their bikes during the state funeral; it has now scrubbed that advice from its websites, admitting “we got this one wrong.”\n\nThe government has advised companies that “there is no obligation on organizations to suspend business during the National Mourning period. Depending on the nature and location of their business and the tone of planned events, some businesses may wish to consider closing or postponing events, especially on the day of the State Funeral.”\n\nConfusion has also surrounded the other funerals set to take place around the country on the day the Queen is laid to rest. “If a chosen crematorium or cemetery has taken a decision to close, for whatever reason, funeral directors are working with families to find another date, or another venue, that they are happy with,” the National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) said in a statement.\n\n“The NAFD and other trade bodies in the funeral sector have guided their members that that these decisions should be led by the needs and wishes of the bereaved families,” the group said. It added that reduced transport connections on the Bank Holiday could prevent guests from reaching funerals.\n\nFlights will also be affected; Heathrow airport, one of the world’s largest transport hubs, said it will cancel some flights on Monday to reduce noise pollution over London on the day of the funeral. The airport previously disrupted flights for a two-hour period on Wednesday to “ensure silence” during a ceremonial procession of the Queen’s coffin.\n\n“Most court and tribunal hearings will not take place” on Monday, the country’s court and tribunal service said. Driving tests will not take place. And food banks have been forced to shuffle staffing in order to stay open; Wimbledon’s food bank, in southwest London, initially said it would close but later clarified it would be able to run on Monday thanks to “the overwhelming support” of last-minute volunteers.\n\nMonday’s funeral will be watched by millions of Brits. It will be the “largest single policing event” that London’s Metropolitan Police force has ever undertaken, the force’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said during a media briefing on Friday.\n\nBut it has left companies not involved with the event at a loose end, as they balance their services and staffing with the momentous nature of the Queen’s death.\n\n“It’s a moment of great national significance, whatever your opinions on the monarchy,” said Grierson, reflecting on his holiday being disrupted and the cancellations seen across the UK in general.\n\n“(But) a lot of business may not have the guidance from the government on what to do – so they’re just trying to come up with it as they go.”", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/business/delta-earnings", "title": "Delta earnings fall far short of expectations because of high fuel ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA bad quarter for Delta Air Lines passengers turned into a bad quarter for Delta investors, as the costs of service disruptions, coupled with high fuel prices and rising pay for employees, caused the company to fall well short of earnings forecasts.\n\nDelta posted adjusted earnings of $735 million in the second quarter, its biggest profit since the start of the pandemic. But analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had expected earnings of $1.1 billion for the airline.\n\nShares fell 6% in morning trading. Delta (DAL) is the first US airline to report second-quarter results, so shares of rivals United (UAL), American (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) were also lower on the Delta (DAL) report, with American (AAL) dropping 4%, United (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) down roughly 1%.\n\nDelta executives admitted they made major mistakes, including having too many flights on the schedule, which led to widespread flight cancellations. Those cancellations caused operating costs to be much greater than expected, for items such as overtime pay, and damaged the company’s reputation with customers.\n\nDelta’s non-fuel costs were up 22% when adjusted for capacity, compared to what the airline paid in the same quarter of 2019, ahead of the pandemic.\n\nOvertime and premium pay is now expected to cost the company more than $700 million throughout the year, Delta CFO Dan Janki said. He did not break out those costs for the quarter, but said most of those expenditures will come in the second and third quarter, which includes the summer travel season. That full-year figure is 50% more than Delta spent on those items in 2019.\n\n“I want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we restore the reliability that you’ve come to expect from Delta,” said CEO Ed Bastian, during a call with investors. “The operational environment for the entire industry remains uniquely challenged. I’d like to sincerely apologize to those who have been impacted by cancellations, delays and long wait times over the last two months. …Restoring operational excellence is our top priority.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday Bastian admitted that Delta had scheduled more flights than it should have in the quarter.\n\nToo many flights on the schedule\n\n“This was an industry, not just Delta, that was starved for revenue for the last two years,” he said in an interview on CNBC. “When the spring came and the huge surge came, we all stressed ourselves to do everything we could to take in and capture as much of that revenue. We pushed too hard.”\n\nBut things have been much better so far in July, Bastian said, with 99.2% completion rate in the first 11 days of the month, and only 25 canceled flights out of more than 30,000 scheduled during the last seven days.\n\nDelta and other major airlines cut staff through voluntary buyouts and early retirement offers during the pandemic and have been scrambling to add back workers. Delta raised base pay for many employees 4% in May.\n\nAlthough the airline said it expects its profit margins and non-fuel costs to improve later this year, it won’t see those upsides during the rest of this summer travel season.\n\n“In the near-term, as we prioritize restoring reliability, our full year non-fuel unit cost will remain higher than our previous plan,” said Janki.\n\nBastian said Delta has hired 18,000 employees since the start of 2021, and is now at 95% of its pre-pandemic employment level.\n\n“The chief issue we’re working through is not hiring, but a training and experience bubble,” Bastian told investors. “Coupling this with the lingering effects of Covid and we’ve seen a reduction in crew availability and higher overtime.”\n\nFuel also a problem\n\nPart of the problem for earnings was the spike in fuel costs, which represents the second largest expense for Delta and other airlines, behind only pay and benefits for staff.\n\nAverage fuel costs for Delta rose to $3.82 a gallon, up 37% from the first quarter and up 82% from the final quarter of 2021. Delta had previously told investors it expected to pay between $3.20 and $3.35 in the second quarter. It now expects to pay slightly less in the third quarter, with fuel costing between $3.45 and $3.60 a gallon.\n\nThe good news for the airline, but bad news for customers, is that unit passenger revenue — a measure of air fares — was up 17% compared to the second quarter of 2019. The company’s booking revenue in June reached a record level.\n\n“Demand is really high, so that’s what’s driving fares,” Bastian told CNBC. In fact, he added, “in the past we were talking about fights on the airplane. Now there’s a fight trying to get into the airplane because people want to go.”\n\nAsked about whether fares will stay this high, he conceded that ticket prices “are not sustainable for the long term.” But he suggested fares likely won’t begin to drop until the fall.\n\nStill, the company was limited in the revenue it could take in for the quarter: Delta flew at 18% lower capacity than it did in the second quarter of 2019. So even with the higher fares, total passenger revenue was slightly lower than three years ago.\n\nTotal revenue of $13.8 billion was $250 million more than forecast, slightly higher than the same quarter of 2019, and was boosted by record revenue from the airline’s American Express co-branded credit card. Delta is also the only airline with its own oil refinery, and it benefited from higher fuel costs in that respect: the airline sold $1.5 billion in oil to third parties, compared to only $40 million in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nDelta posted smaller profits in the third and fourth quarters of last year before posting a $784 million loss in the first quarter on the initial spike in fuel prices and a drop in travel caused by a surge in Covid cases.

The CDC currently advises against any travel to the U.K. because of the pandemic.\n\nTrump has used his presidential authority to restrict travel into the U.S., most notably from China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year. On Jan. 31, Trump issued a presidential proclamation limiting travel from China, and he repeatedly touted that as a major success in limiting infections in the U.S.\n\nTrump also banned travelers from the European Schengen Area, a group of 26 European countries that allows open travel across their borders, beginning March 13. Three days later, visitors from the U.K. and Ireland were prohibited.

But airlines’ staffing cuts were also to blame for the 20,000 US flight that have been canceled over the last two weeks.\n\nAirlines went into the busiest travel period of the past two years with significantly fewer employees than they had before the pandemic hit in early 2020.\n\nThat stretched staff too thin and left the airlines unable to adjust when a large number of employees tested positive for Covid and bad winter weather hit major airport hubs from Denver to Washington.\n\nSo it shouldn’t have come as a surprise that travel didn’t go smoothly this holiday season. In fact, it was predicted by some industry experts.\n\n“Granted, Omicron wave was a swift surprise. However, it was made worse by a failure to plan for any hiccups, be it weather or virus,” said Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines 737 pilot and spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, the union at the nation’s largest airline. “Bottom line, management sold tickets it couldn’t fulfill with any duress. It doesn’t seem they stress-tested their ops plan.”\n\nThe airlines all said they were doing their best to accommodate passengers in the face of widespread problems. Many of the flights were canceled in advance to allow the greatest possible notice to passengers. For example, nearly 300 US flights originally scheduled for Wednesday have already been canceled. And all the airlines say they are doing what they can to hire the staffing needed so that they don’t have future problems.\n\nBut these widespread challenges have become far more frequent, with airline employees complaining that they’ve been stretched to the breaking point by difficult work conditions.\n\nHow airlines cut staff\n\nAirlines agreed early in the pandemic that they would not involuntarily lay off staff in return for $54 billion in federal help. But the four major airlines responded to massive losses as demand for air travel plunged by offering voluntary buyout packages and early retirement plans for staff. That reduced the number of airline employees by thousands.\n\nThe airlines cheered when they made it through Thanksgiving week with very low cancellation rates. But the day after Thanksgiving, the world was introduced to the Omicron variant, which would wreak havoc with staffing levels by the end of the year. And it’s a problem that won’t be going away, even when the snow stops falling and holiday travelers eventually make it home.\n\n“The real storm is Omicron. That might peak at the end of January. The snowstorms are minor issues by comparison,” said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of The Points Guy, an airline travel site.\n\nKelly said no matter what preparations the airlines made, the surge in Covid cases brought on by the very contagious Omicron variant was going to cause problems.\n\n“No one could have planned for Omicron. It’s the curveball of curveballs,” he said. “I give the industry a thumbs up for trying to plan as much as they could.”\n\nBut Kelly said it’s also clear that airlines cut staffing too deeply in 2020.\n\n“We’re at a breaking point,” Kelly said. “Where we’re at today is not sustainable. They need to hire more, to have more staff to fall back on.”\n\nThe airlines all say they are hiring, but with certification rules and regulations, it takes much longer to hire new staff than it might for other employers — in some cases a year or more. And given the uncertainty about the return of passenger traffic, airlines are still not back to pre-pandemic employment levels.\n\nHeadcounts at the four major airlines that handle an overwhelming majority of US passengers — American, Delta, United and Southwest — were down between 10% and 11% as of September 30, compared to where they stood on December 31, 2019.\n\nDeliberate decision to trim staff\n\nSome of that reduced staffing was due to a deliberate decision by the airlines, which for years have been striving to offer more flights, and carry more passengers, with a reduced number of employees.\n\n“We had 20,000 people leave,” said Delta CEO Ed Bastian at an investor presentation in December. And even though the airline has so far only filled 9,000 of those vacant positions, “our staffing is exactly where I want it to be,” he said. Additional hiring will come as the company tries to expand capacity beyond where it was before the pandemic.\n\nAlthough the airlines say they are getting job applicants they need to fill jobs, they also admit to getting fewer applicants per opening than they did in the past. And even some of the staff that took unpaid leave have been slower to return than the airlines had hoped.\n\nAirline executives have admitted it was tougher to fill positions that they expected a year ago.\n\n“An assumption that I made was that we were going to call them and say, ‘OK, it’s time to come back,’ [and] they’re going to show up, everything will be just like it was,” said Southwest CEO Gary Kelly, speaking to investors in October. But he said recalling workers hasn’t been that straightforward, with many employees who had been off work deciding they didn’t want to return.\n\n“I think all that will smooth out, both with our existing employees that we’re trying to get back in and settle back and new hires as well,” he said. “But it’s not going to be here in the fourth quarter. It’s going to take a while.”\n\nAnd without as much depth in staffing, when problems arise it can take a long time to recover. That’s what happened in various service meltdowns earlier in 2020 at Southwest and American airlines. And it’s one of the reasons more than 1,200 flights were canceled on Wednesday, even though the bad weather is over.\n\n“It’s going to take a long time, up to a week, to put the pilots and planes where they need to be,” said Kerry Tan, business professor at Loyola University of Maryland and an expert on airlines.\n\nAnother knock-on effect: As major airlines hire new staff, they’re taking much-needed staff away from the lower-paid regional carriers that fly many of the feeder flights booked under the American, United and Delta brands.\n\n“These are the airlines that have the least amount of slack,” said Tan. One of the major regional carriers, Skywest, “had nearly a quarter of their scheduled flights canceled,” he said.\n\nTight staffing issues aren’t new: The airlines have for years been taking steps to try to handle more and more passengers with fewer and fewer employees.\n\nIn 2002, US passenger airlines had 520,000 employees handling 613 million passengers. That’s one employee for roughly every 1,200 passengers throughout the course of the year. By 2019, employment had fallen to 485,000, but passenger traffic was up more than 50% to a record 926 million, or more than 2,000 passengers per employee.\n\n“We estimate that we can fly at schedule 10% larger than 2019 with the same number of employees we needed in 2019,” said United CFO Gerald Laderman in an October call with investors.\n\n– CNN’s Gregory Wallace contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/tech/5g-faa-fcc", "title": "How last week's 5G deployment went so wrong | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nFrom canceled flights to dire warnings of a stalled shipping economy, this was not how the rollout of 5G networks was supposed to go.\n\nDespite having years to prepare, the United States last week had to scramble to keep the launch of new, next-generation wireless technologies from disrupting air transportation nationwide. As international airlines suspended some inbound flights, telecom carriers announced for the third time that they would postpone activation of 5G services near some airports.\n\nEfforts to continue the rollout and mitigate the concerns of aviation are ongoing, and federal aviation authorities on Tuesday said about 90% of the US commercial aircraft fleet has now been cleared to operate around 5G signals. But the eleventh-hour clash between the aviation and telecom sectors puts an early stain on what Americans were told would usher in a new era of commercial prosperity and innovation.\n\nHow could it have gone so wrong?\n\nInterviews with government and industry decision-makers, along with legal experts and public filings, reveal a divided federal bureaucracy with competing public mandates that clearly set the stage for a blowup. But they also paint the portrait of a US aviation regulator that missed a critical opportunity to present its case and potentially avoid this mess altogether.\n\nThe core concern raised by aviation officials is that 5G — the ultra-fast cellular technology meant to pave the way for more smart devices and applications — could disrupt certain aircraft altitude sensors. Those instruments, known as radar altimeters, work by bouncing radio signals off the ground within a specific range of frequencies. But due to their design, many of them are also susceptible to interference from signals originating outside of those frequencies. According to aviation officials, 5G base stations operating in neighboring wavelengths could, depending on how they’re configured, potentially scramble aircraft computer systems and controls, and make it impossible to land in low-visibility conditions. (The dispute is exclusively about 5G infrastructure and has nothing to do with the 5G components in consumer cell phones. AT&T, one of the major wireless carriers with a big stake in 5G, owns CNN’s parent company.)\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration told CNN it has been sounding the alarm about interference risks for years. The agency first raised concerns in 2015, as part of a filing to a United Nations coordinating body. Five years later, in the fall of 2020, the FAA also wrote to the Commerce Department calling for US telecom regulators to delay the rollout of 5G.\n\nFinally, last month, the FAA issued a last-ditch warning that if 5G were switched on without more modifications, the agency would ban pilots from using radar altimeters near certain airports, leading to inevitable flight disruptions. That announcement kicked off weeks of frenzied negotiations between telecom and aviation officials around the holidays, culminating in last week’s showdown.\n\n“This is one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible issues, subjects, call it what you like, I’ve seen in my aviation career,” Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates, told CNN on Jan. 19. The next day, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker acknowledged on an investor call that the breakdown “wasn’t our finest hour, I think, as a country.”\n\nDelayed signs are displayed on the flight schedule board at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on January 18. Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA slow-rolling crisis\n\nIn the debacle’s immediate aftermath, airline industry officials familiar with the late negotiations say that some of the pain could have been eased sooner had the Biden administration been able to fill key vacancies earlier at important agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe FCC declined to comment for this story but referred CNN to a statement last week by Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, who urged the FAA to complete its ongoing review of aircraft radar altimeters “with both care and speed.” Rosenworcel, who had been serving in an acting capacity for months, was confirmed as the FCC’s permanent chair by Senate lawmakers in early December.\n\nWithout earlier active government leadership to settle the dispute, the unresolved tension between two massive and powerful industries created a slow-rolling crisis that finally boiled over as the launch date for 5G arrived.\n\n“I think folks really woke up that we were barreling toward a significant issue in late November, early December,” one of the airline officials said. “I think by then, both sides, both camps, the FAA and the FCC, were so entrenched into their own corners, and there was so much bad blood that, you know, this ended up unfortunately coming to this level of brinksmanship.”\n\nOne other major stumbling block, according to a government source who was part of the 5G talks, was that telecom companies insisted that the location of transmitter towers was proprietary information, making it more difficult for the aviation industry to know the full scope of possible interference.\n\nThe government source said that when the FAA “plays the safety card, usually it’s an ace, and for whatever reason, the telcos have been trying to pretend it’s a one.”\n\n\"This is one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible issues, subjects, call it what you like, I've seen in my aviation career,\" Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates, told CNN on Jan. 19 Christian Marquardt/Getty Images\n\n“There was a lot about aviation that they did not really understand,” the government source continued. When both industries began communicating directly in December, however, “there were a lot of ‘aha’ moments on both sides of the equation.”\n\nFor example, aviation authorities were now able to look at data that the government source said the FCC does not collect from wireless carriers.\n\n“Which begs the question of, ‘How could the FCC do an adequate aviation safety assessment if they don’t even have the material?’” the government source said.\n\nA standoff between government agencies\n\nThe miscommunication over data highlights the different roles that telecom and aviation regulators play in America’s increasingly interconnected economy — and what can go awry when they talk past one another. Whereas the FAA has jurisdiction over aviation equipment and air safety, regulation of telecom equipment and harmful interference falls to the FCC.\n\nIn this case, the FCC was confident its plan would prevent 5G signals from bleeding over into radar altimeters’ territory. But that assessment did not satisfy aviation regulators, who believed that some radar altimeters might still be able to “hear” 5G signals unintentionally.\n\nThe crisis’s near-term origins are overshadowed by longer-term factors, however, that do more to explain why the FAA’s views were never fully accounted for in the first place, ultimately leading to the FAA’s urgent and drastic warnings about the widespread flight restrictions it planned to impose.\n\nDespite the FAA’s many pronouncements on 5G, the agency did not weigh in at the one venue that really counted: The FCC’s public process for planning the US 5G rollout, including any rules, restrictions or mitigations that would need to be imposed on wireless carriers.\n\nIn the United States, the FCC is the congressionally-appointed steward of the nation’s radio frequencies. Like other independent regulatory agencies, the FCC is required to consider public feedback before issuing major policy decisions, and by law, those decisions must reflect what appears in the agency record. Evidence not submitted into the record doesn’t count. This paper trail is an important government accountability tool, particularly during legal challenges when it is vital to show what an agency knew at the time of a decision.\n\nThe FCC opened a docket for input on the proposed 5G airwaves in 2018. Since then, thousands of submissions have been filed, including by airlines, pilots’ groups and others in the aviation sector. Many of them raised serious concerns about the FCC’s plan.\n\nMany of those concerns were addressed, according to telecom experts. For example, in its filings, Boeing called for erecting a buffer of empty airwaves between the 5G signals and the frequencies used by the radar altimeters. These so-called “guard bands” are a common feature of the wireless landscape and help reduce interference from competing radio signals.\n\nIn the past when it’s regulated 4G LTE, the FCC has looked to impose buffers about 5 MHz to 10 MHz wide, according to Harold Feld, a telecom expert at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. This time, on the 5G frequencies, Boeing asked for a buffer of 100 MHz. And the FCC, led by Chairman Ajit Pai, ultimately created a buffer zone that was more than twice as wide, at 220 MHz. Compared to the guard bands the FCC has previously used for cellular communications, the one protecting radar altimeters is enormous.\n\n“As you know, I don’t generally agree with Ajit Pai,” said Feld, who has clashed with Pai on issues ranging from net neutrality to big telecom mergers. “But in this case, they did everything they were required to do.”\n\nAjit Pai, the former FCC chairman, told CNN that claiming 5G signals could pierce through hundreds of megahertz of empty spectrum to interfere with aircraft sensors is \"just not a credible claim.\" Chip Somodevilla/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIf the FAA had approached the FCC to say that some aircraft radar altimeters would need to be upgraded or retrofitted due to the plan, Feld added, “the FCC could have gone, ‘Fine, we’ll set aside money for that.’ They did it when the FCC moved TV broadcasters to new frequencies. They did it here for the satellite guys.”\n\nBut the problem was two-fold: First, the FAA did not appear to write to the FCC until nearly a year after the FCC had already finalized an order authorizing the airwaves for 5G use. And second, the FAA’s complaints were never submitted to the FCC in a form the telecom regulator could act on, even if its claims were deemed credible, which Pai, in an interview, argued they were not.\n\nClaiming that 5G signals could pierce through hundreds of megahertz of empty spectrum to interfere with aircraft sensors “is like asserting that someone having a conversation in New York interferes with our ability to have a conversation in Washington,” said Pai. “It’s just not a credible claim.” (In December, a bipartisan group of former FCC chairs, including Pai, entered a letter into the record defending the FCC staff’s technical analyses and the agency’s public decision-making process more generally.)\n\nThe assessment that 5G signals posed little risk to aircraft operations was not just the view of FCC political appointees, Pai said. During a staff meeting in late 2019 or early 2020 that included a full range of career FCC economists, lawyers and technical engineers, Pai claims that radar altimeter interference ranked low on the list of priorities compared to other tasks — such as figuring out how the plan would affect satellite operators. The reason, Pai said, was because there had not been the evidence in the record to make it a higher priority, and the concerns that had been raised were already addressed by the substantial guard band.\n\n“If the FAA genuinely had a concern back in 2018, 2019 or 2020, I wish they had raised them then, if indeed they were well founded,” said Pai.\n\nThe missing letter\n\nAs it turns out, the FAA did attempt to make its views known to the FCC in 2020 — but it was too late to have an impact on the rules and regulations governing the 5G airwaves.\n\nIn December 2020, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson and Steven Bradbury, then the Transportation Department’s top lawyer, wrote a letter arguing the FCC should pause its 5G proceeding “until we fully understand the safety implications, and how those implications can be addressed.” The letter added that the FCC had failed to account for the extensive retrofitting the plan would require of aircraft radar altimeters in order for the rollout to work.\n\nBy that time, the FCC’s horse had already left the barn. The FCC had voted to approve its plan for the airwaves in February 2020, months before the FAA letter, and after having spent roughly two years soliciting public input, conducting negotiations and studying the issue.\n\nThe FAA letter was also not submitted directly to the FCC docket but to an arm of the Commerce Department charged with advising the White House on telecommunications policy and with coordinating airwaves policy across the executive branch. Customarily, this office, known as NTIA, will relay other agencies’ letters to the FCC. But that did not occur this time, and so the FAA letter never made it into the record.\n\nThe head of NTIA at the time, Adam Candeub, told CNN in an interview this week that his agency’s engineers disagreed with the letter’s conclusions, that NTIA’s main job is to advise the White House on spectrum allocation rather than represent the views of agencies, and that by the time the letter arrived at NTIA he was already on his way out the door to a new job at the Justice Department. News of Candeub’s move to DOJ broke days after the FAA letter, on Dec. 13.\n\nNTIA’s failure to transmit the FAA letter has raised some eyebrows.\n\n“To me, it’s extremely disturbing that NTIA did not submit the letter,” said Blair Levin, a Clinton-era FCC chief of staff.\n\nTravelers walk through terminal 2 at Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU) in Morrisville, North Carolina, U.S., on Thursday, Jan. 20, 2022. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn creating NTIA, Feld said, Congress explicitly required the agency to ensure that executive branch views on telecom issues are “effectively presented” to the FCC.\n\nEven though that process seemed to break down here, experts on FCC procedure widely agreed that the FAA could still have submitted its letter directly to the docket.\n\nThat is not what Transportation Department lawyers believed at the time, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former deputy assistant secretary at DOT who was involved with the letter. Agency lawyers had informed her the department was not permitted to submit the letter directly to the FCC.\n\n“I can assure you that if we were allowed to send over the letter from FAA Administrator Dickson and Deputy Secretary [Steven] Bradbury, we would have done that,” she told CNN. The FAA declined to respond to CNN’s questions as to whether it made any additional efforts to ensure the letter was added to the FCC record, and if not, why not.\n\nBoth Pai and Candeub told CNN nothing prohibits agencies from submitting feedback directly to the FCC on their own behalf. This claim appears to be accurate; a CNN review of public filings shows that agencies including the Pentagon, NASA, NOAA, USDA and others have in the past submitted their own views directly to the FCC on a range of matters. Feld, Levin and a current FCC official also affirmed to CNN that the FAA could have legally filed on its own.\n\nIn recent years, Pai said, the FCC has heard from an array of federal agencies on how decisions about 5G could affect weather forecasts, GPS signals and other important applications.\n\nAccording to Feld, both Furchtgott-Roth and Pai are right in their own ways. Under longstanding tradition and NTIA’s congressional charter, executive branch agencies trying to contact the FCC on wireless spectrum issues are expected to go through NTIA. But, Feld said, Pai is correct that there is nothing legally prohibiting agencies from contacting the FCC themselves.\n\nThe court of public opinion\n\nFiling a letter in the FCC docket much earlier, in 2018 or 2019, may have been the FAA’s best hope for changing the course of events much sooner. But it was not the only way, Levin added. The FAA — or the aviation industry — could still have attempted to challenge the FCC plan in court after it was finalized in early 2020.\n\nIt is not clear why the FAA declined to sue in the months following the 5G order, Levin said, but “they probably thought, ‘We may not be able to win in a court of law, but we can win in the court of public opinion,’ and that’s the strategy they pursued.”\n\nCalling the FCC process flawed, the government source said that aviation regulators had equal claim to regulate 5G, at least in an aviation context.\n\n“What they [FCC and NTIA] would like everybody to believe is that once they’ve ruled on it, then nobody else has a say,” the government source said. “And, you know, the FAA’s authority over aviation safety is absolute and all-inclusive.”\n\nOne factor that may have motivated the FAA to write its letter when it did was an October 2020 study by the aviation group RTCA. As the FAA wrote, RTCA’s presentation found that 5G in the FCC-approved frequencies “may create harmful interference to radar altimeters that would significantly degrade or completely interrupt their operation during critical phases of flight.”\n\nSince then, the paper has renewed the aviation sector’s concerns about 5G interference risks, even as the telecom industry has claimed that the study is out of step with other research and real-world testing and relies on unrealistic test conditions. The industry has also alleged that RTCA refused to share its test data.\n\nDespite last week’s breakdown, telecom and aviation officials appear to be back on track. The FAA continues to perform its testing of radar altimeters, including physical flight tests over 5G antennas at various altitudes, according to the government source. And it is closely analyzing how large the buffer zones around airport runways truly need to be.\n\nStill, the overall standoff points to an uncomfortable tension between two government regulators with equally important missions, and it raises questions about which deserves the benefit of the doubt when the two come into conflict. Why should the public trust the FCC, which supervises radio frequencies, over the FAA, which governs air safety, when the FAA is the one highlighting potentially life-threatening risks to air travel?\n\nThe answer, Feld said, lies in the FCC’s decades-long track record of successful evidence-based risk management of the nation’s airwaves — not just for airplanes, but also for medical devices, 911 calls, outer space and other high-stakes environments where lives are on the line.\n\n“At the end of the day, the FCC did its job,” said Feld. “The problem was that the FAA did not appreciate how the FCC did it, and that’s because the FAA does its job very differently.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/01/28"}]}

Trump to speak today", "text": "The World Economic Forum annual meeting, a yearly gathering of global elites famously held in Davos, Switzerland, is more than halfway through, with President Donald Trump set to take the virtual stage this morning for a speech.\n\nBetter known simply as \"Davos,\" the summit is a place where policy and major deals and decisions are often shaped. The not-for-profit World Economic Forum (WEF) hosts this meeting of minds across the public and private sectors to encourage global collaboration and work towards solutions for the world's major ills of the day.\n\nNow in its 55th year, eyes are on Davos and its long list of heavy hitters as they convene under the 2025 theme \"Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.\" Here's what to know.\n\nWhat is the World Economic Forum?\n\nThe World Economic Forum annual meeting, colloquially known simply as \"Davos,\" is a yearly meeting of elites including leaders in government, business and civil society. Over the course of four days, decision-makers from across the globe discuss what they see as major issues of the day and plans to tackle them. The WEF focuses on promoting collaboration between the private and public sectors to \"make the world a better place for all.\"\n\nAccording to the WEF website, business partnerships, political breakthroughs and policy can and often do come out of the summit, which was held for the first time in 1971. It is an exclusive-invite-only event at which many private conversations happen, contributing to the air of mystery surrounding the event amongst the general public.\n\nWhen and where is the World Economic Forum held?\n\nThe WEF meeting is always held in Davos, Switzerland. Located in the Swiss mountains, Davos is the highest town in Europe in terms of elevation. The organization was founded as the \"European Management Symposium\" by Professor Klaus Schwab in 1971, primarily to discuss Schwab’s \"stakeholder theory,\" or his vision that businesses should serve all stakeholders, not just shareholders.\n\nIn 1973, the Annual Meeting endorsed the Davos Manifesto, a code of ethics for business leaders that lays out Schwab's principles of stakeholder capitalism.\n\nDavos is typically hosted in January. The meeting has taken place in Davos in January for most of its existence, save for 2001 when it was held in New York City after the 9/11 attacks and 2021 through 2022 during which it was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen is Davos this year?\n\nDavos is taking place from Jan. 20-24 this year. The theme is \"Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.\"\n\nWho attends Davos?\n\nDavos is an invite-only event for world leaders and decision-makers, including politicians, academics and business people across public and private sectors. According to WEF, it also invites \"activists, artists, labour leaders, Indigenous community members and prominent youth voices.\"\n\nThe WEF lists a swath of big names planning to attend the 2025 session on its website. Some politicians include Donald Trump; Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; Ding Xuexiang, Vice-Premier of the People's Republic of China; Federal Chancellor of Germany; Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament.\n\nAntónio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations; Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organization; Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund will be in attendance from the international organization category, while over 1,600 business leaders and more than 170 leaders from civil society and the social sector will attend as well.\n\nSome of these include David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee; Sania Nishtar, CEO, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance and Luc Triangle, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation.\n\nWhat happens at Davos?\n\nToday, Davos hosts more than 300 sessions, 200 of which are livestreamed to a global audience, all of which \"aim to accelerate progress and tackle global challenges.\"\n\nIt lists some of its overarching focuses throughout the years as climate change, inclusion, diversity and economics. WEF also releases the Global Risks Reportahead of the annual meeting to identify the major topics of the year.\n\nWhen is Trump speaking at Davos?\n\nTrump will make a virtual appearance at Davos on Thursday at 11 a.m. E.T., followed by a question-and-answer session.

Part of his mission will be to persuade skeptical allies to back his decision four months ago to yank the U.S. out of a controversial deal to limit Iran's nuclear program.\n\nSenior aides say the president will also reaffirm the idea of sovereignty as a guiding principle of U.S. foreign policy – a message sure to play better with voters in battleground states ahead of the November midterm elections than with the diplomatic corps gathered in New York for the annual session.\n\n“Sovereignty is a priority,” Nikki Haley, Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said as she previewed the president’s message. “It’s going to be the will of the American people, not the will of the international community.”\n\nTrump will use other venues to push foreign leaders to take a stronger stance against the global drug trade and will implore the world to focus on the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons, the White House said. He will meet with South Korea President Moon Jae-in, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the leaders of Egypt, France, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter last year's meeting led to an insult-trading tiff with North Korea's Kim Jong Un that elevated tensions, the bombast subsided and the two leaders met in Singapore in June. Many in Trump's administration acknowledge Kim is still developing nuclear weapons, but Trump notes that the rhetoric has cooled.\n\nKim is not expected to attend this week's UN meetings.\n\nWhether Trump will be able to make progress on other U.S. priorities this year is an open question. Some White House aides backed down from a plan to make Iran the centerpiece of a Security Council meeting Trump will chair Wednesday, instead broadening that conversation to deal with weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBut Trump indicated in a tweet on Friday that Iran will be the focus of the meeting, noting he would chair a meeting “on Iran” this week.\n\nRichard Gowan, a senior fellow at the United Nations University think tank, said other world leaders have “a pretty dim view of Trump,” but they also don’t want to risk a public blow up with the United States.\n\nThose same leaders witnessed the spat over trade between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau following the G-7 meeting in June as well as the friction that played out when Trump met with allies at the NATO summit in Brussels a month later.\n\n“I don’t think anyone has really high expectations,” Gowan said. “They’re basically hoping to limit the drama.”\n\nHaley defended the administration's approach.\n\n\"I don’t expect all countries to love how we are but that’s because we’re taking our country back — and the message of our country back — and we’re not apologizing for it,\" she said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday night.\n\nThat dynamic may be particularly pronounced on Iran, where Trump will seek to convince allies that there is no way to salvage the 2015 deal without U.S. involvement. The White House has vowed to ramp up the economic pressure on countries and companies doing business with Tehran. Haley and other administration officials want the Security Council to punish Iran for alleged violations of international nuclear nonproliferation resolutions.\n\n“The message is going to be ‘Our strategy is serious and we’re committed to it,’” said the American Foreign Policy Council's Ilan Berman. “This meeting is a very important opportunity for this administration to signal that the worst pain is yet to come.”\n\nTrump made withdrawing from the Iran agreement a key element of his campaign, and this week’s meeting will represent the first United Nations session since he made good on that pledge. Leaders of the five other nations — China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and Germany — that signed onto the deal are working to save it without U.S. involvement.\n\nAlso hanging over the gathering is whether Trump will meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Trump has indicated he's open to a meeting but aides say the president is not actively seeking one.\n\n“Trouble is, they want concessions before the talks,” said Alex Vatanka, with the Middle East Institute. “I don’t see any signs in Tehran that they’re willing to entertain starting that conversation.”\n\nTrump will address the session on Tuesday and will chair the Security Council discussion on non-proliferation on Wednesday.\n\nNed Price, who served as a top National Security Council adviser to President Barack Obama, predicted there will be a set of parallel talks, outside the formal sessions, aimed at softening or blocking the Trump administration’s foreign policy agenda, from its funding cuts to the U.N.'s Palestinian refugee aid program to its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.\n\n“The story of this General Assembly will be the isolation of the United States,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2021/09/22/antisemitism-boycott-united-nations-durban-commemoration/5800956001/", "title": "'Sickening' display of hate: Why world leaders should boycott UN's ...", "text": "Lee Michael Katz\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIt wasn’t a world-changing scoop, but as I pressed the send button in 1991, I knew the story could change the future of the world’s deliberative body.

U.S. tensions with Russia, China and Iran.\n\nAnd Bibi finally got his meeting with President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden and other world leaders had an agenda chock-full of issues involving social and diplomatic concerns when they gathered this week for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nBiden, who spent three days in New York for the gathering, sat down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday on the sidelines of the summit. It was a meeting Netanyahu had wanted, but not exactly what he had in mind.\n\nNetanyahu had been pushing to meet with Biden at the White House since his return to power last December. But Biden, upset over Netanyahu’s plan to overhaul Israel’s judicial system and concerned about his commitment to democratic checks and balances, was reluctant to give him a high-profile Oval Office meeting.\n\nSo they met at a Manhattan hotel instead.\n\n“We're going to discuss some of the hard issues,” Biden said.\n\nBiden, who has known Netanyahu for years, stressed that even with their differences, the U.S. commitment to Israel is “ironclad.”\n\n“Without Israel,” he said, “there's not a Jew in the world who is secure. Israel is essential.”\n\nNetanyahu said one thing will never change: Israel’s commitment to democracy.\n\n“We will continue to uphold the values that both our proud democracies cherish,” he said.\n\nThe meeting ended but not before Biden invited Netanyahu to visit Washington by year's end.\n\nHere are three other takeaways from the U.N. summit:\n\nWorlds apart: NYC migrant crisis is one of several shadows looming over Biden at United Nations\n\nBiden, Zelenskyy warn of 'aggression'\n\nBiden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy both addressed the members of the general assembly on Tuesday and warned of the consequences of pulling back on support from Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nIn his annual address to the body, Biden cast solidarity with Ukraine as a necessary step to deter other would-be aggressors. Russia believes the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalize Ukraine without consequence, he said. If U.N. member nations abandon their core principles and appease an antagonist, no one will be safe, Biden said.\n\n“If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?” Biden asked. “I respectfully suggest the answer is no.”\n\nBiden’s stark message seemed to be directed at Washington as much as those world leaders in the audience. As American support for the war in Ukraine has softened, some congressional Republicans are resisting his request for $24 billion in military and humanitarian aid for the war-torn country.\n\nA few hours after Biden spoke, Zelenskyy echoed his remarks, warning in his address to the body that Russia’s aggression won’t stop with Ukraine and that its invasion of his country is pushing the world toward a “final war.”\n\n\"Many seats in the General Assembly hall may become empty – empty if Russia succeeds with its treachery and aggression,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nWho wasn’t there for either speech? Russian President Vladimir Putin, who skipped the U.N. gathering.\n\nIran leader slams US, other 'old powers'\n\nEbrahim Raisi, Iran’s hardline president, attacked the United States for pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in 2018 and accused America of imposing sanctions as a political tool.\n\nHis remarks came the same day five Americans who had been imprisoned in Iran returned home as part of a prisoner exchange the Biden administration negotiated with Tehran.\n\nRaisi told journalists the exchange could help build trust between the nations. But he didn’t hold back in his address to the General Assembly.\n\nRaisi said through an interpreter that U.S. sanctions on Iran haven’t worked and “old powers will keep their current downward trajectory.”\n\n“They represent the past,” he said, “and we are the future.”\n\nAs Raisi spoke to the General Assembly, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, walked around the room holding up a banner with a photo of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian woman who died last year while in police custody after allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. Erdan later walked out of the assembly hall with other Israeli diplomats.\n\nAmericans are freed from Iran: So, why is the prisoner swap controversial for Biden?\n\nBiden on Bette Midler, Trump and 2024\n\nIn between his meetings with world leaders, Biden also carved out some time for fundraisers for his reelection campaign.\n\nNew York’s Times Square, a hectic zoo of humanity even without a presidential invasion, grew even more chaotic and congested as Biden’s motorcade zipped across West 46th Street to Broadway’s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Monday night for one of the campaign events.\n\n“Broadway for Biden,” announced a red, white and blue marquee outside the theater. Inside, Biden took the stage as an orchestra played “All That Jazz.”\n\nIn his brief remarks, Biden spoke to the crowd of actors, theatrical producers and others about Bette Midler, Donald Trump and what’s at stake in next year’s election.\n\nYears ago, Biden said, when his sons Beau and Hunter were younger, he took them to a Midler show on Broadway. The bawdy performer spotted the boys in the crowd and asked who on earth would take kids to a show like this, Biden recalled.\n\nOn Trump, Biden said the former president, who is also the GOP front-runner for 2024, and MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy democracy. “I’m running because democracy is at stake because democracy is on the ballot once again,” he said.\n\nIf voters send him back to the White House, Biden said, \"we will have saved democracy.\"\n\nMichael Collins and Maureen Groppe cover the White House.

General Assembly decided in September last year that such a conference would be held in 2025. Hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, the conference was postponed in June after Israel attacked Iran.\n\nThe conference aims to lay out the parameters for a roadmap to a Palestinian state, while ensuring Israel's security.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told newspaper La Tribune Dimanche in an interview published on Sunday that he will also use the conference this week to push other countries to join France in recognizing a Palestinian state.\n\nFrance intends to recognize a Palestinian state in September at the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly, President Emmanuel Macron said last week.\n\n\"We will launch an appeal in New York so that other countries join us to initiate an even more ambitious and demanding dynamic that will culminate on September 21,\" Barrot said, adding that he expected Arab countries by then to condemn Palestinian militants Hamas and call for their disarmament.\n\nThe conference comes as a 22-month war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza still rages. The war was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed nearly 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\n\nThe U.S. will not attend the conference at the United Nations, said a State Department spokesperson, describing it as \"a gift to Hamas, which continues to reject ceasefire proposals accepted by Israel that would lead to the release of hostages and bring calm in Gaza.\"\n\nThe State Department spokesperson added that Washington voted against the General Assembly last year calling for the conference and would \"not support actions that jeopardize the prospect for a long-term, peaceful resolution to the conflict.\"\n\nIsrael is also not taking part in the conference, \"which doesn't first urgently address the issue of condemning Hamas and returning all of the remaining hostages,\" said Jonathan Harounoff, international spokesperson at Israel's U.N. mission.\n\nThe U.N. has long endorsed a vision of two states living side by side within secure and recognized borders. Palestinians want a state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, all territory captured by Israel in the 1967 war with neighboring Arab states.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly in May last year overwhelmingly backed a Palestinian bid to become a full U.N. member by recognizing it as qualified to join and recommending the U.N. Security Council \"reconsider the matter favorably.\" The resolution garnered 143 votes in favor and nine against.\n\nThe General Assembly vote was a global survey of support for the Palestinian bid to become a full U.N. member - a move that would effectively recognize a Palestinian state - after the U.S. vetoed it in the U.N. Security Council several weeks earlier.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols, additional reporting by John Irish in ParisEditing by Marguerita Choy)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/world/unga-what-to-expect-intl-cmd", "title": "World leaders gather 'at time of great peril' at UN | CNN", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nIt took a Queen to shake up this year’s high-level week at the United Nations General Assembly – an annual whirlwind shindig known as UNGA that will begin on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN gang is finally getting back together in person, after three years of leaders speaking by video due to the global pandemic. But many leaders from the 193 UN member countries were in the United Kingdom for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday, forcing their missions to the UN to scramble to reschedule speeches and rendezvous.\n\nPerhaps most prominent among the changes, US President Joe Biden will speak on Wednesday morning instead of taking America’s traditional second speaking slot after Brazil on Tuesday. Biden has also built in time for chats with country leaders in London, which may limit some discussions in Manhattan.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky will be the only world leader to speak by video, occupied as he is by the war in his country. The Assembly on Friday overrode Russian objections to permit Zelensky to speak virtually.\n\nNot ‘business as usual’\n\nThe invasion of UN member country Ukraine by Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, could cast a shadow over the entire General Assembly:\n\n“The General Assembly is meeting at a time of great peril,” UN Secretary-Antonio Guterres said at a press conference last week. “Geostrategic divides are the widest they have been since at least the Cold War. They are paralyzing the global response to the dramatic challenges we face.”\n\nDon’t expect this year’s General Assembly to be “business as usual,” US Assistant Secretary for International Organization Affairs Michele Sison said on Friday. “Russia’s unprovoked, ongoing assault on Ukraine raises serious questions about its commitment to diplomacy, the UN Charter, and the territorial integrity of nations.”\n\nMany UN diplomats say that Russia has put the UN’s credibility and image at stake this year by invading another UN country, with the UN unable to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop.\n\nThe great majority of UN membership strongly opposes Russia’s war in Ukraine. Expect Western countries to use their official speeches to bash Moscow. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will speak on Saturday, but no Western country has said if they have bilateral planned with the Russian visitor.\n\nOthers fear Russia’s war has displaced other issues of global importance, like the climate crisis. “This would have been a climate UNGA but Russia has taken care of that with its invasion of Ukraine,” one diplomat told CNN.\n\n“It does occupy a lot of space,” said Stefan Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary General, during a press briefing on Monday. “Because we know that the war in Ukraine is having a global impact, on food, on grain, on the energy crisis. It’s having a knock-on impact on the fight against climate change, where – because of the energy crisis – we see member states reverting back to polluting sources of energy.”\n\n“It is however not stopping the Secretary General from raising all these other issues,” he added.\n\nBut the US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, emphasized the need to take a broad view, telling reporters on Friday that “next week will not be dominated by Ukraine, but we will not ignore Ukraine. We know that as this horrible war rages across Ukraine, we cannot ignore the rest of the world,” she added.\n\n“[There are] a lot of leaders who feel [Russia’s war in Ukraine] is a distraction from problems in their own region,” International Crisis Group’s UN director Richard Gowan also said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, there will be a ministerial Security Council session on Ukraine, with Lavrov the highest ranking member of the Russian government to attend.\n\nStill, some may wish for fewer verbal attacks on Moscow, seven months into the conflict. One diplomat told CNN that poorer countries on the sidelines feel a calmer tone could assist in finding an end to the conflict – and need Russian oil or food supplies.\n\nFood security is another major topic for the global forum, with the world economy hard-hit by the pandemic, inflation and struggling supply chains. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to chair a meeting on food during the high-level week.\n\n“What we’re hoping to do is really bring the world together to address all of the issues related to food insecurity. So it’s bringing both the south as well as countries – developing countries and donor countries together in the room to address these issues,” said US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\n\nStill, it’s another year where citizens of the world may wonder what the UN really does, given the nightmare in Ukraine and low levels of donations from member countries towards other crises.\n\n“The UN as an organization is not in position to deliver anymore because everything is upside down,” another UN diplomat said.\n\nBut at least it can put on a big show again, with many world leaders making their first appearance in several years. There will be hundreds of speeches, handshakes, parties and panels. An estimated 140 heads of state and government will attend. And chasing them will be hundreds of media members from around the world.\n\nAs another diplomat put it, everyone is a “moving target” at UNGA.", "authors": ["Richard Roth"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/20/israel-ukraine-iran-joe-biden-un/70912713007/", "title": "Israel, Ukraine, Iran: Joe Biden visits the UN", "text": "Hi OnPolitics readers!

General Assembly in New York, curbing their movement and banning access to wholesale stores and luxury goods.\n\nTommy Pigott, deputy spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said in a statement that the move aims to “maximize pressure” on Iran’s clerical establishment, accusing it of allowing authorities to enjoy luxury shopping abroad while ordinary Iranians face “poverty, failing infrastructure, and shortages of water and electricity.”\n\nWorld leaders gather in New York every September for several days of speeches at the annual United Nations General Assembly, which began its 80th session on Tuesday, Sept. 23.\n\nThe economy is the top challenge for Iran’s ruling clerics, who fear a revival of protests that have erupted since 2017 by lower and middle-income communities angry at growing poverty because of sanctions, mismanagement and state corruption.\n\nAlthough it harbors deep mistrust of the United States and President Donald Trump in particular, Tehran is increasingly concerned that mounting public anger over economic hardships could weaken the establishment.\n\nThat is why, despite the unyielding stance of Iran’s clerical leaders in public, Tehran prefers diplomacy to resolve a decades-long dispute with the West over its nuclear program.\n\nThe United States, its European allies and Israel accuse Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons. Tehran has long denied it.\n\nTensions have heightened between Tehran and Washington since June, when the United States joined Israel and attacked Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran.\n\nThere are growing concerns among Iran’s clerical rulers over what they perceive as Trump’s intention to topple the Islamic Republic.\n\nTehran’s concerns were exacerbated by Trump’s speedy revival of the “maximum pressure” campaign, from his first term as U.S. president, to drive Iran’s oil exports toward zero with more sanctions and bring the country’s already-fragile economy to its knees.\n\nPigott said that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had ordered the Iranian delegation confined to routes between their hotel and the U.N. headquarters for official business only.\n\nIran’s foreign ministry did not comment on the U.S. State Department restrictions.\n\nThe United Nations headquarters is located in Midtown Manhattan. Before the new restrictions, Iranian delegation members were allowed to travel between the United Nations, the Iranian U.N. mission, the Iranian U.N. ambassador’s residence and John F. Kennedy International Airport in the New York City borough of Queens.\n\n“The security of Americans remains our top priority,” Pigott said, adding that the U.S. will not let the Iranian regime exploit the U.N. General Assembly to advance what he called its “terrorist agenda” or enjoy privileges denied to its own people.\n\n“These measures send a clear message: the United States stands with the people of Iran in their pursuit of accountability and a better future,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/01/16/european-leaders-davos-forum/1839141/", "title": "European leaders headline 2013 forum in Davos", "text": "AP\n\nInvitation-only event features whirlwind week of talks%2C parties\n\n50 heads of state and over 1%2C000 CEOs due to attend\n\nTopics include global economic revival%3B fighting corruption%2C cyber-piracy\n\nGENEVA (AP) — Promoting measures to get the world economy out of its crisis mode will be the focal point of next week's annual gathering of world leaders and power brokers in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, organizers said Wednesday.\n\nThree leading European leaders, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Premier Mario Monti, will deliver keynote addresses on how to push forward the global economic revival, according to officials from the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe first invitation-only event was held more than 40 years ago and has turned into an annual whirlwind week of talks and parties for politicians, diplomats, thinkers, artists, celebrities and journalists.\n\nOrganizers said nearly 50 presidents and prime ministers and over 1,000 chairmen and CEOs of global companies are due to attend the event Jan. 23-27.

And when did it start?", "text": "Passover began on April 12 and will continue through the upcoming weekend.\n\nPassover is a Jewish holiday during the month of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar. It usually falls on a day in March or April.\n\nThe week-long holiday celebrates the Jewish Festival of Freedom, which commemorates the liberation of Israelites from ancient Egyptian slavery. It begins with a traditional seder meal, allowing people who practice the Jewish faith to reflect on their rich background.\n\nWhat is Passover? Here's what to know about the Jewish holiday.\n\nWhen is Passover 2025?\n\nThis year, Passover began on Saturday, April 12, and ends after nightfall on Sunday, April 20.\n\nEvery year, Passover begins on the 15th day of Nisan, the first month of the Jewish calendar. The celebrations last for seven or eight days, depending on where the holiday is celebrated. In 2024, Passover was April 22-30.\n\nWhat is Passover?\n\nPassover, also known as Pesach, is a Jewish holiday that celebrates the story of Exodus, when the Israelites were liberated from slavery in ancient Egypt by Moses.\n\nHow is Passover celebrated?\n\nOn the evening before Passover starts, Jewish people hold a special meal at home with friends and family called Seder. During Seder, the story of Exodus is read from the book \"Haggadah,\" which includes stories, prayers, poetry and other teachings. Everybody takes part in this reading.\n\nTypically, a Seder plate is made up for the special gathering and contains six parts that symbolize Exodus. These parts include:\n\nBeitzah: Hard-boiled egg symbolic of the festival sacrifice in spring and the spring season\n\nHard-boiled egg symbolic of the festival sacrifice in spring and the spring season Chazeret: Lettuce representative of the bitterness of slavery\n\nLettuce representative of the bitterness of slavery Zeroa: Shank bone symbolic of the Paschal lamb offered as the Passover sacrifice during biblical times (chicken neck and beets are typical substitutes)\n\nShank bone symbolic of the Paschal lamb offered as the Passover sacrifice during biblical times (chicken neck and beets are typical substitutes) Charoset: Mixture typically made of apple, nuts, spices and win symbolic of the mortar used by Hebrew slaves to build Egyptian structures\n\nMixture typically made of apple, nuts, spices and win symbolic of the mortar used by Hebrew slaves to build Egyptian structures Karpas: Celery or parsley dipped in salt water represents tears shed during Egyptian slavery\n\nCelery or parsley dipped in salt water represents tears shed during Egyptian slavery Maror: Bitter herbs, typically made from horseradish, symbolic of the bitterness of slavery\n\nIn addition to the Seder plate, Matzah (flattened bread) and wine are also served.\n\nWhat foods are eaten (and not eaten) during Passover?\n\nDuring Passover, most Jewish people refrain from eating foods made from fermented grains, or chametz − wheat, spelt, barley, oats, and rye. This means no rolls, bread, pasta, flour tortillas, or cookies.\n\nChametz is avoided during Passover to reflect \"the plight of the Israelites as they left Egypt,\" Aaron Kaufman, executive director of Penn State Hillel, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n\"As the story goes, the Israelites had to leave Egypt so quickly, they didn't have time to bake their breads,\" Kaufman said. \"They needed provisions for the long journey through the desert, so they had their dough, and they just threw it in their packs, and it baked on their backs in the heat of the sun into this flat cracker-like substance.\"\n\nMatzah is made from wheat, but when it is made, the wheat flour is kept dry until it is mixed with water and immediately baked. According to Reform Judaism, it takes 18 minutes for flour to ferment and rise, so matzah must be prepared and baked in fewer than 18 minutes.\n\nShould I say 'Happy Passover' or other greetings?\n\n\"Happy Passover\" is an appropriate sentiment. You can also say, \"chag sameach,\" which means happy holiday in Hebrew or \"chag kasher v'semeach,\" which means have a happy and kosher Passover.\n\nContributing: Marina Pitofsky and Julia Gomez, USA TODAY\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

It’s called yoma arichta, translated as “a long day” because the 48-hour celebration may be thought of as one extended day.\n\nWhy is Rosh Hashana celebrated?\n\nRosh Hashana is often treated as a time to reflect on the previous year and focus on hopes for the coming year, Jordan Rosenblum, the Belzer Professor of Classical Judaism and Max and Frieda Weinstein-Bascom Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison told USA TODAY.\n\nRosh Hashana is also important for some Jewish people as a celebration of the creation of humanity. It may be referred to as the \"birthday of the world,\" marking the time when God created — or when the breath of life entered — Adam and Eve.\n\nHow is Rosh Hashana celebrated?\n\nMany Jewish people will attend services at synagogues and other spaces for worship on Rosh Hashana. Jewish congregations will recite special prayers and songs to mark the new year.\n\nSome Jewish communities will blow a Shofar, a curved ram’s horn. This is also used to observe Yom Kippur to ceremonially conclude the celebration, Danielle Kranjec, associate vice president of Jewish education at Hillel International, told USA TODAY.\n\nDuring Rosh Hashana, others may also pray near a body of water in a Tashlich ceremony, in addition to tossing pieces of bread or other food into the water to symbolize sending off sins.\n\nRosh Hashana in Louisville\n\nHere are some Jewish congregations in Louisville with activities or services for Rosh Hashana 2024:\n\nWhat are some traditional Rosh Hashana foods?\n\nApples and honey represent the new year.\n\nChallah, a braided bread, could be eaten in a round loaf to represent a cycle of the year.\n\nPomegranate seeds also represent the 613 mitzvot, or commandments, that are cited in the Torah, the Jewish holy book.\n\nWhat is Yom Kippur?\n\nYom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism, is when Jews reflect on sins or wrongdoings from the previous year. Many Jews will attend services at synagogues or other congregations, reciting special prayers and singing special songs.\n\nDo people eat during Yom Kippur?\n\nNo. One of the most common Yom Kippur traditions is to fast for 25 hours, not eating or drinking from the night Yom Kippur begins into the night it ends.\n\nSome Jewish people also avoid other actions on Yom Kippur, such as bathing, applying makeup, wearing leather shoes or having sex.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/05/25/shavuot-2023-what-is-it-when-is-it-meaning-of-jewish-holiday/70247170007/", "title": "Shavuot 2023: What is it, when is it, meaning of Jewish holiday", "text": "When you think of Jewish holidays, a few may come to mind.

The other two are Passover and Sukkot. The grain harvest \"was one of the three pilgrimage festivals of ancient Israel, when Israelite males were commanded to appear before God in Jerusalem, bringing offerings of the first fruits of their harvest,\" according to MyJewishLearning.com.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

There's a debate on the origins of why this food group is associated with the holiday. Some say the tradition is derived from directions in scripture and others say it came about because dairy was plentiful during spring harvests, according to MyJewishLearning.com.\n\nOther customs include reading from the book of Ruth and adorning synagogues with fresh flowers, \"in the spirit of how Mount Sinai miraculously bloomed just before the giving of the Torah,\" Seligson says.\n\nSeligson's favorite part of the holiday is its emphasis on togetherness. \"For me, it's really gathering with community to hear the 10 commandments, because the holiday really is about unity,\" he says. \"When the Jews were gathered at Mount Sinai there was a very strong sense of unity.\"\n\nMore on Jewish holidays\n\n'The fear is real' Menorahs mean more this Hanukkah amid rising antisemitism\n\nMore on Yom Kippur: Explaining Judaism's holiest day of the year\n\nDid you miss this one?

In three sentences. Go.\n\nA: The biblical Book of Exodus tells how the Israelites were slaves in Egypt. God parted the Red Sea and the prophet Moses led them to freedom. They wandered through the desert to the Holy Land, and along the way God gave them Jewish law.\n\nQ: Explain the holiday one more time — with feeling.\n\nA: “It is the master story of the Jewish people going from degradation to redemption, and it mirrors our own personal journeys,” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, head of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest stream of Judaism in North America.\n\n“When we ask people, ‘What is the most important part of your Jewish identity?,'” Jacobs continued, “the dominant answer is, ‘Standing up for equality, pursuing justice and standing up for the rights of the marginalized.’ These are core Jewish commitments. And if you ever had a ritual that teaches those commitments, it is Passover.”\n\nQ: So how exactly do you celebrate freedom on Passover?\n\nA: By participating in a big meal called a seder, which means “order” in Hebrew — all its rituals are performed step by step. Seder guests take turns telling the story of the Exodus and the Israelites’ new relationship with God based on the law given to Moses on Mount Sinai.\n\nJewish families own haggadahs, books that recount the Exodus. Each participant in the seder gets a copy and follows along as family and friends read and explain the symbolism of the foods on the table. Some haggadahs are beautifully illustrated books with added commentary and poems. Others are simpler booklets that supermarkets in areas with significant Jewish populations give away, such as the well-known one published by Maxwell House coffee.\n\nQ: Why do Jews deny themselves bread for the eight days of Passover?\n\nA: Rushing out of Egypt, with Pharaoh’s army at their heels, the Israelites had no time to bake bread. So to this day Jews eat matzo — essentially a flat cracker — during Passover in place of food with leavening. So forget the croissants, pasta, pretzels, granola bars, etc.\n\nAnd if you’re very serious about the rules, forget anything made with soy, corn or corn syrup. At this point, some may wonder if Passover is like one big low-carb diet. Actually, you can gain weight during Passover. The seder table is often laden with heavy food — lamb, brisket or chicken. And one Passover delicacy is macaroons — 70 calories a piece.\n\nQ: Some Jews are really excited this year because of a ruling permitting the consumption of rice on Passover. Is rice exciting?\n\nA: On day seven of Passover, when you’ve been bread-, pasta- and chip-free for a week, rice might be an extremely welcome addition to your diet. But some Jews will still have nothing to do with it on Passover. So there’s a debate, and the rice-eaters are winning. As Rabbi Jeffrey Salkin put it in a column on the topic: “Increasingly, Jews are saying that, when it comes to Passover, ‘rice is nice.’”\n\nThe backstory: Tradition has it that Jews of Spanish origin eat rice on Passover. But Ashkenazi Jews — whose ancestors come from Central and Eastern Europe — did not. Now rabbis for the Conservative movement, the second-largest stream of Judaism in the U.S., have ruled that “kitniyot” — rice, legumes and some other formerly forbidden foodstuff — are fine to eat on Passover.\n\nQ: And this holiday is called Passover because?\n\nA: God, in Exodus 12:13, visits 10 plagues upon the Egyptians to convince Pharaoh to free the Israelites. During the last of the plagues, the smiting of the first-born sons, God “passed over” the houses of the Israelites, sparing them.\n\nQ: Four cups of wine. For what?\n\nA: Passover requires drinking four cups of wine, spaced throughout the seder. Lightweights sometimes interpret “cup” of wine to mean “a couple of sips.” But the holiday does not condone mindless imbibing. Different rabbinic explanations for the four cups include one that posits that they represent the four terms for deliverance used in Exodus 6: 6-7.\n\nQ: What’s the “seder plate”? Isn’t every plate at a seder a “seder plate”?\n\nA: Nobody really eats off this plate. It’s a single platter to display six symbolic foods.\n\nIt includes: 1. Haroset, an amalgam of fruit, nuts and wine that recalls the mortar the slaves used to build for Pharoah. 2. A hard-boiled or roasted egg, which represents spring and was an object of a sacrifice. 3. A shankbone, which symbolizes the animal sacrifice the Israelites made before they left Egypt. 4. A bitter herb, to remind of the bitterness of slavery. 5. Karpas, a green vegetable that also invokes spring and is dipped in salt water to recall the tears of the enslaved Israelites. 6. A second green vegetable, typically Romaine lettuce, which is eaten with matzo and the bitter herb.\n\nQ: What if I’m a kid? What’s in Passover for me?\n\nA: The youngest person at a Passover seder chants or recites — in Hebrew, English, Yiddish or another language — the Four Questions. The four are introduced by a preliminary question: “Why is this night different from all other nights?” The questions and their answers explain the symbolism of the food and rituals associated with the seder.\n\nThen there’s the afikomen, a special piece of matzo. By the end of the meal, some adult should have hidden it somewhere in the house. Then children look for the afikomen, and exchange it for a prize. A common afikomen prize: a Passover-themed children’s book.

However, there is one Jewish holiday that can be observed during a pandemic with surprisingly little adjustment.\n\nSukkot, the week-long fall harvest festival which started Friday evening, has been honored outside for thousands of years. The primary way to celebrate: To build and dwell in a man-made hut called a “sukkah.”\n\nAlthough the holiday has long been overshadowed by the Jewish high holidays Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the “symbolism of the sukkah this year feels particularly rife,” says Rabbi Andrea London of Beth Emet synagogue in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nSo what is Sukkot and what makes it special this year? Let’s take a look:\n\nWhat is Sukkot all about?\n\nThe holiday commemorates the Israelites' nomadic life in the desert after escaping slavery in Egypt.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\n“We were wandering for 40 years, we were in temporary shelters and we built temporary huts,” says Becky Sobelman-Stern, the chief program officer at the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.\n\nIt is also an agricultural holiday connected to the fall harvest.\n\n“This is really the Jewish Thanksgiving,” adds London. She says it's a time to be thankful for our food and and pray for rain to bring a good harvest next year.\n\nAlready dining outdoors? On Sukkot, you're supposed to eat in a sukkah (hut)\n\nObservant Jews make sukkot (that's the plural of sukkah and also the holiday name) out of materials found in nature — Sobelman-Stern uses palms found in her yard — and sometimes with the help of sukkah kits that can have steel tubing and wooden panels. The sukkah is supposed to have three walls and a roof that provides shade but also allows guests to see through it to the stars.\n\nThe sukkah is meant to be a place for outdoor dining. It is also customary to sleep in the sukkah all week, though “not everyone does the sleeping part, especially here in Chicago,” London says.\n\nPeople who don’t have the space or ability to erect a temporary hut outside can use porticos and overhangs to get into the spirit of the holiday. The holiday “is outside. It’s about decorating. It’s about being creative,” Sobelman-Stern says.\n\nWhy Sukkot feels more meaningful this year\n\nWith the holiday encouraging Jewish people to eat and socialize in open outdoor structures, “in some ways, Sukkot seems made for COVID world,” says Rabbi Sarah Krinsky of Adas Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C.\n\n“It does go deeper than that, too, though: Sukkot is about recognizing the places of fragility in our lives. It reminds us of what is temporary,\" she says.\n\nThe holiday also serves as a reminder of what’s important in life, London adds. “And how do we pursue those things? How do we be people who live with compassion and justice? How can our faith in God support us in times of trials and tribulations in crisis?”\n\nSukkot is meant to inspire thought and discussion around those questions, and also this one: “Who else, deceased or alive, would you like to have in the sukkah this year?”\n\nOn Sobelman-Stern’s list is the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died at the start of Rosh Hashanah.\n\nIt's a Jewish holiday that requires joy\n\nSukkot is the only Jewish holiday in which there is a commanded emotion, Krinsky explains. “In this case, profound joy,” she says.\n\nStepping outside, enjoying nature, decorating a sukkah and sharing food with friends (though likely fewer this year than on any other year, because of the threat of COVID-19) is meant to \"lead us to a deeper sense of presence, gratitude and even joy,\" says Krinsky. Finding joy on the holiday feels particularly important this year, she says, when doing so can be feel like a \"profound challenge and opportunity.\"\n\nAnd if the aforementioned activities don’t put a smile on your face, one specific tradition should: The shaking of the lulav and etrog.\n\nThe lulav, which is meant to symbolize the body, is made from binding the frond of a palm tree to myrtle and willow branches. The etrog, which is meant to symbolize the heart, is a citron fruit that looks like a large lemon. Both are shaken in all directions as a way to recognize God’s presence. It’s OK to treat the ritual as a dance.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/03/15/purim-dates-2022-heres-what-know-jewish-holiday/7041902001/", "title": "Purim dates 2022: Here's what to know about the Jewish holiday", "text": "Purim begins at sundown on Wednesday.\n\nThe holiday recalls the ancient story of how Queen Esther bravely saved the Jewish people.\n\nIt is a tradition for groups of Jewish people to read from the Book of Esther aloud during Purim.\n\nPurim begins this week, and the holiday will bring celebrations, costumes, sweet treats and other traditions to Jewish communities around the world.\n\nThe holiday, which starts at sundown Wednesday, recalls the ancient story of how the figure of Queen Esther bravely saved the Jewish people.\n\n“At the last minute, the story is flipped upside down, and the Jewish people are saved through the heroic acts of a particular heroine, Queen Esther, who realizes that she's in the right place in the right moment in order to change the fate of the Jewish people,” Rabbi Benjamin Berger, vice president of Jewish education at Hillel International, explained to USA TODAY.\n\nHow is Purim celebrated today? How will Jewish communities come together this week?

Everything to know about the Jewish holiday that celebrates nature\n\nWhat is Rosh Hashanah? Here's what you need to know about the Jewish New Year\n\nHow is Purim celebrated?\n\nThere are four main acts that Jewish people do on the day of Purim, Berger said. The first is to read the story of Esther, called the Megillah.\n\nIt is a tradition for groups of Jewish people to read from the Book of Esther aloud, together as a community.\n\n“During the reading, every time the wicked Haman’s name is mentioned, they make a lot of noise,” Nadell said, explaining that people will stomp their feet, shout and use a grogger, a kind of noisemaker.\n\nOther traditions include having festive meals, bringing food to loved ones and giving charitable gifts.\n\n“It's also very important on the holiday to also make donations, to give charity,” Nadell said. “You have this wonderful, raucous celebration, and then you also have remembering those who are less fortunate.”\n\nBerger added that the tradition of giving charitable gifts “is a recognition that we can't sit here in joy and in the levity of the moment if we're not also taking care of those who are in need.”\n\nHe also pointed to commemorations that individual groups organize for Purim. For example, this year, \"Hillel International is urging Jewish students and the global Jewish community to abstain from food and donate what they would have spent on meals” to relief efforts in Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country, according to a news release from the organization. The show of support comes from an ancient tradition to fast ahead of Purim.\n\nSome groups of Jewish people will also bake and eat hamantaschen, a cookie named after the villain Haman, among other Purim celebrations.\n\nIs Purim like Halloween?\n\nThough experts told USA TODAY some Jews don’t embrace comparing the holiday to Halloween, Purim is often likened to modern Halloween celebrations because both involve dressing up in costumes and going to carnivals and other festivities.\n\n“You can think of Purim as the Jewish Halloween,” Nadell said. “Jews wear all sorts of fanciful costumes, and they dress up. Little girls will dress up as Queen Esther, and boys will dress up as one of the male heroes of the story, he was Esther's uncle, his name was Mordechai.”\n\nBut she added that children – and some adults – will “dress up in all sorts of things.”\n\n“Honestly, I've even seen people dress their pets up in costumes, just like they do on Halloween,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/faith/2023/05/16/shavuot-what-when-jewish-holiday-why-dairy/70222006007/", "title": "Shavuot: What is the Jewish holiday? When is it? Why all the dairy?", "text": "Hanukkah, Passover, Rosh Hashanah ... most non-Jewish people have at least a vague idea of what those commemorate, celebrate or honor. But how about Shavuot, the \"Feast of Weeks?\"\n\nShavuot, which means \"weeks\" in Hebrew, is probably the most important Jewish holiday you've never heard of, commemorating the single most important event in Israel's history.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWhat is Shavuot?\n\nAccording to the Jewish faith, Shavuot celebrates the time when Moses received the 10 Commandments and the Torah by divine revelation — for Christians, in this case, the Torah would be considered the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, or the Old Testament — on Mount Sinai.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nThe two-day holiday marks the end of a seven-week count called the Omer that starts during Passover, the holiday where Jews partake in seders and remember how they were freed from Egyptian slavery.\n\nShavuot coincides with the grain harvest of early summer and is one of three pilgrimage festivals mentioned in the Torah, \"when Israelite males were commanded to appear before God in Jerusalem, bringing offerings of the first fruits of their harvest,\" according to MyJewishLearning.com. The other two are Passover and Sukkot.\n\nIn English, it also has been spelled Shavuos, Shavuoth or Shabuoth.\n\n\"The giving of the Torah was a far-reaching spiritual event—one that touched the essence of the Jewish soul for all times,\" explains Chabad.org. \"Shavuot also means “oaths,” for on this day G‑d swore eternal devotion to us, and we in turn pledged everlasting loyalty to Him.\"\n\nJews who observe the holiday of Shavuot typically self-reflect during the 49-day \"Counting of the Omer\" period and work on their spiritual growth.\n\nWhat is Shavuot? Everything to know about the Jewish holiday\n\nWhen is Hanukkah in 2023? When it starts, why it's celebrated and how to honor Jewish tradition.\n\nWhen is Shavuot 2023?\n\nShavuot in 2023 (Hebrew Year 5783) begins at sundown on Thursday, May 25, 2023, and ends at sundown on Saturday, May 27, 2023.\n\nIt always falls on the Hebrew calendar 6 Sivan through 7 Sivan. The Hebrew and Gregorian calendars don't match up, so dates will vary each year in the U.S.\n\nIn Israel it is a one-day holiday, ending at nightfall on 6 Sivan.\n\nWhen is Hanukkah in 2023? When it starts, why it's celebrated and how to honor Jewish tradition\n\nHow do you pronounce Shavuot?\n\nGood question. Shavuot can be pronounced either shuh-voo-oht or shuh-voo-ohs, since the last letter in the word, in Hebrew, can be pronounced as either an \"s\" or a \"t.\"\n\nHow is Shavuot celebrated?\n\nShavuot is observed by lighting candles both nights, staying up the first night to study Torah, decorating homes with flowers and other plants, attending synagogue services to hear the 10 Commandments, reading the Book of Ruth, and eating festive meals, generally including dairy foods.\n\nWhy is it traditional to eat dairy on Shavuot?\n\nLoad up the cheesecake and ice cream! Shavuot stands apart from other Jewish holidays with the emphasis on dairy, but there are differences of opinion as to why.\n\nSome believe it's tied to Moses, as with the revelation of the Torah came the kosher laws. \"As the Torah was given on Shabbat, no cattle could be slaughtered nor could utensils be koshered, and thus on that day they ate dairy,\" according to Chabad.org.\n\nSome say it's to symbolize the \"land flowing with milk and honey\" (Exodus 3:8) promised to the Israelites, or because Israelites at Mount Sinari were considered to be as innocent as newborns, according to MyJewishLearning.com. Dairy dishes also were common at spring harvest festivals, and there are kabbalistic (mystical) meanings as well.\n\nJews traditionally eat two meals on Shavuot, a dairy meal, often including stuffed blintzes and cheesecake, and later the holiday meat meal.\n\nCan you work on Shavuot?\n\nNo, with exceptions.\n\nShavuot is Yom Tov (\"a good day\"), when the Torah requires the Jewish people to sanctify the day by refraining from work. Just as on Shabbat, that means no switching on or off electrical appliances, no going to work, no driving a car, no handling money, no writing. Unlike Shabbat, Jews are permitted during Shavuot to cook and bake, light a fire from a pre-existing flame, and perform some forms of work necessary for eating and drinking, because Yom Tov days are days of rejoicing.\n\nThere are six days of the year called Yom Tov: the first day of Passover, the seventh day of Passover, Shavuot, Rosh Hashanah, the first day of Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah. Each lasts one day in Israel but is celebrated for two days elsewhere, originally because before fixed calendars it was more difficult to be sure you were celebrating the correct day.\n\nWhat is the difference between Shavuot and Pentecost?\n\nBoth holidays celebrate the end of a 50-day season in the spring, but there are definitely some differences.\n\nShavuot comes 49 or 50 days after Passover and celebrates when Jews received the Torah and became a nation. Pentecost comes 50 days after Easter, the day many Christians believe that the Holy Spirit descended on the followers of Jesus after his death, resurrection and ascension, which became the birth of the Church.\n\nJesus' Jewish followers were gathered together at the time for a festival, likely Shavout, when the Bible says the Holy Ghost descended on them. Pentecost comes from pentekoste, which means fiftieth, and was the ancient Greek term for Shavuot.\n\nHow would you greet someone celebrating Shavuot?\n\nChag Sameach! (Happy holiday!) Pronounced CHAG sah-MAY-ach, this works for any celebratory Jewish holiday.

The Jewish holiday ...", "text": "Rosh Hashanah, a holiday that celebrates the Jewish New Year, begins at sunset on Monday, Sept. 22.\n\nIt’s one of the holiest holidays for Jewish people around the world and translates from Hebrew to mean \"the head of the year.\" It can be treated as a time of reflection on the previous year and new hopes coming into the new year.\n\nCelebrations take place over two days. Traditional activities include reciting prayers near a body of water and eating foods such as apples dipped in honey.\n\nAs the holiday approaches, here’s everything you need to know about Rosh Hashanah.\n\nWhen is Rosh Hashanah 2025?\n\nHolidays on the Jewish calendar begin on the evening prior to the listed calendar date. Rosh Hashanah typically begins on the first day of the seventh month, meaning this year’s celebrations start on Monday, Sept. 22 and continue through Wednesday, Sept. 24.\n\nThe exact date varies yearly, because the lunisolar calendar aligns with the moon for its months but also has leap months. However, the holiday always starts in September or October. It’s referred to as \"yoma arichta,\" an Aramaic phrase meaning “a long day,” because the holiday can be considered one extended day.\n\nIt’s the only holiday that is two days long outside of and inside of Israel.\n\nWhat is Rosh Hashanah?\n\nThe holiday is the first of the Days of Awe, a 10-day period between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement in the Jewish faith. Yom Kippur is also the most sacred holiday in Judaism.\n\nIn Jewish customs, the \"Book of Life\" opens on Rosh Hashanah and is \"sealed\" on Yom Kippur, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\n\nIt may be considered as the day when Adam and Eve were created, or the \"birthday of the world.\"\n\nHow is Rosh Hashanah celebrated?\n\nSome people may take time off of work or a vacation to mark the occasion. Typically, those who practice the Jewish faith will attend services at a synagogue that include special prayers and songs.\n\nIn some services, Jewish communities may blow a Shofar, a curved ram’s horn, as part of the celebration.\n\nAs part of a tradition that symbolizes sending off sins, some faith followers may toss pieces of bread into the water as part of a Tashlich ceremony, a ritual inspired by a verse in the Book of Micah that describes God casting sins into the depths of the sea.\n\nWhat are some traditional Rosh Hashanah foods?\n\nLike many holidays, families gather around the table to celebrate the occasion, which is typically marked by traditional foods.\n\nHere are some of the foods families may eat during this time:\n\nApples and honey, representing a sweet new year.\n\nChallah, a braided bread in a round loaf that represents the cycle of the year.\n\nPomegranate seeds, which are meant to represent the 613 mitzvot, or commandments, which are cited in the Jewish holy book, the Torah.\n\nWhat is an appropriate Rosh Hashanah greeting?\n\nHappy new year or Happy Rosh Hashanah can both be used for the holiday. People can also use shanah tovah, meaning good year in Hebrew.\n\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

The most celebrated of Jewish holidays, Passover, represents liberation and is symbolic of self-determination.\n\nKnown as \"Pesach\" in Hebrew, Passover commemorates pivotal events in the Book of Exodus. Jews celebrate the freeing of Israelite slaves from Egypt and Moses guiding them to the Promised Land. The eight-day event often coincides with Easter week but alternates yearly based on the lunar cycle and starts the night of a full moon.\n\nRituals steeped in thousands of years of tradition mark all the ways the faithful celebrate Passover. This is what you most need to know about this period sacred for countless people.\n\nWhen is Passover in 2025?\n\nPassover this year starts at sundown April 12 and culminates when the sun sets April 20. In 2025, the end of Passover falls on the same day as Easter Sunday.\n\nWhat does Passover commemorate?\n\nExodus narrates how Moses approached Pharaoh on multiple occasions, ordering him to \"let my people go,\" cautioning the Egyptian ruler that God would inflict punishment if he did not heed warning. Upon Pharaoh ignoring the command to free the Israelites, 10 plagues were unleashed by God on Egypt and its people. These included the death of the firstborn, turning the Nile into blood and locusts.\n\nWhat is the Seder?\n\nThe first two nights of Passover, April 12 and 13 in 2025, consist of a Seder. At this candle-lit dinner, unleavened bread resembling a large, flat cracker and called matzo is feasted on. Leavened food is forbidden during this period, and \"chametz\" is the practice of removing these items from a household.\n\nOther foods eaten during the Seder harken to the flight of the Israelites from Egypt. These include a lamb shank, which represents the lamb sacrificed by the Israelites before they left in search of their home.\n\nRetelling Exodus, passages from the formal Hebrew text of Haggadah is read during the Seder.\n\nWhat is a famous Seder meal?\n\nAs described in the New Testament, a Seder was the last supper of Jesus Christ, who was Jewish.\n\nCincinnati Enquirer reporters Grace Tucker and Seth Jacobson contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/01/13/tu-bishvat-2022-what-know-jewish-holiday/9169101002/", "title": "Tu BiShvat 2023: What to know about the Jewish holiday", "text": "It may be winter in the U.S., but in Israel, spring is beginning. The annual Jewish holiday Tu BiShvat honors this moment in time.\n\nIt's \"become for many an environmental holiday, a reminder that we need to care for the earth and nature,\" says Rabbi Hara Person, chief executive of the Central Conference of American Rabbis.\n\nThe holiday celebrates the annual new year of trees. Think of it \"like a Jewish Arbor Day,\" Person says. You may also see it written as Tu B’Shevat.\n\n\"'Tu' stands for the Hebrew letters Tet and Vav,\"says Rabbi Josh Weinberg of the Union for Reform Judaism. The letters Tet and Vav together can be pronounced as \"Tu\" and signify the number 15 while Shevat is the name of the current month on the Hebrew calendar. So directly translated, Tu B’Shevat simply means it is the 15th day in the month of Shevat.\n\n\"For Jews outside of Israel, Tu B'Shevat is a celebration of the renewal of vision and awareness, a celebration of connections and connectedness,\" according to Hillel International.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nWhen is Tu BiShvat?\n\nTypically January or February. The Hebrew and Gregorian calendars don't align, hence the date fluctuations for all Jewish holidays in the U.S. This year Tu BiShvat begins the evening of Feb. 5 and ends the evening of Feb. 6.\n\nHow significant is Tu BiShvat, compared to Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and more?\n\nNo offense to trees, but the holiday doesn't land high in terms of religious or spiritual importance for Jews. It's not mentioned in the Torah.\n\n\"It is not considered a major holiday,\" Person says. \"The High Holy Days (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur), as well as the pilgrimage holidays of Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot are much more significant theologically and liturgically. But it is a fun and meaningful holiday.\"\n\nWeinberg adds: \"Some in the Orthodox world add in additional pieces of liturgy to supplement their prayers on that day, but it is not a day off of work (or) school and there are no main prohibitions to the holiday.\"\n\nWhat should you say to someone celebrating?\n\nKeep it simple. Happy Tu BiShvat works, or in Hebrew \"chag sameach.\"\n\nHow do people typically celebrate?\n\nA number of different ways. You can plant trees or clean up a local park, for example.\n\nWhy trees, exactly? \"In Israel as the State was being developed, the holiday became very strongly associated with planting trees as part of the campaign of the Jewish National Fund,\" Weinberg says. \"From that the holiday came to take on an environmental or ecological meaning and association.\"\n\nIf you're thinking about what to eat, \"there is also a tradition from the 17th century of holding a Tu BiShevat seder, or special meal, in which different kinds of fruits and nuts from trees are eaten, along with cups of wine or grape juice of different colors,\" Person says. \"Seder\" means order; the term is usually associated with the Jewish holiday of Passover which recognizes when Jews fled Egypt. The \"Tu BiShevat\" seder is modeled after Passover's, according to Hillel.\n\n\"This custom spread primarily in Sephardic communities, but in contemporary times it has been getting more attention among Jewish communities around the world,\" Weinberg says.\n\nSpeaking of food, what can I eat?\n\nAnything that grows on trees. Kind of.\n\nTypical holiday fare includes seven foods that grew in ancient Israel as mentioned in the Bible – figs, dates, olives, barley, grapes, wheat and pomegranates.\n\n\"Today these might include dates, figs, carob, apricots, olives, almonds, pomegranate or oranges, but could include others as well,\" Person says. \"People might also eat food made with tree fruits and nuts, like banana bread, or persimmon cake, almond cookies, or anything that features products from trees.\"\n\nThose looking for recipes can scour the internet for creative ideas, including persimmon-pomegranate salsa, frozen yogurt grapes and an almond smoothie.\n\nWait, isn't there another Jewish holiday that also recognizes nature?\n\nYes, Sukkot, where Jews gather in huts called \"sukkahs.\" It's been referred to as the \"Jewish Thanksgiving.\"\n\n\"Both are part of the ancient agricultural cycle,\" Person says. \"Sukkot celebrates the end of the annual harvest, whereas Tu BiShvat celebrates the very beginning, basically the hope of the next harvest. In Israel, the holiday usually occurs at the same time that the almond trees begin to blossom, a sign that winter will end, spring will come, a new harvest cycle will begin.\"\n\nWeinberg recognizes the \"overlapping themes,\" though says \"Sukkot’s ritual is all about going outside and living in nature for the week, while Tu BiShvat is seen more of a reminder to us of our obligations for stewardship of the earth.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/13"}]}

We look forward to sharing our lessons learned and operations experience with the private sector to help them develop safe, reliable, and cost-effective destinations in space,” said Phil McAlister, director of commercial space at NASA Headquarters in a statement.\n\n“The report we have delivered to Congress describes, in detail, our comprehensive plan for ensuring a smooth transition to commercial destinations after retirement of the International Space Station in 2030.”\n\nSpace graveyard\n\nIn the International Space Station Transition Report, NASA said the plan was for the ISS to fall to Earth in an area known as the South Pacific Oceanic Uninhabited Area – also known as Point Nemo. The report said that its budget estimate assumed that the deorbit would happen in January 2031.\n\nNamed after the submarine sailor in Jules Verne’s novel “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,” Point Nemo is the point in the ocean that is farthest from land and has been a watery grave for many other spacecraft.\n\nThe area is approximately 3,000 miles off of New Zealand’s eastern coast and 2,000 miles north of Antarctica and it’s estimated that space-faring nations such as the US, Russia, Japan and European countries have sunk more than 263 pieces of space debris there since 1971.\n\nThe report said the ISS would perform thrusting maneuvers that would ensure “safe atmospheric entry.”\n\nThird decade\n\nThe ISS won’t rest on its laurels for the next eight years. NASA said goals for the next decade including using the ISS as “analog for a Mars transit mission,” according to the report.\n\n“The International Space Station is entering its third and most productive decade as a groundbreaking scientific platform in microgravity,” said Robyn Gatens, director of the International Space Station at NASA Headquarters, said in the statement.\n\n“This third decade is one of results, building on our successful global partnership to verify exploration and human research technologies to support deep space exploration, continue to return medical and environmental benefits to humanity, and lay the groundwork for a commercial future in low-Earth orbit.”\n\n“We look forward to maximizing these returns from the space station through 2030 while planning for transition to commercial space destinations that will follow.”\n\nThe space station has been home to many scientific firsts. The first item to be 3D-printed on the space station occurred in 2014. NASA astronaut Kate Rubins sequenced DNA in space for the first time in 2016. And the fifth state of matter, called a Bose-Einstein condensate, was produced in space by NASA’s Cold Atom Lab on the station in 2018.\n\nAstronauts have learned how to grow lettuces and leafy greens in space. The first space-grown salad was sampled by astronauts in 2015. Now, they’re even growing radishes and chilis on the station. This could be used to one day help astronauts grow their own food on deep space missions.\n\nChina, whose astronauts have long been excluded from the ISS, launched the first module of its planned space station last year. While not as large as the ISS, the Chinese space station is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year.\n\nRussia has said it will leave the ISS project in 2025 and plans to build its own space station that could launch in 2030.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2025/02/20/what-we-know-doge-elon-musk-calls-for-deorbiting-international-space-station-nasa-trump/79317126007/", "title": "What we know: DOGE's Elon Musk calls for deorbiting space station", "text": "AI-assisted summary The International Space Station (ISS) may be retired sooner than the planned 2030 deorbit date due to age, cost, and a potential shift in NASA's priorities.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has expressed interest in redirecting NASA's focus towards a crewed mission to Mars, potentially utilizing SpaceX's Starship spacecraft.\n\nThe future of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon, is uncertain under the new administration, with potential budget concerns and a renewed focus on Mars exploration.\n\n(This story has been updated to include a statement by NASA.)\n\nElon Musk on Thursday called for the end of the International Space Station, saying it had already outlived its usefulness.\n\n\"It's time to begin preparations for deorbiting,\" the outpost, Musk wrote on X. \"It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"\n\nMusk's comments could carry significant weight considering his role as a close confidante of President Donald Trump and the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, which is charged with finding ways to cut the federal budget.\n\nWhile plans have already been in place to deorbit the space station by 2030 − with the help of SpaceX − an Office of Inspector General report released in late 2024 questioned whether the space station could survive another five years amidst current issues.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nMusk added later on X that: \"the decision is up to the President, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now\".\n\nWith the earliest ISS module in orbit since 1998, air leaks, structural issues, and space suit problems have plagued the space station for the past decade. The Inspector General report had raised concerns that if NASA had to extend the ISS past 2030, it could face budget cuts, inflation, or even supply chain issues in the coming years making support for the ISS hard.\n\nAccording to a 2021 NASA report, the ISS costs approximately $3 billion a year to maintain, \"roughly a third of NASA's annual human space flight budget.\" With Musk tasked with slashing government costs, that might make the space station a big target.\n\nWhen is the next launch: Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA rocket launch schedule at Cape Canaveral\n\nThe space station has served as a platform not only for breakthrough science, but to study human physiology on long duration spaceflight — something which will be important on a mission to Mars.\n\nIt's also an international endeavor, with multiple countries involved in not only in the science, but having attached modules. Russia is the main American partner in regards to the ISS, and as of the last released NASA report, the Russian space agency has not released a timeline on when they would commit to deorbiting the space station. The European Space Agency is also a partner, as is the Japanese space agency and the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nLate Thursday afternoon, NASA released the following statement:\n\n“NASA’s current mission plans call for using the International Space Station, and future commercial space stations, in low Earth orbit to conduct groundbreaking science, as well as a training ground for crewed missions to the Moon and Mars. We’re looking forward to hearing more about the Trump Administration's plans for our agency and expanding exploration for the benefit of all.”\n\nBoeing works on NASA's space station\n\nThere could be a significant impact to Boeing if the space station were to be deorbited early.\n\nBoeing is a main contractor of NASA on the ISS. They are responsible for multiple components, including structures, hardware and software.\n\nBoeing recently projected job layoffs of up to 400 employees by April, but stated the layoffs were in relation to NASA's Artemis program. It is NASA's Artemis return-to-the-moon program which is currently being watched closely by experts anticipating changes with the new Trump administration. The Artemis program is already hugely overbudget and behind schedule, and it faces the prospect of being outpaced by SpaceX's Starship. Musk runs SpaceX.\n\nHow would the ISS be deorbited\n\nSpaceX is already contracted for $843 million to develop a spacecraft that will safely deorbit the station as soon as 2030, bringing it down over the ocean — where any bits that are not burned up during reentry would fall into the water and not impact humans.\n\nAmerican astronauts have been present continuously on the ISS since November of 2000. This means that anyone 24 years and younger have not lived through a time when an American astronaut was not in orbit.\n\nShould the ISS be abandoned and deorbited early, that would potentially end an American presence in orbit. China has a crewed space station currently orbiting the Earth.\n\nWhat would come after the NASA space station?\n\nThe current plan by NASA is to replace the ISS with one or more space stations built by private companies. Blue Origin and Sierra Space, Axiom Space, and Voyager Space alongside Airbus, have been on the task. But with five years to go, nothing is currently ready to be launched.\n\nAxiom Space is making progress with their space station module, which will attach to the ISS. They've been launching crewed missions to the ISS to prepare for this future transition to their space station. Axiom-4 is still scheduled for no earlier than this spring, and will see four astronauts visit the space station to conduct science.\n\nIt remains to be seen, though, whether this will continue to be the plan.\n\nCould there be a push for sending NASA astronauts to Mars on Starship?\n\n\"Let’s go to Mars,\" the Thursday statement by Musk closed with. This left room for continued speculation about whether the Trump administration will be pushing for Mars instead of the moon.\n\nThe plan of NASA's Artemis moon program was to lay the groundwork for an eventual journey to Mars. There are still huge obstacles to sending humans to Mars, not least of which is how to keep them safe from dangerous radiation levels.\n\nThe SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, which will fly the Artemis missions, has been reported to be way over budget, estimating to reach a cost of $93 billion through 2025.\n\nSo far, Artemis has only launched one uncrewed mission in 2022. Artemis II, which will see a crew fly around the moon, keeps slipping − now slated for no earlier than 2026.\n\nPresident Trump stated during his inauguration speech that the plan was to have \"American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars.\" He didn't mention the moon.\n\nIf this promise can be delivered, it would most likely be SpaceX's Starship providing the transport. Humans on Mars has long been the ultimate goal of Musk's SpaceX, and currently Starship is the only spacecraft being developed which can refuel in space. Refueling in space will be an essential part of getting a crew and all of its supplies on the long journey to the red planet.\n\n\"And, we're going to take DOGE to Mars,\" Musk said during a post-inauguration celebration.\n\nIt is unknown how much sending a crewed Starship to Mars would cost, or if it would even fall into NASA's mission schedule. Musk has already been pushing for SpaceX to send an uncrewed Starship to the planet by 2026, with a crewed mission following a few years later. Still, Starship has yet to have even a successful full flight − one in which the Starship reenters in one piece.\n\nAstronaut calls out Musk on X over statement on astronauts onboard ISS\n\nHours prior to the post by Musk on the ISS being deorbited, a feud broke out on X between former space station commander Andreas Mogensen (Crew-7) and Elon Musk.\n\nMogensen, a Danish astronaut, reposted a recent Fox News interview where Musk stated that Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams were abandoned by the previous administration. \"What a lie. And from someone who complains about lack of honesty from the mainstream media,\" Mogensen wrote.\n\nThe astronauts were placed onto NASA's Crew-9 after their Boeing spacecraft malfunctioned upon docking to the ISS back in June. Their return has just been moved up by a few weeks, after Trump ordered Musk to bring them home sooner.\n\nMusk fired back at the the European Space Agency astronaut, writing: \"You are fully retarded. SpaceX could have brought them back several months ago. I OFFERED THIS DIRECTLY to the Biden administration and they refused. Return WAS pushed back for political reasons. Idiot.\"\n\n\"Elon, I have long admired you and what you have accomplished, especially at SpaceX and Tesla.

NASA plans to award the contract in June for the vehicle, which will be deployed upon the space station's impending retirement in 2030.\n\nUFO sightings: Civilian pilots could report UAP to FAA under proposed bill\n\nWhat is the International Space Station?\n\nDesigned and operated thanks to a global partnership of space agencies, the International Space Station has been home to crews of astronauts, cosmonauts and plenty of others since November 2000, NASA says.\n\nMore than 260 spacefarers from 20 countries have visited to the International Space Station, including 163 from the United States alone, according to the U.S. space agency.\n\nCrew members who live and conduct scientific experiment aboard the space station orbit Earth 16 times a day. The orbital outpost is larger than a six-bedroom house with six sleeping quarters, two bathrooms, a gym, and a 360-degree view bay window, according to NASA.\n\nSince 1998, more than 260 spacewalks have been conducted at the International Space Station, including a rare all-female spacewalk in November.\n\nIn September, a U.S. military astronaut named Frank Rubio was stationed aboard the space outpost when he made history as the American with longest consecutive spaceflight. Rubio spent a U.S. record of 371 days in space after the capsule meant to ferry him back to Earth, a Russian Soyuz, sprang a coolant leak in 2022, which doubled his stay.\n\nThe current Expedition 70 crew began their stint in late-September and are scheduled to land in spring. While aboard the station, the seven astronauts and cosmonauts have been conducting a variety scientific experiments and studying an array of microgravity phenomena.\n\nWhat is the timeline for ending the International Space Station?\n\nDecommissioning the aging cosmic outpost is the shared responsibility of the five space agencies that have operated it since 1998: the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada.\n\nAll of those nations have committed to supporting the International Space Station operations through 2030 with the exception of Russia, which has agreed to keep going only until 2028, according to NASA.\n\nHow will NASA land the space station?\n\nNASA examined several options for decommissioning the International Space Station, including disassembling it while in orbit, boosting it to a higher orbit and allowing it to decay naturally before randomly re-entering Earth's atmosphere.\n\nMany of those options presented \"significant logistical and financial challenges\" for a space station as large as an American football field, NASA said.\n\nIts modules and truss structure were not designed to be easily disassembled in space, while allowing for an unplanned atmospheric re-entry posed too much of a threat to populated areas. Further, objects that are retired to the safer high \"graveyard\" orbits are typically smaller satellites, not massive outposts, NASA said.\n\nSuch considerations were why the space agency decided that a controlled, targeted re-entry ending in a crash landing into a remote ocean was the safest route.\n\nWhichever private aerospace company is selected by NASA will build a deorbiting craft capable of performing a \"propulsive maneuver\" to line up the re-entry path into the desired uninhabited waters.\n\nMany of the space station's modules and hardware are expected to burn up, melt away or vaporize upon re-entry. The denser and heat-resistant components that may survive the plunge will splash down into the ocean, where they are expected to harmlessly sink to the ocean floor, according to NASA.\n\nWhat comes after the ISS?\n\nIn the months and years ahead, the United States will shift its focus to commercial operations and contracted missions.\n\nThat includes funding and enabling private industry to develop commercially-owned-and-operated space stations, NASA says.\n\n\"It is NASA’s goal to be one of many customers in a robust commercial marketplace in low Earth orbit where in-orbit destinations as well as cargo and crew transportation, are available as services to the agency,\" NASA said in an explanation of its transition plan.\n\nPartnering more often with private industry will hopefully free up NASA to focus on building spacecraft and rockets for deep space missions, including human missions to the moon and Mars.\n\nArtemis moon mission delayed another year\n\nAs part of its ongoing Artemis program, the agency had hopes of sending a group of spacefarers on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon as early as November. However, the target date for Atemis II was pushed back last week to no earlier than 2025 \"to allow teams to work through challenges associated with first-time developments, operations, and integration,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nThe mission would pave the way for Artemis III, when another group of astronauts will venture to land on the lunar surface itself. That mission, which has experienced setbacks, was also delayed until no earlier than 2026.\n\nThe announcement came on the heels of the news that the first American attempt to land a commercial spacecraft on the lunar surface would likely be unsuccessful. NASA spent tens of millions of dollars for a spot for its scientific cargo on Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic's Peregrine spacecraft, which faltered on its journey to the moon when it encountered an issue with its propulsion system.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nCurrently, there are only two destinations in low-Earth orbit, the ISS and a smaller modular station being built by China.\n\nWithin the next decade, NASA expects that to change.\n\nISS is costly and old, commercial stations are not\n\nThe ISS, which has been continuously occupied since 2000, is beginning to show its age.\n\nThe main portion of the station repeatedly endures impacts from visiting spacecraft, as well as harsh cycles of heating and cooling from orbiting the Earth 16 times a day.\n\nNASA spends about $1.1 billion in operating and maintenance costs on the station.\n\nWith an increasingly expensive and aging station and higher-than-ever confidence in the low-Earth orbit capabilities of its commercial partners, NASA intends to shift its focus to its return-to-the-moon Artemis program.\n\nWith NASA as a customer, private companies will foot the bill for maintenance and operation of destinations in space, potentially saving NASA — and the American taxpayers — billions.\n\nNASA funding commercial station development\n\nEvery space station since the Soviet Union's pioneering Salyut 1 in 1971, has been built by NASA and its partners or the national space programs of Russia or China.\n\nThe agency's plan to transition from a low-Earth orbit destination provider to a customer of independent commercial low-Earth orbit destinations (CLDs) was first outlined in the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017. At the time, the ISS was set to be decommissioned in 2024.\n\nSince then, the Biden administration has committed to extending operations of the ISS through 2030. NASA's international partners have also signaled their intention to continue operations until then.\n\nIn an effort to duplicate the success it had in fostering commercial cargo and crew transportation to the ISS, NASA is funding initial efforts with Axiom Space, Blue Origin, Nanoracks, and Northrop Grumman to develop commercial space destinations through 2025.\n\nAxiom Space has been tapped to develop at least one transitional module that will attach to the ISS and one day separate to become its own space station.\n\nBlue Origin, Nanoracks, and Northrop Grumman Systems were selected by NASA to develop free-flying, independent commercial low-Earth orbit destinations (CLDs).\n\nCommercial stations aren't a new idea\n\nThe concept of commercial destinations in space is not new.\n\nBigelow Aerospace, a company founded 20 years ago to develop orbital destinations, had been floating the idea of a commercial space station to NASA years before the agency planned for the retirement of the ISS.\n\nIn 2017, it proposed an idea to launch a small outpost station to the moon with United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket.\n\nIt also planned to pursue an opportunity to develop a free-flying station with NASA using its B2100 \"Olympus\" inflatable habitat designed for crew and tourists.\n\nBigelow Aerospace was certainly ahead of its time in 2010 when it proposed the concept of connecting an inflatable module to the ISS.\n\nIts Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) was launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 and installed on the ISS in 2016.\n\nSince then, Bigelow Aerospace passed on an opportunity to bid on a NASA contract to connect another commercial module to the ISS.\n\nThat opportunity was ultimately awarded to Axiom Space for the development of its Axiom Hub 1 — a major first step in the race to develop commercial destinations in space.\n\nCompany founder, Robert Bigelow, said that the funding was too low and his company was more interested in an opportunity to develop a free-flying space station.\n\nBigelow Aerospace suffered what many architects of the future do, facing the reality of grand ideas.\n\nIn practicality, getting massive inflatable space stations and large numbers of crew members to orbit requires massive launchers — such as Blue Origin's New Glenn, SpaceX's Starship, NASA's SLS, or ULA's Vulcan — and multiple fast, reliable, and safe crew transportation options.\n\nEven now, those options are not readily available. SpaceX is a sole provider of commercial crewed spaceflight, while the New Glenn, Starship, SLS, and Vulcan rockets are all still in development.\n\nBeing ahead of its time and citing impacts from the global pandemic, Bigelow Aerospace has all but closed up shop.\n\nIn March 2020 its entire workforce was laid off. In December 2021, it transferred ownership and operation of the ISS BEAM module to NASA Johnson Space Center.\n\nThere are other commercial providers succeeding where Bigelow Aerospace failed.\n\nNanoracks owns and operates a commercial airlock on the ISS.\n\nSierra Space has its own version of an inflatable habitat in the works called the Large Integrated Flexible Environment which is a planned component of Blue Origin's bet on a commercial space station called the \"Orbital Reef.\"\n\nBoth of these companies have won big with NASA investment to develop the next era of commercial space stations in a robust economy in low-Earth Orbit.\n\nAxiom Station to lead the way\n\nThe first step toward a revolutionary new economy in low-Earth orbit was taken in 2020 when NASA awarded Axiom Space a $140 million contract ordering at least one habitable commercial module that will attach to the ISS — the opportunity that Bigelow Aerospace passed on.\n\nAs explained in a statement provided by NASA, the contract is a first stepping stone for a commercial partner “to demonstrate its ability to provide products and services and begin the transition to a sustainable low-Earth orbit economy in which NASA is one of many customers.”\n\nAxiom Space has plans to build not only the module that will attach to the ISS but to build onto the initial module and ultimately separate from the ISS as a free-flying, self-sustaining facility called Axiom Station.\n\nAxiom Hub 1, the first module of the eventual Axiom Station, will consist of crew quarters with windows and will be capable of supporting research and in-space manufacturing.\n\nSpeaking to FLORIDA TODAY, Axiom Space Executive Chairman Kam Ghaffarian said, “We're expecting the first module in our space station to be launched in mid-2024.”\n\n“There will be additional modules that will be launched. And initially, our modules will dock with the current ISS. And then as ISS retires, somewhere between 2028 to 2030, we will separate from the International Space Station, and we'll be operating as the first private commercial space station in orbit,” continued Ghaffarian.\n\nAxiom Hub 1 is currently being constructed in Europe by Thales Alenia Space.\n\nWork began in October 2021, just 14 months after the program's launch. The fabrication of the module is expected to wrap up soon followed by initial integration and testing operations.\n\n“We've been working on the project; we've been developing hardware. We will be in orbit by 2024, way ahead of everybody else. And as a result, we would have huge first-mover advantage,” said Ghaffarian.\n\nGhaffarian believes that Axiom Space has the advantage over other companies working to develop their own free-flying space stations because “the other companies do not have the ability to connect to the International Space Station. We're the only one that has access,\" he said.\n\nDelivery of Axiom Hub 1 to Houston for final assembly, outfitting, and integration by Axiom Space is expected in early 2023.\n\nWhile hardware is currently being constructed, Axiom Space still has a few logistics to work through starting with how the first module will make it to orbit in the first place.\n\n\"We're not 100% sure yet as to who we're going to contract with for the transportation to take that to orbit for us when it's ready,\" said Ghaffarian.\n\nIn an effort to further open the ISS to commercialization, in 2021 NASA solicited proposals to support up to two private astronaut missions a year to the ISS.\n\nNASA has also selected Axiom Space as the provider of the first two private astronaut missions to the ISS. NASA has stated that it will use data and information collected from the first two private astronaut missions to the ISS before announcing the selection of a third mission.\n\nLike NASA's Commercial Crew Program astronaut missions, Axiom Space is partnered with SpaceX for crew transport using its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsules.\n\nThe first private astronaut mission, AX-1, is slated to launch from Kennedy Space Center on April 3 sending three paying customers and a former professional NASA astronaut on a 10-day mission with eight spent aboard the ISS to conduct scientific research.\n\nThe second private astronaut mission, AX-2, is targeted to launch between fall 2022 and late spring 2023.\n\nNASA plans for more than one station\n\nIn contrast to Axiom Space's exclusive access to build onto the ISS, 11 companies submitted proposals to NASA to develop independent free-flying space stations.\n\nFrom the 11 proposals, NASA selected Blue Origin, Nanoracks, and Northrop Grumman Systems in December 2021 awarding a total estimated $415.6 million for Phase 1 development which is expected to last through 2025.\n\nAfter the initial design phase, NASA intends to move forward with at least one of the companies to certify the space station design as safe for NASA crew members and purchase services from the provider(s).\n\nBlue Origin has partnered with Sierra Space receiving a total $130 million award in Phase 1 funding to develop its proposed \"Orbital Reef\" space station.\n\nBlue Origin and Sierra Space plan to develop the \"Orbital Reef\" and make it enticing to business partners, researchers, and tourists alike by teaming with Boeing, Redwire Space, Genesis Engineering Solutions, and Arizona State University (ASU).\n\nIn a Blue Origin-provided statement, Brent Sherwood, senior vice president of advanced development programs said, \"the Orbital Reef mixed-use space business park will offer reduced costs and complexity, turnkey services, and inspiring space architecture to support any business.\"\n\nBlue Origin's proposal features the most attractive options for wealthy space tourists, as well as, scientific researchers.\n\nTo make \"Orbital Reef\" an easy-to-reach, all-in-one excursion and destination in space, Blue Origin partnered with Sierra Space and Boeing to provide multiple cargo and crew transportation options.\n\nLindy Elkins-Tanton, ASU vice president of interplanetary initiative, explained it as \"a village. Think of it as many different organizations and people in their own parts of \"Orbital Reef\" doing their own activities.\"\n\nAt any given time, the large station would be able to support up to 10 occupants.\n\nIt would also be large enough to provide spaces for scientific research, in-space manufacturing, and even \"exotic hospitality\" for tourists.\n\nAlso unique to Blue Origin's proposal is the opportunity for visitors to experience space without the constraints of a spacesuit.\n\nGenesis Engineering Solutions will contribute essentially a space version of a one-person submarine to conduct excursions outside of the main station.\n\n“Until now, excursions outside spacecraft have required the challenge, inconvenience, risk, and expense of spacesuits. Orbital Reef changes that with the Single Person Spacecraft, an efficient and tourist-safe alternative,” said Brand Griffin, program manager for Genesis Engineering.\n\nNorthrop Grumman — partnered with Dynetics, Leidos, and more unnamed partners — was awarded $125.6 million in Phase 1 funding.\n\nNorthrop Grumman expects to leverage its extensive space experience to develop an as-of-yet unnamed space station.\n\nInitially, it will be capable of supporting four permanent crew members with expectations to expand to eight in the future as the market demands.\n\n“Our station will enable a smooth transition from International Space Station-based LEO missions to sustainable commercial-based missions where NASA does not bear all the costs but serves as one of many customers,” said Steve Krein, vice president, civil and commercial space, Northrop Grumman in a Northrop Grumman-provided statement.\n\nNorthrop Grumman's design also incorporates capabilities to support science, manufacturing, and tourism.\n\n\"Multiple docking ports will allow future expansion to support exploration crew, analog habitats, laboratories, crew airlocks, and facilities capable of artificial gravity,\" as described in a statement issued by Northrop Grumman.\n\nNanoracks, awarded $160 million in Phase 1 funding, has partnered with Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin to develop its space station called \"Star Lab.\"\n\nThe proposed \"Star Lab\" will be able to continuously support up to four astronauts and \"include a large inflatable habitat, designed and built by Lockheed Martin, a metallic docking node, a power and propulsion element, a large robotic arm for servicing cargo and payloads, and a state-of-the-art laboratory system to host a comprehensive research, science, and manufacturing capability,\" as explained in a statement provided by Nanoracks.\n\nNanoracks Chairman Jeffrey Manber, says that it's smart that NASA is investing in multiple space stations, just as it provided funding for more than one ISS cargo supplier and chose both SpaceX and Boeing to ferry passengers to the ISS.\n\nHe pointed out that for nearly a decade the U.S. had relied on one provider — Russia — to carry NASA astronauts to the space station before SpaceX began doing so in 2019.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine would have complicated, if not ended, the NASA-Russia flights, said Manber.\n\n\"So you know, this crisis shows the value of the United States moving into a new era where there will be multiple smaller private space stations,\" Manber said. \"So that we're not single-point dependent on any company, any team, and we have a really robust presence in space.\"\n\nJamie Groh is a space reporter for Florida Today.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThree thousand miles off the coast of New Zealand and 2,000 miles north of Antarctica, Point Nemo is so far from land that the closest humans are often the astronauts on board the International Space Station – that orbits 227 nautical miles above Earth.\n\nIt’s precisely this remoteness that explains why the ISS, once it’s retired in 2030, will end its days here, plummeting to Earth to join other decommissioned space stations, satellites and space debris. This is the world’s space graveyard.\n\nSpacefaring nations have been dumping their junk in the area around Point Nemo, named after Captain Nemo from Jules Verne’s novel “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea,” since the 1970s.\n\nAlso known as the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility or South Pacific Ocean Uninhabited Area, the exact coordinates of the world’s most remote spot were calculated by Canadian-Russian engineer Hrvoje Lukatela in 1992.\n\nMore than 263 pieces of space debris have been sunk in this area since 1971, including Russia’s Mir space station and NASA’s first space station Skylab, according to a 2019 study. They’re not intact monuments to the history of space travel but are likely fragmented debris scattered over a large area.\n\n“This is the largest ocean area without any islands. It is just the safest area where the long fall-out zone of debris after a re-entry fits into,” said Holger Krag, Head of the Space Safety Programme Office at the European Space Agency.\n\nPoint Nemo is beyond any state’s jurisdiction and is devoid of any human life – although it’s not free from the traces of human impact. In addition to the space junk on the seafloor, microplastic particles were discovered in the waters when yachts in the Volvo Ocean Race passed through the region in 2018.\n\nBest practice\n\nSpace junk such as old satellites reenter the Earth’s atmosphere on a daily basis, although most of it goes unnoticed because it burns up long before it can hit the ground.\n\nIt’s only larger space debris – such as spacecraft and rocket parts – that pose a very small risk to humans and infrastructure on the ground. Space agencies and operators must plan well in advance to ensure that it falls to Earth in this far-flung bit of ocean.\n\nIn the case of the International Space Station, NASA said the ISS will begin maneuvers to prepare for deorbit as early as 2026, lowering the altitude of the space lab, with it expected to crash back to Earth in 2031. The exact timings of the maneuvers depends on the solar cycle activity and its effect on Earth’s atmosphere.\n\n“Higher solar activity tends to expand the Earth’s atmosphere and increase resistance to the ISS’ velocity, resulting in more drag and natural altitude loss,” NASA said in a newly published document outlining plans for decommissioning the ISS.\n\nSpace agencies and commercial operators must also notify authorities in control of flights and shipping – usually in Chile, New Zealand and Tahiti – of the location, timing and dimensions of the debris fall-out zones. Around two flights per day pass through the air space, said Krag. These authorities produce standardized message sent out to air and sea traffic.\n\nA bigger problem than the spacecraft that end up in Point Nemo, said Krag, is chunks of metal rocket stages and spacecraft making what’s known as an “uncontrolled reentry” into the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nIn June 2021, NASA criticized China for failing to “meet responsible standards” after debris from its out-of-control Long March 5B rocket plunged into the Indian Ocean.\n\n“Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at the time.\n\nThe rocket, which was about 108 feet tall and weighed nearly 40,000 pounds, had launched a piece of a new Chinese space station into orbit on April 29. After its fuel was spent, the rocket had been left to hurtle through space uncontrolled until Earth’s gravity dragged it back to the ground.\n\nKrag said that, on average, 100 to 200 tons of space junk reenter the Earth’s atmosphere in an uncontrolled way every year, yet most space experts consider reentry the most desirable outcome for space junk.\n\nThe vast majority stays above us where it can collide with functioning satellites, create more junk and threaten human life on crewed spacecraft.\n\nThere are at least 26,000 pieces of space junk orbiting the Earth that are the size of a softball or larger and could destroy a satellite on impact; over 500,000 the size of a marble big enough to cause damage to spacecraft or satellites; and over 100 million pieces of debris the size of a grain of salt that could puncture a spacesuit, according to a NASA report issued last year.\n\nOcean trash can?\n\nLanding space junk in the ocean depths of Point Nemo is the least worst option, said Vito De Lucia, a professor of law at the Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea at The Arctic University of Norway. However, we don’t know much about the deep sea environment in this area.\n\nSome research suggests that because of ocean currents in that region – known as the South Pacific Gyre – it is not particularly biologically diverse. Oceanographer Autun Purser, a postdoctoral researcher at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, said he had been close the area and said the seafloor would likely be inhabited with sea cucumbers, seabed octopuses and “the odd fish.”\n\n“There is generally a low reign of food, as it is in the middle of the Pacific Gyre, a low productivity area with little upwelling nutrient rich waters, so though there will be seafloor animals, there will not be a high biomass down there probably,” he said via email.\n\nKrag at the European Space Agency said that the space objects that landed in the ocean were typically made from stainless steel, titanium or aluminum and were not toxic.\n\n“It is not more than a few dozens of metric tons per year. The re-entering fragments do not float, but sink and therefore are no hazard to ship traffic. Compared to the many lost containers and sunk ships, the amount of space hardware is vanishingly small.”\n\nHe noted that some rocket fuels are toxic but that they burn up during re-entry.\n\nKrag said that ESA was working on what he termed “design-for-demise” technology that would replace the aluminum, titanium and steel with materials that would melt during reentry.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/world/space-station-archaeology-cultural-heritage-scn", "title": "Capturing the heritage of the International Space Station before it ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe International Space Station will intentionally fall to Earth and come to rest within the depths of Point Nemo, a watery graveyard 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) north of Antarctica, in January 2031.\n\nThe space station will join the fragments of Russia’s Mir and NASA’s Skylab in the South Pacific Ocean Uninhabited Area, home to more than 263 pieces of intentionally sunk space debris.\n\nSince November 2000, the space station has functioned as an orbiting laboratory 227 nautical miles (420 kilometers) above our planet, as well as a home to continuously rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts. It has been the site of multiple firsts as astronauts have successfully sequenced DNA and feasted on crops grown in space.\n\nThe ultimate fate of the space station has been part of the plan since before the modules ever launched. But when the space station deorbits, it will be the end of an era. And part of its legacy will be preserved through space archaeology.\n\nNow that NASA has shared an updated transition plan for the space station, which currently doesn’t include returning any artifacts to be used for research or museums, the studies a team of researchers want to conduct on the floating lab takes on added significance.\n\nWhat’s more, by understanding the ways that astronauts have used the space and tools on the space station, this input could be used in the design of future spacecraft and habitats during exploration of the moon and Mars.\n\nFirst of its kind\n\nThe very first archaeological study ever performed outside of Earth was the brainchild of Justin St. P. Walsh, associate professor of art history and archaeology at Chapman University in California, and Alice Gorman, associate professor within Flinders University’s College of the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences in Australia. They began the creative process of considering the space station from an archaeological perspective in December 2015.\n\nWith the help of the ISS National Laboratory’s Center for the Advancement of Science in Space and implementation partner Axiom Space, Walsh and Gorman were finally able to see the first step of their investigation become a reality this year.\n\n“ISS is such an important site for the development of humanity living in space,” Walsh said. “If this were a site on Earth, we would do everything we could to preserve it. But that isn’t technically feasible, so the next thing archaeologists do, like when sites are going to be flooded due to the construction of a dam, for example, is document everything we can about the site, and preserve that documentation and any samples” for posterity.\n\nThe project began on the space station in January. The experiment, called the Sampling Quadrangle Assemblages Research Experiment, or SQuARE, is a simple one.\n\nArchaeologists often set up a test pit at a site of interest, dividing it into a grid of squares for excavation purposes.\n\nThe dotted yellow line outlines a sample location for the Sampling Quadrangle Assemblages Research Experiment, part of the starboard workstation in the NASA Node 2 module (Harmony) on the International Space Station, photographed January 15. International Space Station Arch/NASA\n\nHowever, it’s not possible to dig through layers of the space station – or for scientists to just zip up there for a study.\n\nAstronauts placed 3-foot (1-meter) tape squares on walls throughout the space station and are photographing them each day for 60 days to show how these areas change over time.\n\nThe findings could emulate the way layers of soil preserve different moments in time at archaeological sites.\n\nThe squares have been placed at the galley table where the crew eats, across from the latrine, a workstation and two different science stations, as well as a place chosen by the crew. The six sites capture what daily life is like in zero gravity.\n\nDocumenting a slice of life in space\n\nHeritage sites are often thought of as being places of historical importance on Earth – but they exist in space, too, Gorman said.\n\nThe Apollo landing sites on the moon are a prime example, and as we leave human and robotic footprints behind on places like Mars, those places of significance will spread.\n\n“Nobody’s collected data like this before, so we don’t have it for Mir and Skylab,” Gorman said.\n\nEuropean Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer tweeted his excitement about participating in the experiment in February.\n\n“Space archaeology with SQuARES. Using a ruler & colour chart we document the use & changes of defined areas on the #ISS to help design future spaceships & habitats,” Maurer wrote in his tweet.\n\nSpace archaeology with SQuARES ✌️ Using a ruler & colour chart we document the use & changes of defined areas on the #ISS to help design future spaceships & habitats.

When the crew, including NASA astronauts Kayla Barron, Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn and Mark Vande Hei, return to Earth this spring, the researchers will get a chance to talk to them.\n\nGorman and Walsh envision a series of six additional experiments if they get the funding.\n\nOther experiments include recording the acoustic environment of the space station and documenting the quest for privacy in a small habitat, something which could be useful as crews prepare to experience time on the much smaller Gateway that will orbit between the moon and Earth as a hub supporting lunar exploration.\n\nIn turn, the lessons that Gorman and Walsh are learning from their first experiment aboard the space station could be applied to remote sites on Earth, like the artifacts left on Mount Everest after decades of people ascending to its peak.\n\n“This might be the beginning of different kinds of archaeology that we could see in the future,” Gorman said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2024/11/24/the-international-space-station-is-limited-nasa-spacex-boeing-northrop-how-long-can-it-last/76426102007/", "title": "International Space Station aging: How long can NASA keep it afloat?", "text": "For anyone 24 years old or younger, every day of your life, there have been humans circling above our planet onboard the International Space Station. Day in and day out. Season after season. Year after year. Decade after decade.\n\nNearly a quarter century of human occupation in space, making the ISS the oldest orbiting outpost in human history.\n\nBut the ISS is showing its age, and a recent NASA Office of Inspector General report raised concerns about whether it would be safe or even affordable to operate past 2030 when plans call for it to be safely deorbited and crashed into an ocean.\n\nThere are even some concerns whether it will still be habitable for another six years.\n\nAccording to the report, titled NASA's Management of Risks to Sustaining ISS Operations through 2030, operating the ISS costs $4.1 billion annually, which is 16 percent of NASA’s budget for the past two years.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nBeyond the expense, there are other concerns. An air leak in a Russian module has been growing. Americans right now only have one U.S. spacecraft certified to carry them to and from the station. Space suits have been malfunctioning raising questions of whether repairs to the outside of the ISS could even be safely conducted. And the main international partner, Russia, has yet to commit to staying onboard through 2030.\n\nCan the ISS operate past 2030 if needed?\n\nCompleted in 2011, the ISS has been orbiting Earth since 1998. It has been continuously occupied since November 2000 − meaning there has not been a day since then when all humans have been on Earth at the same time.\n\nThe International Space Station has always been an international effort. The Russian module, Zarya, was the first module to be launched on November 20, 1998. It was followed by the launch and attaching of the American Unity module on December 6, 1998. Altogether, five nations or groups of nations participate in the ISS: Russia, America, Europe, Canada, and Japan.\n\nInitially, the space station was only supposed to last until 2015. Congress extended its operation two more times, moving it from 2020 to 2024, and then to 2030.\n\nNASA needs the ISS to continue its human presence in Earth orbit. Currently, the only other occupied space station is China's Tiangong, which is run exclusively by that country.\n\n\"The International Space Station is all about preparation ... preparation for the next big leap,\" former NASA astronaut Clayton C. Anderson told FLORIDA TODAY via X (previously Twitter).\n\n\"It is a 'learning' platform to determine how humans can adapt to the environment of outer space, critical to any endeavors we propose for the future. Keeping this platform available, as long as it remains safe, is a solid focus, and a clear example of international cooperation, another future essential.\"\n\nDuring his career as a NASA astronaut, Anderson racked up a total of 167 days in space, visiting the ISS twice − once for a five month stay in 2007 and again for a 10-day stay during a resupply mission in 2010.\n\nCurrently, there are seven people onboard the station: four American astronauts and two Russian cosmonauts. While onboard, they conduct research on areas ranging from biology to technology.\n\nBut for years now, NASA has known the ISS was entering its final stretch. SpaceX is contracted for $843 million to develop a spacecraft that will safely deorbit the station in 2031.\n\nNASA plans to use the deorbit vehicle to bring the ISS down over a remote part of Earth — in the middle of an ocean — where any bits that are not burned up during reentry do not impact humans.\n\nAdd rockets to any room: FLORIDA TODAY's 2025 Space Launch Calendar is here\n\nWhat would come after the space station?\n\nNASA is aiming to replace the ISS with one or more space stations built by private companies. Blue Origin and Sierra Space, Axiom Space, and Voyager Space alongside Airbus, have been on the task. But with five years to go, nothing is currently ready to be launched.\n\nAstronaut Michael López-Alegría told FLORIDA TODAY this week that Axiom is currently making progress with their space station module, which will attach to the ISS. López-Alegría flew to the ISS as a NASA astronaut, but after retiring from NASA, he ended up back at the ISS thanks to Axiom. López-Alegría became a consultant to Axiom Space, and has since flown to the ISS twice with the private space company, which utilizes SpaceX's Crew Dragon to send its astronaut crews to conduct research on the ISS. He commanded missions AX-1 and AX-3.\n\n\"It's an amazing place,\" said López-Alegría during a media event at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex where his Axiom flight suit was unveiled. \"It's your home, it's your bedroom, it's your kitchen, it's your gym, but most of all it's a laboratory. And we've been doing world class science on the ISS since 2001 — it's been continuously inhabited since then.\"\n\n\"Yet, it's a machine, so someday it's going to wear out,\" added López-Alegría.\n\nHe said it's unlikely governments would be willing to build another station so the future will see private space companies build space stations and sell them back as a service to NASA and other private research companies.\n\nAxiom's partner, Thales Alenia Space, is working with NASA on the design of the module before its current anticipated 2026 launch.\n\nIf a replacement outpost is not ready or if SpaceX can't deliver the deorbit vehicle for the ISS by that date, the question remains − could NASA keep the ISS going even longer?\n\nThe Inspector General report raised concerns that if NASA had to extend the ISS past 2030, it could face budget cuts, inflation, or even supply chain issues in the coming years making support for the ISS hard. International partnerships, such as Canada, Europe, and Japan, have committed to the 2030 date. Russia remains an unknown.\n\nWhen is the next Florida rocket launch? Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA rocket launch schedule from Florida\n\nAir leak on the ISS\n\nAlready, teams are struggling with maintenance issues on the outpost, which orbits at approximately 250 miles above Earth.\n\nNASA and Roscosmos have been trying to pin down the cause of continued cracks and air leaks in the Service Module Transfer Tunnel, which was reported as a top safety risk back in 2021. In April, NASA said the leak rate had increased.\n\nThere is no immediate threat to crew, the report said. Still, an air leak on a pressurized space station is a long-term safety issue. Roscosmos has expressed confidence in the ability to monitor it, and plans to simply permanently close the hatch to the Service Module if needed, but NASA has elevated the situation to a high risk.\n\nWith there's no resolution or official diagnosis of the leak as of now, closing the hatch to the Service Module when not in use has been the temporary solution. Long term, keeping this hatch closed would block the docking port located within the module, limiting cargo missions. The Inspector General report also claims that closing the hatch permanently would require more fuel to maintain the ISS's correct position in orbit.\n\nThreat of orbital debris to the ISS\n\n\"NASA considers the threat of micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD) a top risk to crew safety, the ISS structure, visiting vehicles, and sustained ISS operations,\" the Inspector General report said.\n\nOn Tuesday, an incoming piece of space junk recently prompted the International Space Station to take action to maneuver itself out of harm's way. A Russian cargo ship docked at the space station fired its thrusters for more than five minutes to \"provide an extra margin of distance\" for the hunk of debris, NASA said.\n\nLópez-Alegría, who has preformed 10 spacewalks during his time as a NASA astronaut, told FLORIDA TODAY that the evidence of micrometeoroids is noticeable outside the space station. The fact that the earliest modules of the ISS have been in orbit since 1998 and the station exists in a harsh environment is visibly apparent, he said. The ISS orbits above most of the atmosphere, in which those micrometeoroids burn up. Basically, it's unprotected from space rocks picked up by Earth's pull. Space junk, such as debris from broken satellites, can also pose a threat.\n\nTo put this in more perspective, the ISS is traveling at 17,500 mph around the Earth. Orbiting debris is traveling just as quickly.\n\nIn December 2022, orbital debris struck a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, which in turn caused a coolant leak. The leak forced the cancellation of a spacewalk which was about to start, as coolant was observed flowing out of the spacecraft, which was docked to the ISS. The two cosmonauts and NASA astronaut, Frank Rubio, were forced to wait an extra six months for a replacement Soyuz.\n\nLast February, a United States and Russian satellite came within just 10 meters of colliding with each other. The debris from an impact would have caused damage not only to other satellites, but the ISS and spacecrafts arriving and departing.\n\nThen in June, a retired Russian satellite came apart, causing the creation of hundreds of trackable pieces of debris. These large pieces of debris forced the astronauts onboard the ISS to shelter in their spacecrafts for more than an hour.\n\nThe Inspector General report states that the ISS has shields which protect it from debris three centimeters and smaller. Additional shielding could be added, but doing so would pose a technological challenge and be expensive. The report didn't offer a dollar amount.\n\nFor now, NASA depends on the U.S. Department of Defense’s Space Surveillance Network for data to track orbital objects larger than 10 centimeters in size. This data is used to assess risk and watch for possible collisions with the ISS.\n\nAnother concern: transportation to and from the ISS\n\nCurrently, NASA has only one option, the SpaceX Crew Dragon, to bring its astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Boeing's Starliner faced performance issues on its first crewed flight — thruster malfunctions and helium leaks which prompted NASA to return the spacecraft without its astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams. They had to stay on the station and join the next station crew.\n\nThe only other transportation provider is Russia's Soyuz. So if Russia doesn't commit to extending the life of the space station, that would remove one of the key transport vehicles.\n\nNASA has stated it expects Starliner to fly crew again in 2025, but that all depends on if the thruster issue and helium leaks can be resolved. While not official, it has also been reported that Boeing may back out of the space industry, seeking to sell its space interests. NASA and Boeing both declined FLORIDA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nLack of redundancy in space transport means there isn't a \"ready to launch\" vehicle in the case of an emergency, for example if a spacecraft encountered damage in orbit.\n\nAs for resupply missions, NASA utilizes SpaceX's Cargo Dragon and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus cargo spacecrafts. Should one of those spacecrafts be grounded, it could pose a serious risk to resupplying the crew.\n\nWill NASA spacesuits last?\n\nWhile the Inspector General report did not mention the issue, FLORIDA TODAY previously reported that the past two NASA spacewalks this year were canceled due to issues with the spacesuits. On June 13, a spacewalk was cancelled due to a \"discomfort issue\" before the airlock was even opened.\n\nThe following attempt on June 24 saw a water leak in the service and cooling umbilical unit on NASA astronaut Tracy C. Dyson’s spacesuit. The spacewalk was about to begin when the issue was discovered. Dyson could be heard stating that she was observing ice forming on her glove and helmet.\n\nThe water was leaking from outside her suit and freezing. While still in the airlock, it had already been unpressurized and the hatch was open. Without an atmosphere, temperatures outside the space station fluctuate from extreme highs to extreme lows.\n\nCrew-8 had no further spacewalks. A spacewalk for Crew-9 has yet to be announced.\n\nThis is not the first time a NASA spacesuit has malfunctioned during a spacewalk. Back in 2013, European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano was preforming a routine spacewalk when water started to fill his helmet. What was thought to be a leak from a drinking pouch quickly became worse, with water getting into Parmitano's eyes and nose. The spacewalk was quickly canceled, and NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy had to guide Parmitano back to the airlock to safety.\n\nThe current spacesuits being used by NASA date back from the shuttle program, which began in 1983. NASA had been working with Collins Aerospace on newer spacesuits for the ISS, however Collins dropped out of the contract on June 26. The reasoning for this change was that the suits would not be ready before 2030 when the ISS is set to be deorbited. A new suit developer was not announced.\n\nSpacesuits are essential to conduct repairs outside the ISS.\n\n\"In the long-term, NASA has committed to replacing the Station with one or more commercially owned and operated space destinations to maintain its presence and research capabilities in LEO (low Earth orbit),\" the OIG report reads, noting however that NASA needs to keep other options open, including extending the station, if needed and if deemed safe and affordable.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nSpaceX to boost NASA International Space Station\n\n“NASA contracted with SpaceX a few years ago to provide a reboost capability to the space station. As you know, the space station’s altitude slowly decays over time, due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" International Space Station Program Operations Integration Manager Bill Spetch said during a prelaunch press briefing. “To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"\n\nSpetch said NASA has used many different ways to maintain altitude in the past, with the main being the Russian segment providing propulsive assist. In the past, NASA also used the space shuttle, the European Space Agency’s ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) spacecraft, and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus cargo spacecraft.\n\nThe boost on this current mission will be provided by an independent propellant system located in the Dragon spacecraft's trunk. The adjustment of the space station's altitude is slated to begin in September with multiple boost burns planned throughout the fall season.\n\nThe Dragon spacecraft is expected to return to Earth no earlier than December.\n\nSpaceX is also contracted by NASA to safely deorbit the International Space Station after its planned 2030 retirement.\n\nWhen is the next Florida rocket launch? Is there a launch today? Upcoming NASA, SpaceX, ULA rocket launch schedule at Cape Canaveral\n\nResearch on the SpaceX CRS-33 mission\n\nCRS-33 will be carrying more than 50 different scientific studies. Some of these studies are critical for future human space exploration, such as expeditions to Mars.\n\nThis includes a study which is investigating the basic mechanisms behind bone loss in microgravity.\n\n“This research team is testing out the hypothesis that blocking a certain protein in the body that is known to promote bone loss or bone health changes may actually help reduce the overall bone loss that astronauts experience in space,” said Heidi Parris, associate program scientist for the ISS Program.\n\nIt’s not just those flying in space that these experiments help. Many studies that look into astronaut health also have impacts on Earth-based medicine.\n\n“In addition, the knowledge we gain from this study may also help us find ways to minimize bone loss in patients on Earth,” said Parris.\n\nAnother study by the European Space Agency is geared towards maintenance in space. The study, known as Metal 3D Printer, consists of 3D printing metal parts in microgravity. 3D printing parts will be vital on missions to the moon and Mars, as resupply missions will be limited.\n\n“We really have to be able to make do with whatever we have onboard already in order to make tools or spare parts,” said Parris.\n\nAccording to Parris, there will also be a study which looks into 3D bioprinting – or 3D printing an implantable medical device which supports nerve regrowth after injury by ”bridging the gab to reconnect severed nerves while also simultaneously delivering drugs that can support nerve regeneration.\"\n\nLastly, Parris mentioned a study which investigates if microgravity can improve the formation of blood vessels and capillaries in 3D printed liver tissue. Sponsored by the ISS National Laboratory, the study is by Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and developed from NASA’s Vascular Tissue Challenge.\n\nThis launch isn't the last of the resupply missions slated for the year. In September, the Russian Progress 93 mission will launch from Baikonur. This will be followed by the Northrop Grumman NG-23 Cygnus resupply mission no eailer than mid-September from Florida.\n\nWhen is the next rocket launch in Florida?\n\nThe next launch for Cape Canaveral is set for no earlier than 1:49 a.m. Wednesday, Aug. 27 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center Pad 39A.\n\nThe mission is SpaceX's next batch of Starlink internet satellites, titled Starlink 10-11.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

It serves a different purpose entirely. Axiom is less focused on building rockets than re-thinking the future of space stations.\n\nThe four crew members – three paying passengers and a former NASA astronaut there to serve as commander – taking part in the mission, dubbed Ax-1, will taxi to the ISS via SpaceX vehicles as part of the 10-day trip. Axiom has arranged with NASA for them to spend eight days aboard the orbiting laboratory managed by a team of international government-backed agencies. While on the ISS, the civilians are slated to assist with more than two dozen scientific experiments, as well as help pave the way for the development of Axiom’s plans to build the first commercial space station.\n\nAxiom, SpaceX and NASA announced Sunday evening that they are now targeting no earlier than Friday at 11:17 a.m. ET for the launch, which is set to lift off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. If the launch goes as planned on Friday, docking of the SpaceX Dragon capsule to the station is scheduled for early Saturday morning. Those interested in watching the launch can tune in via NASA and Axiom Space’s live coverage of the event on Friday morning.\n\nThe Ax-1 Crew (left to right): Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría, Mark Pathy, Michael López-Alegría and Eytan Stibbe. Courtesy SpaceX\n\nThe commander of the first-ever private astronaut mission to the ISS is Axiom’s Michael López-Alegría, a veteran Spanish-American NASA astronaut with four previous spaceflights under his belt, and who now has the professional title of Vice President of Business Development for Axiom. He will be joined by three fee-paying crewmates – Larry Connor of the United States, Eytan Stibbe of Israel and Mark Pathy of Canada – who each dished out an estimated $55 million to Axiom in order to take the journey into orbit. (Axiom did not publicly disclose the specific financial details of the trip.)\n\nHere is what you should know about the upcoming Axiom spaceflight, which comes as a handful of private companies are seeking to commercialize the space beyond our planet’s surface.\n\nWhat is Axiom Space?\n\nAxiom Space, the Houston-based company overseeing the entire mission, does not build launch vehicles or rockets like some of the other players in the emerging private spaceflight industry such as Blue Origin, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic.\n\nThe company arranges so-called “private astronaut” missions to the ISS, which includes seventeen weeks of training and custom itineraries based on the individual goals of those wealthy enough to afford the trip. Ax-1 is the company’s first of these planned trips to the ISS, and late last year NASA and Axiom announced Ax-2 is targeting to launch between fall 2022 and spring 2023. In addition to its human spaceflight services, Axiom also offers on its website opportunities for companies and individuals seeking to access space for research purposes.\n\nThe Ax-1 Crew during Zero-G flight training. Courtesy Axiom Space\n\nNASA uses the term “private astronaut missions” to refer to “missions that are privately funded, fully commercial spaceflights on a commercial launch vehicle for the purpose of enabling tourism, outreach, commercial research, and approved commercial and marketing activities on the space station.” Referring to ultra-wealthy thrill seekers with the title of “astronaut,” however, has spurred heated debates over its definition online in recent years.\n\nIn January 2020, NASA selected Axiom to provide at least one habitable commercial module to be added to the ISS’s Harmony node in 2024. Axiom said it has plans to have its module be ready to detach from the station by late 2028, and operate as the first building block of a private commercial space station.\n\nAxiom’s lofty plans to build the first private space station and pioneer the commercialization of low-Earth orbit are what it sees as setting itself apart from others in the budding private space industry. The company even touts the Ax-1 mission as “an important step toward Axiom’s goal of constructing a private space station in low-Earth orbit that can serve as a global academic and commercial hub.”\n\nBuilding a commercial destination in low-Earth orbit\n\nAxiom CEO Michael Suffredini, a 30-year veteran of NASA who served as the ISS program manager from 2005 to 2015, described Ax-1 during a pre-launch news conference last week as a “precursor mission” to the company’s plans of eventually assembling and launching its fully commercial space station in orbit.\n\nWhile Axiom is partnering with SpaceX to launch its private astronauts, “SpaceX is just a taxi,” John Logsdon, a professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs, told CNN Business of the role of Musk’s company in this Axiom mission.\n\nLogsdon, who was the founder and longtime director of GW’s Space Policy Institute, added that he sees Axiom’s inaugural private astronaut mission as “the first step in a process that could result in one or more private space stations doing a variety of things in low Earth orbit.”\n\n“We’ve had the International Space Station in orbit, with people aboard, since the year 2000,” Logsdon added. “NASA says it will de-orbit it in 2030 or so and turn over the use of low-Earth orbit to the private sector.”\n\nAx-1 Crew (left to right) Mark Pathy, Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría and Eytan Stibbe in SpaceX Crew Dragon during training. Courtesy SpaceX\n\nAxiom Space “is the first of the private sector ventures getting ready for that transition,” according to Logsdon. He noted that construction of the first Axiom space station modules are already underway abroad, and it is slated to be shipped to Houston for final assembly next year ahead of their tentative launch in 2024.\n\n“Like all entrepreneurial investments, there’s a high risk of failure, but a possibility, a very real possibility, of success – success in terms of economic payoffs from doing things in space,” Logsdon said. In February 2021, Axiom said it raised some $130 million from investors, adding that the “new financing will accelerate the growth of Axiom’s workforce and construction of its privately developed space station.”\n\nWhile private astronauts seeking to venture beyond Earth’s surface can potentially strike a launch deal directly with SpaceX – as billionaire Jared Isaacman did last year for his self-funded Inspiration4 mission – Logsdon says the purpose of Axiom’s mission is “fundamentally different than Inspiration4.”\n\nLogsdon said these trips are the first step in the process toward Axiom’s primary goal of constructing a commercial space station to replace the ISS. The Inspiration4 mission was “basically a tourist ride,” he added.\n\nWhile it will likely be years before opportunities to visit a commercial space station become available to more than just the wealthy, Logsdon notes that a private space station could provide benefits beyond vacations for the rich – especially if the ISS is retired as planned and scientists, engineers and other researchers look for alternatives.\n\nThe privatization of human spaceflight is becoming an increasingly crowded sector amid the rise of a handful of space tourism ventures. However, Axiom CEO Suffredini said during last Friday’s news conference that he thinks the company’s plan of creating the first commercial space station – and launching the first commercial module to be added onto the ISS in 2024 – gives the company a novel “business plan.”\n\n“We think it does put us in a good place relative to the competition, but we’re happy that there are others that are going to help us grow the LEO [low-earth orbit] economy along the way,” Suffredini said.\n\nLogsdon said he has been watching human spaceflight launches for decades and was at the Kennedy Space Center for the Apollo 11 launch that put the first humans on the moon back in 1969. While the private sector’s foray into spaceflight has muddled some of the initial intrigue, he said he’s still planning on tuning in for the launch.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2023/05/01/nasa-russia-canada-japan-european-space-agency-international-space-station-iss-cooperation-2028/70162815007/", "title": "Russia agrees to space station cooperation with NASA through 2028", "text": "Space is important to us and that's why we're working to bring you top coverage of the industry and Florida launches.

Still, Russia threatened to pull out of operations after 2024.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

For example, the Russian segment provides the ability to propulsively boost the station to counteract orbital decay and maintain its position some 250 miles above the Earth.\n\nBut the threat to depart early remained empty and Roscosmos has since continued discussions and joint space operations with NASA.\n\n“Extending our time aboard this amazing platform allows us to reap the benefits of more than two decades of experiments and technology demonstrations, as well as continue to materialize even greater discovery to come,\" NASA's Robyn Gatens, International Space Station director, said in a statement.\n\nFuture orbital destination options\n\nOnce the ISS is decommissioned and de-orbited in 2030, NASA still plans to maintain a human presence in low-Earth orbit by transitioning from being the gatekeeper of U.S. access to space to becoming one of many customers of space stations owned by commercial companies.\n\n\"NASA will continue to work with its partner agencies to ensure an uninterrupted presence in low-Earth orbit, as well as a safe and orderly transition from the space station to commercial platforms in the future,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nSo far, NASA has funded initial efforts with Axiom Space, Blue Origin, Nanoracks, and Northrop Grumman to develop commercial space destinations through 2025. Axiom Space anticipates the first module of its proposed Axiom Station to be ready to launch in late 2025.

Speakers emphasized Kirk’s religious faith and his contributions to the \"Make America Great Again\" movement as a leading voice for young conservative activists.\n\nChoking up at times and dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, delivered an emotional eulogy for her slain husband and received a standing ovation when she declared of his killer: \"I forgive him.\"\n\n\"I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it is what Charlie would do,\" said Erika Kirk. \"The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love.\"\n\nKirk, 31, a close ally of the Trump administration and Turning Point USA co-founder, was assassinated earlier this month while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. His death sparked an outpouring of grief and anger from the highest levels of government, including Vance, who accompanied his coffin as Air Force Two transported his body home to Arizona, where Kirk lived with his wife and two children.\n\nTrump calls out political rivals in wide-ranging eulogy\n\nTrump vacillated between eulogizing Kirk, celebrating his political achievements, and taking shots at his rivals, including former President Joe Biden. While discussing a ceremony to award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, Trump touted his recent efforts to combat crime in the nation's capital.\n\n“We stopped the crime in Washington. It took 12 days,” Trump said, adding that he plans to make similar moves in Memphis and Chicago and calling Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker \"incompetent.\"\n\nLike other speakers on Sunday, Trump condemned those who \"cheered\" Kirk’s killing, including a late-night TV host who Trump said implied that Kirk \"deserved\" what happened to him. Trump did not identify the host, but his comments came days after ABC suspended \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" over the comedian's comments about Kirk.\n\nTrump also lashed out at the \"radical left.\" He said Kirk was killed for expressing beliefs deeply held by many of those in the stadium and across the country, calling the killing “an assault on our most sacred liberties and God given rights.”\n\n\"That gun was pointed at him, but the bullet was aimed at all of us,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also repeatedly referenced the 2024 election, highlighting Kirk's role and calling out Biden by name for opposing his MAGA slogan. Trump concluded his speech by bringing Kirk’s widow, Erika, back to the stage.\n\n\"The lesson of Charlie’s life is that you should never underestimate what one person can do with a good heart, a righteous cause, a cheerful spirit, and the will to fight, fight, fight,\" Trump said.\n\n— N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nTrump calls for the death penalty\n\nTrump once again called for Kirk’s accused assassin, who has been charged with murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting, to be put to death.\n\n\"God willing, he will receive the full and ultimate punishment for his horrific crime,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that in response to Kirk's killing, the Department of Justice is also investigating \"networks of radical left maniacs\" who organize and perpetuate political violence.\n\nTrump: Kirk will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nTrump said Kirk will receive the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThe ceremony will take place in the White House, Trump confirmed.\n\nTrump says he learned of Kirk's shooting in the Oval Office\n\nTrump said he was in the Oval Office when he learned Kirk had been shot, describing the moment as a \"surreal experience.\"\n\n\"They told me in front of a group of very powerful people, I said, 'You have to leave now, right now,'\" Trump said.\n\nTrump called Kirk \"without a doubt among the most influential figures in the most important election in the history of our country.\" He said Kirk was one of the first people to speak to him about JD Vance, and the activist played a crucial role in helping him secure votes from men under 30.\n\n\"We owe Charlie a profound and eternal debt of gratitude,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president elicited some laughs from the crowd as he recalled Kirk making late-night phone calls asking Trump to speak at various events.\n\n\"I almost always went because you never wanted to let Charlie down. He worked so hard you didn’t want to let him down,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump says Kirk wanted him to 'save Chicago'\n\nWith tens of thousands of people packed into State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Trump eulogized the conservative activist, noting that Kirk \"could always draw a big crowd.\"\n\nTrump compared the crowd to \"an old-time revival.\"\n\nHe also described Kirk as a good athlete, an Eagle Scout, and a fan of Rush Limbaugh who grew up in Illinois. Trump said one of the last things he and Kirk spoke about was the city of Chicago.\n\n\"And one of the last things he said to me is 'Please, sir, save Chicago,'\" Trump said. \"We’re going to do that. We’re going to save Chicago from horrible crime.\"\n\n— Zac Anderson and N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nTrump: 'Today America’s a nation in grief'\n\nDuring the memorial, Trump declared that \"America’s a nation in grief, a nation in shock and a nation in mourning.\"\n\nTrump said Kirk was killed by \"a radicalized, cold-blooded monster\" because \"he spoke for freedom and justice.\"\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nTrump teases autism announcement\n\nLater in Kirk’s memorial, Trump said his administration would be making a big health announcement on Sept. 22, declaring: \"I think we found an answer to autism.\"\n\nTrump said it will be one of the most important news conferences of his time as president. The administration will reveal how autism \"happens, so we won’t let it happen anymore, and how to get at least somewhat better when you have it,\" Trump said.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nErika Kirk: 'Even in death, I could see the man that I love'\n\nKirk recalled arriving at a Utah hospital on the day of her husband’s death to do the \"unthinkable\" and “look directly at my husband’s murdered body.” She was shaken and felt \"a level of heartache that I didn’t even know existed.\"\n\n\"There was something else too,\" she added. \"Even in death, I could see the man that I love.”\n\nKirk detected the “faintest smile” on her husband’s lips.\n\n\"It revealed to me a great mercy from God in this tragedy,\" knowing he didn’t suffer, she said, wearing a white jacket and a diamond cross.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nErika Kirk: Marriage 'the best thing that ever happened to me'\n\nErika Kirk said her husband wrote love notes to her every Saturday, calling it \"our little secret\" to keeping their marriage strong. He ended the notes by saying: \"How can I better serve you as a husband.\"\n\n“My marriage with Charlie was the best thing that ever happened to me, and I know it was the best thing that every happened to him as well,” Kirk said. “He wanted everyone to experience that joy.”\n\nKirk said her husband was passionate about helping young men who feel lost and have no direction.\n\n“My husband, truly, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” Kirk said.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nVance calls Kirk a 'great American leader'\n\nVance described Kirk as a \"kindhearted man,\" recalling a moment when he stopped to say a prayer for a White House staffer who was struggling to balance work with fatherhood. But Vance also acknowledged Kirk’s outsized political influence, calling him a \"great American leader\" who reshaped the balance of the nation’s politics and touched millions of young people.\n\nThe vice president also criticized those who have celebrated Kirk’s death, saying he has often wished he could ask Kirk how to handle the influx of “hate.”\n\n\"For Charlie, we will rebuild this United States of America to greatness,\" Vance said. \"For Charlie, we will never shrink, we will never cower and we will never falter, even when starting down the barrel of a gun.\"\n\n— N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nVance on Kirk: We wouldn’t be here without him\n\nVice President JD Vance, who has been outspoken about Kirk’s killing, was greeted by chants of \"USA\" as he began to speak about his “dear friend.” He heralded Kirk as a “hero to the United States of America” and a “martyr for the Christian faith.”\n\n\"Our whole administration is here, not just because we loved Charlie as a friend - even though we did - but because we know we wouldn’t be here without him,\" Vance said.\n\nTrump Jr. jabs at Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump Jr. did an impersonation of his father and jabbed at Democrats Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris in his speech at Kirk’s memorial.\n\nTrump Jr. said he’s known more for his combative online presence than for being sentimental, before doing an impersonation of father telling him to tone it down. \"You’re getting a little aggressive on social media, Don. Relax,\" he said, channeling his father.\n\nTrump Jr. said he was \"devastated\" by the death of Kirk, who he described as \"like a little brother to me.\" Kirk would want to be known for his religious faith, he added.\n\n\"To say Charlie knew more about the Bible than me is an understatement, folks,\" he said. \"It’s like saying Donald Trump knows more about being president than Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris. No kidding.\"\n\nTrump Jr. delved more into politics than many of the others who spoke at the service. He criticized the media and talked about eradicating \"criminal cartels.\"\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nRFK Jr. says Kirk once asked if he was afraid of the risks of public life\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. began his remarks by talking about what he called Kirk’s two greatest passions, his Christian faith and his love of free speech. He praised Kirk for his belief that \"conservation was the only way to heal our country\" and called his friendship \"the best evidence that God loves us all.\"\n\nKennedy recalled Kirk once asking him if he was afraid of the safety risks that come with being a public figure. Kennedy said he replied that there are fates worse than death.\n\n\"Charlie died with his boots on, and he died to make sure that we didn’t have to undergo those fates that are worse than death,\" Kennedy said.\n\n— N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nTrump and Musk shake hands at Kirk memorial\n\nTrump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk were spotted speaking during Kirk's memorial in Arizona on Sunday.\n\nMusk departed the Trump administration earlier in the year following an explosive split. The appearance at the memorial appeared to show that the rift between the two had, at least temporarily, smoothed.\n\n— James Powel\n\nPete Hegseth says Kirk was engaged in a 'spiritual war'\n\nKirk was known as a political activist and often spoke about cultural issues, but he was ultimately a spiritual warrior, said Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.\n\n\"Over time, he realized, like so many of us have, that this is not a political war, it’s not even a cultural war, it’s a spiritual war,\" Hegseth said. \"Faith and family first.\"\n\nKirk waged war \"not with a weapon but with a tent, a microphone, his mind, and the truth,\" Hegseth added. \"He went into the darkest of places… he went into college campuses where they said we couldn’t go and he was the light.\"\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nMarco Rubio remembers Kirk for his 'uncanny' wisdom\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio recalled being skeptical when he first learned of Kirk’s plan to promote conservative values on college campuses. Ultimately, Rubio said Kirk proved him wrong.\n\nRubio said Kirk led his movement with \"incredible knowledge,\" recalling recent interactions with Kirk, including one in which he quoted former Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius.\n\n\"He just didn’t have knowledge, he had wisdom, an uncanny amount of wisdom for a man as young as he was,\" Rubio said. \"Wisdom that sometimes takes a lifetime to accumulate, he had it in just 31 years.\"\n\nRubio praised Kirk for actively seeking to engage those who disagreed with him on various platforms. He said the nation needs \"the ability to discuss our differences, openly, honestly, peacefully, respectfully\" in the way Kirk did.\n\n— N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nTulsi Gabbard calls Kirk a defender of free speech\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard cast Kirk as a staunch defender of free speech, which she described as \"the foundation of our democratic republic.\"\n\n\"We must protect it at all costs because without it we’ll be lost,\" Gabbard added. \"Charlie knew this. He lived it.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has sparked a debate about free speech with actions such as Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr pressuring ABC over comments by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show recently was suspended indefinitely, and suing the New York Times and other media outlets.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nTucker Carlson remembers Kirk as 'truly fearless'\n\nConservative commentator and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson shared a Biblical anecdote and spoke about Kirk’s Christian faith, calling him \"a wonderful man and a decent man.\"\n\n\"But the main thing about Charlie and his message, he was bringing the Gospel to the country,\" Carlson said. \"He was doing the thing that the people in charge hate most, which is calling for them to repent.\"\n\nCarlson recalled sharing many stages with Kirk on which they called for the election of Trump. He praised Kirk for being \"truly fearless to his last moment.\"\n\n\"He was unafraid, he was not defensive, and there was no hate in his heart,\" Carlson said.\n\n— N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nSusie Wiles says Kirk 'made the winning difference' for Trump in 2024\n\nKirk’s group, Turning Point USA, partnered with the Trump campaign during the 2024 election, providing the \"winning difference\" that helped the president carry every swing state and the popular vote, said Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles.\n\nTrump’s victory was \"powered by young people… that was Charlie’s army and he made sure they understood the stakes,\" said Wiles, who served as Trump’s campaign manager.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nStephen Miller says assassination 'immortalized Charlie Kirk'\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller pledged to continue fighting for the causes Kirk devoted his life to, casting the effort as a battle between good and evil.\n\n\"You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk? You have made him immortal. You have immortalized Charlie Kirk and now millions will carry on his legacy,\" said Miller, who handles policy and serves as a Homeland Security adviser to Trump.\n\nPreviously, Miller discussed plans to \"go after\" liberal nongovernmental organizations that they said support \"doxxing\" campaigns against conservatives, help orchestrate riots, publicize the addresses of political opponents, and promote messages intended to create violence on Sept. 15, during the episode of \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" podcast hosted by Vance.\n\nMiller has called political violence on the left a \"vast domestic terrorist movement,\" vowing the Trump administration would use \"every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government\" to \"identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy\" the networks.\n\n\"It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie’s name,\" Miller said.\n\n— Arizona Republic\n\nSergio Gor says Kirk helped stock Trump administration with ‘loyal patriots’\n\nAfter Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Kirk was deeply involved in helping him staff the administration, said Sergio Gor, the president’s nominee to be ambassador to India and a key White House figure.\n\nGor said Kirk was \"all Trump.\"\n\n\"Charlie knew the importance of hiring loyal patriots for this administration,\" he said, adding that \"Countless individuals are currently in key roles across our government because of Charlie Kirk.\"\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nKirk’s mentor shares eyewitness account of assassination\n\nAuthor Frank Turek, who served as a mentor to Kirk, described the harrowing moment the activist was shot just feet away from him.\n\n\"When that shot rang out, I took a step toward him, but his security team was on him immediately,\" said Turek.\n\nTurek said he got into an SUV with Kirk’s security team after the shooting, where they attempted to save his life. Despite their attempts to render medical aid, Turek recalled seeing the activist \"looking past me right into eternity.\"\n\n\"If it’s any consolation, I learned later that Charlie felt no pain. He died instantly, but we had to try and bring him back,\" Turek said.\n\n— N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nTrump arrives at Kirk’s memorial\n\nThe broadcast of Kirk’s memorial showed Trump watching the speakers and later waving to the crowd shortly before 1 p.m. local time. Air Force One had landed at Luke Air Force Base at 11:42 a.m., as Trump is scheduled to speak at Kirk’s memorial.\n\nMany Trump administration officials are attending Kirk’s service in Glendale, including Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nJack Posobiec says Kirk’s death will save 'western civilization'\n\nAn animated Jack Posobiec said Kirk’s death will be viewed as “the turning point” that “led to the saving of western civilization.”\n\nPosobiec, a conservative political commentator and the senior editor for Human Events, said Kirk’s death revealed “ugliness” and declared “we will overcome their evil.”\n\n“We will never, ever let the left, the media or the Democrats forget the name of Charlie Kirk,” Posobiec said.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nCongresswoman compares Kirk to George Washington, MLK Jr.\n\nRep. Ana Paulina Luna, D-Fla., said she would not have run for Congress if it weren’t for Kirk, telling the audience she decided to join Turning Point USA instead of attending medical school.\n\nShe later compared Kirk to major historical figures in American history, including former Presidents George Washington and John F. Kennedy Jr., and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThose leaders, Luna argued, \"changed the outcome of eras just as Charlie changed the trajectory of our modern fight against cultural decay and ideological tyranny.\"\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nBen Carson thanks Kirk for his 'sacrifice'\n\nDr. Ben Carson, former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, criticized a politician, whom he did not name, for reportedly calling Kirk \"ignorant\" because he did not have a college degree.\n\nCarson recalled seeing Charlie Kirk \"run circles\" around people who had higher levels of education than he did. \"I wonder if that political figure realizes that most of learning in life comes outside the classroom,\" Carson said.\n\nCarson ended his remarks by reading a passage from the Bible and thanking Kirk \"for his sacrifice, because much fruit is going to be realized.\"\n\n— N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nBenny Johnson calls Kirk 'a martyr in the true Christian tradition'\n\nConservative political commentator Benny Johnson was among a series of speakers who said Kirk was a martyr whose influence will live on.\n\n\"You cut down a martyr, his power grows,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said he was \"a degenerate loser\" who was addicted to alcohol when he met Kirk. \"I had nothing going for me,\" he said, adding: \"After 10 years working with Charlie Kirk… I have become a Christ-centered man.\"\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nCharlie Kirk podcast producer says continuing show 'excruciating'\n\nAndrew Kolvet, the executive producer of Kirk’s podcast, \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said it was “excruciating” to continue recording the show in the week after Kirk’s death and said his staff \"heroically\" carried on.\n\nKolvet remembered Kirk as a hard worker, telling the audience that the conservative activist read every single email he received from fans and often debated with his audience.\n\n\"He never forgot about you,\" Kolvet said.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nCollege president says Kirk will get an honorary degree\n\nDr. Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school in Michigan, told a brief story about how he once \"interrogated\" Kirk about his intellectual interests. He recalled asking Kirk some questions that he couldn't answer. \"If you want to grow, you have to suffer,\" Arnn said he told him, advising Kirk to study the Bible, the classics, and the founding of America.\n\nNow Kirk has suffered enough and has gone to the Lord, Arnn said. \"He deserves his reward.\"\n\nArnn announced that Hillsdale College will be awarding an honorary degree to Charlie and Erika Kirk. He said Kirk can’t be replaced.\n\n“Charlie lives on. The assassin will die,” Arnn said.\n\nKirk’s movement 'only beginning'\n\nMcCoy told the crowd in Glendale that the slain activist’s movement will only grow after his death.\n\n“Charlie was not silenced,” McCoy said. “His movement is only beginning.

Brown, who was wearing a white and gold \"47\" hat, said he traveled from Tennessee to celebrate the way Kirk spread Christianity.\n\n“He's done more to bring people to Christ than most pastors have,\" Brown said of Kirk’s influence.\n\nWhere can I watch Charlie Kirk’s memorial service?\n\nUSA TODAY will be livestreaming Charlie Kirk’s memorial service on Sunday.\n\nApart from USA TODAY, the memorial service will be carried live on networks including CBS News, CNN, Fox News, ABC News and NewsNation.

Vance has called him a “visionary” and a “luminary” who created a “whole social network for an entire generation of young people.”\n\nThe post accompanied an emotional video showing the transportation of Kirk’s casket back to Phoenix a day after he was fatally shot in Utah. Over somber music, the clip shows the late conservative activist’s widow, Erika Kirk, alongside friends and family, and images of the vice president helping carry the casket to Air Force Two.\n\n“May he eternally rest in peace, and may God watch over Erika and their beautiful children,” Vance wrote in the post.\n\nWhat to know about security for the Charlie Kirk memorial\n\nExpect the tribute service for Kirk at State Farm Stadium to have presidential-level security and perhaps concert or football-level attendance.\n\nThe Secret Service is overseeing security for the event, and officials said those who do attend should expect the rules to be similar to those for Arizona Cardinals games. A no-bag policy will be in effect. Entry will be denied to guests carrying bags.\n\nAll attendees will go through a magnetometer with their keys, phones, and other items.

Other signs featured an illustration of Kirk and the scripture, “Here I am Lord, send me.”\n\nSeats also had red rubber bracelets that read “WE ARE CHARLIE KIRK,\" a phrase that has become popular in the days since the conservative activist's murder. Tissues were distributed in the stadium, as emotions are expected to run high during the service.\n\n– Stephanie Murray, The Arizona Republic\n\nThousands lined up early for the Charlie Kirk memorial\n\nThousands of people lined up outside of State Farm Stadium for Kirk's memorial service before the sun rose Sunday morning. Many were clad in Make America Great Again hats and shirts printed with photos of Kirk.\n\nAs they waited, workers hung banners of the slain conservative commentator along the walls of the stadium. Chants of “U-S-A” erupted outside.\n\n“We just want to get in and be part of it,” said Lori Aquilone, who took an Uber at 4 a.m. from north Phoenix.

Turning Point USA is planning to seat people who don't get into the football stadium in the nearby Desert Diamond Arena.\n\nAn estimated 15,000 visitors mourned former Sen. John McCain when he lay in state at the Arizona State Capitol in 2018. The 1998 funeral of former U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Arizona, drew about 3,000 people, according to accounts from The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nWho is Erika Kirk? Charlie Kirk's wife to speak at memorial service\n\nErika Lane Kirk, 36, grew up in metro Phoenix and regularly appeared by her husband's side as he helmed Turning Point USA.

She received her Juris Master's from Liberty University School of Law in 2019 and says on her website that she is pursuing a doctorate in biblical studies.\n\nShe is the CEO and founder of a nonprofit, Everyday Heroes Like You, a faith-based clothing brand, and a ministry project called BIBLEin365 that her bio says \"seeks to help individuals engage with the scriptures daily.\"\n\nShe's also the host of the \"Midweek Rise Up\" podcast, which she describes as a \"devotional series focused on Biblical leadership and empowering others to lead with integrity and purpose.\" In her podcast and as a regular feature beside her husband, Erika Kirk has publicly championed the same political and biblical views as her husband, focusing specifically on young women.\n\nContributing: Amaris Encinas and Natalie Neysa Alund, USA TODAY; Arizona Republic", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/09/21/charlie-kirk-service-state-farm-stadium-crowds/86228387007/", "title": "Huge crowd flocks to Kirk service in Glendale's State Farm Stadium", "text": "Thousands of people clad in red, white and blue waited up to six hours, most of it in the predawn murk, to get into State Farm Stadium to watch the memorial for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. By the time the service began, they had filled the 64,000-seat stadium and nearly filled the overflow arena. Outside the arena, people packed an outdoor viewing area by the thousands.\n\nSome had been there 17 hours by the time the service ended just after 4:00 p.m.\n\nGlendale police estimated the number of attendees as high as 100,000. The stadium held about 70,000, the overflow site held about 10,000, and another 10,000 were estimated to be in and around the Westgate area, according to Bryan Hoskin, a spokesperson with the department.\n\nThey came with a flood of patriotism and faith. Many who arrived early said they wanted to celebrate Kirk's messages of freedom and family, as well as his Christian beliefs. Others came to honor his political legacy.\n\nBy the time President Donald Trump closed his remarks and ended the memorial with a hug for Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, many attendees were exhausted. Thousands began leaving midway through Trump's 40-minute address. The rest remained until the end, but said they were too tired to share their reflections after the five-hour event.\n\nThose who did said they emerged feeling optimistic about the future of the Christian faith and conservative beliefs.\n\nFor the Sedona-based Aker family, the highlights were seeing a living president and Erika Kirk’s message to forgive her husband’s assassin, the most dramatic moment of the occasion.\n\n“Literally within two weeks and she's already able to forgive and I just feel that the uplifting of the heart and soul is number one,” said Sydney Aker.“I'm glad we were able to bring the kids to it. Yeah, it's definitely a good experience for them to have,” said Dylan Aker.The couple said they were inspired by Kirk’s strong family beliefs to grow their three-child family. “We’ve decided we’re going to have three more children,” said Dylan. “We’re going to name one of them Charlie.”\n\nThousands flood the gates, as concerns about security rise\n\nSome people, dressed in their \"Sunday Best\" as requested by Turning Point, lined up as early as 2 a.m.\n\nGates opened at least half an hour early, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, although organizers at Turning Point USA said doors opened a full hour before they were scheduled to open.\n\nThree hours later, and an hour before the event began, organizers closed the gates and ushered people to Desert Diamond Arena, the overflow venue across the street.\n\nAs crowds filtered into the stadium, some voiced concerns about the handling of security outside, while medical teams treated more than two dozen people with minor medical problems, transporting \"a few\" to nearby hospitals. Meanwhile, a small protest took place east of the stadium, in a designated area.\n\nThere were a few security guards to direct the crowd at one of the two security checkpoint areas for stadium entry. One attendee grabbed a rope that had fallen and started forming a line from the mass that had gathered. Another person began directing people to the back of the line.\n\nThe other checkpoint area seemed to have more security guards directing the crowd into easily discernible lines with megaphones.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Transportation reported thick traffic on all the main streets surrounding the stadium early in the morning. By mid-morning, on and off ramps were closed on an eight-mile stretch of Loop 101.\n\nNone of that deterred Kirk's supporters, eager to pay tribute to the slain conservative activist.\n\n“Ironically, being named Turning Point, that Charlie named his organization, I think we will look back and see this as a turning point in history,” said Bruce Betz, 61, of San Diego. “I think many conservatives, now, realize it’s time to peacefully stand up against 'radical left-wing ideology.'”\n\nMany inside State Farm Stadium wore a white T-shirt with “FREEDOM” written across the chest, like that Kirk wore when he was killed.\n\nAvondale resident Auchie Espinoza, 40, makes T-shirts for a living and printed his own, and said, \"Charlie got shot for his First Amendment right, freedom of speech, and it’s just so chilling because the very word on his shirt said freedom.”\n\nBy about 7:30 a.m. on Sept. 21, a sea of red, white and blue, topped with dots of white and red, flooded the entrance to the home of the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nThe crowd filled Westgate Plaza in Glendale hours before the doors to the neighboring stadium opened. The line snaked at least a half mile through Westgate and across north 95th Avenue to the west and north 93rd Avenue to the east. And that was only one of the lines.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Transportation reported thick traffic on all the main streets surrounding the stadium early in the morning. By mid-morning, on and off ramps were closed on an eight-mile stretch of Loop 101.\n\nAttendees praise Kirk's dedication to faith and family\n\nNearly every other person carried an American flag. Heads were adorned with red “Make America Great Again” hats. Shirts read “Freedom,” “I am Charlie Kirk,” and “This is the Turning Point.”\n\nThe Pino family arrived at 4:30 a.m. and said it was important for them to have family-focused role models for their daughters, 6 and 7.\n\n“We really love everything he stands for,” Jesus Pino said. “I think the biggest thing we got from him was that he believed in family, he believed in marriage.”\n\nHal Brown waited on the east side of the stadium, where thousands lined up to enter.\n\n\"I think Charlie was probably the single biggest force of bringing people to Christ, especially young people,\" said Brown, who traveled to the memorial from Tennessee.\n\nWearing a white and gold \"47\" hat, Brown noted Kirk's legacy may be remembered as the founder of Turning Point USA, but believed Kirk should be honored for spreading Christianity.\n\n\"He's done more to bring people to Christ than most pastors have,\" Brown said.\n\nTed Burke, a Glendale resident, was selling stickers from his motorized scooter outside the stadium since 4:30 a.m. to help pay his bills and spread his self-described love of Kirk.\n\n“People are more anxious to get inside than anything else,” Burke said, noting his limited sales. Burke said he most valued Kirk’s ability to debate people who disagreed with the conservative activist\n\n“He was talking to people… having discourse that was hospitable, not violent, it was all just hearing out other people's viewpoints and not agreeing to disagree,\" he said. \"Which is a beautiful thing.”\n\nAll morning, security was tight, heightened by the arrest at the stadium of a man with a gun the day before. A spokesperson for Turning Point later said the man was performing security for someone attending the memorial. He was released.\n\nA mix of state troopers, FBI, Secret Service and local police patrolled the parking lots. No bags were allowed inside, even clear ones. But mass confusion permeated the crowd as the line to get inside halted around 8:15 a.m.\n\nBy 10:30 a.m., medics treated about 30 people for exhaustion, dehydration and breathing problems, according to John Chester with the Glendale Fire Department.\n\n\"A few people\" were transported to the hospital, but most were evaluated on site, and none of the cases were critical, he said.\n\nThe temperature had reached 91 by 10 a.m., and people were sitting down and fanning their neighbors. Attendees who were going into the stadium were allowed one clear 16-ounce bottle of water.\n\nCrowds had been building all morning.\n\n“We just want to get in and be part of it,” said Lori Aquilone, who took an Uber at 4 a.m. from north Phoenix. She said she arrived between 4:30 and 5 a.m.\n\n“Already, there were massive crowds,” she said. “There was a crowd moving, but there was no one saying which way to go.”\n\nThe crowd periodically and triumphantly cheered as they waited in line. Chants of “U-S-A” erupted around 7:45 am at the east entrance.\n\nLockwood Smith, 78, made the trip from a small town north of Austin, Texas, and was shut out of both venues, but said it was a testament to Kirk’s impact.\n\n“That in itself is a statement about who Charlie was and that effect isn’t over,” Smith said.\n\nSmith said he sees Kirk’s death as a rallying point for Christians, noting, \"Just like with the crucifixion of Jesus, he had enemies who didn’t like what he was saying. They found an excuse to kill him.”\n\nAttendees who didn’t make it into either the stadium or Desert Diamond Arena were able to watch the memorial on a tractor-trailer modified with a large TV screen.\n\nProtestors oppose war in Gaza, religion, politics\n\nNot everybody shared the sentiment of those in attendance. About a dozen protesters gathered east of the stadium in an area set aside for them, even though progressives earlier in the week said they would stay away, claiming it would be \"crass\" to protest at a memorial.\n\nAmongst the largest groups gathered were members of the Westboro Baptist Church, a hate group according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, who traveled from Kansas to protest.\n\nThe church famously protests celebrations of lives and funerals. Esther Griffin said those in her church took a 3 a.m. flight into Phoenix to protest the event.\n\nAnother gathering represented pro-Palestinian demonstrators, which included both the flag of Israel and the U.S. flag with bloodied handprints.\n\n“This is the biggest audience of like people who thought, like him (Kirk), with misogynistic, supremacist beliefs,\" said Deb Scott, from Mesa.\n\nSamayyah Dawud, 40, a Phoenix native and local activist, said she attended to protest Kirk’s message.\n\n“Charlie Kirk spread a lot of xenophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, racism. All these things that are unacceptable in our society,” Dawud said.\n\nNoah-James Markham, 27, said he came to the memorial to pay respects to Kirk, despite disagreeing with him politically. “I was indoctrinated into MAGA for a moment in my life, but luckily I found my way out,” he said. “I don’t agree with Kirk at all, but I still wanted to pay my respects.”\n\nWhen he wasn’t able to get inside because of the crowds, Markham joined protesters, adding his LGBTQ flag alongside others. “I really wanted to protest because my grandfather fought in World War II, and one of my great-grandfather’s brothers died in an airplane crash fighting for our freedom,” he said.\n\nHe didn’t agree with the strong conservative Christian faith that bled between politics and religion, preferring they remain separate.\n\nAfter about an hour, the group dwindled to about half a dozen.\n\nMeanwhile, people taking their seats inside State Farm Stadium found them lined with signs and tissues for attendees.\n\nSome signs had a photo of Kirk with the words “NEVER SURRENDER REMEMBER CHARLIE KIRK” and the Turning Point logo. Other signs featured an illustration of Kirk and the scripture “Here I am, Lord, send me.” Seats also had red rubber bracelets that read “WE ARE CHARLIE KIRK.”\n\nReporter Stephanie Murray contributed to this report.\n\nLauren De Young covers Tempe, Chandler, Maricopa County and transportation for The Republic.

Speakers, which also included high-ranking Trump administration officials and other conservative leaders, highlighted the 31-year-old's legacy as an influential voice in young conservatism.\n\nCharlie Kirk, who was a close political ally of the Trump administration, was assassinated during a Turning Point USA event on the campus of Utah Valley University. Mourners cheered and applauded Erika Kirk, who said during her eulogy that she forgives the man accused of killing her husband.\n\n\"I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it is what Charlie would do,” Erika Kirk said. “The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love.”\n\nClosing out the service, Trump said in his speech that, \"today America’s a nation in grief, a nation in shock and a nation in mourning.” The president called Charlie Kirk, “without a doubt, among the most influential figures in the most important election in the history of our country.\"\n\nThe rest of his speech moved between eulogizing Kirk, celebrating his political achievements, and taking shots at his rivals.

Some in the London crowd wore MAGA hats and carried American flags.\n\nMultiple people fired after comments, posts\n\nPublic figures, academics and everyday business owners have faced consequences for comments and social media posts that contained celebrations or other musings that attracted swift condemnation after Kirk's killing.

He is being held without bail. Court documents confirm Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions on his record.\n\n-Nick Penzenstadler\n\nWhat we know about Charlie Kirk's suspected killer\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters that Robinson was taken into custody after a family member contacted a family friend, who informed authorities that Robinson had \"confessed to them or implied that he committed the incident.\"\n\nInvestigators used images and video from the scene, interviews with family members and messages to identify him, Cox said. Family members \"did the right thing,\" he said, adding that family and a friend \"helped deliver\" Robinson into custody.\n\nRobinson was remembered by former classmates and neighbors and on his mother's Facebook page as a high-achieving student and \"quiet.\" He had become more political recently, a family member told investigators, according to Cox. He briefly attended college for a semester and was enrolled at the time of the shooting in an electrical apprenticeship program. Neighbors said his family were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose members are known as Mormons.\n\nRead more.\n\nWhat was written on the bullets?\n\nInvestigators recovered bullet casings with messages written on them and also used messages they believe were sent to a roommate by Robinson to piece together more of the crime.\n\nThe single fired casing read, “Notices, Bulges, OwO What’s This?” Cox said. The phrase references an internet meme tied to animated videos and furry culture. One of the unfired casings said, according to Cox: “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.” The lyrics reference the anthem of the antifascist Italian resistance during World War II.\n\nCox said that another read, “Hey fascist! Catch!” The third unfired casing, according to Cox, said, “If you’re reading this, you’re gay LMAO.”\n\nA rifle was found wrapped in a towel discarded in a wooded area off campus, authorities have said. Messages shown to them by a roommate included references to a rifle that needed to be retrieved, wrapped in a towel. The messages also referenced engraving bullets, Cox said.\n\nContributing: N'dea Yancey-Bragg, Thao Nguyen, Davis Winkie, Christopher Cann, Nick Penzenstadler, Aysha Bagchi, Dinah Voyles Pulver, Josh Meyer, Will Carless, David DeMille, Michael Loria and Brandon Loomis; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/09/20/looking-back-at-arizona-most-memorable-political-funerals/86231238007/", "title": "Arizona has seen major political memorial services.

But it is not the first major political funeral or memorial service in the state to attract national political heavyweights or media attention.\n\nHere's a look back at some of Arizona's highest-profile political memorial services and funerals.\n\nBarry Goldwater: June 3, 1998\n\nFormer Sen. Barry Goldwater's funeral at Arizona State University's Gammage Auditorium perhaps was the closest precursor to the Kirk memorial that is set for Sept. 21.\n\nGoldwater was one of the founders of modern conservatism and the 1964 GOP White House nominee. He served five terms as a senator from Arizona, from 1953 to 1965 and from 1969 to 1987. He also was the author, with ghostwriter L. Brent Bozell Jr., of the 1960 book \"The Conscience of a Conservative,\" a seminal conservative tract that was highly influential on the emerging movement.\n\nHe died May 29, 1998, at age 89, and his June 3, 1998, service attracted a galaxy of Republican stars. The Arizona Republic reported the Goldwater crowd at more than 3,000 mourners. They included former first lady Nancy Reagan, then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former senator and 1996 presidential candidate Bob Dole, 30 sitting U.S. senators and numerous other dignitaries, many of whom cited the impact of \"The Conscience of a Conservative\" and his doomed 1964 run against President Lyndon Johnson on their own political careers.\n\nRobert Tree Cody, a Native American flutist, performed and delivered a prayer. A somber Air Force flyover featured F-16s from the 62nd Fighter Squadron in the \"Missing Man\" formation.\n\n''There are two Arizonans who are literally known throughout this planet. One is Geronimo, and the other is Barry Goldwater,'' said then-Interior Secretary and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat who represented then-President Bill Clinton's administration at the Goldwater service.\n\nCarl Hayden: Jan. 29, 1972\n\nFormer Sen. Carl Hayden, D-Arizona, served 56 years — 20,773 days — in Congress, including a then-unprecedented seven terms in the Senate. His record as the longest-serving member of Congress stood for years; the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-West Virginia, finally broke it in 2009.\n\nHayden was Arizona's first U.S. representative, joining Congress on Feb. 19, 1912. He moved to the Senate in 1927, eventually becoming chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, and served until his Jan. 3, 1969, retirement at age 91. As Senate president pro tempore, he was third in line to the presidency.\n\nA Jan. 29, 1972, funeral, also at ASU Gammage, followed his Jan. 25, 1972, death in Mesa at 94. Hayden's body also had lain in state at the Arizona Capitol rotunda.\n\nThe funeral was notable for bringing the two fierce combatants of the 1964 presidential race together on stage for the final time. Johnson, the by-then former president, and Goldwater, who served in the Senate alongside Hayden from 1953 to 1965, delivered eulogies during the 50-minute service.\n\n\"He stood tall and straight before many generations of his fellow men,\" Johnson said. \"Now that he is gone, he leaves a lonesome spot against the sky.\"\n\nThe remembrance of Hayden would mark one of Johnson's final public appearances. The 36th president would die about a year later on Jan. 22, 1973.\n\nJohn McCain: Aug. 30, 2018\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, in 1986 won the Senate seat vacated by the retiring Goldwater. He was reelected five times in 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010 and 2016 before dying in office on Aug. 25, 2018.\n\nMcCain was a former Navy aviator who was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam from 1967 to 1973. He would make two unsuccessful runs for president. In 2000, he came up short against Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, in the GOP primaries. He would secure the Republican Party's 2008 nomination but lost the general election to President Barack Obama.\n\nMemorial services for McCain included his body lying in state at both the Arizona Capitol and U.S. Capitol rotundas and an event at Washington National Cathedral that featured speakers such as former Presidents Bush and Obama and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Another former president, Bill Clinton, didn't talk but was in attendance with other big names such as comedian Jay Leno and actor Warren Beatty.\n\nIn Phoenix, a more Arizona-oriented memorial service was held Aug. 30, 2018, at North Phoenix Baptist Church at Central Avenue and Bethany Home Road.\n\nThe local memorial service was headlined by then-former Vice President Joe Biden, who would become president by defeating Trump in the 2020 election. Biden, a former senator from Delaware, served with McCain for years on Capitol Hill and forged a friendship that even withstood the heated 2008 White House race that pitted Obama and him against the GOP ticket of McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.\n\n\"Things have changed so much in America, they look at him as if John came from another age because he lived by a different code, an ancient, antiquated code where honor, courage, character, integrity, duty mattered,\" Biden said in his eulogy.\n\n\"The truth is John's code was ageless, is ageless. It wasn't about politics with John. You could disagree on substance. It was about the underlying values that animated everything John did,\" Biden said.\n\nTwenty-four U.S. senators and more than 3,000 other mourners attended the McCain service at North Phoenix Baptist Church.\n\nSandra Day O'Connor: Dec. 22, 2023\n\nFormer Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to sit on the nation's high court, was remembered Dec. 22, 2023, with an invitation-only memorial service at the Madison Center for the Arts in Phoenix.\n\nO'Connor, 93, a former Arizona Senate Republican leader whom President Ronald Reagan nominated for the Supreme Court in 1981, died Dec. 1, 2023, in Phoenix. She had retired from the court in 2006.\n\nPrior to the Arizona event, O'Connor's body had lain in repose at the Supreme Court, and then-President Biden and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts honored her at Washington National Cathedral.\n\nIn Phoenix, former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy talked about his and his wife's long friendship with O'Connor.\n\n“Friendships created a splendid life for Sandra, and she wanted the same for us,” Kennedy said. “The O’Connors' friendship with us was the rock upon which we built our lives in Washington.”\n\nOthers in attendance included former Vice President Dan Quayle; former Ambassador Cindy McCain, John McCain's widow; Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs; and former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer.\n\nJack Williams: Sept. 4, 1998\n\nFormer Arizona Gov. John R. \"Jack\" Williams never had the national profile of Hayden, Goldwater, McCain or O'Connor but was a well-known figure in the state for years.\n\nA Republican, Williams had the distinction of being the last Arizona governor to serve a two-year term and the first governor to serve a four-year one. Voters in 1968 passed a referendum increasing the terms of governor and other statewide offices from two to four years. Williams was elected to two-year terms in 1966 and 1968 and a four-year one in 1970. While governor, Williams oversaw a massive reorganization and modernization of state government. He also faced a recall effort from organized labor but was out of office by the time a legal case over petitition signatures was resolved.\n\nHe had previously served as Phoenix mayor from 1956 to 1960, but many in Phoenix knew him best as a longtime radio personality and program director at KOY (550 AM). Among the talent he worked with at the station was Steve Allen, the future television comedian and \"Tonight\" show host.\n\nWilliams' signature catchphrase on KOY was: \"It's a beautiful day in Arizona. Leave us all enjoy it.\"\n\nWilliams died Aug. 24, 1998. His memorial service at All Saints' Episcopal Church, 6300 N. Central Ave., Phoenix, was not as large an affair as some of the other Arizona events, but it did attract some big names, notably O'Connor, whose 1969 to 1975 time in the Arizona Legislature overlapped with Williams' tenure as governor.\n\nRaul Castro: May 16, 2015\n\nRaul Castro was Arizona's first and only Latino governor and a U.S. diplomat under two presidents.\n\nCastro, who died April 10, 2015, at 98, served as Johnson's U.S. ambassador to El Salvador from 1964 to 1968 and as Johnson's ambassador to Bolivia from 1968 to 1969.\n\nA Democrat, he lost his 1970 bid for governor to Williams but was elected to the office in 1974. He would serve until 1977, when he resigned to become President Jimmy Carter's ambassador to Argentina.\n\n\"Raul Castro epitomized the triumph of the human spirit,\" Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said during a May 16, 2015, ceremony honoring Castro at the Arizona Capitol. \"He was the American dream; what others saw as adversity, he saw as opportunity.\"\n\nA memorial Mass had been held May 15, 2015, at St. Augustine Cathedral in Tucson. Castro's ashes were interred in Sedona.\n\nDan Nowicki is The Arizona Republic's national politics editor. As a reporter, he covered the Goldwater, Williams and McCain memorial services.

That means most attending the event will have no option but to walk, perhaps from Desert Diamond Casino 2 miles north of the stadium, Santiago said.\n\nHighways were not expected to be closed, but final traffic management plans were not yet available.\n\nStadium officials, following rules from the U.S. Secret Service, said no one was permitted to bring a bag of any kind to the event.\n\nPhones were still permitted, along with one 16-ounce clear bottle of water.\n\nConcessions inside the stadium will be open, Santiago said.\n\nGetting inside the free tribute will be a presidential-level security matter. For those wanting to attend, police urged them to arrive early, expect slow lines and be patient.\n\nLimited stadium parking options open at 7 a.m. the day of the event, and the doors at the stadium won’t open until 8 a.m., said Santiago.

Through his influence, Kirk was known for injecting his hyper-conservative values into young Americans across the country.\n\nFor some students at Oklahoma universities, the fact that Kirk was killed on a college campus carried an extra weight.\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Blake Swenson, a 21-year-old junior at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. \"Charlie stood up for his faith, and there's nothing more important than that.\"\n\nSwenson sat on a bench near a mini memorial for Kirk set up next to a fountain in front of the Edmon Low Library. At the center of the memorial was a photo of Kirk with his wife and two children, along with a sign that read, \"Left or right, a father, son, husband/friend is dead.\"\n\nKirk became a national figure as the co-founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that pushes Christian conservative politics on high school and college campuses. He was a close political ally of President Donald Trump, recognized for his ability to package party politics in a way that appealed to younger audiences. He was known for encouraging traditional gender roles, touting anti-LGBTQ+ views of marriage and making provocative statements about race.\n\nHis campus events routinely turned into debates with people who disagreed with his political takes. Still, Kirk attracted a massive following, and Trump and other Republican leaders credited him with inspiring a new generation of conservative voters.\n\n'He is the reason why I hold all of the believes that I believe'\n\nAaron Newman, a marketing student at OU, said during the candlelight vigil on the school's campus that he had probably watched “about 1,000 hours of Charlie Kirk” since 2022. He described Kirk’s death as “probably the most heartbreaking and tragic death” in the country’s recent history.\n\n“He is the reason why I hold all of the beliefs that I believe,” Newman said. “Words can’t truly describe how horrible of an event this is. Charlie was a patriot, he was an American hero, and I believe that he would have been president of the United States one day.”\n\nJosh Michael, a 21-year-old student at OSU, told The Oklahoman he stood for four hours to listen to Kirk speak on campus five months ago. Kirk spoke there in April during his “The American Comeback” tour, which hosted free events across the nation.\n\nIt was at a similar event on Wednesday at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah where Kirk was shot and killed.\n\n\"That's definitely something that could have very possibly happened here, which obviously, praise God that it didn't,\" Michael said. \"You've definitely got to keep your head on a swivel. Be aware of your surroundings.\"\n\nMichael's fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, hung a banner outside its house reading, \"Pray for the Kirks.\"\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, authorities were still searching for the shooter who killed Kirk. Photos of a person of interest were also released by the FBI on Thursday.\n\nTrump said Thursday that he would award Kirk a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award the U.S. bestows to civilians.\n\n“We miss him greatly, yet I have no doubt that Charlie’s voice and the courage he put into the hearts of countless people, especially young people, will live on,” Trump said during a ceremony marking the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nBehind OSU's library, hundreds of small American flags were planted in the ground in recognition of 9/11. A few students representing Young Americans for Freedom at OSU were sitting at a table near the flags.\n\nThomas Hatfield, an OSU junior and president of the conservative student organization, said it sickens him to have to discuss the killing of Kirk on the anniversary of 9/11.\n\n\"It's a shame that one person decided that murdering somebody over their political beliefs was more important than bringing people together and understanding each other's differences,\" Hatfield, 20, said.\n\nKirk was often labeled as divisive, racist and at times hate-stoking by critics. One of his most controversial comments was in 2024 when he said that he might assume a Black airline pilot is less qualified than a White pilot because of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nBut many students said Kirk's messaging — and the way he tailored it to young crowds on social media and in person — resonated with them.\n\nAt the OU vigil, junior Elizabeth Ardizzone, 20, described herself as a proud Republican Jew from New York. She said that while attending high school on the East Coast, she was always told that she would be villainized if she spoke up for both her beliefs.\n\n“But watching Charlie Kirk and hearing the way he spoke, the way that his mind worked, was just amazing to me,” Ardizzone said. “I did not understand how much information someone like him could have in his head and just be able to articulate it so well — and so respectfully, too. He changed so many people’s opinions on even the most minute things.”\n\nGary Barksdale, an OU math professor and faculty adviser to the Turning Point chapter, called for the students at the OU vigil to hold onto Kirk's memory.\n\n\"Charlie was impactful to me in such a way because he let me know that the fire of patriotic devotion is in the heart of our youth,\" Barksdale said.\n\nKalib Magana, president of the OU chapter for Turning Point USA, said he was in disbelief when he heard Kirk was killed.\n\nMagana, who said he had met and gotten to know Kirk personally, remembered him as a \"respectful and caring\" person who was passionate about his personal beliefs, his Christian faith and his family.\n\n\"I guess the only way to really move on from this is, for us as patriots, for us as the youth, to carry on what Charlie Kirk would've wanted us to do,\" Magana said. \"Right now, he would want us to continue on fighting for our country, doing what's right, speaking the Word of God, to ensure that our country lives on.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/12"}]}

It had fewer than 2700. Its fighter pilot shortage grew by 200 career officers in the past year alone.\n\n“Within our pilot crisis we have multiple crises,” said Brig. Gen. Michael Koscheski, director of the Air Force Aircrew Crisis Task Force which was established earlier this year to recommend actions to address aircrew shortages across active duty, Guard and Reserve forces.\n\n“We are concerned that the fighter pilot shortage is the canary in the coal mine,” Koscheski said. “We’re worried about a mobility pilot shortage with the airline hiring and the draw it has.” Shortage of instructor pilots is another concern.\n\nA majority of the 23,000 pilots Air Force needs for its total force are flying air mobility missions in transports and tankers. These pilots, when not flying, are “carrying a disproportionate load” of aviation staff assignments and training billets that fighter pilots can’t fill given their own acute shortage, Koscheski said.\n\nAviation community managers are used to seeing pilot retention issues rise and fall based on various factors including hires by airlines, pace of military operations or the relative pull of aviation bonuses. But current pilot shortages for Air Force are acute and expected to grow.\n\nA recent Congressional Research Service report said the sharp rise in airline hires reflects industry expansion to meet passenger demand. Fleets of commercial aircraft are expected to double in size over the next 20 years. In the past three years, major air carriers have been forced to raise pilot salaries by 20 percent to fill their cockpits. Meanwhile, a large percentage of airline pilots, possibly 40 percent, will reach mandatory retirement age of 65 in the next 10 years.\n\nAnother factor is a 2010 law that toughened hiring standards for airlines and put a premium on the experience of military pilots. By the time they complete their initial 10-year service obligation out of flight school, military pilots typically have the 1500 flight hours to qualify for an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate.\n\n“This is a unique period because [multiple] things have happened, all about the same time,” said Koscheski. “This also is a long-term problem, really a national pilot crisis. Airlines, especially regionals, are running short of pilots as well.”\n\nOther factors drive Air Force pilot attrition, however. In exit surveys, pilots are citing cultural issues that affect their quality of life and their service time including “dissatisfaction with excessive duties unrelated to flying and inability to maintain work-life balance,” said CRS in its report.\n\nThe task force has proposed reducing administrative requirements on aircrews, reducing requirements for fighter pilots to fill 365-day deployments, reducing off-station exercises, cutting ancillary training and hiring contractors to handle some administrative duties. Air Force also looks to increase training capacity with new squadrons, add incentives for instructor duty and is engaging with industry on cooperative solutions to mutual pilot shortages, the CRS said.\n\nAt a State of the Air Force press briefing last week, Gen. David Goldfein, Air Force Chief of Staff, said his service wants to retain every pilot it can as it builds capacity to produce more. The nation overall, he said, doesn’t produce enough aviators to meet demands of military, business and commercial aviation. The military, therefore, intends to work with industry to solve the crisis, he said.\n\nThe long-term fix, said Koscheski, “is to grow our way out of this. And so, it's going to take a while to get in place what we need to start producing more pilots.”\n\nThat effort is made more difficult by Congress failing routinely to pass stable, predictable defense budgets on time, forcing the services to operate at least through the first three months of every fiscal year under a “continuing budget resolution” which freezes program spending at previous-year levels.\n\nLast year, Congress did increase peak aviation incentive pay (flight pay) payable after 14 years of service from $840 a month to $1000. It also raised the ceiling on pilot retention bonuses, from $25,000 a year to $35,000. The services vary actual bonuses based on need, trying to keep enough pilots with experience for every type of platform. Recently, the Air Force has been fallen woefully short.\n\nPilots are offered bonuses after completing their initial 10-year commitments. They take it or they leave active duty.\n\n“You’re sitting at the 11- or 12-year point of your career. If you sign a five-year or longer bonus, you’re essentially committing until retirement” at 20 or more years, Koscheski said.\n\nIn fiscal 2013, every Air Force pilot community exceeded or came close to meeting the target of a 65 percent bonus take rate. Bomber pilots had an 81-percent take rate, rescue pilots 94 percent and fighter pilots 63 percent.\n\nBy fiscal 2017, however, Air Force rescue pilots alone surpassed the target. Only 35 percent of fighter pilots, 44 percent of air mobility pilots and 46 percent of bomber pilots opted to remain on active duty.\n\nPart of the problem is Air Force got smaller yet missions and operational tempo haven’t eased, Koscheski said. With fewer aircraft, deployments are more frequent and pilots spend more time away from families. Yet when pilots come home, they find the flying hours they crave cut due to tighter budgets and maintenance challenges. Not until squadrons begin pre-deployment training to restore their readiness are pilots satisfied again with their cockpit time.\n\n“It’s multiple compounding problems that are starting to snowball here,” Koscheski said.\n\nPilots hired by airlines soon have compensation packages that far exceed what the military could offer. Aviators also know that the sooner they accept industry jobs, the sooner they set their seniority number for the airlines.\n\n“They know that thousands more pilots will be in the pipeline behind them, which is going to directly relate to their quality of life in terms of schedules and aircraft they fly. It’s all based on seniority in the airline industry,” said Koscheski.\n\n“We’re emphasizing the value proposition in the Air Force,” he said. “Money is a factor but it’s not the factor, because people join to do amazing things, work with amazing people and with the world’s greatest technology, and live a life that matters.…We cornered the market on that. And we’re trying to balance that with what’s the right amount of financial compensation.”\n\nThe defense authorization bill for fiscal 2018 requires a U.S. Comptroller General report on the severity of the national pilot shortage by April 30, to include how airline compensation is impacting military pilot retention; the wisdom of requiring the services to make a business case for raising pilot bonuses above $35,000, and the adequacy of Air Force efforts to improve non-monetary incentives to retain more pilots.\n\nTo comment, write Military Update, P.O.

But pilots can fly with high blood pressure that is treated with medication and with coronary artery disease that is closely monitored.\n\nPilots rarely die during flights.

About 3,332 airports are eligible for the program's funding.\n\nMcNamee was in Washington to testify before the House Transportation subcommittee on aviation, along with airport directors from Dallas, Pittsburgh and Asheville, North Carolina, all of whom endorsed higher levels of funding for airport maintenance. The subcommittee is considering a bill to reauthorize Federal Aviation Administration programs.\n\nMcNamee also endorsed bipartisan support for lifting the personal facility charge cap to pay for needed capital projects. The fee that generates revenue for airport capital projects has not been adjusted in 17 years, he noted.\n\nUnder questioning by Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Westlake Village, McNamee also discussed the airports’ experience using unmanned aircraft systems for perimeter security and facility inspections and said Ventura County hopes to be a model for the rest of the country on how to safely integrate and operate small drone aircraft near airports.\n\nUnited Express terminated flights between Oxnard and Los Angeles International Airport in June 2010, and the airport now operates as a general aviation facility, like the Camarillo Airport. About a third of the passengers on the United Express flights had been Navy personnel. When fares became prohibitive, their numbers fell until the flights were no longer viable.\n\nMcNamee said the FAA’s Small Community Air Service Development Program, aimed at helping smaller markets retain commercial flights, was authorized to spend $35 million a year but has been funded by Congress at just $6 million since 2012.\n\n“Even with the promise of a Small Community Air Service grant, restoring commercial air service has eluded our community,” he said.\n\nRep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale, noted that his local Chico Municipal Airport lost scheduled flights in 2014. He asked McNamee what strategies he has applied to bring a passenger air carrier back to Oxnard. McNamee said it has been a challenge. The pilot shortage and Oxnard’s 5,500-foot runway that can accommodate no more than 90-seat aircraft has worked against its efforts. Oxnard is roughly 60 miles from the Santa Barbara, Burbank and Los Angeles International airports, he noted.\n\nIn addition, mandatory retirement at age 65 is expected to trim 30,000 pilots by 2026, McNamee said.\n\nVentura County plans major runway rehabilitation projects over the next few years, he noted, including one at Oxnard that's expected to cost $6.7 million, with an additional $5 million for taxiways. Reconstructing a runway at the Camarillo Airport is expected to cost $18 million, he said.\n\n“With FAA shortfalls in discretionary funding and only $150,000 entitlement funds per year for each airport, we have had to postpone projects, bank our AIP entitlements and wait for limited discretionary funds to make up the difference,” he said.\n\n“Our local FAA officials have been terrific to work with, but there must be a better way to distribute funds to general aviation airports that have significant needs,” he added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2013/03/11/delta-air-lines-longest-serving-captain-retires-after-record-run/1978041/", "title": "Delta's longest-serving captain retires after record run", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nATLANTA (AP) - From inside the cockpit, Cal Flanigan watched Delta Air Lines grow over the decades from a Southern regional carrier to a global airline that assigned him to pilot its inaugural flights to Dubai and other cities worldwide.\n\nNow, after 37 years, Delta's longest-serving pilot is hanging up his captain's stripes. Flanigan is turning 65, which is the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots.\n\nHe landed his final flight - a Delta 777 widebody returning to Atlanta from Los Angeles - on Friday. His plane received a water-cannon salute and Flanigan was met by Delta employees with a celebration at the concourse gate at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.\n\n\"It's a career that has exceeded my wildest dreams,\" Flanigan told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"I've been preparing myself mentally for the last year, knowing it's coming and I couldn't do anything to stop it.\"\n\nFlanigan first joined Delta as a mechanic 45 years ago, with hopes of one day flying. A year later, in 1969, he was drafted into the Army for two years. Using the GI Bill and money saved from his Delta wages, Flanigan managed to pay for pilot training at a time when few other African-Americans were flying commercial airliners. He realized his dream in 1976, when he became a first officer flying DC-9s for Delta.\n\nFlanigan is retiring after 25 years as a captain and a record eight years as Delta's senior pilot.\n\nDelta says Flanigan has logged more than 26,000 flight hours and flown roughly 12.5 million miles. He's landed at 95 destinations on six continents.\n\nIn a message to employees, Delta CEO Richard Anderson called Flanigan \"a hero of mine at Delta.\"\n\n\"We are honored that you have been part of the Delta family for so many years,\" Anderson said.\n\nThose he's retiring from commercial flying, Flanigan said he plans to keep his pilot license active and fly his own plane.\n\nHe's not the only one facing a big transition.

John Hale, American's vice president for flight, said the company is excited to build its team through hiring and recruitment, with greater opportunities expected after the proposed merger.\n\nA month ago, United Airlines announced it would recall nearly 600 pilots, the last to return from furloughs in 2008, to fill gaps from retirements and rest rules.\n\nBut a pilot shortage is looming because of increased training of pilots, extended rest periods for pilots and a mandatory retirement age of 65, which was extended from 60 in 2007. The lure of foreign airlines in China or elsewhere could also reduce the domestic supply of pilots.\n\nKent Lovelace, chairman of the aviation department at the University of North Dakota, studied pilot retirements, surveys of potential pilots and projected a shortfall of 35,000 pilots in the next 20 years.\n\n\"I know regional airlines are having challenges right now,\" Lovelace said.\n\nThat study didn't factor in a Federal Aviation Administration rule that took effect Aug. 1, requiring 1,500 hours of flight time for all co-pilots, to match the minimum requirement for captains. The rule grew out of the fatal Colgan Air crash in 2009 that killed 50 people and was partially blamed on pilot training.\n\nThere are exceptions for military pilots and graduates of four-year colleges, but airlines are reluctant to hire pilots who aren't close to the requirement.\n\nAlso, in December 2011, the FAA adopted an anti-fatigue rule that lengthened the rest period between shifts for commercial pilots flying passengers. Pilots are now supposed to get 10 hours off, including eight hours for uninterrupted rest, between shifts whose length varies depending on the time of day.\n\nWithout criticizing the extra training, regional airlines worry that the cost and difficulty of obtaining the training could discourage people from becoming pilots. Regional airlines, where pilots build their experience, are key because they represent half of all flights as they feed larger hubs.\n\n\"It remains a pressing concern. It should be a pressing concern not just for airlines, but for any community that isn't in the top 30,\" said Roger Cohen, president of the Regional Airline Association. \"If they're not concerned about losing air service, they ought to be.\"\n\nClair Tosino, who flies nearly every week as a consultant from her home outside Columbus, was heading home from Boston through Chicago on Aug. 23. But she said her American Eagle connection at O'Hare was canceled for what was announced as a lack of an \"available\" co-pilot.\n\nAs an executive-platinum member, she was rebooked on another flight an hour later.\n\n\"Nonetheless, I got home late with more or less a wasted evening at the airport,\" Tosino said.\n\nA spokesman for American Eagle said the problem was not caused by the new training rule and said the airline finished its new qualification program early.\n\n\"American Eagle hasn't had any issues related to the 1,500-hour rule,\" Matt Miller said.\n\nThe training requirement remains a concern generally for regional airlines. Cohen noted that reaching 1,500 hours would require flying three hours per day, five days a week — a significant and costly commitment for a student.\n\n\"That's an enormous amount of time,\" Cohen said. \"That's pretty daunting.\"\n\nA first officer for a regional carrier typically makes $18,000 to $20,000 a year. But flight school loans can reach $100,000.\n\n\"Students want a defined path,\" said Lovelace, the professor.\n\nAcademic programs and airlines are working to attract young pilots and expedite training. For example, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Cape Air, ExpressJet and JetBlue have a University Gateway Program to provide training and mentorship for students to become pilots.\n\nParticipants have to maintain a B average and work as a flight instructor at the university. As they accumulate hours, participants can join Cape Air and eventually perhaps, JetBlue.\n\nSince launching in 2007, the program now has 150 pilots; 20 have reached Cape Air, and eight have reached JetBlue.\n\n\"It's a definite path with clearly obtainable goals,\" said Capt. Krista Poppe, the program's manager at Cape Air. \"They know how to get to JetBlue.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2022/06/24/pilot-shortage-summer-travel-headaches/7715978001/", "title": "Don't blame the ones who showed up: Pilot shortage driving airline ...", "text": "It’s been a tough summer for air passengers in the U.S.\n\nMany days have seen thousands of flight delays and cancellations, and airlines are taking longer to get their operations back on schedule when things go wrong.\n\nA shortage of pilots, while not the only reason, is a major factor.

Airlines have complained for years about difficulty finding trained pilots to hire. But pilots say airlines would have no trouble finding qualified pilots if they hiked starting salaries.\n\nAs the Sept. 30 expiration date approaches for FAA policy legislation, regional airlines are \"pushing very hard\" against the 1,500-hour rule, Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee said. He said he expects other lawmakers to offer amendments to reduce the requirement when legislation is considered this fall.\n\n\"They've got a number of my colleagues in a panic,\" he said. Carriers threatened to reduce flights to congressional districts, he said.\n\n\"We're going to have to fight to keep that.\"\n\nCongress adopted the requirement that every pilot have at least 1,500 hours flying in 2010 after the last fatal crash of a U.S. passenger airline, the February 2009 Colgan Air flight 3407 that crashed near Buffalo during a snowstorm. The rule, which took effect in August 2013, raised the experience level for first officers from 250 hours to the 1,500 hours that captains must accumulate. FAA made exceptions for former military pilots who have 750 hours and graduates of four-year schools who have 1,000 hours.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board blamed the Colgan crash on the captain's inappropriate response to a warning that the Bombardier Q400 turboprop was going too slow to remain aloft. The pilots lacked training to avoid the aerodynamic stall and were fatigued, the investigation found. The Colgan pilots had 3,379 hours and 2,244 hours of flying experience.\n\nFAA regulations that grew out of the Colgan crash required greater simulator training to avoid aerodynamic stalls and increased rest periods between shifts. Six regional-airline executives told a House hearing in April 2014 that the 1,500-hour rule mistakenly favors quantity of training over the substance of what pilots need to learn.\n\nRelatives of the crash victims who fought for the changes say they are prepared to defend them.\n\n\"Our antenna's up,\" said Scott Maurer of Palmetto, Fla., whose 30-year-old daughter Lorin died in the Colgan crash. \"You've got to keep watching – there are so many snakes in the grass.\"\n\nIn addition to more flight hours, a mandatory retirement age of 65 and a growing need for pilots each contribute to fears of a shortage. Boeing, the plane manufacturer, projected a need for 558,000 new pilots worldwide during the next 20 years, including 95,000 in North America.\n\nA Government Accountability Office report in February 2014 found that airline demand hadn't yet outpaced the supply of pilots. But 11 of 12 regional airlines contacted by GAO reported trouble filling openings.\n\n\"Americans have to brace themselves, especially in the small- and medium-sized communities, for one of two things: withdrawal or reduction of service, or higher ticket prices,\" said Jim Higgins, an associate professor at the University of North Dakota's aviation department, who studied the shortage.\n\nRepublic Airways, which serves American, Delta and United airlines, lost half its stock value in July after announcing a pilot shortage forced it to cut 4% of its flights in April, May and June.\n\n​Bryan Bedford, CEO of Republic Airways, told a House hearing in April 2014 that the rule would fail to improve safety and \"would hasten the growing pilot shortage and imperil air service at communities across the country.\"\n\nIn February 2014, United, Republic, Great Lakes and Silver airlines blamed service cuts at least partially on a shortage of pilots caused by the tougher federal training requirements.\n\n\"Collectively, these new regulations have put many of us in the position of having to park airplanes, cut flights and eliminate cities,\" John Sullivan, CEO of Champlain Enterprises, which operates as CommutAir and flies as United Express, told lawmakers in April 2014.\n\nBut the Air Line Pilots Association, a union with 52,000 members, questions whether such a shortage exists.\n\n\"We reject that out of hand,\" said Capt. Tim Canoll, the union president.\n\nPilots say more people would spend the $150,000 to $200,000 to acquire a commercial license if regional airlines paid more to starting pilots. The five lowest-paying airlines pay first-year pilots less than $21,000 per year, according to the union. To bolster salaries, some regional airlines offer signing bonuses. For example, Endeavor Air – a regional affiliate for Delta Air Lines – offers a $20,000 annual retention payment through 2018.\n\nTo recruit more potential pilots, airlines must show pilot recruits a clear path to a career in aviation that could result from significant training expenses, Canoll said.\n\n“It’s been two years\" since the rule took effect, Canoll said. \"Anyone can accumulate 1,500 hours if they want to within two years.\"\n\nUniversity of North Dakota's Higgins, a former airline pilot, said only one fatal crash in the last 100 in the U.S. involved pilots with fewer than 1,500 hours of flying.\n\n\"It was a really good sound-bite and feel-good measure,\" Higgins said. \"It's exceptionally safe with low-time pilots.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2015/10/05/reports-american-airlines-flight-diverts-after-captain-becomes-ill-dies/73386898/", "title": "American Airlines flight diverts after captain becomes ill, dies", "text": "Ben Mutzabaugh\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAn American Airlines pilot died after becoming ill on an overnight \"red eye\" flight from Phoenix to Boston, American Airlines confirmed to Today in the Sky.\n\nThe incident occurred about four hours into Flight 550, which then diverted to Syracuse and landed there around 7:10 a.m. Monday morning, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.\n\nIn a recording of a conversation with air traffic control, Flight 550's first officer can be heard calling in the emergency while saying the captain had become \"incapacitated.\"\n\n\"Syracuse, American 550, medical emergency, captain is incapacitated, request handling for runway,\" the co-pilot said, according to an audio recording of the conversation posted on the website savvystews.com.\n\nAmerican Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein confirmed to Today in the Sky the captain died, though the immediate cause of the pilot's death could not be confirmed.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

Thousands of pilots retired – either by choice or aging out at 65 – during the pandemic, and research presented by the Regional Airline Association says 2,000 pilots reach mandatory retirement age this year. Mandatory retirement numbers are expected to grow over the next 6 years.\n\nSouthwest executives identified staffing as one of their key priorities this year, setting a goal of hiring 8,000 new employees. Forty percent of those will be flight crews.\n\nMore hiring alone will not solve the fatigue issues, SWAPA president Casey Murray says.\n\n“A lot of our delays and issues that we’re having have to do more with scheduling and connecting pilots with airplanes,” Murray told CNN in an interview. “It is inefficient scheduling processes that are affecting when we work in a very dynamic environment.”\n\nThe union wrote in the letter to executives that the number of pilots who reported being unable to work because of fatigue skyrocketed last fall, including a 600% spike in October, and hit “another staggering 330% increase” last month. “April is already setting fatigue records,” SWAPA wrote.\n\nFederal rules set baseline limits on hours pilots may work and require rest periods. The limits for major US airlines include 30 hours of flying time each week and at a minimum 9 hours of rest between shifts.\n\nBut pilots report the stresses of the job and changes because of storms can leave them worn out before hitting those benchmarks.\n\nSouthwest Airlines acknowledged a climb in fatigue reports filed last month – 35 reports for every 10,000 duty periods, compared to 10 reports for the same metric in March 2019. Spokeswoman Brandy King said the numbers show an effective system.\n\n“The increase is expected, as it’s common to experience an elevated level of fatigue calls during irregular operations and in March, the industry faced weather and airspace delays that resulted in disruptions across the network,” King wrote in a statement to CNN. “The March increase in Pilot fatigue calls is a result of the system working as designed, allowing Crew to determine if they are too fatigued to fly.”\n\nDelta Air Lines pilots are holding a series of demonstrations at airports this month drawing attention to their fatigue concerns.\n\n“Our pilots are tired and fatigued,” Evan Baach, a captain at Delta and official with Air Line Pilots Association, or ALPA, told CNN affiliate KSL at a Salt Lake City airport protest. He said pilots are working “longer days with shorter nights at home.”\n\nJason Ambrosi, chairman of the Delta group at ALPA, said that pilots are responsible as “the last line of defense” in aviation safety but “too often we are being pushed to our limits as Delta tries to add back flying and capture revenue.”\n\nALPA wrote in a message to Delta members last month that the pandemic presented “several opportunities for Delta to re-set its broken pilot staffing issue.” As air travel rebounds now, the union wrote, unresolved problems are becoming more apparent: The number of pilots available to step in and cover for an issue caused by weather, maintenance, or a sick colleague is significantly smaller.\n\n“Delta Flight Operations continues to run the operation at red line,” the union note reads. “So, if it feels like you are working more and seeing less control over your schedule – you are right; you are.”\n\nDelta told CNN that its scheduling follows federal rules for pilot work and rest hours.\n\n“We continuously evaluate our staffing models and plan ahead so that we can recover quickly when unforeseen circumstances arise, and the resilience of the Delta people is unmatched in that regard,” spokesman Morgan Durrant said. “All of our people, including our pilots, are working hard to restore our airline and deliver for our customers as we emerge from the pandemic. We are grateful for and proud of their efforts.”\n\nLast year, pilots from all carriers filed about 60 reports of mistakes or other incidents involving fatigue to the federal Aviation Safety Reporting System. The reports are posted to a federal website anonymously, without identifying names or airlines.\n\nSome pilots wrote they were tired after handling training responsibilities. Others said airline managers asked them to handle too many extra flights because of short staffing.\n\n“Both of us were yawning and eye rubbing halfway through our 6+ hour flight… I was physically unable to keep up,” one captain wrote in November, despite having “appropriate, average sleep the night before.”\n\n“But ‘we’ press on - don’t we?” the pilot continued. “Our threats are threefold of the pre-Covid environment. We’ve been facing delays, shortages, planning and staffing issues that are NOT being taken into account in building schedules. Why? Because we pilots are counted upon to make it work.”\n\n– CNN’s Pete Muntean and Raja Razek contributed to this report", "authors": ["Gregory Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/04/16"}]}

The price for the XR (the one Apple is hawking discounts for): $749.\n\n\"This should be a wake-up call for Apple,\" says Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"They swung, and they really missed.\"\n\nThe prices on the new phones are \"far too high,\" says Terry Walton, a tourist from Auckland, New Zealand. He has an iPhone 7 and didn't even consider any of the X-series iPhones because it still works just fine. Upgrading \"didn't enter my mind at all,\" he says.\n\n(Walton's daughter, Olivia, thought of moving on from her old iPhone 6S, but dad didn't agree. \"With the new update, it's failing a bit, but that's fine,\" she says.)\n\nIt wasn't just iPhones that got price hikes. Apple also upped the cost of the top-of-the-line iPad to $1,000 as well (or more than $2,800 for a loaded model) and added $300 to the cost of the Mac Mini and new MacBook Air computers.\n\nThe iPhones got the most attention, because it's the premier product for a company that gets 65 percent of its revenue from the devices. The XS Max model is the most expensive iPhone ever.\n\nUnlike past years, however, Apple didn't offer consumers much that was new for the 2018 models. The flagship XS and XS Max phones had more power, but that didn't resonate with consumers who thought their old iPhone 6S and 7 devices ran just fine. The XR has the premium edge-to-edge display of the X series iPhones, minus the second camera lens of those models and shinier OLED screen, but it's $400 more expensive than the older, entry-level current model.\n\nAnalysts say the XR phone experienced the biggest resistance from consumers.\n\nBut don't cry for Apple. It will still sell more than 200 million iPhones this year. It's just that analysts such as Ives expected Apple to sell as many as 220 million phones. \"We reduced it to 210 million and now think it could go even lower, to 205 million,\" he says.\n\nThe rest of Apple's lineup was mixed. Sales of the HomePod, Apple's pricey, $349 connected-speaker answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers those companies were practically giving away in holiday sales for $25 to $50, fizzled. A new, lower-priced $329 iPad did do well, according to Stephen Baker, an analyst with the NPD Group. \"This iPad will have its best holiday in years,\" he says.\n\nApple said in October that it won't reveal sales numbers for iPhones any longer, so analysts will just have to take their best guesses in 2019.\n\nLet's remember that Apple still makes great phones. The new models were the best of the breed. It's not the lack of new features so much as that older iPhones are so good, many people don't feel the need to upgrade. Not for $1,000 and up, anyway.\n\n\"If I could see a huge difference in a new phone, then maybe I'd be more prone for it, but $1,000 for one or two new features ... I knew I wasn't getting it,\" said Keith Skinner, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nAnd I wonder if there's any new feature consumers really would care about more than an all-day battery, unbreakable screen and camera as good as Google's Pixel 3 for shooting in low light.\n\nApple historically redesigns iPhones every other year (2018 was the \"S\" year, when models get slight upgrades) so in September we could see the company go back to the drawing board and really wow us again.\n\nOr not. But, here's hoping!\n\nIn other tech news this week\n\nPeople apparently bought Fitbits and a whole lot of Google Home and Amazon Echo speakers for the holidays, as evidenced by a look at the app store charts. The Alexa app took the top spot on both the iOS and Google app stores' lists of the top free apps the day after Christmas while Fitbit was in the No. 5 slot. Google Home took the No. 3 spot in the Android Play Store and came in seventh on the iPhone. Among other popular apps on both stores: the Tile app, for the popular tracker, was 20 on iPhone and 47 on Android; iRobot Home, for controlling the robotic Roomba vacuums, was 40 on iPhone and 91 on Android; and the Ring app, for the video doorbell, was 41 on iPhone and 65 on Android.\n\nDespite the hacking, theft of personal data, frequent apologies from the social network and terrible grades for 2018 from the press, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg says he's \"proud\" of the year the social network has had. \"Building community and bringing people together leads to a lot of good, and I'm committed to continuing our progress in these areas as well,\" he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nDid your Instagram look different Thursday? You weren't alone. An Instagram test that changed the way users go through their feeds went wide across the social network. And the internet was not happy with the potential new changes. The apparent update, which appeared to be in the process of rolling out to users, changed the way people viewed feeds. As opposed to the normal method of scrolling down vertically through posts from the people you follow, under the test format users needed to swipe and tap through it, similar to how you navigate the company's Stories feature. By the end of the day, Instagram scrapped the new look.\n\nThis week's Talking Tech podcasts\n\nPeter Csathy's tech predictions for 2019\n\nHow to get started with Amazon Echo and Google Home\n\nHow to get used to X-series iPhones\n\nPeter Pham's favorite tech products of 2018\n\n10 essential apps for your phone\n\nMeet Innermap, the new mindfulness app from Mitra Manesh.\n\nAnd that's our last Talking Tech newsletter for 2018.

Now, during a pandemic, when millions have been thrown out of work?\n\nThis really comes to home when you consider that there are three fantastic smartphones out now for $400 or less: The Samsung Galaxy A51 and Apple iPhone SE will cost you $399, while the Google Pixel 4A is just $350.\n\nAnd they are clearly the best bargain-priced phones I've seen. Unless you need the latest camera technology with multiple lenses, there is no reason for most consumers to spend more on a phone. You won't be missing out.\n\nAll are worth your attention if you're looking for a replacement phone, or a new model for the kids. Meanwhile, new phones are scheduled to be released in a few weeks from Google (a new Pixel) and Apple (several models of iPhones), and are expected to cost way more than $400. So how do the budget phones compare?\n\nSamsung Galaxy A51\n\nThe biggest of the phones is a $399 bargain, with a beautiful 6.5-inch screen the size of the $1,099 iPhone Pro Max, and even larger than the $999 6.2-inch Samsung Galaxy S20. . You get a second lens with the camera, which the rivals don't have. And while that's a plus, Samsung tends to oversaturate your photos, so if that's a problem, and you want to remain in the Android family, you'll want to look at the Pixel 4A.\n\nGoogle Pixel 4A\n\nThe best bargain in smartphone land, at $349, the Google phone is an Android flagship with a 5.8-inch screen, fast processor, and a terrific one-lens camera that can take some pretty amazing night photos in the dark. Plus there are add-ons like the ability to add live captions to both homemade videos and ones you watch on YouTube, and an instant transcription service using Google's voice recording app. The Pixel 4A is clearly the best Pixel phone Google has made, one so good, I think if the line had launched with this model, Google would have been able to turn Pixel into a mass market brand. Google's market share is under 1%, while most phones sold in the United States are from Apple and Samsung.\n\nApple iPhone SE\n\nThis is the Apple phone for those who didn't like bigger phones, with a 4.7-inch screen, and yearn for the classic iPhone, one with a Home button for navigation and Touch ID instead of Face ID. , and a headphone jack. Apple's nod to modernity is a powerful A13 processor, the same one that's in the current top of the line iPhones. It's classic in every sense, but as powerful as the latest iPhone. If you prefer living in an iPhone world to Android, this is the phone for you.\n\n5G ... a concern?\n\nNone of these phones are compatible with the new, faster 5G networks. However, know that in our tests, true national 5G service that isn't spotty or as fast as advertised is still at least a year away, if not longer. So you won't be missing anything now by waiting.\n\nDecisions, decisions\n\nWhich one is best for you? It depends on whether you prefer Android or iPhone. I'd choose the Pixel 4A over the Galaxy because I'm not a fan of Samsung bloatware or the somewhat oversaturation of photos, (notice how the oranges below are \"orange orange\" in the words of the old Trix rabbit, compared to just orange on the Pixel and iPhone) but these are minor quibbles. I could easily live with either.\n\nOn a specs basic, you'd have to go with the A51, for the bigger screen and second camera lens. But if money's tight, the Pixel 4A is fantastic. As is the SE. You couldn't go wrong with any of these phones.\n\nReaders: If you had to take one of these phones to a desert island, which one would you select?\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/16/apple-store-gets-major-remodel/2028536002/", "title": "Apple is a third of the way through a major remake of flagship retail ...", "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif.—With a massive remodel program underway for current Apple Stores, the iPhone maker is set on remaking retail into a place that puts education and community first, and sales second.\n\nWhat Apple refers to as one of its “flagship” locations, the large store near the Pacific Ocean — and a gathering place for local actors, filmmakers and the millions of tourists who visit yearly — reopens Saturday, after several weeks of a major remodel. Apple says its one-third of the way into remodeling or making over its 100 flagship stores, and using a new store design for new locations.\n\nWhile the idea is to bring in customers and get them hooked on Apple products, Angela Ahrendts, the company’s senior vice-president of retail, says she wants the stores to act as “gathering spaces, where people can come in, get service and support and learn about everything they would do on their devices.”\n\nAnd how does that help the bottom line?\n\n“When you do the right thing, naturally, then you get the right outcome,” she says.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nGene Munster, an analyst and investor with Loup Ventures, calls the Apple Stores the company’s most “under-appreciated competitive advantage,” over rivals.\n\n“No other tech company has Apple's base of 65,000 retail employees delivering face-to-face advice, support, and experiences,” he says. “Microsoft comes in second with about 6,000 retail employees.”\n\nMicrosoft also has a retail store to show off its products, with just under 100 locations.\n\nClearly, the approach is paying off for Apple, which raised prices on nearly every product line in 2018, bringing the top of the line iPhone to a starting price of $1,100 ($100 more than last year) and, for the first time, selling an iPad that starts at $1,000.\n\nApple competes with many companies, mostly notably at retail with device makers like Samsung and Google, who make rival smartphones.\n\n\"Apple is able to sell through discovery,\" says Munster. \"This is how to sell technology today, offering something more than just a place to look and buy, but instead an experience.\"\n\nApple hasn’t specified how much it’s spending on the upgrades. The store concept began in 2001 at a time when Microsoft dominated computer usage, and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said retail did a poor job of showing his products.\n\nToday, there are over 500 Apple Stores globally. Besides the remodeled Santa Monica location, Apple also opened a new store on the historic Champs-Élysées this weekend as well.\n\nAhrendts says the older stores really needed to be updated, as Apple has so many more product lines now. (Originally, it was just computers and iPods.)\n\nThe flagship stores are broken into three areas:\n\n—Avenues: This is where Apple devotes product selection to themed areas, like photography and health, and where customers can go hands-on time with them.\n\n—The Grove: Trees are imported and are a visual to bring customers to the newly renamed “Genius Grove,” where more product specialists will be available to help with support, Apple says. Customers still need to make reservations via the Apple Store smartphone app, although walk-ins can try their luck, usually right when the store opens.\n\n—The Forum: This is where Apple stages its daily, free “Today at Apple” seminars, devoted to photography, art, computer coding and the like. The list of classes is available on the Apple Store app. Customers can't miss it--the Forum is flanked by a giant video screen at the back of the store.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/24/tech-turkeys-2018-facebooks-portal-apple-prices-google-clips-more/2079169002/", "title": "Tech Turkeys 2018: Facebook's Portal, Apple prices, Google Clips ...", "text": "Thanksgiving is now behind us, Black Friday seems like yesterday, and leftovers rule for our lunch and dinner plans.\n\nWhich can mean only one thing. It's that time again for our annual list of the Top Tech Turkeys of the year. We got some assistance this year from some 1,000 consumers, whose responses were \"universal\" and totally in sync with our pick for No. 1.\n\n\"Across the board – regardless of age or gender – Facebook’s Portal was named by a quarter of consumers as the tech turkey of the year (25 percent),\" notes the research team at Survey Monkey Audience, which did the exclusive poll for USA TODAY.\n\nThe Portal, a video chat device released in early November, saw its debut in a year with near weekly apologies from Facebook over the social network's hacking and data breach crises.\n\nThe Portal has an always-on microphone and video camera that can move around the room to bring more people into view. Tech-wise, the Portal is the best video chat experience we've ever had, far superior to FaceTime, Skype or Hangouts, due to the higher-resolution screen and camera movement, which transforms a static image into something resembling a professionally shot video.\n\nIn our review, we noted this. But beyond that, and the innate creepiness that comes from putting what amounts to a Facebook monitor in your home, the product also pales in comparison to rivals in that, beyond video chat and a digital photo frame, it can't get you voice-summoned music videos, recipes or any of the other features of the Amazon Echo Show or Google Home Hub.\n\nAnd if you try to chat with someone who isn't on Facebook Messenger, you're out of luck. Not so with Home Hub or Echo, which lets you make calls to landlines and cellphones. Gobble gobble.\n\n. Our tech turkeys of 2018:\n\nApple's ever-rising prices\n\nThe company, sitting on more than $200 billion in cash, decided to up the prices on every one of its marquee products this year to new highs – with the top-of-the-line iPhone and premium iPad Pro each at or above the $1,000 mark, the MacBook Air at $1,200, the Mac Mini price increased by $300 – and eliminating the entry-level, bargain-priced $350 iPhone SE from its lineup.\n\nNow, the lowest priced iPhone is the still available iPhone 7, which starts at $449. Apple still makes the best-selling consumer device in the world, but folks, if the prices keep going up and up, one of these days, many of us are going to turn our backs and shop elsewhere. (And on another note, those crazy repair prices. Buy an Apple Watch for $400, crack the screen, and Apple charges $300 to fix it. Something is wrong with that equation. How about making a product that doesn't crack?)\n\nGoogle Clips\n\nThe search giant made several great products this year, including the Pixel 3 smartphone and the Home Hub video speaker, which ranks as my favorite new device of 2018. Google Clips, however, wouldn't make my top 10 best list. The $250 camera only shoots six- to seven-second silent video clips and photos automatically, when Google decides to do so. The camera is the photographer, not you. And what am I going to do with all those silent videos? No thanks.\n\nBattery life\n\nThis year's crop of smartphones have higher resolution, more features that people probably don't care that much about and won't last as long without a charge. Fellow tech critic Geoffrey Fowler recently tested 13 top 2018 models and found that none lasted as long as 2017 models. Once again, smartphone makers, this is what we want: Screens that won't crack and an all-day battery. (Note the above on repairs.) Nothing else. Well, maybe lower prices, too.\n\nCloud Blackmail\n\nPhoto site SmugMug sweeps in and saves the day to revive Flickr from the hands of Verizon, which snapped it up when it bought the remnants of Yahoo. All looks positive, then SmugMug earlier this month says that anyone who has more than 1,000 photos stored on the site, which predates Instagram and Facebook as a social sharing hub, would have to fork over $50 yearly or see their 1,001st photo and beyond. Delete now, or they will be removed by Flickr in January. Well, that's a nice way to get people to come back to Flickr and start sharing again, isn't it? (Folks who pay $50 monthly get unlimited storage.)\n\nYouTube and machine learning\n\nThis was the year YouTube had to deal with Logan Paul, Alex Jones and all those misinformed conspiracy videos that leaped to the top of the rankings and had the potential to lead viewers to think they were spouting the truth. Paul posted a video of a suicide in Japan, Jones' InfoWars spouted out conspiracy videos. Paul got a two-strikes warning, Jones got banned. But the problem remains. YouTube's videos get posted by humans, and if they don't abide by community standards, it's up to the machine to figure that out. YouTube has 10,000 humans overseeing what is 400 hours of videos uploaded every minute. It's a losing battle. YouTube says it has beefed up its human oversight, but do a search for anything icky, and we guarantee you'll still find it in the YouTube index. There's got to be a better way.\n\nAT&T kills Filmstruck\n\nThat didn't take long. AT&T swallowed up Time Warner in 2018, made a quick announcement that it would take on Netflix in 2019 with a new Warner Bros. Studios themed movie service and then proceeded to kill Filmstruck. The beloved classic movie service, which showcased movies from the Turner Classic Movies and Criterion Collection, had only around 100,000 subscribers, which AT&T said was not enough. Where this stings for consumers is that the big streamers, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, showcase current films and originals, and as a rule, classics need not apply. So if the video store and DVD rentals have gone away, the hope was that the film lovers and students of today would have an online resource to see classics such as \"Citizen Kane\" and \"City Lights.\" (Criterion is starting its own service in the spring, but without the involvement – and films – from WarnerMedia.) For now, check your YouTube, where clips from classics are in abundance and many greats are available for viewing at a fee.\n\nTiVo's high-fee DVR\n\nThe company that invented the DVR introduced a new model recently, the Bolt OTA, aimed at cord cutters who just wanted to record broadcast TV shows in addition to watching Netflix and Amazon. TiVo, which has a unique business model of selling you a device and then charging $15 monthly to use it – in order to access TV listings – hasn't changed stripes, even when cord cutters are the target. The Bolt OTA is $249, plus $6.99 monthly to use it. Consumer alert: Amazon's Fire TV Edition sets from Toshiba show you TV listings within the set menu, at no charge. Ditto for the TCL Roku TVs.\n\nAmazon plays the cities\n\nAmazon put many cities into an \"Apprentice\"-like contest to bid for its new corporate headquarters and, in the end, picked the usual suspects – New York and Washington, D.C., where some speculate it was always headed in the first place. It extracted huge tax breaks from New York and Washington to get Amazon, while the other cities spent precious time and person power trying to woo the e-commerce giant. Net result: These poor souls helped Amazon get richer terms from the East Coast cities.\n\nAnd that's our 2018 Tech Turkey list. If you're keeping score, Snapchat's Spectacles topped our chart last year, and the exploding Samsung Note phone in 2016. What's on yours for 2018?

So, while the elegant new iPhone XS Max that I’ve been testing since Wednesday (along with the XS) has, by far, the largest display and is the most expensive and best iPhone ever, Apple’s latest handsets, good as they are, don’t move the needle all that much.\n\nThe cameras are superb, but they were excellent before.\n\nThe robust A12 Bionic processor inside means the handsets are faster, snappier, primed for immersive augmented reality, and, in theory, more power-efficient – that’s hard to judge in a few days – with Apple claiming marginally better battery life. But it’s not like prior models, which on Monday got a performance boost with iOS 12, which were poky.\n\nAnd while the latest screens are beautiful, iPhone displays have long been brilliant.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nA year ago, of course, Apple launched the X as the first model to exorcise the home button, go all-in on Face ID facial recognition (at the expense of the Touch ID fingerprint system) and, oh yeah, crack $1,000. Those of us who bought the X – and it became Apple’s most popular phone after its release – had to learn a few new gestures, which, thankfully, were fairly intuitive.\n\nBy now, most X buyers have made peace with all that and may have even gotten used to the notch at the top of the display that consists of the front camera and sensors that make Face ID even possible – and that remains on the newest models. And Face ID, in my experience, typically works really well.\n\nIf you didn’t buy then but are ready to buy the $999 (or more) XS or XS Max at $1,099 (to start) now, you’ll face the same relatively minor learning curve the X crowd had to deal with a year ago. (The third new iPhone, the XR, isn’t coming until Oct. 26; Apple hasn’t supplied review units.)\n\nThe only recourse for those of you who want a new iPhone but haven’t come to grips with the disappearance of Touch ID and the home button is to purchase either an iPhone 7- or 8-series device that are still in Apple’s lineup.\n\nWith that perspective, here’s what I like about the new iPhones, and here are my gripes.\n\nTHE GOOD STUFF\n\nThose big displays\n\nIf you’ve read the specifications, you already know the iPhone XS Max has a beautiful edge-to-edge 6.5-inch OLED display, the largest ever on an iPhone – it makes the iPhone XS, despite its own large 5.8-inch screen, look relatively puny.\n\nEven so, thanks to reduced bezels, the XS Max has a smaller footprint than the iPhone 8 Plus, whose screen size is 5.5 inches. It is also slightly smaller than Samsung’s rival Galaxy Note9, which has a 6.4-inch screen. The upcoming XR will have a 6.1-inch screen.\n\nThe new gold finish of my test unit – the other available colors are space gray and silver – is really attractive, but like many people I cover up the finish with a case anyway. Apple says the XS and XS Max displays are fortified with what Apple claims is the most durable glass yet on a smartphone. Short of trying to smash or scratch the device, I'll have to take their word for it.\n\nThe camera\n\nBoth the XS and XS Max have dual 12-megapixel rear cameras, one wide-angle, one telephoto, just like the iPhone X. But through other under-the-hood enhancements that include larger pixels and what Apple refers to as Smart HDR, the company is promising even better pictures. Honestly, it can be difficult to detect differences that, to the subjective eye, are subtle improvements.\n\nBut the cameras can compensate for a photographer’s shortcomings, like if you were shooting with the sun washing out the background of your subject. Which is not to suggest that you still can’t take a bad picture. What I can say, though, is that I was extremely pleased with the quality of the pictures I took under all sorts of lighting conditions, including in dim settings.\n\nApple has improved the portrait mode feature by letting you adjust the depth of field and \"artful\" background blur, after you shoot, even on the front camera. While Apple is not the first company that lets you change the blur effect after the fact – some Galaxy’s have had the feature for a while – its presence on the new iPhones is welcome just the same.\n\nCoffee resistance\n\nYes, prior iPhones have been water resistant, as is this one. But Apple says the latest device can also withstand everyday spills of wine, tea, beer, soda and other liquids. To put it to the test, I intentionally spilled coffee on the XS Max. I wiped the phone dry and was immediately good to go.\n\nStereo recording\n\nYou can now capture stereo audio when shooting a video, thanks in part to four built-in microphones. I tested stereo recording during a Paul Simon concert I attended over the weekend inside Newark’s Prudential Center. The resulting audio sounded really good, just like you expect to hear on a live album. I can practically hear you budding garage musicians cheer.\n\niOS 12\n\nGranted, this isn’t an XS- or XS Max-only feature since the upgrade also freshens up older iPhones, including models dating as far back as the iPhone 5S. But iOS 12 offers a number of useful features, from Screen Time reports and time limits that promise to help tame digital addiction to video effects in FaceTime and iMessages.\n\nDual SIM\n\nThis is a feature that you’re not going to be able to take advantage of immediately. But dual SIM technology will let you have two separate numbers on your single device – one perhaps for your job, another that’s personal. You will need carrier support, though, which comes later. This isn’t a novel feature; overseas phones have had dual SIM support for a while. Frequent travelers likely will appreciate it.\n\nMY GRIPES\n\nThe price\n\nThink about this for a second. If you buy the iPhone XS or XS Max with the maximum storage capacity of 512GB, you’re looking at $1,349 or $1,449, respectively, or well within the price range of a new, medium-spec’d MacBook Pro laptop. I recognize that for many of us, the smartphones in our pockets have become our computers and that not everyone is going to max out on storage. But jeez, even the “cheaper” phones aren’t exactly cheap, with the 64GB XS and XS Max versions fetching $999 and $1,099, respectively, and the 256GB version $1,149 and $1,249.\n\nI also realize that four-digit price tags have become the cost of admission for top-of-the-line premium phones nowadays and that trade-ins and monthly installment plans can ease the pain somewhat. But it doesn’t mean I have to like it.\n\nThough I haven’t tested it yet, it is for this reason that some of you may want to hold out for the iPhone XR next month. It starts at $749 and has most of the features of the XS and XS Max, save a second rear camera and a screen that, while very good, isn’t as fancy as these higher priced iPhones.\n\nWhat, no adapter?\n\nIt’s bad enough that the iPhones of the last few years did away with the standard-sized headphone jack. I had no illusions that Apple was going to bring back the jack with the XS or XS Max. But Apple no longer includes a $9 adapter in the box that you can use with your existing wired headphones. It smacks of stinginess. I get that Apple is pushing wireless Bluetooth headphones, especially on its own AirPods and Beats products. But still.\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nNo, you’re not going to not buy an iPhone because of its name. But even though I know the iPhone X is pronounced iPhone “Ten,” I’ve been stumbling with the XS, calling it just that, “ex-ess,” rather than its official name, \"ten-ess.\"\n\nNo more small screen iPhones\n\nI happen to be a fan of large displays, so this is more a complaint for those of you who aren't. That's why it's a shame that Apple discontinued the iPhone SE (or didn’t introduce a new one) with a 4-inch display. I’m not buying the silly narrative making the rounds that Apple is being sexist toward women here because I know females who like larger phones – and men who like smaller models. I just wish a small screen was still an option because choice is good.\n\nFast charging and yet ...\n\nThe new iPhones supports faster charging, and that's great – about a 50 percent charge in a half-hour, Apple says. Unfortunately, you'll only see such results with an optional USB-C accessory and not the slower charger included in the box.\n\nAs with prior models, wireless charging is also supported.\n\nSomething crazy\n\nAs I said, Apple's radical changes came last year, so it was expected that the changes in the new iPhones are mostly of the incremental variety. That doesn't mean, though, that we couldn't wish for something more, like, say, a fingerprint sensor – or Touch ID – built into the display. Put that on the wait-until-next-year wish list.\n\nAnd is it crazy to want certain features Apple has long resisted in the iPhones, notably expandable storage? (The Note9 via microSD can go up to a full terabyte). Oh well.\n\nAll told, though, the iPhone XS and XS Max are the best iPhones Apple has ever made, and I expect those of you who buy them will be thrilled. As for if the cost justifies the expense, well, maybe you should wait until the XR appears next month.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter; Baig is the co-author of iPhone For Dummies, an independent work published by Wiley.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/29/apple-watch-shopping-guide-series-6-series-3-which-best/6456057002/", "title": "Apple Watch shopping guide: Series 6 or Series 3? Which is best?", "text": "One of the most heavily advertised products during the holiday sales is the Apple Watch, primarily for the entry-level Series 3 model, which is available for as low as $119 at Walmart.\n\nBuyers beware: What's being offered for a great price is a 3-year-old product from 2017 that doesn't offer many of the newer features. How does it compare with the latest and greatest, the Series 6 or the more affordable SE?\n\nWe're here to help. What you need to know:\n\nPricing\n\nThe Series 6, the latest, has a starting list price of $399 from Apple, compared with $279 for the 2020 entry SE and the Series 3 for $199. Older models are available at various outlets, including the Series 5 for $329 at Best Buy and Amazon. Note the \"starting\" price. Apple offers a $25 gift card with purchase of the Series 3 for its holiday sale, which ends Monday night.\n\nYou need an iPhone*\n\nThe Apple Watch is not compatible with Android phones such as the Samsung Galaxy series. What about using it as a plain watch? No dice. You still need an iPhone to set up the Watch, so if you're not in the Apple world, forget about it. Apple is specific about which model you'll need. The Series 6 Watch works only with iPhones dating back to the 6S, from 2014. If you held onto your old iPhone 6 or 5S, sorry, it's not compatible.\n\n*There is a new way this year for some to use a Watch without an iPhone, via Apple's new \"Family\" plan. It lets parents buy editions of the Apple Watch and tie them to their iPhone. (Note that the Series 3 watch that's being discounted doesn't work with it, but the SE and Series 6 do.)\n\nMore on the family plan in a minute.\n\nGPS edition or Wi-Fi/cellular?\n\nThe GPS editions of the watch are $100 cheaper, but you'll need that iPhone on you when you use the watch for receiving notifications, calls, streaming music, apps, talking to the Siri personal assistant and the like. Spend the extra money, and you can do all of the above when out and about (as joggers or stand-up paddlers might want to do), but again, you'll pay for it. You need to spring an extra $10 monthly on your wireless service plan.\n\nMore on the family plan\n\nApple touts the SE as starting at $279 and the Series 6 at $399, but for the family plan, parents need to purchase step-up editions with cellular connectivity. Those SE models start at $329 for the 40mm watchface or $359 for the 44mm version. Then add roughly $10 monthly for your wireless plan (depending on the carrier), and you're looking at a minimum of $658 for a family with two kids, plus $240 a year in cell charges.\n\nSeries 3 vs. SE and Series 6\n\nThere are many differences in the top of the line watch, the 6.\n\nEarlier editions of the watch turned dark when not in use to save battery power. The Series 6 has the \"always on\" feature, so you'll always be able to see the watch face. Two health apps are available, to check your blood-oxygen level and do an ECG to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. The Series 3 watch doesn't offer these features, nor does the SE. The SE works with the family plan and has a larger watch face, 44mm (same as Series 6) to the Series 3 42mm.\n\nIf you do have an Android phone...\n\nIf you have an Android phone and want a smartwatch, you'll want to look at arm pieces featuring Wear OS by Google (which can work with Android phones as well as iPhones) from makers such as Fossil or Samsung with its Galaxy-branded watches. Samsung's Galaxy watch line is heavily discounted for the holidays as well: A 46mm watch face edition of the Galaxy watch sells for $189 at Best Buy, down from $239.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/tech/apple-event-march-8", "title": "Apple event: First budget 5G iPhone unveiled | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt its first product event of the year on Tuesday, Apple unveiled an upgraded iPad Air, a new desktop computer and a powerful new Mac chip. But the standout product was a new budget iPhone with access to 5G networks.\n\nApple’s new iPhone SE, only the third version since the model launched in 2017, runs on the company’s faster A15 Bionic chip, the same in-house processor that drives the iPhone 13 line. It also features an updated camera and a longer-lasting battery, packed into the same 4.7-inch display as the previous model.\n\nBut it’s the added 5G capability that could be the ultimate draw for customers, by giving them access to the faster wireless network at a more affordable price point. However, the bump up to 5G comes with a price change. The device will cost $429 — $30 more than the previous model.\n\nWhen Apple released its second version of the iPhone SE in April 2020, the budget smartphone seemed well-suited for the moment. The global pandemic was in its early days. Millions of households were grappling with job loss and financial uncertainty. And consumers were largely stuck at home, with less use for some of the bells and whistles that come with higher-end smartphones.\n\n“Consumers were uncertain about the outlook and an affordable iPhone was ideally placed to take advantage of that,” said Ben Wood, an analyst with market research firm CCS Insight. “In 2022 things have improved but the iPhone SE franchise still fills an important role as an affordable iPhone for consumers still cautious about splashing out on a top-of-the-line iPhone or who just don’t feel the need to spend more than is necessary.”\n\nFor Apple, the new SE offers the promise to further boost demand for its core smartphone business by luring away Android users and convincing more iPhone owners to upgrade. In January, Apple reported record revenue during the all-important holiday quarter fueled in part by demand for its latest lineup of iPhones.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook showcases the new iPhone SE featuring 5G and the A15 Bionic chip during a virtual product event Brooks Kraft/Apple\n\nDan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said there is “pent up demand for this next SE” globally. In an analyst note after the event Tuesday, Ives said the new SE “will be the fastest and most powerful phone at these price points by a wide margin.”\n\nColors for the new SE include midnight (black), starlight (white) and red. Pre-orders start today and the device starts shipping on March 18. Separately, Apple announced it would add two new shades of green to its iPhone 13 lineup: The iPhone 13 will now be available in a bold new green and the iPhone 13 Pro will come in an alpine green.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what else Apple announced at its virtual event on Tuesday:\n\nA 5G iPad Air\n\nThe new iPad Air Brooks Kraft/Apple\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the “new, even more amazing, iPad Air,” which features its M1 chip, the same in-house processor used in the iPad Pro, as well as 5G capabilities and a revamped front-facing camera.\n\nThe new iPad Air is available for pre-order starting Friday and will be available in stores on March 18. The price starts at $599.\n\nA new Mac chip\n\nApple’s in-house M1 chips have improved the speed and performance of its devices. Now, the company is adding a new chip, the M1 Ultra, to the lineup. The latest processor joins its existing family of chips, including the M1, M1 Pro and M1 Max.\n\nThe M1 Ultra will make some Mac desktops faster, more powerful and more power efficient. It has 114 million transistors (seven times more than the M1), 128 GB of unified memory for big workloads, and is nearly eight times faster than the M1.\n\nThe Mac Studio and Studio Display\n\nApple unveiled new desktop computers – the Mac Studio and Studio Display – that will use its M1 Max and M1 Ultra chips.\n\nThanks to Apple’s in-house chips, the Mac Studio has a strikingly small form factor — just 7.7 inches by 3.7 inches. It will also be quieter, faster and more energy efficient than other high-end Macs. The Mac Studio with the M1 Ultra is expected to be 90% faster than the company’s powerful 16-core Mac Pro.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mac Studio with M1 Max will have up to 64 GB of unified memory, and the M1 Ultra will have up to 128 GB of memory.\n\nThe new Mac Studio Brooks Kraft/Apple\n\nThe Mac Studio comes with four thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, ethernet and HDMI ports and a pro audio jack on the back. The front of the device will feature an SD card reader and either USB-C or thunderbolt ports on the front, depending on the model.\n\nThe Studio Display comes with a 27-inch screen and a 5K retina display. It also boasts a 12 megapixel camera that supports Apple’s Center Stage feature for improved video calls, as well as spatial audio capabilities.\n\nThe Mac Studio with M1 Max will start at $1,999 and the device with the M1 Ultra will start at $3,999. The Mac Studio Display will start at $1,599. The line is now available for pre-orders and will be available March 18.\n\nCook kicked off the event by previewing some new content coming to Apple TV+ later this year and reviewed some of its existing popular content, including the film Coda, which has been nominated for the Oscar in Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor.\n\nFriday night baseball is also coming to Apple TV+. Each Friday, two Major League Baseball games will be streamed exclusively on Apple TV+, Cook said.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/12/28/apple-iphone-best-selling-tech-device-year-work-home-helped/4048111001/", "title": "Apple iPhone best selling tech device of year. Work from home helped", "text": "Once again, the best-selling tech product of 2020 was Apple's iPhone – topping the phone's sales in 2019 – despite being a pandemic year when so many people were thrown out of work and money was harder to come by.\n\nThat's the projection from Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, who tracks sales for USA TODAY in an exclusive chart.\n\nAt 195 million units, that bests Apple's 2019 iPhone sales of 185 million units. Ives credits the increase in sales to the work and learn from home trend that saw so many people need to upgrade their tech gear.\n\nThat Apple was able to see an increase for a product that ranges from $399 to $1,099 during the COVID crisis was a \"shock,\" Ives says. \"It just speaks to the pent-up demand Apple has created in the install base,\" which totals over 1 billion users.\n\nIn 2020, Apple introduced 4 new iPhones in the fall, the iPhone 12 Mini ($699), iPhone 12 ($799), iPhone 12 Pro ($999) and iPhone 12 Pro Max ($1,099.)\n\nIves charts specific brands, vs. categories. Televisions and PCs are both huge categories in total, but with many, many players.\n\nAccording to Strategy Analytics, about 212 million laptops will sell in 2020, up 23% from the prior year, with 181 million tablets, up 13%. \"Laptops and tablets have soared this year, due to virus-led homeworking and stay-at-home orders,\" says Neil Mawston, an analyst with Strategy Analytics.\n\nAbout 38.6 million TVs were projected to sell in 2020, the Consumer Technology Association says.\n\nAnd while the new Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Xbox were at the top of many, many wish lists for the year, they were hard to get. The companies were supply constrained and didn't make enough units to get on Ives' list.\n\nHow other best-sellers fared:\n\nApple Airpods\n\nThe best-selling headphone product (AirPods and AirPods Pro) saw its sales increase by nearly one-third, to 91 million units, up from 65 million in 2019. In December Apple introduced a new entry to the AirPods line, with a $550 over-the-ear headphone called AirPods Max.\n\niPad\n\nApple's tablet had a resurgence in 2020, moving from No. 4 to No. 3, again, a beneficiary of the work and learn from home trend, with projected sales of 55 million units, up from 40 million in 2019. In 2020 Apple introduced new iPad units, the iPad Air ($599) and iPad ($329) with faster processing chips.\n\nEcho\n\nDoes everybody who wants a talking speaker already own one? That's the dilemma for Amazon, which saw its sales fall from 60 million units in 2019 to a projected 40 million. Amazon went on a major refresh in 2020, changing the coffee can and hockey puck shapes of the Echo and Echo Dot into devices that looked like bowling balls. Amazon has 5 Echo speakers available, from the $99 top of the line Echo down to the Dot.\n\nSamsung Galaxy\n\nSamsung's Galaxy smartphone saw a slight increase, with sales of 36 million, up from 30 million the previous year. The Galaxy S series is the second best-selling phone to the iPhone in the United States. This year Samsung introduced so many new models that when combined with its entry-level A line, the Z Fold and Z Flip phones, the company had 15 different phones available for purchase.\n\nApple Watch\n\nWith the new Series 6 Watch, Apple touted the ability to check blood oxygen levels and introduced a new family plan that enabled parents to buy watches for their kids without having to pair them to iPhones.Apple saw its Watch sales increase from 25 million to 31 million in 2020.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/tech/apple-september-event-highlights-trends", "title": "Apple unveils new iPhones, Apple Watches and AirPods | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nApple unveiled its new iPhone 14 lineup at a press event on Wednesday, along with three new Apple Watch models, an update to its popular AirPods product line and a feature that could save lives when cell service isn’t available.\n\nAt a closely-watched event from its headquarters in Cupertino, California, Apple showed off four new smartphones, including a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus model and an updated iPhone 14 Pro that rethinks the much-maligned notch. In typical Apple fashion, the devices also offer better battery life and camera features than the year prior.\n\nThe biggest surprise, however, may be the price: The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will start at $799 and $899, respectively, the same starting prices as last year’s models. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max start at $999 and $1099, respectively, also unchanged from the year prior. Analysts widely predicted Apple would hike the price of the premium models by $100.\n\n“It is impressive that Apple has maintained year-on-year pricing parity on the new iPhone 14 devices in the US,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight. “We had anticipated that inflation, increased production and component costs, and other expenses such as more expensive shipping would have led Apple to increase its retail pricing.”\n\nFor Apple, the stakes are always high to convince customers to upgrade devices, and especially the iPhone, which remains its central product. That task is potentially made more difficult this year by broader economic jitters, including fears of a looming recession.\n\nApple unveils the new iPhone 14 product line at a big press event on Wednesday. Apple\n\nThroughout the event, Apple appeared to alternate between pitching its suite of products as tools for living our best lives and also for avoiding any number of ills that may befall customers in an uncertain world, ranging from car crashes to getting stranded in the wild.\n\nApple announced several new Apple Watch models, including a higher-end version that costs $799 and is designed to support the needs of a rarefied group of outdoor enthusiasts. It also added an option for its watches to detect when a user has been in a car crash, as well as a satellite connectivity feature for phones, which is intended to help people communicate when their cell service isn’t working.\n\nHere are the big highlights from the event:\n\nThe new iPhone 14 lineup\n\nApple unveiled four new smartphones, including the new iPhone 14 with a 6.1-inch screen and the iPhone 14 Plus with a larger 6.7-inch screen.\n\nThe new iPhone 14 features a 12 MP main camera with bigger pixels, a faster aperture and improved sensors. It also uses the same chip as last year’s iPhone 13 Pro model (the A15), the first time it’s repeated a chip in years.\n\nFor the first time, however, the new front camera has auto focus, allowing it to focus at multiple distances in low light for better individual and group selfies. It also has a new action mode that lets users keep videos stable while moving.\n\nApple’s new Pro line features an always-on display and the ability to receive notifications and activities through what the company is calling “the dynamic island,” the much polarizing notch at the top of the phone that is now considered a feature. The Pro line also comes with the first-ever 48 MP camera on an iPhone.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro. Apple\n\nIn a notable shift, the iPhone 14 lineup also eliminates the need for a physical SIM card and instead uses a digital “e-SIM” card. Now, users can store multiple e-SIMs on the same device and have multiple cellular plans and phone numbers on the same phone. It also prevents others from removing the physical SIM card if your iPhone is lost or stolen. Apple said all US models of the iPhone will no longer have the SIM tray.\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will come in five colors: midnight, starlight, blue, purple and red.\n\nNew Apple Watches\n\nApple unveiled three new smartwatches at the event: the Series 8, the SE and the Ultra.\n\nAt the high end, the Ultra model is designed to help users track endurance training, scuba diving adventures and triathlons. The device gets about 36 hours on a single charge, is more water resistant and boasts an enhanced compass that can work at night, in the ocean and other conditions.\n\nAt the low end, Apple updated the SE to be up to 20% faster than the prior version. It starts at $249 for GPS models and $299 for cellular models.\n\nApple Watch Series 8. Apple\n\nAnd in the middle is the Series 8 model, which starts at $399. Like prior versions of Apple’s smartwatch, the Series 8 is intended to motivate users to stay active and fit. Apple also emphasized the Watch’s features for women’s health, with revamped period cycle tracking tools that can predict ovulation. The tracking data is kept on each device and only accessible through a passcode or face ID, according to the company. Apple does not have a key to encrypted data and so it cannot access it without your express permission.\n\nThe announcement comes as data security for women has become a major flashpoint in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nNew AirPods Pro 2\n\nApple showed off its latest generation of AirPods Pro, one of its bigger breakout products of recent years. The new AirPods Pro will have six hours of listening time with a single charge, better than the original version. Each headphone and the case itself are now equipped to make a noise to help you find it. And a light swipe up and down the headphone will increase or decrease volume.\n\nThe new AirPods Pro. Apple\n\nAirPods Pro now comes with improved dynamic noise-cancellation technology, and can cancel out double the amount of noise compared to the original version. Meanwhile, a new adaptive transparency mode aims to reduce harsh environmental noise.\n\nThe AirPods Pro 2 cost $249 and hit stores on Friday.\n\nSatellite connectivity for emergency situations\n\nWhile Apple did not unveil any groundbreaking new hardware products, at least one new feature could prove to be a game changer for customers — albeit in rare situations.\n\nThe new Emergency SOS via Satellite feature, which Apple said has been in the works for years, was designed and built specifically for iPhone 14 devices to connect to satellites when not near a terrestrial tower. By allowing users to point their device toward a satellite, which the phone will help locate, users will be able to send and receive information to get emergency help.\n\nThe company said it created a short text compression mechanism to condense messages that take about 15 seconds to send if a user has a clear view of the sky. (It may take a few minutes longer if something like foliage is in the way.)\n\nApple said local providers will be alerted to help call for help.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/10/25/iphone-buyers-guide-2018-what-buy-what-not-buy/1750995002/", "title": "Looking for a new iPhone? Here's what you should – and shouldn't ...", "text": "With the iPhone XR now on sale, Apple's 2018 iPhone lineup is seemingly complete for the holidays. Now comes the fun – or hard – part if you're in need of a new iPhone: picking out which one you should buy.\n\nApple's current list of phones goes from the $449 32GB iPhone 7 to $1,449 for the 512GB iPhone XS Max, offering a wide range of options at a variety of prices.\n\nHere's a guide to help you navigate through them.\n\nNote: This guide focuses on new iPhones and isn't factoring trade-ins that could bring the prices down depending on your store or carrier. We also aren't talking about Android devices, though there are plenty of great options for that platform, too.\n\nLike a home button? Get an iPhone 8\n\nIf you like a home button your choices are simple: an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus or an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus.\n\nAt $599, the iPhone 8 costs $150 more than the iPhone 7 (and the $699 8 Plus is $130 more than the 7 Plus). As far as features and design, the differences between the two lines are fairly minor. The screens are the same sizes and resolutions, the camera improvements on the 8 line aren't terribly significant, and all devices are water resistant and lack a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nSo why spend the extra money? Two reasons: the faster processor and the improved storage capacities.\n\nToday, people are holding onto their phones for longer than the traditional two-year upgrade cycle of the past decade. With these purchases now stretching further, it makes sense to get a device that is better equipped. Whereas Android devices let you augment storage with memory cards, you can't do that with iPhones (though iCloud and Google Photos are good options for backing things up to the cloud). You also can't upgrade the processor.\n\nThis makes the price difference, which gets you 64GB of storage on a base 8 or 8 Plus as well as Apple's A11 processor, all the more worthwhile in the long run.\n\nWant a \"new\" iPhone? Look at the XR\n\nApple's latest iPhones are a far departure in design from the home button days of the original.\n\nSuccessors to last year's iPhone X, all three of Apple's latest iPhone's – the XS, XS Max and newly released XR – all drop the home button for larger edge-to-edge displays, have much-improved cameras and run faster processors.\n\nFor many, the $749 iPhone XR will be the right iPhone to buy. Its LCD display (Apple calls it \"Liquid Retina\") isn't as sharp as the fancier OLED displays on the XS and XS Max, and it lacks the second telephoto camera on the back for improved portrait photos.\n\nBut that's not to say the XR is a bad phone. The biggest of the differences, the display, is actually pretty good. So good, in fact, that USA TODAY's Ed Baig in his review noted that \"many of you would only notice the display discrepancies if you laid an XS or XS Max next to an XR, side by side, if even at that.\"\n\nAt 6.1 inches, the display is right in between the XS's 5.8-inch screen and the 6.5-inch display of the XS Max. Size-wise, it's slightly larger than a regular iPhone 6-7-8 and slightly smaller than one of the Plus varieties.\n\nIt has the same processor, similar storage capacities and packs many of the features the XS models have including water resistance and wireless charging (though the XS is a bit stronger on the water-resistance side). Because of its lower-resolution display compared to the OLED models, Apple also says the XR will actually have better battery life.\n\nOver the course of a 24-month payment plan, the difference between the XR and XS is over $10 per month. For what for many might not be a major difference in screen and camera, you will likely be better off saving your money and going with the XR.\n\nWant a big-screen phone? Get the XS Max\n\nIt makes the most sense to buy the XS if you want the largest display you can get on an iPhone. At 6.5 inches, the XS Max packs one of the largest screens available on a phone in the U.S. today.\n\nMost impressive with the XS Max, however, is that the massive display is actually quite compact. While the screen is an inch larger than the 8 Plus, the phones are roughly the same size because of the removal of the home button and top bezel.\n\nAt $1,099 for the 64GB version, the XS Max isn't cheap. But if you want all the latest Apple has to offer on the largest iPhone screen yet, you'll be very happy with the XS Max.\n\nWhat to avoid: Buying a new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus and the iPhone X\n\nAs mentioned above, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are bad options both for the smaller storage offered and their weaker processors. Assuming you hold on to your phone for more than two years, you'll really appreciate this then.\n\nWhen Apple's new iPhones were announced in September, plenty of people asked about trying to buy an iPhone X on a discount from a carrier.\n\nFor $899.99 for the 64GB X, buying last year's iPhone at a $100 discount isn't much of a savings. For the extra $100, or just over $4 per month on a 24-month payment plan, you'd get the improved XS. For $150 less, you'd sacrifice the OLED display but get a faster phone in the XR.\n\nAs for Apple's smaller iPhone SE? While not officially sold by Apple, you can still find the phone at a number of carriers and prepaid providers. If you want a smaller iPhone or need a replacement iPhone for cheap, the SE isn't a bad choice particularly if you find it for less than $200.\n\nJust remember that the phone you are getting doesn't just have a 4-inch display, but runs a now roughly 3-year-old processor and specs. Plus, a successor has been heavily rumored to be around the corner, possibly in 2019.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/25"}]}
