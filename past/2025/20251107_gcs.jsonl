Andrew Cuomo, later conceded in a combative speech to supporters.\n\nBefore a roaring crowd at the Brooklyn Paramount theater, Mamdani thanked young New Yorkers for believing \"that the promise of a better future is not a relic of the past\" in a speech that shouted out \"Yemeni cab drivers and Mexican abuelas\" among the workers who deliver the city's packages, staff its warehouses and sweat in its kitchens.\n\n“We are breathing in the air of a city that has been reborn,” he said.\n\n'We sent a message.' Five takeaways from Democrats' 2025 elections sweep\n\n\"I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life,\" Mamdani said. “But let tonight be the final time I utter his name as we turn the page on politics that abandons the many and answers only to the few.”\n\nMamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens, was at 1% in the polls when he launched an upstart campaign focused on the cost of living. He offered unabashedly left-leaning proposals including a rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments, free buses and universal child care, paid for by taxes on the city’s wealthiest. Several of the city's billionaires donated millions of dollars on attack ads against him.\n\nCuomo, the 67-year-old inheritor of a storied New York political name, was considered unbeatable until Mamdani, 34, won an upset in the Democratic primary in June.\n\nThe general election campaign, which Cuomo contested as an independent, was marked by fighting over Mamdani’s proposals and his past criticisms of Israel and the New York Police Department.\n\nIn addition to some fellow Democrats objecting to him, Mamdani drew the ire of President Donald Trump, a Queens native, and other Republicans who have attacked Mamdani − a Ugandan immigrant and a Muslim − with incendiary allegations that he supports terrorism. Some of those attacks were echoed by Cuomo, who Trump endorsed.\n\n\"This was a change election,\" political consultant Suri Kasirer told USA TODAY, noting record voter turnout and Mamdani's grass roots campaign.\n\nWhen Mamdani replaces embattled incumbent Mayor Eric Adams on Jan. 1, he will have to navigate threats by the Trump administration to pull federal funds from New York and convince state lawmakers to approve his plans for taxing and spending.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nMamdani dares Trump\n\nZohran Mamdani dared President Donald Trump to keep going after him in a combative speech after his Nov. 4 New York City mayoral election victory.\n\nMamdani, the subject of months of attacks from the president, called Trump out by name as the democratic socialist hailed a “mandate for change” with his victory.\n\n“If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,” Mamdani, 34, said. “And if there is any way to defeat a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.”\n\nHe added: “This is not only how we stop Trump ‒ it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n\nTrump had endorsed Mamdani's chief opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if the young democratic socialist was elected.\n\nAfter the race was called for Mamdani, Trump left a four-word post on Truth Social: \"…AND SO IT BEGINS!\"\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Eduardo Cuevas\n\nBad Bunny and the Black Eyes Peas show a younger New York choosing the mayor\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's election night victory party reflected the new coalition that has brought him to power. A racially diverse − but decidedly young-skewing − filled the Paramount Theater in Brooklyn.\n\nLocated on the border of the rapidly developing Downtown Brooklyn and the once majority-Black, now heavily gentrified Fort Greene neighborhood, the 2,700-capacity venue is in one of the areas where progressive young professionals drove Mamdani to victory.\n\nAs election results trickled in, he 34-year-old democratic socialist's supporters began filling the dance floor in front of a DJ playing remixes of Bad Bunny’s “Nueva Yol,” the Black Eyed Peas, classic New York hip hop like 50 Cent’s \"Many Men,” old R&B, and Afro-beats.\n\nThe crowd also sang along to English singer Natasha Bedingfield’s early-aughts “Unwritten,\" and hear bhangra blasting from the speakers.\n\n--Eduardo Cuevas and Ben Adler\n\nTears and a vision for New York City\n\nShortly after Zohran Mamdani exited the stage with his wife, mother and father, the crowd lingered as Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s Motown ballad, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” played.\n\nRebuking Trump, California passes Prop 50 to redistrict in favor of Democrats\n\nTeary-eyed, Brooklyn resident Katie Deray, 37, wore a blue “Iranians for Zohran” tee, in English and Farsi. She had black bows in her hair with “Z” stickers on them.\n\nAs the daughter of an Iranian immigrant, she said Mamdani was “so transparent and unapologetically himself” during the campaign,, even as he faced what he called racist and Islamophobic attacks. “It’s a beautiful thing,” she said.\n\nDeray, a social worker, came to support Mamdani's plans for a “Department of Community Safety,” to help respond to certain emergency calls as an alternative to the NYPD. She said some voters were concerned about 34-year-old Mamdani's age, she saw it as an asset that would help him think differently.\n\nMamdani, she said, wasn’t “encumbered by the mechanisms of the political structure that are inevitable, to a degree,” she said.\n\n-- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMamdani says New Yorkers delivered a ‘mandate for change’\n\nMamdani hailed his victory as a “mandate for change” after winning New York City’s mayoral election with more than 50% of the vote.\n\n“You have delivered a mandate for a new kind of politics, a mandate for a city we can afford and a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that,” the 34-year-old democratic socialist said in his remarks.\n\nMamdani kicked off his election speech by quoting the early 20th century United States labor leader Eugene V. Debs, the founder of the Socialist Party of America more than a century ago.\n\n\"As Eugene Debs once said, I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity,” Mamdani said.\n\nMamdani took a jab at his chief election opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who finished about 9 percentage points behind Mamdani.\n\n\"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" he said. \"I wish Andrew Cuomo the best in private life. But let tonight be the final time I utter his name.\"\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nMamdani takes the stage\n\nThe Brooklyn Paramount has erupted in roars as Zohran Mamdani takes the stage.\n\nCuomo: Mamdani's promises 'cannot be met'\n\nSpeaking to supporters at his election night party in Midtown Manhattan, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo celebrated his campaign's effort and the 42% of a record-high turnout it received.\n\n\"This campaign was the right fight to wage,\" Cuomo said to enthusiastic applause.\n\nThe crowd booed when he congratulated Mamdani. \"That is not right, and that is not us,\" Cuomo chastised his audience.\n\n\"This campaign was to contest the philosophies that are shaping the Democratic party, the future of this city, and the future of this country,\" Cuomo said. \"This coalition transcended normal partisan politics, it brought together Democrats and Republicans and independents joined together by the simple fact that their first allegiance is as citizens of New York City.\"\n\n\"More than half of New Yorkers did not vote to support an agenda that makes promises that cannot be met,\" he added, suggesting Mamdani would fall short of winning 50% of the vote.\n\n\"We are a nation of laws and we believe in law and order and we need the police to keep society safe,\" he said. \"We will not make the NYPD the enemy.\"\n\n\"New York City heard us and we will be the better for it,\" he concluded.\n\n--Ben Adler\n\nMayor Eric Adams congratulates Zohran Mamdani\n\nOutgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who endorsed Andrew Cuomo, congratulated Mamdani on his win in a video posted to social media.\n\nAdams pledged to help Mamdani with the transition, and called the mayor of New York City one of the “most difficult” and “greatest” jobs on the globe.\n\nThe mayor then pivoted to address voters who feared a Mamdani administration.\n\n“To all those communities who voted for someone else: we understand your concerns, we understand your fears, we understand the anxiety that you are feeling,” he said, “But this is our democracy, and as our democracy, we will move together to ensure this city is the city that is the voices for everyone.”\n\nCalling himself the “former mayor” and referencing his prior career in law enforcement, Adams said he will remain committed to residents’ safety.\n\nAdams will remain mayor until Mamdani is sworn in on New Year's Day.\n\n--Kathryn Palmer\n\nReveling in Mamdani's ground-breaking identity\n\nSabah Merchant, 31, stood toward the back of Zohran Mamdani’s election night party. Her brother worked on Mamdani’s campaigns, including when he ran for state Assembly and won in 2020.\n\nThe importance of Mamdani as the first Muslim and South Asian mayor, and someone who immigrated to the country as a child, wasn’t lost on Merchant, who is a second-generation American.\n\n“It’s amazing seeing someone with that identity bringing an entire city of diverse communities together,” said Merchant, who works in policy at a nonprofit.\n\nMamdani, she said, “has embraced New York City as his own and actually contributed meaningfully to it. I’m excited to see what doors he can open for others.”\n\n-- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nLikely GOP candidate for governor puts Mamdani at center of 2026 race\n\nGOP U.S. representative and potential candidate for governor, Elise Stefanik, said in a statement that the \"only way to save our great state and provide a check on this insanity is to elect a Republican Governor in 2026.\n\nStefanik said that under Gov. Kathy Hochul’s \"weak catastrophic leadership, New York City has now fallen to a pro-Hamas, Defund the Police, Tax Hiking, Antisemite Jihadist Communist.\"\n\nMamdani is a democratic socialist, not a communist, and he denies accusations that he is antisemitic or supports Islamist violence, calling such claims Islamophobic.\n\nStefanik has teased a race for governor for months, but has said she would not make an announcement about her decision until after the 2025 election.\n\n--Sarah D. Wire\n\nClassic hip hop, Bad Bunny, Natasha Bedingfield as Mamdani party continues\n\nThe Zohran Mamdani watch party has DJ remixing quintessential New York hip hop − think 50 Cent’s \"Many Men” and Bad Bunny’s hit “Nuevayol,” which takes from a Nuyorican salsa classic. The crowd sang along to Natasha Bedingfield’s early-aughts classic, “Unwritten.”\n\nSupporters, who are noticeably younger, are dancing through scores of press searching for interviews, politicos catching up, and cheers when new voting numbers roll on the screen above.\n\nAt one point, a crowd of younger supporters circled around the middle of the floor to chant, “We believe that we have won.\"\n\nJust after 10:30 p.m., Lil Wayne's \"A Milli\" played briefly. Results showed Mamdani has garnered more than 1 million votes in the historic turnout election.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nJubilation on Mamdani's home turf\n\nMamdani supporters packed the sidewalks on Steinway Street in the Astoria neighborhood in Queens, the future mayor's home district, cheering as cars rolled by honking their horns and waving Zohran signs.\n\nAt a watch party inside the Mokafe coffeehouse,as Mamdani was called the winner, the crowd erupted in cheers and tears.\n\nMauree Akhi, of the Long Island suburbs, shook with emotion, and wiped away tears.\n\n“Growing up post 9/11, as children we felt constantly scared to be who we are, to be Muslim, to wear a hijab. We were other-ized in this city of immigrants and today it’s a win for every one of us in this city,” he said.\n\n-- Hannan Adely\n\nKendrick Lamar’s 'Not Like Us' booms as Mamdani supporters celebrate\n\nBrooklyn native Julio Herrera, 27, danced to Kendrick Lamar’ hit diss track “Not Like Us” minutes after the election was called for Zohran Mamdani. Herrera, part of the Black Leadership Action Coalition, said his organization endorsed Mamdani in the Democratic primary. Herrera cited Mamdani's messaging about affordability − an issue that spans race, ethnicity and party lines in the diverse city.\n\nHerrera felt validated, adding an expletive.\n\n“This isn’t just like a New York situation,” he said. “This is a phenomenon across the country, across the world.”\n\nA few feet away from Herrera, Ali Hasan, an 11-year-old from San Jose, California, looked up, watching the screens with his mother, as the results streamed in. As someone who is also Muslim, Hasan said, “It means that I can be like him when I grow up.”\n\n-- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nRNC chair says voters will punish Democrats for electing Mamdani\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Joe Gruters said in a statement that by electing Zohran Mamdani as New York City Mayor, “Democrats have officially handed New York City over to a self-proclaimed Communist, and hardworking families will be the ones paying the price.”\n\n“Zohran Mamdani’s radical agenda will push businesses out, drain taxpayers dry, and drive one of America’s greatest cities into lawlessness. His election is proof that the Democrat Party has abandoned common sense and tied themselves to extremism. Next year, Democrats will be held accountable by voters for embracing Mamdani’s far-left agenda and the consequences it will bring,\" Gruters added.\n\n--Sarah D. Wire\n\nAOC calls Mamdani 'a historic candidate'\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters at Mamdani's victory party that \"we showed we're not going to be bullied.\"\n\nAsked if Mamdani is the future of the Democratic Party, she said \"I think he's the next mayor of New York City.\"\n\n\"He is a bright light showing the future path for championing working families in New York,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"I know for Zohran, it's not about Democrat, Republican, or independent, it's about how we help people.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez added that President Trump \"knows that if you mess with New York, you mess with the whole country, and that this is a city that doesn't fight back.\"\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nManhattan DA who led Trump’s hush money conviction wins reelection\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has won reelection, according to local outlet NY1 and Associated Press.\n\nBragg, a Democrat, was the first Black district attorney elected to the office in 2021 and earned the national spotlight in recent years for leading the hush money trial against President Donald Trump.\n\nA 12-person Manhattan jury unanimously convicted Trump in May 2024, when he was no longer in office, on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a 2016 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The president’s legal team is attempting to appeal the decision.\n\n-Kathryn Palmer\n\nMamdani leads with majority of early votes cast\n\nNY1, the local news channel owned by Spectrum cable, is reporting that the New York City Board of Elections has released early voting totals. They are:\n\nMamdani 422,716 (51.5%)\n\n422,716 (51.5%) Cuomo 325,497 (39.7%)\n\n325,497 (39.7%) Sliwa 65,810 (8%)\n\nThis is 36.13% of the expected vote total of over 2 million cast. If the trend continues among absentee ballots and votes cast on Election Day, Mamdani will be the winner.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nSliwa concedes, with a warning for Mamdani\n\nSpeaking to his supporters at his election night party on Manhattan's Upper West Side, Curtis Sliwa appeared to concede his defeat and Mamdani's likely victory.\n\n\"We have a mayor-elect, obviously I wish him good luck,\" Sliwa said. \"\n\n\"We have spent two years organizing this movement. it's not just Republicans or Democrats or independents.,\" Sliwa added, before listing his eclectic constituency, which he described as including animal lovers and the homeless.\n\n\"We will not surrender, we will not retreat,\" he said. \"let me warn our new leader: if you try to implement socialism, if you try to render our police impotent... we are not only organizing, we are mobilizing and we will become the mayor-elect and his supporters worst enemies.\"\n\nSliwa also alluded to entreaties he has said he received from wealthy Cuomo backers to drop out.\n\n\"A person said to me, 'c'mon Curtis, everybody has a price. But guess what? We don't have a price. We are not for sale. we are the people.\"\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nRecord turnout will give the winner a mandate, state senator says\n\nState Sen. Mike Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens who has endorsed Mamdani, said whoever wins the race will have a mandate even if they don't cross 50%.\n\n“I think the bigger number is not the margin of victory, it’s the turnout,” Gianaris, old reporters on the floor of the Mamdani election night party before results began trickling in. \"It's astounding.\"\n\nPreliminary voting numbers indicate the highest turnout in decades in a mayoral election in New York. “Whoever comes out of this, the victor is gonna have quite a mandate,” Gianaris said.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nPolls close in NYC and the vote count begins\n\nPoll workers across New York's five boroughs will begin counting the more than 2 million votes cast in the 2025 mayoral election.\n\nNew York voter turnout tops 2 million\n\nNew York has seen its biggest voter turnout in 56 years, the city Board of Election reported.\n\n\"We officially hit TWO MILLION votes - first time since 1969!\" the board said in a social media post at 8:45 p.m. local time.\n\nThe board noted that anyone waiting on line when the polls close at 9 p.m. will be allowed to vote.\n\nWhen will we know who won the NYC mayoral election?\n\nWhile results from other off-year races start to trickle in, those watching the NYC race will need to wait a bit longer for returns.\n\nPolls close at 9pm ET, after which the vote count begins.\n\n-Kathryn Palmer\n\nForeign press packs into Mamdani election night party\n\nJust before polls close at 9 p.m., scores of international, national and local press clamored to get inside the Brooklyn Paramount theaterin downtown Brooklyn. The venue, built in 1928, has capacity for 2,700 people and at least two bars, according to Brooklyn Magazine.\n\nThe event space, with balcony seating and soaring blue ceilings, had an open floor looking out to a stage with signage for Zohran. Behind the podium were flags for the city of New York and a large screen for Spectrum News 1, the local New York television station, playing on live.\n\nThe city mayor's race has garnered international attention after Mamdani's shock win in the June Democratic primary.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nHope, vibes in Brooklyn deli near Mamdani campaign party\n\nInside Munch Gourmet Market, a deli just a block from Mamdani’s election night party at the Brooklyn Paramount theater, Bronx resident Helmi Kassim said he likes the vibes in the race for mayor.\n\n“Am I entitled to trust my vibes?” Kassim, 45, who is second-in-command at his brother’s deli, said from behind the counter. “No, I trust my vibes. That’s where my heart is.”\n\nKassim said Mamdani had given him new hope in politics.\n\nHe makes minimum wage and drives an hour-and-a-half from his home in the Bronx to the deli, six days a week and has put his three children through college. Kassim, a Muslim, like Mamdani, said he prays five times a day.\n\n“I go through a pain just to be honorable and have dignity,” he said. “I feel like we share that. And when everybody's going against him, he's still standing. That’s God telling me, like, ‘Listen, this guy's special.’”\n\nKassim said he voted early for Mamdani. When he gets off work at 10 p.m., he will drive home to the Bronx, with a large sign for Mamdani on his dashboard.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nNYC sees record turnout in mayor's race\n\nPolls don't close until 9 p.m. ET, but New Yorkers have already voted in record numbers, according to city Board of Elections data.\n\nWith nearly 1.75 million voting check-ins as of 6 p.m. local time, the results mark a high in voting for mayor this century. The century’s previous record was in 2001, when over 1.5 million votes were cast in the election that saw Mike Bloomberg first win office. Early voting numbers also reached historic highs this election.\n\nIn 2021, around 1.15 million people voted in the general election that saw Eric Adams win in an uncompetitive race against Republican Curtis Sliwa after winning a nail-biter Democratic primary.\n\nOff-year elections tend to have lower turnout, including in New York City. On this year’s ballot, New Yorkers are also deciding whether to move some elections, including the mayor’s race, to coincide with even-year presidential elections. Proponents, including Adams’ City Charter Revision Commission, say this could boost turnout.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMayor Eric Adams, four years after swooping to victory, walks alone to polls\n\nFour years ago, Eric Adams coasted to victory in the New York City mayoral election after winning in the Democratic primary. As the city’s second Black mayor, Adams − a former police officer seen as a political moderate − was considered by some to be the future of the Democratic Party before scandals rocked his administration.\n\nThis Election Day, video showed Adams, now 65, walking alone in untucked white dress shirt with his hands in his pockets to his polling place at P.S. 81 in Brooklyn. His security flanked him crossing the street.\n\nAfter facing federal corruption charges that the Trump Justice Department later dropped, Adams skipped the June Democratic primary and ran as an independent before ending his long-shot reelection bid in September. He later endorsed Cuomo − whom he once called “a snake and a liar” − against Mamdani, the Democratic nominee.\n\nAdams' name remains on the ballot, on an independent line. Fabien Levy, Adams' spokesperson, said he supported Cuomo.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nSchumer mum on who he voted for\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the senior senator from New York, declined to say who he voted for.\n\nWhen asked at a press conference on Capitol Hill whether he voted for the Democratic candidate, Mamdani, or for Cuomo, the former Democratic governor running as an independent, Schumer simply said he voted.\n\n\"Look, I voted and I look forward to working with the next mayor to help New York City,” Schumer said.\n\n–Rebecca Morin\n\nWho do the city’s past (living) mayors support? Split, just like they are about baseball.\n\nNew York’s former mayors are as divided about the race to lead City Hall as they are about which baseball team to back. Here's where the living former mayors and the current hizzoner stand on the election and baseball.\n\nNone of the living former mayors or mayoral hopefuls’ teams made it to this year's World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who originated in Brooklyn, won after midnight early Sunday morning, Nov. 2.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhite House calls Mamdani ‘irresponsible’ over bomb-threat allegations\n\nAfter Mamdani linked Trump to bomb threats at New Jersey polling places, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the candidate “irresponsible.”\n\nMamdani called the bomb threats part of voter intimidation like Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud.\n\n“I think they are completely irresponsible and they are based on zero evidence,” Leavitt told reporters Tuesday at the White House.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nEarly voting saw record turnout\n\nIn arguably the buzziest mayoral race in New York history, New Yorkers have recorded the highest turnout in the city's history in the general election.\n\nFinal New York City Board of Elections tallies showed over 735,000 check-ins in the early voting period from Oct. 25 to Nov. 2. In 2021, the last time the city elected its mayor, more than 169,000 people cast their ballots during early voting, four times less than in 2025.\n\nSunday, Nov. 2 − the final day for New Yorkers to cast their ballots in early voting before the Nov. 4 election − marked the highest early voting day in New York City history, elections officials announced in a Monday news release.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas and Jay Stahl\n\nWhat is a democratic socialist?\n\nLike Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Mamdani identifies as a democratic socialist. And like Ocasio-Cortez, he belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nDemocratic socialists believe that the government and economy should be run for the benefit of the public rather than private profit. They typically favor an enhanced social safety net such as universal health insurance provided by the government and paid for with higher taxes on the rich.\n\nUnlike communism and other authoritarian systems of government, democratic socialists believe in democracy. Sanders has pointed to the social democracies in Scandinavia as models he would emulate in the United States.\n\n−Ben Adler\n\nVoters on both sides focused on cost of living\n\nMamdani reshaped the New York City mayoral race by focusing on cost of living in the notoriously expensive city.\n\nInwood resident Gisselee Rivera, 20, voted for Mamdani, citing cost of living as the top issue for her and her parents. She works in an after-school program for kids, and she thought Mamdani's proposed rent freeze would help her family. She said she noticed Mamdani talking to people and businesses across different neighborhoods on social media, and he also campaigned heavily in her neighborhood during the primary.\n\n“It gives you a different idea of how the actual neighborhood is working,” Rivera said.\n\nBronx resident Zoila Cruz, 59, had a more pessimistic view and said she was leaning toward voting for Cuomo. Cruz had two jobs as a home attendant, but recently lost work in one job and said she struggles to keep up with rising expenses.\n\n“Every day is worse,” she said in Spanish. “The economy, the cost of living, the rent.”\n\nCruz wasn't confident that Cuomo could improve things, but she sided with him more than the others. She thought Mamdani’s proposal for free buses was unrealistic. “Es una locura, verdad, mi amor?” Cruz said. It’s crazy, right, my love?\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nIn Manhattan Latino hub, voters divided\n\nIn northern Manhattan, which has the highest concentration of Dominicans in the United States, voters appeared split between Mamdani’s vision and Cuomo’s experience. The area is represented by Democratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat, the first Dominican in Congress, who has backed Mamdani in the general election after endorsing Cuomo in the primary. The area swung to Mamdani in the primary.\n\n“I’m going to vote for the youth and something new,” Jose Rodriguez, 72, a retiree, said in Spanish outside of the Washington Heights Academy in the Inwood neighborhood on a windy Election Day morning. His family encouraged him to vote for Mamdani. Rodriguez said he was most concerned about public safety and homelessness, and thought Mamdani could make a change as opposed to Cuomo, who he said represented the old political class.\n\nCell phone vendor Hector Ferreira, 49, planned to cast his vote for Cuomo. Mamdani was too liberal and New York had already gone too left, Ferreira said in Spanish. Ferreira was in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic capital, during the primary and didn’t vote then. But Cuomo, he said, “has the experience that New York City needs right now to fight crime and to improve quality of life.”\n\nA year ago, Ferreira voted for President Donald Trump to fix the economy, which Ferreira blamed on former President Joe Biden. Inwood, like many working-class Latino communities, voted in record numbers for Trump. Mamdani has tried to bring back these voters to Democrats, while Cuomo has made appeals to conservatives to join his side.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMusk points out Mamdani appears on ballot twice. That's normal for New York.\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire Tesla owner who has endorsed Cuomo, wrongly suggested that because Zohran Mamdani is listed twice on the ballot, he could win twice.\n\nNew York allows candidates' names to appear on multiple ballot lines to reflect various party endorsements, which is often used as a way to give support for parties or causes outside of the traditional two-party system. But New Yorkers can only vote for a single candidate, as their ballot indicates.\n\nFor example, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa appears on both the GOP ballot line and Protect Animals ballot line. Sliwa’s wife Nancy, an animal welfare advocate, reportedly voted for her husband under the Protect Animals line.\n\nMamdani appears as the Democratic nominee and also as the candidate for the left-leaning Working Families Party. Independent candidate Cuomo is listed once, on the Fight and Deliver line.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nCuomo apologizes for COVID-19 deaths but says he 'did nothing wrong'\n\nCuomo, in an Election Day morning appearance on Fox News, said he was sorry to people whose loved ones died from COVID-19 while he was governor.\n\n\"I apologize for any family that lost a loved one during that time. It was on my watch, and I understand how terrible it was,\" Cuomo said.\n\nCuomo has been dogged during his campaign by ongoing accusations that, when he was governor, his administration undercounted the number of nursing home residents who died from the coronavirus.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James issued a report in 2021 finding that the state's Department of Health published data that may have undercounted those deaths by as much as 50%, and that nursing homes put residents at increased risk by failing to comply with infection control protocols.\n\nEven with his apology, Cuomo continued to defend his record.\n\n\"We followed all the federal rules. We did nothing wrong,\" he said. \"It was horrific, but everyone did the best that they could.\"\n\n–Aysha Bagchi\n\nCuomo says Trump is 'pragmatic' in endorsing him\n\nAndrew Cuomo said President Donald Trump was being realistic by telling Republican voters to support him against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani.\n\n“President Trump is pragmatic,” Andrew Cuomo said on the conservative talk show “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday morning. “He’s telling them the reality of this situation. If you do not vote, Mamdani is going to win.”\n\nTrump has increasingly voiced support for Cuomo against Mamdani, the frontrunner in the race. Cuomo, running as an independent, previously disavowed Trump's endorsement while also trying to pull Republican voters away from GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa, who trails in third.\n\n“Even if you’re not voting for a Republican, you’re voting to save New York City,” Cuomo said. “This election is not about Democrat or Republican. It’s about saving the city.”\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nSliwa, wearing a cat tie, accompanies wife to vote\n\nSporting his signature red beret and a tie decorated with cats, Curtis Sliwa accompanied his wife, Nancy, on Tuesday as she cast her ballot for her husband in the New York City mayoral race.\n\nSliwa, the Republican candidate running on the Protect Animals ballot line, said that the results of the city’s election will “be determined by the people, even if they don’t choose me” and not the “political elites.” While holding a book entitled, “Pawverbs for a Cat Lover's Heart,” Sliwa said that he has the people’s support.\n\n“Hopefully by the time the ballots are counted tonight, when all is said and done, I’ll be the next mayor of the City of New York,” he said. “And you know animals throughout the city will be partying hardy because they’ll have a friend both in Gracie Mansion and in City Hall.”\n\n–Rebecca Morin\n\nCandidates highlight their signature policy proposals\n\nThe three candidates vying for mayor gave vastly different closing arguments Tuesday while appearing on WNYC’s popular “The Brian Lehrer Show” to describe their signature policy proposal.\n\nMamdani, who has run on a campaign to address affordability, said his key issue was universal child care, which he wants to fund via taxes on the city’s wealthiest. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who would have to ultimately approve the tax hike with state lawmakers, has supported Mamdani’s proposal.\n\nSliwa cited his opposition to the city’s controversial housing proposals, which Cuomo and Mamdani support. Sliwa also pointed to opposition from City Council leadership, which is staunchly Democratic. “Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani are helping developers and realtors,” he said. “I’m standing with the people.”\n\nCuomo’s signature proposal was public safety, including hiring 5,000 new police officers. “Safety is the foundation,” he said. Mayor Eric Adams, who endorsed Cuomo, recently announced funding to hire 5,000 new NYPD officers. Recent data has showed a continued decline in major crimes in the city, with the lowest October for homicides since NYPD began tracking data in 1994.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMamdani votes 'yes' on NYC housing measures\n\nOutside of his polling place in Astoria, Queens, Mamdani told reporters he voted yes on New York City’s controversial ballot proposals 2 through 4, which Mayor Eric Adams' administration put forward in what proponents said is needed to address the city’s dire housing shortage.\n\nCity Council leadership opposed the measures, arguing it left local officials unable to respond to local needs of neighborhoods while concentrating power in the hands of the mayor and developers.\n\nMamdani hadn’t said whether he supported proposals until now. In the last mayoral debate on Oct. 22, his opponents and moderators ridiculed him for not having a response.\n\n“We urgently need more housing to be built across the five boroughs,” he told a New York Daily News reporter on Election Day, acknowledging councilmembers who opposed the measures based on concerns over investment in their communities. “I share the commitment to that investment. I look forward to working with them and delivering on that.”\n\nMamdani also voted no on ballot proposal to move city elections for offices such as mayor to presidential years in order to boost turnout.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\n'Our country has failed them.' Zohran Mamdani talks to USA TODAY about younger voters.\n\nCuomo declines to embrace Trump endorsement\n\nAndrew Cuomo declined to embrace President Donald Trump's last-minute endorsement of him in the final hours before Election Day. Trump urged his supporters to cast their ballots for Cuomo in a Nov. 3 evening post on Truth Social.\n\n\"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\" Trump said.\n\nRather than leaning into the endorsement, Cuomo highlighted that Trump previously called him a \"bad Democrat.\"\n\n\"Trump called me a bad Democrat? No I’m a good Democrat. A proud Democrat,\" Cuomo said in a Monday evening post on X.\n\nCuomo added that Trump wouldn't be sending ICE or the National Guard into New York City under his watch, and painted himself as someone who could stand up to the Republican president.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\nMamdani says he aims to ‘Trump-proof’ New York City\n\nMamdani said his economic plan aims to protect the city from President Donald Trump’s threat to provide it less federal funding.\n\nMamdani calls for a 2% tax on people making more than $1 million per year, to raise $4 billion per year, and seeks to increase the corporate tax rate to 11.5%, to generate $5 billion. Mamdani would also freeze the rent for 2.5 million residents in a city of 8.5 million people.\n\n“It would actually allow us to start Trump-proofing our city,” Mamdani told “The Beat with Ari Melber” on MSNBC on Monday. “We have to protect the New Yorkers with the least from the attacks from the man with the most power in this country.”\n\nTrump calls Mamdani a communist and said the federal government can’t afford to throw good money after bad if he is elected.\n\n“It's going to be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York,” Trump told “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMamdani calls Cuomo Trump’s ‘hand-picked’ candidate\n\nMamdani called Cuomo Trump’s “hand-picked” candidate in the race.\n\nTrump urged New Yorkers to vote for Cuomo, whom Mamdani already beat in the Democratic primary. Mamdani said voting for Cuomo in the heavily Democratic city would be the same as voting for Trump.\n\n“I'm saying that because Donald Trump has hand-picked his candidate. That candidate's name is Andrew Cuomo,” Mamdani told “The Beat with Ari Melber” on MSNBC on Monday. “And New Yorkers have the chance to handpick their fighter. And I believe that candidate should be me.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Zohran Mamdani?\n\nDemocratic candidate Zohran Mamdani is a 34-year-old democratic socialist and state lawmaker. He won election to the New York State Assembly in 2020 and represents the 36th district in Queens. Before joining the assembly, Mamdani worked for a year at a housing nonprofit.\n\nMamdani was born and raised in Kampala, Uganda, until the age of 7 when his family moved to New York City. He became a naturalized citizen in 2018.\n\nHe became the first South Asian man and Ugandan to join the assembly and is the third Muslim elected to the chamber.\n\nMamdani is the son of academic Mahmood Mamdani and prominent filmmaker Mira Nair. He married 28-year-old artist Rama Duwaji in February.\n\n−Kathryn Palmer\n\nWho is Andrew Cuomo?\n\nAndrew Cuomo, 67, is a former governor of New York running as an independent in the race to lead New York City. He is a lifelong Democrat and resigned as governor in 2021 due to a series of sexual harassment allegations that he has denied.\n\nHe is the son of the late three-term former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who also served as the state’s lieutenant governor and secretary of state. He has three children with former wife Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy. The pair divorced in 2005.\n\nBefore he became governor, Cuomo was a Manhattan assistant district attorney and worked in former President Bill Clinton’s administration in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). He later served one term as New York attorney general before making his bid for governor. Cuomo won his first gubernatorial election in 2010 and again in 2014 and 2018.\n\n−Kathryn Palmer\n\nWho is Curtis Sliwa?\n\nCurtis Sliwa, 71, is the Republican nominee in the race. He is the founder of the Guardian Angels, a citizen-led safety patrol group created in the 1970s to address subway crime.\n\nSliwa has hosted various radio talk shows for decades and ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 2021, losing in a landslide to current Democratic mayor Eric Adams.\n\nHe is married to animal activist and attorney Nancy Regula.\n\n−Kathryn Palmer\n\nWho are the candidates for NYC mayor?\n\nDemocratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from Queens, has been ahead in polls following his stunning win in the June primary against Andrew Cuomo, the three-term former New York governor who has sought to revive his political career after resigning in disgrace. If elected, Mamdani would be the first Muslim and the first South Asian to lead the city, and the first immigrant mayor in 80 years.\n\nCuomo, 67, running as an independent in the general election, has been consolidating voters against Mamdani, shrinking Mamdani’s lead headed into Election Day. A turnaround victory would be a monumental comeback for Cuomo, the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo.\n\nBut Cuomo still faces a roadblock by Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, the beret-wearing founder of the Guardian Angels vigilante group. Polls have indicated Sliwa’s conservative base could help Cuomo climb to compete against Mamdani, but Sliwa, 71, did not drop out.\n\nSliwa, a well-known New York City figure for decades, lost handily to Adams four years earlier. If a fractured electorate can't decide between Cuomo or Mamdani, Sliwa would be the first Republican elected in the heavily Democratic city since Mike Bloomberg.\n\nIs Eric Adams running for reelection?\n\nNew York City mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat-turned independent who trounced his Republican opponent in the 2021 election, is no longer running for a second term.\n\nAdams announced he was dropping out of the race on Sept. 28, after consistently polling far behind race frontrunners Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo.\n\nA little less than a month after he bowed out of the race, Adams endorsed Cuomo.\n\nHe had been pressured to drop out of the race for months after failing to shore up support following numerous scandals in his administration, including resignations and corruption allegations.\n\n-Kathryn Palmer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/25/nyc-mayor-candidates-2025-ballot/84349432007/", "title": "Who will be on the NYC mayoral ballot in November?", "text": "Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani pulled off a seismic upset in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, amassing a 7-point margin over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in results as of Wednesday morning.\n\nThough Mamdani's presumptive win won't be official until runoff counting is announced early July, Cuomo conceded the nomination, all but assuring the 33-year-old the Democratic mayoral candidacy. Now, with the competitive primary out of the way, focus is shifting to the general election in November, where Mamdani will face the city's current mayor, a Republican candidate and, possibly, battle against Cuomo once more.\n\nSince 2021, primaries in the city have used ranked choice voting, a system that allows residents to vote for up to five candidates from their most preferred to least. If no candidate gets more than 50% of first-place votes, then the least-popular candidate is eliminated and their supporters' votes are redistributed to other candidates based on their lower-ranked preferences. Mamdani did not reach the 50% threshold, but leads with 44% of first-place votes, with 96% of ballots counted on June 25, with Cuomo amassing 36%.\n\nHere's what we know about the November ballot for New York City mayor.\n\nWho will be on the November ballot for NYC mayor?\n\nMamdani will begin the race for the general election as the favorite in the overwhelmingly Democratic city. But his Democratic primary win doesn't clear the way to an easy victory in November, as he will face significant opposition from independent party candidates in what could end up being a five-way race.\n\nUnlike the primary, November's election does not use ranked-choice voting on the general ballot. Mamdani will likely face four other candidates in the fall: current Mayor Eric Adams, Republican and founder of the Guardian Angels, Curtis Sliwa, former federal prosecutor Jim Walden, and possibly Cuomo.\n\nAdams won the mayoralty after winning the 2021 Democratic primary, when New York City first used ranked-choice voting. He dropped out of the Democratic primary earlier this year after a scandal-plagued tenure caused his approval ratings to plummet, and he will be running in November as an independent. The party line will face stiff competition should Cuomo decide to stay in the race, telling the New York Times shortly after his concession on Tuesday that he is considering staying in the race as an independent.\n\nCuomo is attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 over multiple scandals, including covering up nursing home deaths and numerous allegations of sexual harassment, which he denies. The former three-term governor moved back to New York City for the first time in decades, and became an instant frontrunner when he entered the mayoral race. Many elected officials who condemned him in 2021 endorsed him for mayor this year.\n\nContributing: Ben Adler, Anna Kaufman and Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

In Tuesday night’s general election, Mamdani won with just over 50% of votes, totaling to over 1 million, becoming the city’s first Muslim and Asian American mayor.\n\nAt 34 years old, Mamdani is also New York City’s second youngest mayor behind only Hugh J.

That night, he was introduced by Hon. Sylvia Hinds-Radix, an associate justice of the New York State Appellate Division.\n\nHe was supposed to have a larger inaugural event that day at Brooklyn’s Kings Theater, but canceled it due to the COVID-19 pandemic, reported television stations WPIX and FOX 5.\n\nPrior to Adams’ election, former Mayor Bill de Blasio was sworn in at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2014, in front of his home in NYC’s Park Slope neighborhood. A longer inaugural event was held later that day at City Hall Plaza, where he was sworn in by former President Bill Clinton.\n\nFormer Mayor Michael Bloomberg's 2002 inauguration took place on New Years Day, as well.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the New York City Mayor’s office and Mamdani’s team for more information about his swearing-in.\n\nMore on Mayor-elect Mamdani\n\nMayor-elect Mamdani moved to New York City with his family at 7 years old. He graduated from the NYC Public Schools system, went to the Bronx High School of Science, and earned a bachelor’s degree in Africana Studies from Bowdoin College. He became naturalized as an American citizen in 2018.\n\nHe previously worked as a foreclosure prevention housing counselor and worked with low-income homeowners of color in Queens facing eviction. As an assemblyman and democratic socialist, he represents the 36th Assembly District and neighborhoods Astoria, Ditmars-Steinway and Astoria Heights.\n\nMamdani ran for mayor with the promise of freezing rent for eligible tenants, providing free bus fare and childcare for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old and addressing tenant complaints about neglectful landlords.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 5, the day after his victory, Mamdani addressed community members and said his administration will be “equal parts capable and compassionate” and “driven by integrity.”\n\n“Throughout this campaign, I have worked hard to be accessible and transparent with New Yorkers,” he said. “That same spirit will animate this transition, and the city hall we built because New Yorkers deserve a government that they can trust.”\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

In 2021, the last time the city elected its mayor, over 169,000 people cast their ballots during early voting, four times less than in 2025.\n\nSunday, Nov. 2 − the last day to vote early before the Nov. 4 election − marked the highest early voting day in New York City history, elections officials announced in a Nov. 3 news release.\n\nPolls have tightened in the mayor’s race between Mamdani, the frontrunner who’s led by double digits, and Cuomo, running as an independent. Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime vigilante group, trails in third. The winner replaces embattled Mayor Eric Adams, a moderate Democrat, to lead the heavily Democratic city.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nElon Musk urges NYC voters to back Cuomo\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, a former adviser to Trump, urged New York voters to cast their ballots for the state’s former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent in the city’s mayoral race.\n\nMusk took a swipe at the Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in his post endorsing Cuomo over the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa.\n\n“Remember to vote tomorrow in New York!” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is. VOTE CUOMO!”\n\nMusk, a Texas resident who previously lived in California, is no stranger to weighing into political elections.\n\nHe endorsed Trump in the 2024 presidential election, often joining the then-Republican candidate on the campaign trail before briefly becoming an adviser to the president after he won the election. Musk also poured in at least $20 million on a high-stakes Wisconsin court race that saw his choice judge, conservative Brad Schimel, lose against liberal Susan Crawford.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nWho has the momentum? The 2025 election could say a lot about political climate\n\nThe first big round of voting since Trump was elected last year could help answer some questions about the current political climate, including which party has the momentum and whether Democrats have an effective message for taking on the president.\n\nThe off-year races in New Jersey, Virginia, California, New York City and elsewhere are seen as key early barometers of how voters are feeling about Trump and the Democratic Party as it fights his aggressive agenda. The president has loomed large over the contests, featuring in ads and as a frequent topic in debates.\n\nVirginia, which has been heavily impacted by cuts to the federal workforce, could be a test of how Trump’s policies are being received, and whether voters believe he has overreached in his second term. California could check Trump’s redistricting power plays in other states.\n\nThe elections are a precursor to more consequential midterm contests next year, when control of Congress – and with it the fate of Trump’s legislative agenda – will be decided. The results on Nov. 4 will be highly scrutinized to see which party has the upper hand heading into next November's midterms.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nNewsom campaigns for Prop 50: ‘We’re going to get out there and win’\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday said his state is going to send a “powerful message” in Tuesday’s election by approving a ballot initiative that would radically change how his state’s congressional boundaries are drawn.\n\nAt a campaign rally in San Francisco just one day before voters hit the polls, Newsom said Trump turned to states to address redistricting due to the president’s approval rating.\n\n“Donald Trump one-upped himself: Historic president. Historically unpopular president. The most unpopular since his first term,” Newsom said. “He knows he’s going to lose the midterm election. Period. Full stop.”\n\nSeveral GOP-led states, such as Texas and Indiana, are trying to redraw their congressional maps with Trump's urging ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nNewsom said that Trump and his allies didn’t expect for states, like California, to counter their redistricting plans.\n\n“They did not expect California. They did not expect all of you. They thought we were going to write an op-ed, have a candle light vigil, maybe do a rally,” he said. “They poked the bear and the bear is poking back. We’re going to get out there and win and send a powerful message not only to the people of the state of California but the people all over the United States of America.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nWhat time do polls open on Election Day?\n\nIt’s not a presidential election, but millions of Americans will head to the polls to vote in state and local elections on Tuesday, Nov. 4.\n\nDo you know what time your local polling place opens?\n\nIf you plan to vote or drop off your ballot in person, you need to know where your polling precinct is and when it opens. This information depends on which state you live in, and sometimes even on your county or municipality.\n\nMost states open their polls at 7 a.m. local time. Others start voting as early as 5 a.m. or as late as 10 a.m.\n\nSee when polling opens for your state.\n\n– Natalie Neysa Alund and Gabe Hauari\n\n'SNL' takes on NYC mayoral debate\n\nDays before New York City's mayoral election, \"Saturday Night Live\" weighed in.\n\nIn its Saturday cold open, the sketch show parodied the final New York City mayoral debate, with Miles Teller as Andrew Cuomo, Ramy Youssef as Zohran Mamdani and Shane Gillis as Curtis Sliwa.\n\n\"I know this city like the back of a woman's back,\" Teller said as Cuomo, the former governor of New York who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. He was elected as a Democrat but is running for mayor as an independent after losing the party's mayoral primary to Mamdani.\n\nAs Democratic nominee Mamdani, Youssef told voters he wanted to deliver free health care and Wi-Fi and affordable housing.\n\n\"As mayor, can I make that happen? I'm not sure yet,\" he said. \"But together, we're going to find out − that the answer is no.\"\n\nThe popular sketch comedy show has not shied away from parodying the Trump administration, with cast member James Austin Johnson often portraying the president. In Saturday’s sketch, Johnson’s Trump interrupted the mayoral debate to promise the candidates that he's \"going to be very involved\" in New York politics.\n\n– Brendan Morrow\n\nObama says 'it's worse than I expected' at stumps for Dem gubernatorial candidates\n\nFormer President Barack Obama didn't mince words about what he thought about the first 10 months of President Donald Trump's second administration during weekend stumps for Democratic gubernatorial candidates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nWhile praising Spanberger's run and her prior experience in law enforcement and the CIA in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday, Obama also said the US is \"in a pretty dark place.\"\n\n\"It’s hard to know where to start, because every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness,\" said Obama to cheers and boos. \"I mean, it’s like every day is Halloween. Except it’s all tricks and no treats.\"\n\nObama then ran through a litany of what he said Trump has done since taking office, including turning the justice department against his political opponents, replacing career prosecutors with loyalists, and firing decorated officers because they might be more loyal to the Constitution than to him and deploying the National Guard to mostly Democratic-led cities to stop crime waves that don’t exist.\n\n\"It’s not as if we didn’t see some of this coming,” Obama told the crowd somewhat sarcastically. \"I will admit it’s worse than even I expected...But, I did warn y’all! I did!\"\n\nHours later, Obama gave a similar message during Sherrill's get-out-the-vote rally in Newark. He said voting for Sherrill will not only put New Jersey on a path to a brighter future but also set \"a glorious example\" for the nation.\n\nWhen Obama ran through the \"recklessness and mean-spiritedness\" about the Trump administration in his Newark speech, there was a cascade of boos. The former president countered. \"Don't boo,\" Obama said. \"Vote!\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nSupporters of California ballot measure dominate ad spending\n\nProponents of California’s Proposition 50 redistricting ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom have far outspent opponents on political ads as campaigning around the initiative wraps up.\n\nMore than $129 million has been spent on the Proposition 50 campaign, and 72% of that went towards ads supporting the initiative, according to ad tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nNewsom is pushing an effort to temporarily bypass the state’s independent redistricting commission and redraw California’s U.S. House map to create more Democratic-leaning seats,a response to Trump pushing for more GOP-leaning House seats in Texas and other red states.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nCiattarelli gets a November surprise visit from son\n\nJack Ciattarelli, New Jersey’s Republican nominee for governor, got an October surprise on Monday from his “biggest supporter” while campaigning at Murph's Saloon in Totowa.\n\nThe candidate’s son, Army Capt. Jake Ciattarelli, returned home from his assignment in Kuwait.\n\nThe elder Ciattarelli slapped his forward with his right hand as his son, dressed in camouflage fatigues, approached for a hug. The crowd chanted “USA, USA.\"\n\n“Wow!” the elder Ciattarelli said. “What he probably forgot to do because he’s been so busy defending our nation, he probably forgot to get in his vote-by-mail ballot. He’s here to vote.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDNC head cautiously optimistic about Tuesday’s elections\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin expressed cautious optimism about his party’s chances of winning critical governor races in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, despite tightening polls.\n\nA survey published Saturday showed Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli in a dead heat in their race for New Jersey’s governor’s mansion. But Martin said he’s confident about Sherrill’s momentum in the race coming off a whirlwind weekend campaigning with Democratic heavyweights, including former President Barack Obama.\n\n“We've always expected the race to be close,” he said. “But everything that I've seen I was on the ground there for the last three days shows record enthusiasm and excitement.”\n\nWins on Tuesday, Martin said, will “signify that this notion that the Democratic Party is dead and can't be resuscitated is deeply exaggerated.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nMamdani, Cuomo campaign across NYC — from nosebleeds to court side\n\nZohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, sat in nosebleed seats at Sunday’s Knicks home game win at Madison Square Garden. Over a week ago, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, left the last mayoral debate to sit court side at the Knicks’ home opener with Mayor Eric Adams, who later endorsed Cuomo. The Knicks also won that time.\n\nThe candidates for mayor of the nation’s largest city are campaigning across the boroughs a day before Tuesday’s general election.\n\nIn the city that doesn’t sleep, Mamdani, the 34-year-old frontrunner, ate biryani with taxi drivers in Queens’ ever-diverse Jackson Heights neighborhood after midnight. He’s gone to Brooklyn clubs and bars before heading to the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network in Harlem on Sunday morning. At sunrise on Monday, after the Knicks game, Mamdani marched with supporters across the Brooklyn Bridge to City Hall, in what he said signaled a new day.\n\nCuomo has also made his way around at different hours.

It's the lowest rating of his second term seen in CNN polling and stands just one point higher than the 36% approval rating Trump had at this point in his first presidential term.\n\nThe president's 63% disapproval rating in the poll is also a noteworthy change to numbers stretching back to January 2025. It's numerically the highest disapproval of either term throughout CNN polling, standing one point above Trump's previous all-time high of 62% when he was leaving office in January 2021.\n\nThe dismal numbers come as the country hurtles toward day 35 of the ongoing government shutdown on Tuesday, which would tie with the longest-ever shutdown during Trump's first term in 2019, and on the eve of an off-year election many are watching as a potential referendum on the Republican party.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nJohnson hopes Democrats vote to end shutdown after election\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that he hopes getting past the election Nov. 4 will allow most Democrats to vote with Republicans to reopen the government.\n\nHouse Republicans approved short-funding bill to keep the government open through Nov. 21. But most Senate Democrats blocked the measure while arguing for greater spending on health care.\n\n“I hope the election tomorrow is a change, a sea change in all this,” Johnson said Monday. “I hope that after everybody votes and they go in their room and they make the calculation that, ‘Well, maybe we won’t have to hold that line any more.

Certified results aren't expected until later in July.\n\nOne advocate blamed the \"foolishness\" around the results on the board's \"incompetency in elections.\"\n\nNEW YORK – The New York City mayoral election was thrown into disarray Tuesday night after the Board of Elections acknowledged a \"discrepancy\" in the calculation of ranked choice votes, showing 135,000 \"test\" votes had been added into the count.\n\nThe race between Brooklyn borough President Eric Adams and his rivals appeared to narrow significantly after the partial results were released Tuesday afternoon, but hours later the Board removed the tally from its website and said there were issues with it.\n\nApproximately 135,000 additional votes, added into the Board's computer software for testing purposes, were never removed before the actual ballots were added in and those results published online.\n\nThat led to the unofficial results showing Adams narrowly surviving in 11 rounds of vote redistribution, ahead of former sanitation department head Kathryn Garcia by only some 16,000 votes.\n\nThe board said it had removed the test ballot images from its system and will upload the election results again, checking it with software from election night.\n\nIn a statement, Adams called the Board's mistake \"unfortunate.\"\n\n\"It is critical that New Yorkers are confident in their electoral system, especially as we rank votes in a citywide election for the first time,\" he said.\n\nPublic Advocate Jumaane Williams said the \"foolishness\" around the results was not a result of the ranked choice system but rather the Board's \"incompetency in elections.\"\n\nRanked choice voting, new to New York's mayoral primary, allows voters to select up to five candidates. Votes are redistributed in an elimination process if no candidate commands a majority of first-choice votes.\n\nThe tally released Tuesday was intended to be only a partial count of in-person ballots from Election Day and early voting. The board has received tens of thousands of absentee ballots and was to begin counting those this week. Certified results weren't expected until later in July.\n\nA ranking of voters' first choices released June 22 on election night showed Adams in first place with a roughly 9-point lead over Wiley. Garcia trailed closely in third.\n\nAfter numerous elimination rounds clearing the crowded Democratic field, Adams remained in first, but Garcia was in second and Wiley in third. Wiley's elimination boosted Garcia even closer to Adams, though the former police captain still held on with 51% of the vote.\n\nAdams' campaign had previously raised concerns about the ranked choice voting system. When Garcia and Andrew Yang, the former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate turned mayoral hopeful, looked to campaign together days before the election, Adams' campaign allies tried to cast the alliance as voter disenfranchisement. Advocates of the system say such alliances are common.\n\nGarcia called Tuesday's error \"deeply troubling\" and said a \"transparent and complete explanation\" was needed. Wiley said it was \"not just a failure to count votes properly today, it is the result of generations of failures that have gone unaddressed.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Board of Elections did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nHow ranked choice voting works in New York City\n\nIf a candidate had won 50% of first-choice votes, that person would be the winner. Because that didn't happen, the ranked choice voting process kicks in.\n\nIn a series of elimination rounds, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and the votes for that candidate are redistributed based on how voters ranked their preferences. The process continues until two candidates are left, and the person with the most votes would win.\n\nNew Yorkers voted in a ballot initiative in 2019 to enact ranked choice voting for mayor and many other offices' primaries and special elections.\n\nThe system has been used in Oakland, California, and Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAdvocates said ranked voting better captures voters' preferences and can be less costly than runoff elections.\n\nWithout ranked choice, the city would probably be awaiting a runoff election that could cost millions, said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause/New York.\n\nExit polling from Lerner's group found that voters took advantage of the new system. More than 80% of voters ranked at least two candidates in the mayoral primary, and more than 40% ranked five candidates.\n\nLerner stressed the delay in reporting results is not because of ranked voting but rather state laws protecting voters' rights around when absentee ballots can be counted and \"curing\" ballot defects.\n\n\"Democracy takes time, and it's important that every vote counts. Accurate results are worth waiting for,\" she said.\n\nOther closely watched elections using ranked choice voting included the race for city comptroller and several City Council seats.\n\nThe Republican primary featured only two candidates. Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder, won the nomination and will face the Democratic winner in November. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to win the general election, given the city's overwhelming majority of Democratic voters.\n\nEric Adams: Police reformer with public safety message\n\nAdams' campaign focused squarely on addressing crime in the city. Though New York is not seeing as high a number of shootings as it did in the crime peaks of the 1980s and 1990s, there has been a roughly 50% uptick compared with last year.\n\nAs a former NYPD captain, Adams, 60, regularly pointed to his police experience while on the campaign trail, calling for increased police presence in high-crime neighborhoods and renewed focus on illegal firearms.\n\nAdams has a long history advocating for police reform. He often cites his experience being beaten by New York City police when he was a teen as a motivation to join the department and change it from within.\n\nIn the 1990s, he formed 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, an advocacy group that sought to fight racial profiling and police brutality while restoring trust among Black residents.\n\nIf elected, he would be the city's second Black mayor. Wiley, who is also Black, or Garcia would be the city's first woman elected mayor.\n\nBruce Berg, a political science professor at Fordham University who specializes in New York City politics, said Adams' moderation and balance on the issue of crime and police reform made him an appealing candidate to some voters.\n\nThe New York Times published a map of first-choice votes, showing how candidates fared in each district. Garcia won much of Manhattan, in which there is a larger share of white and wealthy voters, while Adams found much of his support among the city's Black and Latino and lower income neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx.\n\nGarcia largely shared a message on crime similar to Adams', while Wiley advocated for diverting some funds away from the police department and reinvesting them in homeless and mental health services.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/11/eric-adams-nyc-mayor-corruption-charges-timeline/78415508007/", "title": "Timeline of NYC Mayor Eric Adams' federal corruption charges", "text": "Embattled New York City Mayor Eric Adams asked for voter's trust and thanked the Justice Department Tuesday after the agency, a day earlier, reportedly directed prosecutors to drop a federal corruption case filed against him.\n\nActing Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, in a two-page memo addressed to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York Monday, ordered the swift dismissal of criminal charges against Adams, Reuters reported. In the memo, Bove argued the mayor's case was distracting him from dealing with illegal immigration, violent crime and his reelection campaign.\n\nIn a 57-page indictment filed in September, federal prosecutors claim Adams quietly solicited and accepted illegal gifts and campaign donations from wealthy foreigners including accepting luxury airline tickets, meals, and hotel stays.\n\nThe request from the DOJ to Manhattan prosecutors comes after speculation President Donald Trump would seek to end the case against Adams, a Democrat, to whom he has grown sympathetic.

We know that New York City said, ‘Our first choice is Eric Adams.’”\n\nBecause no candidate won a majority of first-choice preferences, voters' preferences will be redistributed in the ranked choice system, with the first batch of ranked choice results released next week.\n\nAdams would be the city's second Black mayor. He's made public safety his campaign's central message while also appealing to his past advocacy in politics calling for reforms to the city's police department.\n\nWith Wiley and Garcia, the city could elect its first woman as mayor. Yang would have been the city's first Asian American mayor.\n\nNew York City mayoral race: What to know about the candidates, issues and why a 'progressive' isn't leading the way\n\nAt the ballot box, voters could select up to five candidates. While the calculation to redistribute voters' preferences as candidates are eliminated is done electronically, state law allows for absentee ballots to trickle in over the next week. Those votes could be the deciding factor in the tightly contested race.\n\nAfter releasing the ranked choice results of early and in-person votes, the city's Board of Elections expects to release the ranked choice preferences of absentee ballots beginning July 6. Some estimates have the winner not being known until mid-July.\n\nThe crowded Democratic field featured eight major candidates and centered on the issues of crime and New York's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"It is truly one of the most, if not the most important election that we've seen simply because of (the pandemic) and how do you come back,\" said Sid Davidoff, a senior adviser to former Mayor John Lindsay. \"Then the question becomes: Who best leads in this city going into these next couple years?\"\n\nNYC has never elected a woman as mayor: Will one of these women change that?\n\nThe Democratic incumbent, de Blasio, is leaving office after reaching his term limit. He did not endorse any candidate nor did any candidate, except Yang, say they wanted his endorsement.\n\nAdams had been a front-runner for much of the race and leading in many major polls conducted in its final weeks. In addition to his public safety message, the Brooklyn native also pledged to address racial inequities in the city. However, he also faced sharp criticism after a POLITICO report detailed discrepancies in his property and campaign records.\n\nWiley, meanwhile, was the progressive favorite as the race narrowed and she won the backing of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Wiley has pledged to divert some police funds to mental health and homelessness services as well as schools.\n\nYang and Garcia, who had recently formed a sort of alliance amid the ranked choice system, both more closely mirrored Adams on the issue of policing. Garcia also made climate change a large part of her campaign. Yang has promised to bring a local version of his universal basic income plan to New York, which he ran on in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThere are more than 3 million registered Democratic voters compared with about half a million registered Republican voters in the city, so the winner of the Democratic primary is likely to cruise to victory in November.\n\nIn the Republican race, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa was leading businessman Fernando Mateo.\n\nMore than 200,000 voters requested absentee ballots, and more than 87,000 had been returned as of Monday.\n\nTrailing the front of the pack in the Democratic race was Scott Stringer in fifth, Dianne Morales in sixth, Ray McGuire in seventh and Shaun Donovan in eight. Several other minor candidates also received slivers of the vote.\n\nAlso being decided was the race for Manhattan District Attorney.

He also worked as a flight instructor in Albuquerque and received a Bachelor's degree in Spanish language and literature in 2006 from the University of New Mexico, according to the profile.\n\nDiamond, from Caldwell, Texas ― a small city between Austin and Houston, was a supplemental crew member available in case the other pilots needed rest.\n\n— Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; Stephanie Kuzydym and Monroe Trombly, Courier Journal\n\nUnion honors victims at community vigil\n\nTeamsters Local 89, the union that represents UPS and other workers in Louisville, held a vigil on Nov. 6 to honor the victims killed in the crash. The vigil began with a moment of silence at 5:14 p.m. local time, the time that officials believe the plane crashed just 48 hours before.\n\nLouisville residents showed up in large numbers, some holding signs with \"2976,\" the number of the flight, while others read \"Louisville is UPS strong.\" Among local union leaders were elected officials, including Greenberg, U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, Kentucky state Rep. Lisa Willner, and Secretary of the Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet Jamie Link.\n\n\"I want to make sure that everyone here and everyone across the entire city knows that we are here to help and support each of the survivors, each of the families who are in grief,\" Greenberg said. \"Any member of our community who has been impacted by this horrific tragedy, we will continue to support you — not just today [or] two days after the crash, but in the months and the years to come.\"\n\nThough UPS pilots are represented by the Independent Pilots Association (IPA) and not Teamsters Local 89, the two work closely together. IPA President Bob Travis expressed his appreciation for the crowd turnout and the members of Teamsters Local 89.\n\n— Lillian Metzmeier, Courier Journal\n\nOil cleanup underway at UPS plane crash site\n\nA large amount of oil was stored in above-ground tanks at a petroleum recycling facility south of the airport, where the plane crashed on Nov. 4. In the wake of the disaster, local, state, and federal agencies are working to clean up the subsequent spill.\n\n\"Approximately 226,000 gallons of used motor oil and 37,000 gallons of oil-water-antifreeze mix were at the oil recycling facility at the time of the incident,\" according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe agency did not say how much oil spilled, but said \"several large, above-ground storage tanks ... broke open and fell over.\"\n\nThe plane itself was carrying about 38,000 gallons of jet fuel, and all the petroleum products involved in the crash intensified the resulting fire. The EPA said the plane was not carrying hazardous cargo.\n\nOfficials \"are working with UPS to develop work plans for containment, recovery, removal and disposal of oil and oiled debris,\" according to the EPA.\n\nOfficials are also assessing environmental harm further afield. Downstream of the wreckage is the Salt River, which drains to the Ohio River at the southwestern tip of Jefferson County.\n\nLouisville drinking water is safe for consumption, officials said, though the Louisville Water Co. is \"communicating directly\" with about 50 customers near the crash site \"to confirm that their water is safe to drink.\"\n\n— Connor Giffin, Courier Journal\n\nNTSB probing maintenance history of UPS cargo plane\n\nThe NTSB said on Nov. 6 that they are probing the maintenance history of the plane involved in the crash. Before the incident, investigators said the aircraft had been in Texas for repairs.\n\n\"We are aware that this aircraft was there in San Antonio,\" Inman said, without giving a specific time frame. \"We will look at every piece of maintenance that was done, even from the San Antonio time, all the way to the date of the flight.\"\n\nFlight tracking data showed the plane was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, from Sept. 3 to Oct. 18, Reuters reported. According to Federal Aviation Administration records dated Sept. 18, a crack on a structural piece inside the center wing fuel tank required repairs.\n\nThere is currently no evidence that poor maintenance caused the crash, according to investigators. Inman said the NTSB had no immediate safety concerns about the broader MD-11 program owned by Boeing.\n\nNTSB releases photos of recovered 'black boxes'\n\nThe NTSB on Nov. 6 released photos of the downed plane's so-called \"black boxes\": the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. The boxes, which are typically brightly colored despite the name, appeared blackened by fire or smoke exposure in the photos.\n\nInman said Nov. 6 that investigators recovered the plane's recorders intact amid the crash debris and successfully retrieved data from the system, including cockpit audio. Inman said the NTSB will release a transcript of audio and prepare a timeline of the crash, but he warned the process of going through the data would be \"laborious.\"\n\nAbout 28 members from the NTSB arrived in Louisville on Nov. 5 to begin their investigation, according to Greenberg. The NTSB said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was assisting at the scene with collecting evidence, taking photographs, mapping and measuring the wreckage field, and \"generally serving as a force multiplier for the NTSB go team.\"\n\nLouisville plane crash witnesses grapple with what they saw\n\nSadit Aliyev and a coworker were settling in just after 5 p.m. at Kentucky Truck Parts & Service to have a bite to eat when the explosion happened.\n\n“As soon as the explosion happened, it knocked me off my feet,” Aliyev, who owns the automotive store said as he attempted to get back to the business to assess the damage. “I was thinking it was my last moments, that’s why I started recording the video.”\n\nAliyev’s footage is harrowing. The two-minute clip shows the plane slide across the ground, leaving a trail of fire and billowing smoke just outside the auto repair shop. The smoke plume grew for hours, placing all of the city and the surrounding region under a shelter-in-place order for much of the evening.\n\n“When you’d come outside, the heat of the flames and fire was so bad,” he said.\n\n\"I feel empty. That’s what I feel like. It’s tragic. People died.”\n\n— Monroe Trombly and Lucas Aulbach, Courier Journal\n\nWhere did the UPS plane crash occur?\n\nThe plane crashed in a largely industrial area just south of the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, about 6 miles south of downtown Louisville. The airport is home to UPS Worldport, an international air hub that serves more than 300 daily inbound and outbound flights, and processes about 2 million packages each day.\n\nBeshear said that two businesses were directly affected by the catastrophic crash: Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and Grade A Auto Parts. Other businesses, including a nearby convention center, restaurant and Ford assembly plant, escaped the blaze.\n\nThe crash and ensuing fires also disrupted airport-based operations at the UPS Worldport facility and slowed delivery services. UPS said it resumed operations at the facility on the evening of Nov. 5.\n\nAirport officials announced on Nov. 6 that the west runway was reopened late in the afternoon, meaning all three of the airport's runways were back in service after the Nov. 4 crash.\n\n\"The SDF team continues to keep the victims, their families and our community in our hearts following this tragic incident,\" Louisville Regional Airport Authority Executive Director Dan Mann said in a statement. \"We sincerely appreciate the quick response by the SDF Public Safety Department as the first units to the scene as well as the actions of so many mutual aid agencies from the city and state during this time.\"\n\n'It’s a workhorse': Crashed UPS jet was part of an aging fleet with an expensive reputation\n\nWhat caused the UPS plane crash?\n\nThe FAA said the NTSB will lead the probe that will investigate the crash. The full inquiry is expected to take a year or more to complete.\n\nThe plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder will be a key part of the investigation.\n\n\"We feel comfortable that once we get these to our lab in (Washington) D.C. that we will be able to get a good readout of the applicable data, and that will be yet another point of information that will really help us understand what happened,\" Inman said.\n\n'You'd think the world was ending': Witnesses horrified to see fiery UPS plane crash\n\nInman noted that the NTSB is “not aware” of any staffing shortages due to the government shutdown at the time of the crash. The airport's tower, \"from what we can see and what we've been told, was at its proper complement,” he said.\n\nThe aircraft, a 34-year-old MD-11 freighter, was carrying three crew members when it crashed just after clearing a fence at the end of the runway during takeoff on Nov. 4. The plane hit nearby structures, including a petroleum recycling facility that was set ablaze and exploded, before erupting into flames.\n\nUPS plane crash: How often do cargo jets go down?\n\n(This story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.)\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick, USA TODAY; Louisville Courier Journal; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/04/louisville-airport-aircraft-incident/87094155007/", "title": "UPS plane crashes near the Louisville airport leaves at least 7 dead", "text": "Editor's note: Follow USA TODAY's live coverage of the UPS plane crash in Louisville, KY, for Wednesday, Nov. 5.\n\nLOUISVILLE, KY — At least seven people were killed after a United Parcel Service cargo plane was involved in a \"catastrophic crash\" near Louisville’s Muhammad Ali International Airport on Tuesday, Kentucky Gov.

Beshear previously said some of the victims had sustained serious injuries.\n\nVideo footage of the crash appeared to show the plane taking off with fire on one wing, and a huge fireball erupted as it hit the ground. Several buildings in an industrial area beyond the runway were on fire after the crash, with thick black smoke rising into the sky.\n\nUPS plane crash in Louisville, Kentucky: Here's what we know about the deadly accident.\n\nThe crash and fire prompted a massive emergency response from state and local agencies, including multiple fire departments and law enforcement agencies. The Louisville Metro Police Department warned on social media that there was an active scene near the airport with fire and debris, and urged people to avoid the area.\n\n\"This will be an ongoing active scene for the next several days.

We're not aware of any that are missing right now.\"\n\nEarlier, Beshear said authorities believe the main area hit by the crash included two businesses: Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and Grade A Auto Parts.\n\nBeshear said Kentucky Petroleum Recycling was \"hit pretty directly.\" As for Grade A Auto Parts, the governor said the business accounted for all of its employees except for two people.\n\n\"Because of the nature of these facilities, it may be some time before we can account for everyone or know that no one else was on the grounds,\" Beshear said.\n\nLouisville airfield temporarily closed, departing flights canceled\n\nThe security line at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport was empty following the crash, according to the Courier Journal. The airport is also known by its former names, Standiford Field and Louisville International Airport.\n\n\"Aircraft incident confirmed at SDF,\" the airport posted on its X account. \"At this time, the airfield is closed.\"\n\nBiven confirmed Tuesday night that runway 1129 was open and all departing flights were canceled for the night.\n\n\"We’re asking anyone who is traveling out of SDF airport tonight and tomorrow, they should contact their airline for flight status,\" Biven said.\n\nVideo shows 'how violent this crash is': Louisville plane crash aftermath footage shows plume of smoke rise over scene\n\nLocal hospitals received 10 patients\n\nUofL Health, an academic health system based in Louisville, told the Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, that it received 10 patients related to the plane incident.\n\nTwo people were at the UofL Hospital Burn Center in critical condition, and two others were being treated with non-life-threatening injuries. Six others were being treated with non-life-threatening injuries at Mary & Elizabeth Hospital, South Hospital, and Jewish Hospital.\n\nShelter-in-place order issued in areas north of the airport\n\nFollowing the crash, a shelter-in-place order was issued stretching from the area around the airport northward to the Ohio River, including Old Louisville, South Louisville, and downtown Louisville.\n\nAreas south of the Outer Loop were cleared from the order at around 7:15 p.m. By 9 p.m., the order was reduced to a one-mile radius of the Louisville airport.\n\nLouisville's Emergency Management Agency said crews were monitoring the air quality. The public was urged to avoid the area due to the smoke.\n\nLocal health authorities advised people with homes or businesses in the shelter-in-place area to “please turn off any air intake systems as soon as possible.\"\n\nUPS Worldport halts operations\n\nUPS said in a statement that it was halting operations Tuesday night at Worldport. The Next Day Air sort was also canceled, and employees were told not to report to work, according to the company.\n\n\"We are terribly saddened by the accident tonight in Louisville,\" the company said. \"Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities we serve.

Three crew members were onboard the aircraft — a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airplane — at the time of the incident, the company said in a statement.\n\n\"At this time, we have not confirmed any injuries/casualties,\" UPS added in the statement.\n\nFlightRadar24 said the plane had flown from Louisville to Baltimore earlier on Tuesday before returning to Louisville. The flight from Louisville to Honolulu typically takes 8 1/2 hours, according to the flight-tracking service.\n\nThe MD-11 has three engines — one mounted under each wing and one mounted under its tail. The jet, first launched in 1990, hasn't carried a passenger flight since 2014. It remains active as a cargo plane.\n\nIn February 2023, the president of UPS told supply chain industry publication Freight Waves that the MD-11 was being phased out in favor of newer Boeing planes.\n\n'You could feel the heat off it'\n\nDamon Fortner, 58, a long-haul UPS truck driver, told USA TODAY he was driving near the airport to pick up a load of packages when he saw the plane fly over a nearby road. \"That’s awful low,\" he said.\n\nSeconds later, it exploded, barely 100 yards from where he stopped his pickup. He watched the plane take down telephone poles and power lines as it left a trail of fire.\n\n“It blew up. And it just kept on. All you could hear was stuff blowing up, and black smoke everywhere,” he said. “You could feel the heat off it.”\n\nJust after 7 p.m., Fortner and a coworker, wearing brown UPS uniforms, were standing by their pickups farther away, waiting for word from their bosses. They had been supposed to drive a truck to Boston overnight. Now, everything was grounded. As he waited, Fortner pulled up his phone, showing photos he snapped of black smoke filling the sky near his truck just hours earlier.\n\n“I’ve never in my life seen anything like it,” he said, shaking his head. “Don’t ever want to see anything like it.”\n\nAll he could think about were the poor souls who were on the plane, he said. “It tears me up.”\n\n— Chris Kenning, USA TODAY\n\nDeadly UPS plane crash: How often do cargo jets go down?\n\nMassive smoke seen miles away\n\nTraffic cameras and footage from local television stations showed a large plume of smoke and a red-orange glow of flames from fires ignited on the ground by the crash.\n\nSmoke from the explosion drifted northwest from the airport, according to a radar image broadcast by local TV news.

Businesses in the area include Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant, UPS Flight Training Center, and UPS Worldport Freight Facility, among others. Many of those were open with employees on site at the time of the crash.\n\nThe majority of UPS's thousands of hourly employees at UPS Worldport are members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union. A spokesperson for Teamsters Local 89, the local union that represents the Louisville-based workers, told the Courier Journal that \"to the best of our knowledge, none of our members were anywhere near\" the plane.\n\nThe spokesperson said workers still at UPS Worldport are sheltering in place, largely due to health concerns related to the smoke, and the power is off at UPS Worldport. \"Aside from the smoke, we don't believe any of our members are in any immediate danger,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nFord Louisville Assembly Plant has started evacuating, said UAW Local 862 president Todd Dunn. He said the evacuation is a safety precaution, not because of immediate danger.\n\n\"We're getting everybody out now,\" Dunn said.\n\nHow many times has a UPS plane crashed before?\n\nUPS Airlines has had two fatal plane crashes in its company history. Other minor, non-fatal crashes have resulted in substantial damage to planes.\n\nIn September 2010, a UPS Boeing 747-400F caught fire in flight. The plane crashed near Dubai, killing both crew members on board. This was the shipping and logistics company's first fatal crash.\n\nIn August 2013, a plane that departed from the Louisville airport crashed near its final destination of Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nThe plane was an Airbus A300-600F and descended to an unsafe altitude, ultimately crashing and killing both crew members aboard.

In July 2022, the team announced that its first-ever woman F/A-18 demonstration pilot would take to the skies, U.S. Navy Lt. Amanda Lee.\n\nHistoric season begins: Blue Angels pilot Amanda Lee takes to the sky\n\nWho is Lee? Where are the Blues based and how fast do they fly?\n\nWe answer your burning questions and more:\n\nWhat planes do the Blue Angels fly?\n\nIn 2021, the Blue Angels started flying in a new airplane for the first time in more than 30 years — the Super Hornet F/A-18 E/F. The new jets are 25% larger, fly 40% further, remain on station 80% longer and can carry more weapons than their predecessors. The team previously flew F/A-18 Hornets, which they transitioned to from the A-4F Skyhawk II in 1986.\n\nHow fast do the Blue Angels fly?\n\nThe new Super Hornets can reach top speeds just under Mach 2 (about 1,400 miles per hour), almost twice the speed of sound. The jets can climb at a maximum rate of 30,000 feet per minute.\n\nFans shouldn’t expect to see these feats at an air show. According to the Blue Angels website, the fastest speeds you’ll see in an air show are about 700 mph during the team’s “sneak pass” maneuver — a maneuver described in the Federal Aviation Administration’s maneuver manual as a flat pass on the 500-foot show line that flies over the spectator area from the rear, just 50 feet overhead.\n\nIn 2021, the Calexico Chronicle reported a training incident at the Naval Air Facility El Centro that caused property damage to three base structures and temporary headaches and ear ringing in base personnel prompted the naval flight demonstration squadron to adopt safety measures around the maneuver to prevent anything like it from happening again.\n\nBlue Angels pilots salary\n\nBlue Angels pilot salaries are no different from what their pay would typically be, based on rank and time in service.\n\nWho is on the Blue Angels team?\n\nThe Blue Angels team currently consists of 16 officers who voluntarily serve with the Blue Angels. Each year, the team will pick three tactical jet pilots, two support officers and one Marine Corps C-130 pilot to relieve departing members. Officers tend to serve with the squadron between two and three years, while enlisted personnel serve between three and four years.\n\nA full list of the demonstration team can be found below. You can find a list of the full team here: https://www.blueangels.navy.mil/team/\n\n#1 Commander Alexander Armatas | Flight leader and commanding officer\n\n#2 Lieutenant Commander Chris Kapuschansky | Right wing\n\n#3 Lieutenant Amanda Lee | Left wing\n\n#4 Lieutenant Scott Goossens | Slot\n\n#5 Lieutenant Commander Julius Bratton | Lead solo\n\n#6 Lieutenant Commander Griffin Stangel | Opposing solo\n\n#7 Lieutenant Commander Thomas Zimmerman | Narrator\n\n#8 Lieutenant Commander Brian Vaught | Events coordinator\n\nMeet Blue Angels' first woman pilot, Lt. Amanda Lee\n\nIn July, the Blue Angels made a historic announcement — naming the team’s first woman F/A-18E/F demonstration pilot.\n\nAlthough hundreds of women have served with the Blue Angels in a variety of capacities over 55 years, Lt. Amanda Lee, of Mounds View, Minnesota, was the first woman to serve as a demonstration pilot.\n\nAlthough Lee is the first fighter jet pilot to fly with the Blues’ squadron, she is actually the second female pilot to fly for the team. Marine Maj. Katie Higgins broke that barrier in 2014 flying the Blues’ C-130 Fat Albert for two seasons.\n\nGrowing up in Minnesota, Lee worked for UPS while attending the University of Minnesota in Duluth. She enlisted in the Navy before graduating from Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes, Illinois, in 2017.\n\nHer successes as an aviation electronics technician led to her selection into the Seaman-to-Admiral Commissioning Program. She was designated a naval aviator in April 2016.\n\nAfter earning her naval aviator wings, Lee was deployed to the USS Harry S. Truman in support of Dynamic Force Employment Operation INHERENT RESOLVE, as well as numerous exercises with NATO allies.\n\nIn 2019, Lee flew in the first ever all-female flyover that was part of the funeral service for retired Navy Capt. Rosemary Mariner, one of the first female Navy jet pilots and the first woman to command an operational naval aviation squadron.\n\nHave the Blue Angels crashed?\n\nOver the team's 77-year-history, 26 pilots and one crew member have died in crashes. The majority of the crashes occurred between 1946 and 1985. Five pilots have died since 1985:\n\nLt. Cmdr. Mike Gershon – On July 13, 1985, Lt. Cmdr. Mike Gershon's, #6, Skyhawk crashed into Lt. Andy Caputi, #5, during a show in Niagara Falls. Caputi was able to eject before the crash, but Gershon died in the collision.\n\n– On July 13, 1985, Lt. Cmdr.

Kieron O'Connor and Lt. Kevin Colling – On Oct. 28, 1999, Lt. Cmdr. Kieron O'Connor, and Lt. Kevin Colling, died after their F/A-18 jet struck the ground while practicing circle and arrival maneuvers in Valdosta, Georgia. According to a CNN article from 1999, Colling had just finished his first month with the squadron and was going to be one of the new pilots in 2000.\n\n– On Oct. 28, 1999, Lt. Cmdr.

Jeff Kuss, #6, died while performing the Split-S maneuver during a practice run for the Great Tennessee Air Show in Smyrna, Tennessee.\n\nWhere are the Blue Angels stationed?\n\nThe Blue Angels’ home base is Forrest Sherman Field, NAS Pensacola, during the air show season. The squadron spends January through March at NAF El Centro, California, for winter training.\n\nPlanning a trip to Pensacola? You can catch Blue Angels practice shows throughout the season. NAS Pensacola is currently closed to all guests without an active Department of Defense ID card. DoD ID card holders can escort up to 15 guests on base.\n\nAll non-DoD ID Card holder adults must have at least one of the following and remain escorted while aboard the installation:\n\nNon-CAC (common access card) local or regional DoD credential issued by the local installation or region\n\nREAL ID-compliant driver's license, enhanced driver's license, or non-driver's identification card issued by a State, territory, possession or the District of Columbia\n\nU.S. or Foreign Passport or Passport Card\n\nTravel Workers Identification Card (TWIC)\n\nVeterans Health Identification Card (VHIC)\n\nFederal PIV\n\nBlue Angels vs Thunderbirds — What’s the difference?\n\nThe Blue Angels is a U.S. Navy flight demonstration squadron that showcases the teamwork and professionalism of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. The team was formed in 1946 and is the second oldest formal aerobatic team in the world. It performs around 60 annual shows across 30 locations in the United States and two shows in Canada.\n\nThe Thunderbirds is a U.S. Air Force flight demonstration squadron that performs about 75 annual demonstrations. They are based at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The Thunderbirds fly the Air Force’s premier multi-role fighter jet, the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The white jets are easy to spot in the air thanks to the dark blue thunderbird painted on the underside of each jet. The Thunderbirds were created in 1953, making them the third oldest formal aerobatic team in the world.\n\nAccording to the Blue Angels’ official website, current Department of Defense policicy states that the use of military aviation demonstration teams is for recruiting purposes, so the teams don’t fly within 150 miles of each other without special permission.\n\nWhere are the Blue Angels right now\n\nBetween March and November, the team travels across the country, dazzling crowds with their blistering aerial performances. In between shows, the Blue return to their home base aboard NAS Pensacola for practice shows.\n\nThe show season wraps up in November, but that doesn’t mean the team gets a break. In January, the team will depart from NAS Pensacola head to NAF El Centro, in California, to hold winter training. The process repeats all over again in March.\n\nCheck the Blue Angels 2023 practice and show schedules below to find out where they are now:\n\nBlue Angels 2023 practice schedule\n\nApril - 4, 5*, 11,12*, 18, 19*, 25, 26*\n\n- 4, 5*, 11,12*, 18, 19*, 25, 26* May -

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/12/27/top-20-arizona-stories-from-past-decade-2010-to-2020/4411565002/", "title": "Top 20 Arizona stories from 2010-2020 shocked, united and divided ...", "text": "The past decade brought Arizona unspeakable tragedy with the shooting of a Congresswoman and wildfires that set records for acreage burned and lives lost.\n\nBut it also brought renewed prosperity to the state's beleaguered housing market, national attention for sporting events, and historic electoral wins for women in politics.\n\nFollowing are 20 of the biggest news stories in Arizona over the last decade.\n\n20. A string of major sporting events\n\nArizona businesses found an extra $720 million in their cash registers from Jan. 24 to Feb. 1, 2015, culminating with the New England Patriots defeating the Seattle Seahawks at the Super Bowl in Glendale.\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX's economic impact was the largest in state history, according to a post-event study. It was also the most-watched program in American television history, with an average of 114.4 million viewers.\n\nThe next year, the University of Alabama defeated Clemson University for the College Football Playoff National Championship at the same stadium.\n\nThen, to cap off a historic run of major sporting events, in 2017, the Final Four was played there, too. The University of North Carolina, the University of Oregon, Gonzaga University and the University of South Carolina came to town, with North Carolina winning the national championship.\n\nArizona will host its fourth Super Bowl in 2023. The previous times were in 2008 and 2015 in Glendale, while the 1996 game was at Sun Devil Stadium. Glendale also will host the 2024 Final Four.\n\n19. Freeway shootings put Phoenix on edge\n\nFor two weeks in August and September of 2015, motorists in Phoenix were on edge amid a shooting spree that left 11 vehicles shot, seemingly at random.\n\nThe spree initially was thought to have started on Aug. 29, 2015, when two cars driving on Interstate 10 through Phoenix between 19th and 59th avenues were hit with bullets.\n\nOver the next two weeks, nine more vehicles would get struck by gunfire and become part of a major investigation by the Department of Public Safety. Nobody was seriously hurt, but tensions were high on the freeways.\n\nA man named Leslie Allen Merritt Jr. was arrested Sept. 18 and charged in connection with the shootings. Gov. Doug Ducey even posted a victorious statement — \"We got him!\" — on Twitter after his arrest.\n\nBut after seven months in jail, the case against Merritt fell apart.\n\nThe charges were dropped and he was released amid questions about the timeline and whereabouts of his gun, which he pawned,and whether the shots actually came from his gun. DPS even revised the suspected date of one shooting, saying it actually took place on Aug. 27 but wasn't noticed until the 30th.\n\nMerritt settled for an undisclosed amount from the county in 2018.\n\n18. A historic deal to mitigate drought\n\nOn May 20, 2019, representatives from seven Western states signed a deal to help keep water in Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\n\nThe Drought Contingency Plan lays out cuts to Colorado River water use that supplies about 40 million people.\n\nThe river has been found to reliably supply less water than officials calculated when the water was initially divvied up among the states in 1922.\n\nAnd 19 years of drought conditions and a warming global climate are exacerbating the problem. Further cuts could be required if lake levels fall too far.\n\n17. APS plays hardball politics\n\nIn the lead up to the 2014 elections, millions of dollars in \"dark money\" was piling up behind two of the Republicans who aspired to be utility regulators at the Arizona Corporation Commission, Doug Little and Tom Forese.\n\nTheir Republican primary opponents, Vernon Parker and Lucy Mason, had taken strong positions supporting rooftop solar power.\n\nHow we got here: Arizona's rooftop-solar industry\n\nThe state's biggest utility, Arizona Public Service Co., had been waist-deep in policy disputes over rooftop solar. The company previously had a policy to abstain from financing candidates for the commission that set APS rates. Company officials no longer would make that commitment.\n\nBut APS also would not confirm until five years later that it was the source of millions of dollars that poured into the race for Little and Forese, even though nobody seriously doubted that APS had been the source, or suspected anyone else of making the contributions.\n\nAPS' parent company said in a letter to the commission that it gave $10.7 million to groups that in turn contributed to the Corporation Commission elections that year.\n\nFollowing that election, the Corporation Commission granted APS a $95 million rate hike in 2017 with broad changes to the rate plans available to customers.\n\nThose changes continue to cause headaches for the company and its customers.\n\n16. Uber self-driving car kills pedestrian in Tempe\n\nAn Uber vehicle equipped with self-driving capabilities crossed Tempe Town Lake on the Mill Avenue bridge heading north at 9:59 p.m. on March 18, 2018. It traveled at about 40 miles per hour as a woman named Elaine Herzberg slowly ambled across the road, pushing a bike.\n\nThe vehicle's sensors detected the woman six seconds before the car hit and killed her, but the computer couldn't determine what she was or where she was heading. The emergency brakes on the Volvo were disabled, and the driver, Rafaela Vasquez, was watching \"The Voice\" on her phone rather than watching the road.\n\nThe first fatal crash between a self-driving car and a pedestrian sent shockwaves through the transportation industry, which had settled on metro Phoenix as a prime site for real-world testing of autonomous technology.\n\nUber pulled its autonomous fleet out of the state, though the largest test on public roads continues here under one of its competitors, Waymo, which is affiliated with Google.\n\n15. Jodi Arias trial transfixes the nation\n\nCrime and drama enthusiasts were fixated on the Jodi Arias trial from January 2013 through March 2015, when it ended in a mistrial that would send the 34-year-old woman to prison for life.\n\nIt began at 5:30 on the evening of June 4, 2008, when 30-year-old Travis Alexander was sitting in the shower of his Mesa home. One minute and 46 seconds later, he was lying on his back on his bathroom floor with a stream of blood flowing down his neck.\n\nHe had been shot in the head, stabbed 27 times, and his throat was cut. Arias, 32, his secret lover, was charged with his murder.\n\nThe trial began in January 2013 and was live-streamed around the world over the internet. The prosecutor, Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Juan Martinez, and defense attorneys Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott, became well known for their roles.\n\nArias was found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2013. But that jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on whether to sentence her to death.\n\nA second jury was formed in October 2014 to impose only the sentence. But even without having to determine Arias' guilt or innocence, the second trial took as long as the first.\n\n14. Brian Terry's death becomes national scandal\n\nOn the night of Dec. 14, 2010, 40-year-old Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was on patrol 11 miles north of the Mexico border searching for a \"rip crew\" of criminals stealing from drug dealers and migrants. He was shot and killed in a firefight.\n\nThe man accused of pulling the trigger was caught in 2017 and convicted earlier this year.\n\nThat tragedy became a national scandal when, months after the killing, it was determined two AK-47s found at the scene were purchased in Glendale and tied to \"Operation Fast and Furious,\" an Arizona investigation in which agents monitored weapons and buyers after suspicious sales in an effort to track guns trafficked to cartel members.\n\nOperation Fast & Furious: What was it exactly?\n\nFederal authorities had previously denied that gun-store owners were encouraged to continue selling firearms to cartel operatives, some of whom visited shops repeatedly, purchasing dozens of assault rifles.\n\nThen emails surfaced that showed a gun dealer sharing misgivings with an ATF agent who encouraged him to continue selling firearms to those under investigation.\n\nSix of the seven people suspected in the shooting have been convicted as of February.\n\n13. Kayla Mueller abducted, killed in Syria\n\nOn the first weekend of August 2013, an aid worker who grew up in Prescott entered Syria with her boyfriend, who intended to help repair an internet connection at a hospital.\n\nBut the couple was captured, and while the boyfriend was released, Kayla Mueller would never return home. Her capture would remain a secret until her death in captivity in 2015.\n\nMueller had moved to Turkey in December 2012 and worked to help refugees. But in captivity, she was reportedly raped by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the terrorist group known as the Islamic State.\n\nAl-Baghdadi killed himself and three of his children when cornered by U.S. commandos during an October 2019 raid.\n\nHer body was never recovered, so her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, never got the chance to bury her.\n\n“I don’t know yet what happened to Kayla, what truly happened to Kayla,” Marsha told The Arizona Republic. She hoped the ISIS leader’s death would bring them answers.\n\n12. US Airways merges with American Airlines\n\nOn Monday, Dec. 9, 2013, US Airways and American Airlines officially merged operations. The $17 billion deal moved a major corporate headquarters out of Arizona.\n\nAmerica West Airlines launched in Arizona in the early 1980s with three aircraft and five destinations. It eventually overtook the much larger US Airways when that company was in bankruptcy in 2005.\n\nAmerican Airlines sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2011, and US Airways announced the merger in February of 2013. The deal moved the headquarters to Fort Worth, Texas, and the new Airline kept the American name.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed a federal lawsuit to block the merger, saying it was not good for consumers. The airlines reached a settlement with the DOJ, agreeing to keep their existing hubs, including Phoenix, at current levels for three years.\n\nThree years after the merger, American was cutting flights and moving to smaller aircraft, which contributed to an overall decline at Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\n11. The saga of Joe Arpaio\n\nOn the morning of Monday, July 17, 2017, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton found Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio had demonstrated “flagrant disregard” for another federal judge’s order that should have halted his signature immigration round-ups.\n\nArpaio, who was 85 at the time, faced up to six months in confinement for the guilty verdict in the contempt of court case.\n\nBut a little more than a month later, on Aug. 25, President Donald Trump pardoned Arpaio, removing the only legal consequences the lawman faced.\n\nThe White House announced the pardon on a Friday evening in a news release that recounted Arpaio's lengthy career of \"admirable service\" in federal and local law enforcement and called him \"a worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.\"\n\nArpaio had already lost a re-election bid for sheriff in 2016 after 24 years in office.\n\n10. Women hold the reins of power\n\nJan Brewer continued Arizona's tradition of women elected to the state's top political positions when she won the governor's race in 2010.\n\nBrewer initially became governor in January 2009, after Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano resigned to join Obama's Cabinet as the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nNear the end of the decade, in 2018, women won five of the seven major statewide contests on the ballot.\n\nDemocrat Kyrsten Sinema made history by becoming the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate in the state's 106-year-old history. Democrat Katie Hobbs won the secretary of state race while Republican Kimberly Yee was elected state treasurer. Voters made Democrat Kathy Hoffman the superintendent of public instruction, and Democrat Sandra Kennedy had the most votes for a seat on the Arizona Corporation Commission.\n\nLater, Gov. Doug Ducey appointed Martha McSally to an open U.S. Senate seat. That meant women filled both those posts, also for the first time in state history.\n\nThe historic 2018 election followed the \"Fab Five'' group of five women who won every major statewide executive office in the 1998 election.\n\n9. VA medical care scandal\n\nOn April 10, 2014, Arizona Republic reporter Dennis Wagner broke news that as many as 40 veterans may have died while awaiting care from the Phoenix VA Health Care System.\n\nThe VA's Office of Inspector General investigated more than 90 veterans' medical facilities and concluded some VA staffers intentionally manipulated appointment wait times, in part to secure performance bonuses.\n\nLawmakers grilled VA executives at congressional hearings. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned and other top administrators were forced out.\n\nCongress passed reforms that included $16.3 billion to expedite care. Additional medical workers were hired, new clinics were opened, and patients who could not get appointments within the VA were referred to private care.\n\n8. Wallow Fire is biggest in Arizona history\n\nAt about 11 a.m. Sunday, May 29, 2011, two cousins camping in the Bear Wallow Wilderness of eastern Arizona went for a hike without pouring water or dirt over the fire they used to cook breakfast that morning. They later said they thought the fire was out.\n\nWhile they were away, winds blew the ashes off the top of the fire and blew embers into the forest, igniting a fire that burned more than 538,000 acres over six weeks.\n\nThe biggest wildfire in state history, the Wallow Fire, burned 32 homes and 30 other structures in Apache, Greenlee, Graham and Navajo counties, and part of New Mexico. It cost $79 million to fight.\n\nAt its height, thousands of people were forced to evacuate, and only brave stands by firefighters saved the mountain hamlets of Alpine and Greer from being wiped off the map.\n\nCaleb and David Malboeuf were sentenced to 48 hours in jail and 200 hours of community service for failing to control their fire, and then later they were ordered to begin paying $500 a month each into a restitution fund.\n\n7. #RedforEd mobilizes teachers, shakes Capitol\n\nMore than 50,000 educators and #RedForEd supporters clad in red flooded the Phoenix streets leading to the state Capitol in April 2018.\n\nThe historic push for increased education funding included a statewide teacher walkout that closed more than 1,000 schools, affecting a combined enrollment of more than 840,000 students.\n\nThe threat of that action prompted Gov. Doug Ducey to recalculate education funding in his state budget, but the protest took place anyhow as state lawmakers had not introduced bills to enact Ducey's plan for 20% raises by 2020.\n\nDucey's budget plan eventually passed with money marked for teacher pay raises.\n\nThe plan as passed would not provide the funding for every single teacher to receive a 20% raise. Nor would it mandate that all the dollars provided go to teacher salaries, though districts generally have given raises.\n\n6. Border and immigration issues dominate the decade\n\nIn October 2018, the number of migrant families arriving at the southern border from poverty- and violence-stricken countries in Central America began to soar.\n\nFederal immigration authorities began releasing large groups at local churches, shelters and even bus stations.\n\nThe influx drew threats from President Donald Trump to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexican authorities did not curb the migration.\n\nMeanwhile, a fight over whether children brought to Arizona as undocumented immigrants — and who are protected from deportation under an Obama-era program — could obtain drivers licenses went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In March 2018, the justices refused to hear the state's appeal of a court ruling that allowed them to have driver's licenses.\n\nThe case, decided by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February 2017, centered on a lawsuit brought by the ACLU. The suit argued that Arizona was infringing on the federal power to make immigration policy by seeking to deny driver’s licenses to people protected under the Deferred Actions for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.\n\n5. John McCain dies\n\nSen. John McCain revealed on Wednesday, July 19, 2017, that he had a brain tumor known as glioblastoma, which set in motion a whirlwind year before he died of the disease Aug. 25, 2018.\n\nDuring his final year, the Republican cast an important vote to sink his fellow Republicans' partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nSenators voted 49-51 for the bill, falling two votes short of the 51 votes needed to pass the legislation. In addition to McCain, the Republicans who voted against the bill were Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nThe vote rekindled an ongoing feud between McCain and President Donald Trump that Trump has continued well past McCain's death.\n\nGov. Doug Ducey appointed former Senator Jon Kyl to the vacant Senate seat and then later appointed Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally when Kyl resigned.\n\n4. SB 1070 divides Arizona\n\nArizona became the epicenter of the national immigration debate on April 23, 2010 when then-Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law Senate Bill 1070.\n\nThe bill often is referred to as the \"show us your papers\" law and regarded as the toughest state action to deter undocumented residents.\n\nIt was immediately hit with several lawsuits, from the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nIt also prompted boycotts and criticism of the state.\n\nBefore the law could take effect, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton enjoined four sections of SB 1070 that she felt were unconstitutional and pre-empted by federal law.\n\nThose injunctions were upheld by the 9th Circuit and then taken to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOne of those statutes, which requires law-enforcement officers engaged in a lawful stop to ask about a person's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally, was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012.\n\n3. The housing market crashes, recovers\n\nThe housing crash and the Great Recession might have begun in 2007, but Phoenix-area home prices hit bottom in September 2011.\n\nThat's when the median plummeted to about $115,000.\n\nForeclosures were running at a clip of about 3,000 to 4,000 a month that year, about 10 times the norm, and about 49% of homeowners were underwater on their properties.\n\nIt wasn't until June 2018 that home prices recovered and again reached their previous high from 2006.\n\n2. Yarnell Hill Fire kills 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots\n\nNineteen wildland firefighters known as the Granite Mountain Hotshots were killed June 30, 2013, in the Yarnell Hill Fire, south of Prescott, when they were overrun by flames at 4:42 p.m.\n\nThe fire also burned 8,000 acres, destroyed 114 structures and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate.\n\nIt remains unclear to this day why the crew decided to leave a safe area that already had burned as winds were fueling the fire.\n\nThe events were re-created in a 2017 film called \"Only the Brave\" based in part on interviews with the fire crew's sole survivor, Brendan McDonough.\n\nHow accurate is 'Only the Brave'?: Here's what the movie gets right and wrong\n\n1. Shooting near Tucson horrifies nation\n\nU.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head and nearly killed just after 10 a.m. on Jan. 8, 2011, in a massacre that wounded 13 and killed six, including a 9-year-old girl and sitting District Court judge.\n\nBystanders at the public event at a grocery store north of Tucson tackled and disarmed 22-year-old Jared Loughner, who had a history of mental illness and later was sentenced to life in federal prison for the shooting.\n\nThe violence cut short Giffords' time in elected office, but she has remained a prominent voice in the national debate over gun policies. After the attack, she and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, formed a nonprofit to push for stricter gun control.\n\nKelly is running as a Democrat to challenge Republican Sen. Martha McSally for a U.S. Senate seat in November.\n\nReach reporter Ryan Randazzo at ryan.randazzo@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4331.

Here's when.", "text": "A super close Supermoon will occur this week. The moon will be as close to Earth as it can get this month, fully illuminated for skywatchers, according to the Earth Sky, a science website that provides daily news and information on astronomy and space.\n\nThe supermoon is set to rise on Wednesday, Nov. 5, with peak illumination at 8:19 a.m. ET. It will rise low on the horizon and, like the October Harvest moon, it will appear full for roughly three days, from October 5 to 7.\n\nIt the weather permits, this visual phenomenon will be low in the sky, making it perfect for photographing or simply taking in the crisp autumn evening sky.\n\nSo, what is a Supermoon?\n\nThe moon's orbit is elliptical, or egg-shaped, rather than a perfect circle around the Earth. A supermoon is a celestial event where the moon's orbit brings it closer to Earth than usual. When the Moon is full and it reaches its closest point to Earth, it is called a \"supermoon.\" As the Moon reaches perigee, the point when it is nearest to Earth in its orbit, the Moon will appear much larger and brighter.\n\nThe Nov. 5 supermoon will be the closest in 2025, at roughly 221,817 miles from Earth, according to EarthSky.org. That's 2,782 miles closer to Earth than October's supermoon, that was about 224,599 miles, which will make it appear even larger for skywatchers.\n\nYour brain makes comparisons between the moon and everyday objects, such as buildings, which are much smaller than the moon itself, when it is close to the horizon. The comparison causes your brain to inflate the moon's apparent size, giving the impression that it is enormous.\n\nWhat is a Beaver moon?\n\nThe November full moon has been referred to as Beaver Moon. The phrase comes from a number of Native American and European customs and mythology.\n\nOne theory is that beavers construct dams and stockpile food in November in order to get prepared for the winter. Beavers were also trapped in November so that their thick, winter-ready pelts could be used to make warmer clothing, according to NASA.\n\nHow to get the best view of the supermoon\n\nThe moon will appear bigger and brighter when it is low on the horizon than when it's higher in the skyline. Despite being a mental trick, this creates a breathtaking view. Tips for a better view:\n\n◾Check moonrise times: Find moonrise and moonset times by checking local listings. Most weather and star-gazing apps will have them.\n\n◾Location, location, location: Find a spot away from city lights and other light pollution, locate the moon in the sky and get comfortable.\n\n◾No lights: Your eyes will need to adjust to the darkness, which could take 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nIf you miss this months supermoon, not to worry. The next supermoon will occur next month on Thursday, Dec. 4.\n\nSOURCE: NASA, Space.com, EarthSky.org, BBC Sky at Night Magazine and University of Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Laboratory\n\nParts of story were previously published on Oct. 5, 2024.\n\nThis story was updated to clarify the amount of time the moon will appear full, from October 5-7.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/03/november-full-moon-2025-supermoon-beaver-moon/87061721007/", "title": "The November supermoon will be the closest to Earth.

The moon will also look full for several days after it peaks.\n\nWhat is a supermoon?\n\nSupermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon is at its closest to Earth all month, according to NASA. The phenomenon is known as \"perigee.\"\n\nBecause of that, the moon will look 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than it usually does.\n\n3 supermoons to occur in 2025\n\nNovember is not the only month with a supermoon this year. One already occurred in October, and another will happen on Thursday, Dec. 4.\n\nOf the three supermoons, November's full moon will be the closest to Earth at 221,817 miles away from Earth, with December's moon coming in second at 221,965 miles and October's moon in third at 224,600 miles, according to the Almanac.\n\nWill you be able to see November's supermoon?\n\nAs of Monday, Nov. 3, the National Weather Service is predicting that the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and most of California will have heavy sky cover between Nov. 5 at 7 p.m. ET and Nov. 6 at 1 a.m. ET.\n\nMaps of sky coverage\n\nWhy is it called the Beaver Moon?\n\nIn the U.S., moons are known by names associated with the folklore of Native American tribes, Colonial Americans, and Europeans, according to the Farmer's Almanac.\n\nThe Beaver Moon gets its name because this is the time when beavers start to take shelter in their lodges ahead of winter, according to the Farmer's Almanac. It was also the season when fur traders in North America trapped beavers for their winter pelts.\n\nThe moon is also known by the following names:\n\nDigging or Scratching Moon\n\nDeer Rutting Moon\n\nWhitefish Moon\n\nFrost Moon\n\nFreezing Moon\n\nJulia is a Trending reporter for USA TODAY and covers all things Labubu and Pop Mart, scientific studies and trending news.

It is the the second of three consecutive supermoons in 2025.\n\nAs the beaver supermoon sets over the horizon, it will appear larger and more orange, fitting into the fall season, although the orange coloring is really an illusion as the moon's light travels through more of the Earth's atmosphere when it is low on the horizon.\n\nThe full beaver supermoon will rise on the same night the the southern Taurids meteor shower peaks, followed by the northern Taurids peak the following week and the popular Leonids the week after that.\n\nHere's everything to know about the next full moon and exciting meteor showers' peak displays to watch for in November.\n\nWhen is the next full moon 2025?\n\nThe next full moon will be the November beaver supermoon, set to rise, Wednesday, Nov. 5, with peak illumination at 8:19 a.m. ET. It will rise low on the horizon and like the October Harvest moon, it will rise around the same time for several nights, including Tuesday.\n\nWhat is a supermoon?\n\nA supermoon happens when the moon's orbit is closest to the Earth at the same time the moon is full. According to NASA, at approximately 226,000 miles from Earth, the full moon appears brighter and larger than a regular full moon, hence the term supermoon.\n\nBecause supermoons are closer to the Earth than normal, the illusion is that they appear larger and brighter.\n\nSupermoons come in three and fours, consecutively. This year it started with September and ends in January 2026; the next cycle of full moons will not come again until November of 2026.\n\nWhy is it called the beaver moon?\n\nAccording the the Farmer's Almanac, the November full moon marks the time when some of the first snow appears in the northern sphere of the United States and Canada and when the fall foliage has past. Signs of frost on the grass gives beavers the sign to build their dams before the ground freezes.\n\nBeaver moon is a sign that winter is coming. Besides this being the time of year when they take up shelter, this also takes place at the time when the fur trade in North America took place. It was the season to trap beavers for their thick, winter-ready pelts.\n\nFull moon names have long been tied to early Native American, Colonial American and European folklore, according to the Almanac.\n\nWhat is a meteor shower?\n\nA meteor shower is celestial event that happens when Earth passes through the path of a comet or the trail of debris left by a comet or asteroid during its orbit around the sun. The debris is called meteoroids.\n\nMeteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds and burn up, streaking the sky with bright moving lights, like a \"shooting star\" from what appears to be a single point in the sky, called the radiant. They range in size from dust-like particles to boulder size.\n\nThese meteor showers are named for the constellation where the meteors appear to be coming from.\n\nThe best time of day to see a meteor shower is around midnight according to Space.com, it's best to go to the \"darkest possible location, and wait about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.\"\n\nWhen to watch the southern Taurid meteor shower 2025 peak?\n\nThere are two active Taurid meteor showers right now that are set to peak in November — the southern Taurids and the northern Taurids. Both named Taurid because \"both streams radiate from the constellation Taurus the Bull, not far from the bright star Aldebaran and the tiny, misty, dipper-shaped Pleiades,\" according to EarthSky.\n\nThe southern Taurids are active from Sept. 20 to Nov. 20, 2025 and will peak on the night of Nov. 4-5, coinciding with the rise of the November supermoon. They tend to be slow-moving at about five meteors per hour but this year will be a special treat in that it will be rich in fireballs.\n\nThe best time to watch the southern Taurids peak is around midnight on the night of Nov. 4-5.\n\nWhen to watch the northern Taurid meteor shower 2025 peak?\n\nThe northern Taurid meteor shower is active from Oct. 20 to Dec. 10, 2025 and will peak on the night of Nov. 11-12. While similar to the southern Taurids, the overlap in the two meteor showers can produce double the blazing fireball display in the sky leading up to its' peak.\n\nWhen will the Leonid meteor shower 2025 start?\n\nThe popular Leonid meteor shower display of shooting stars that light up the skys are set to start after the November full moon, on Nov. 6 through the 30th and peak on the morning of Nov. 18th. They are named Leonids because their meteors appear to come from the constellation Leo.\n\nThe Leonids are a result of the comet Tempel-Tuttle's melting particles that disintrigrate as it passes close ot the Sun during its orbit, leaving a trail of debris roughly the size of grains of sand or smaller, according to the Almanac. Earth travels through this debris field every year, hence the annual Leonid meteor shower.\n\nThe best time to watch the Leonids this year will be on the night of Nov. 17 against the dark sky and waning crescent moon, making for great views. They average a typical 10 to 15 shooting stars per hour or more.\n\nWhat are the current moon phases?\n\n🌑 New Moon: Oct. 21🌓 First Quarter: Oct. 29🌕 Full Moon: Nov. 5🌗 Last Quarter: Nov. 12🌑 New Moon: Nov. 20🌓 First Quarter: Nov. 28\n\nWhen is the December full moon 2025?\n\nThe December full moon of 2025, the cold supermoon, will occur on Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025.\n\nWhen is winter solstice 2025?\n\nThe winter solstice will bring us the shortest day of the year on Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025, with approximately 9 hours, 17 minutes of daylight.\n\nTo check how many hours of sunlight you'll get and the sunrise/sunset times in your area, click here.\n\nMaria Francis is a Pennsylvania-based journalist who covers trending topics across the Mid-Atlantic region.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/10/27/when-is-the-next-full-moon-november-2025-stargazing-meteor-showers/86882295007/", "title": "Is there a supermoon in November 2025?

It was also 2025's first supermoon - but November's full \"Beaver Moon\" has its own special features residents of South Carolina (and everyone else) won't want to miss.\n\nAnd that's not the only celestial event in November.\n\nHere's what to know about our next full moon, plus two meteor showers taking place in November and even more for stargazers.\n\nWhen is the next full moon? Full moon in November 2025\n\nNovember's Beaver Moon will reach peak illumination at 8:19 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 5, this year.\n\nWhen was the last full moon?\n\nOctober's full Harvest Moon peaked at 11:47 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 6, 2025.\n\nIs there a supermoon in November 2025?\n\nYes, the second supermoon of the year is in November.\n\nWhat is a supermoon?\n\nA supermoon occurs when a full or new moon falls during the closest point in the moon's orbit to Earth, according to NASA. The full moon can appear up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter at its closest point in the orbit.\n\nSupermoons generally appear three or four times a year, always consecutively. During 2024, there were four on Aug. 19, Sept. 17, Oct. 17 and Nov. 15.\n\nWhat is the largest supermoon of the year?\n\nNovember's supermoon is the biggest and brightest supermoon of the year, appearing 7.9% bigger and 16% brighter than a regular full moon, according to Star Walk.\n\nIs there a meteor shower in November 2025? When do the Southern Taurids peak?\n\nSeveral other astronomical events will take place during November beyond the supermoon. Two separate meteor showers will also peak during the month. Star Walk provided the following information on the Southern Taurid shower:\n\nMeteors/hour: 5-10\n\n5-10 Active: Sept. 20-Nov. 20\n\nSept. 20-Nov. 20 Peak: Nov. 11-12\n\nOne of the two branches of the Taurids meteor stream, the Southern Taurids can occasionally produce very bright meteors. In 2025, their peak falls when the moon is close to full. Star Walk suggests waiting a few days to view the shower until the moonlight is less obstructive.\n\nWhen does the Leonids meteor shower peak November 2025?\n\nAs for the Leonids meteor shower, Star Walk provides the following information:\n\nMeteors/hour: 10-15\n\n10-15 Active: Nov 6-30\n\nNov 6-30 Peak: Nov. 17-18\n\nThe Lenoids are famous for producing spectacular meteor storms, as in 1966 when U.S. observers reported 40-50 meteors per second. However, much more often is the usual 10 meteors per hour. This year, the Leonids peak three days before the new moon, meaning that the moonlight will present minimal interference for stargazers.\n\nWhy is November's full moon called the Beaver Moon?\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac says that the 12 full moons each year are named by Native Americans, according to previous reporting by the Hendersonville Times-News. UNC Asheville Associate Professor of Astronomy Britt Lundren reminded readers that, when sharing the names of the monthly moons, it's essential to acknowledge the cultural diversity of tribes in the U.S.\n\n\"Each tribe has a close relationship with the land, and their moon names will reflect the seasonal changes unique to their environments,\" Lundren said.\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac explains that the title \"Beaver Moon\" refers to November being the time of year when beavers begin to take shelter in their lodges. During the fur trade, it was also the best season for trapping beavers.\n\nOther names for the November full moon, according to the publication, include:\n\nDigging/Scratching Moon (Tlingit)\n\nDeer Rutting Moon (Dakota and Lakota)\n\nWhitefish Moon (Algonquin)\n\nFrost Moon (Creen and Assiniboine)\n\nFreezing Moon (Anishinaabe)\n\nFull moon names 2025\n\nHere's a list of the full moon names, courtesy of the Old Farmer's Almanac:\n\nJanuary - Wolf Moon\n\nFebruary - Snow Moon\n\nMarch - Worm Moon\n\nApril - Pink Moon\n\nMay - Flower Moon\n\nJune - Strawberry Moon\n\nJuly - Buck Moon\n\nAugust - Sturgeon Moon\n\nSeptember - Corn Moon (was Harvest Moon in 2024)\n\nOctober - Hunter Moon (also the Harvest Moon in 2025)\n\nNovember - Beaver Moon\n\nDecember - Cold Moon\n\nIris Seaton is the trending news reporter for the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.

A supermoon occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its orbit, making it appear larger and brighter than usual.\n\nSupermoons occur because the moon’s orbit is elliptical, meaning its distance from Earth varies. When a full moon coincides with this closest approach, it can appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than a typical full moon.

It's also sometimes called the Frost Moon due to the colder temperatures that begin to set in during November.\n\nIs there a black moon in 2024?\n\nAccording to Space.com, a black moon happens when there are two new moons in a single calendar month. This can occur in months with 30 or 31 days, where the first new moon occurs early, followed by the second new moon at the end of the month.\n\nNovember will not have a black moon, but December will, with the next one occurring on December 30.\n\nWhat are the full moon dates for 2024?\n\nThe final full moon of 2024 happens on Friday, Dec. 15.\n\nGot a story you want to share?

October's harvest moon will appear to be the largest moon and will illuminate the sky for several nights. Here's what to know and when to watch.\n\nThe October full moon will orbit closer to Earth than all the other full moons this year so far, making it a special supermoon that will appear the biggest, brightest and yellowest of 2025, giving stargazers a night to remember.\n\nThe harvest moon is also different from all other full moons in that it isn't tied to a particular month, but rather to the timing of the autumnal equinox, which can happen either in September or October. This year the autumnal equinox fell on Sept. 22.\n\nIn any typical year the September full moon is known as the corn moon and the October full moon is known as the hunter's moon, however every year one of these two — depending on which falls closer to the timing of the autumnal equinox — becomes the harvest moon.\n\nIt will be the first of three supermoons this year.\n\nHere's everything to know about the brilliant harvest supermoon of 2025 and the current moon phases.\n\nWhen is the next full moon 2025?\n\nThe next full moon will be the harvest supermoon, set to rise on Monday, Oct. 6, with peak illumination at 11:47 p.m. ET. It will rise low on the horizon and unlike other full moons, it will rise at about the same time for several nights.\n\nWhat is a supermoon?\n\nA supermoon happens when the moon's orbit is closest to the Earth at the same time the moon is full. According to NASA, at approximately 226,000 miles from Earth, the full moon appears brighter and larger than a regular full moon, hence the term supermoon.\n\nThis October supermoon will drift over the horizon around sunset and the illusion of a larger and brighter orange color moon will appear because of how close it is to the earth.\n\nWhy is it called the harvest moon?\n\nThe harvest moon came to be called that because of the abundance of bright moonlight in the early evening hours when farmers harvested their crops. They worked well into the night as autumn began, before electricity.\n\nUnlike other full moons, the harvest moon rises at nearly the same time for the few nights surrounding it, just 25 to 30 minutes later each day, versus the average 50 minutes later each day throughout the year. It will also rise very near sunset for those few nights, appearing like a full moon for three days in a row.\n\nWhy is it called the hunter's moon?\n\nThe hunter’s moon name comes from the traditional hunting season, as the brighter lunar light allowed hunters to track and gather game in preparation for the frigid days and nights of the winter to come.\n\nAccording to the Farmer's Almanac, October marked the season in the Northern Hemisphere, where the falling leaves and lasting moonlight made it easier to see and hunt animals at night and the brush is not as thick making hunting and tracking easier.\n\nThe October moon is also known as sanguine or blood moon, also referencing the blood from hunting or the color of changing autumn leaves.\n\nWhat are the current moon phases?\n\n🌑 New moon : Sept. 21\n\n: Sept. 21 🌓 First quarter : Sept. 29\n\n: Sept. 29 🌕 Full moon : Oct. 6\n\n: Oct. 6 🌗 Last quarter: Oct. 13\n\nWhen is the November full moon?\n\nThe November full moon of 2025, the beaver supermoon, will occur on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/10/23/beaver-moon-2025-supermoon-november/86849143007/", "title": "Here's how to see November's supermoon, the Beaver Moon, in 2025", "text": "October is nearly over, and time is bringing us to the closest supermoon of the year, the Beaver Moon.\n\nThe supermoon is an incredible sight, and it will look around 30% brighter and up to 14% larger, according to NASA.\n\nIn December, another supermoon will make an appearance, but November's supermoon will be the closest of the year.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 5, the supermoon is expected to hit its peak and will light up the night sky, and it will be 221,817 miles away from Earth at its nearest point, according to the Farmer's Almanac.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the full moon in November.\n\nMore news: Video shows suspected space junk being found on remote Australian road\n\nWhen will November's full moon reach its peak?\n\nThe full moon will be at its peak on Wednesday, Nov. 5, at 8:19 a.m. ET, according to the Farmer's Almanac.\n\nWhen will be the best time to see the November supermoon?\n\nThe moon will reach its peak during the day, but it will still appear full at night for multiple days.\n\nWhat is a supermoon?\n\nSupermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon is at its closest to Earth all month, according to NASA.

Protests and even cases of vandalism have plagued Tesla dealerships across the U.S. as President Donald Trump, a staunch ally of Musk's, has vowed to prosecute those suspected of committing crimes.\n\nThe Cybertruck recall, the latest from Tesla, is to fix an exterior panel that could detach while driving, the company said. The recall covers more than 46,000 vehicles built from November 2023 through Feb. 27 of this year, Tesla said in a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe recall is the eighth for the SUV since January 2024.\n\nTesla recalls Cybertruck over exterior panel issue\n\nTesla said it is recalling the electric pickup truck because of the risk of a stainless-steel exterior trim panel detaching from the vehicle, causing a potential road hazard and raising the chances of a crash.\n\nThe NHTSA first notified Tesla of a Cybertruck owner who claimed a vehicle underwent a rail panel detachment Feb. 21.\n\nTesla, which indicated it is aware of 151 warranty claims possibly related to the recall issue, said its service will replace the rail panel assembly with a new one that meets durability testing requirements. The issue prompting the recall has not caused any collisions or injuries, the EV maker said.\n\nUpdated trim protection will also begin being used in the company's production on Friday, Tesla said. Vehicles produced before then but still in Tesla’s possession will be retrofitted before delivery.\n\nTesla stock struggles\n\nThe recall comes as Tesla has seen its stock plummet by more than 50% since December.\n\nAmid the slump, Trump and his administration have publicly supported Musk in an effort to help the president's ally boost sales. Earlier this month, the president posed with a lineup of Tesla vehicles in front of the White House, later saying on social media he planned to buy a Tesla \"as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck recall is just the latest from Tesla, which In February recalled more than 375,000 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles for a power steering issue.\n\nProtests at Tesla\n\nMusk's work through the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to drastically cut federal spending has sparked plenty of pushback, including protests, lawsuits and, in some cases, vandalism.Musk, who is categorized as a \"special government employee,\" has made sweeping cuts to the federal government, implemented mass firings and canceled billions of dollars in contracts as the head of DOGE.\n\nThe moves have made Musk's Tesla dealerships frequent targets in recent weeks, and when the blowback has turned violent, Trump and Musk have both referred to the attacks as domestic terrorism. On Thursday, the Justice Department announced that three individuals are facing \"serious charges\" for allegedly using Molotov cocktails to set Tesla cars and charging stations on fire.\n\n“The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.”\n\nEarlier this week, the Vancouver International Auto Show also booted Tesla out of its annual event following the swarm of attacks on the brand's electric vehicles.\n\nContributing: Aysha Bagchi, Savannah Kuchar, Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Similar actions by Republicans in Indiana, Missouri and Ohio, as well as Democrats in Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia, are also under consideration.\n\nThe fight over Prop 50, which is expected to cost $282.6 million in taxpayer funds, according to the California Department of Finance, has been one of the most expensive ballot fights in state history.\n\nThe campaigns supporting Proposition 50 have raised roughly $171 million in total — more than double what was raised by the groups opposing the ballot measure, according to the California Secretary of State’s office.\n\nNewsom, Trump react to redistricting approval\n\nDemocrats widely cheered the quick call for the measure’s passage Tuesday night, with the result's passage declared within minutes of polls closing across California. However, Newsom struck a dire tone in an address shortly after the race was called Tuesday night.\n\n\"Our founding fathers did not live and die to see the kind of vandalism to this republic and our democracy that Donald Trump is trying to perpetuate,\" Newsom said.\n\nNewsom also called on other Democratic states' leaders to \"meet this moment head-on\" and \"to recognize what we're up against in 2026.\"\n\n\"Let me make this crystal-clear: We can de facto end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives,\" Newsom said, referring to the Democratic minority leader. \"It is all on the line — a bright line — in 2026.\"\n\nAfter the result was called Tuesday, many conservatives bemoaned the process and maintained it was unfair to California's voters.\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, the chair of the lead opposition group against Proposition 50 and a former chair of the California Republican Party, said Tuesday night that the campaign \"left everything on the field fighting to stop Gavin Newsom and Sacramento politicians’ partisan power grab.\"\n\n\"In the end, the tens of millions poured in to promote these gerrymandered maps were too much to overcome, as Newsom put his national ambitions ahead of protecting California’s voter-approved independent redistricting commission and the millions of voices now silenced,\" Patterson said.\n\nWhy was Proposition 50 on the ballot?\n\nThe proposal to carve up California’s congressional maps quickly evolved from a long-shot idea to reality over the summer, when Texas lawmakers passed new maps that likely flip five seats currently held by Democrats.\n\nIn July, Newsom began to discuss changing California’s redistricting system as a response to the gerrymandering in Texas, which was encouraged by Trump.\n\nCalifornia state officials formally moved forward with the measure in August, with Newsom saying on social media in a tone mocking Trump's online style that the maps “WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.”\n\nWill Newsom run for president in 2028?\n\nThe special election for Proposition 50 has placed a national spotlight on California. And Newsom, whose final term as governor is up next year, remains the subject of widespread speculation about a potential run for the White House in 2028. He’s traveled to several battleground states, including a summer trip to South Carolina, where Democrats may start their 2028 primary elections.\n\nNewsom has declined to comment on his plans, though he’s lately been more open to discussing them. Last week, the governor told CBS News that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nSupporters of Proposition 50 have deployed some of the Democratic Party’s biggest stars to publicly back the measure, including former President Barack Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe proposition has drawn widespread opposition from Republicans in California and nationwide. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been a vocal critic of Prop 50, though he did not take a starring role in the public campaign against the measure.\n\nTrump, a longtime foe of Newsom’s, criticized the proposal on Election Day, calling Prop 50 a \"GIANT SCAM\" on social media and saying the voting itself is \"RIGGED,” without offering any evidence. The California secretary of state, whose office oversees elections, called the president's comments \"ramblings\" and noted the lack of proof.\n\nTom Coulter covers local government for The Desert Sun.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has a message for Democrats around the country: Follow my lead.\n\nDeclaring victory for Proposition 50, his Democratic redistricting ballot measure, he named five other states led by Democrats and urged their governors to tilt their own congressional maps in favor of the party and help it secure the U.S. House in next year’s midterms.\n\n“We need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,” he said. “We can de facto end Donald Trump’s presidency as we know it, the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives. It is all on the line.”\n\nIt had the decisive air of a politician claiming the national mantle. And though he nodded to House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries’s role, the subtext was clear: Newsom was the one who just delivered the party the likelihood of five new seats in Congress.\n\nWith Prop. 50’s overwhelming passage, the governor has vaulted — for the moment — into the role of Democratic favorite in the 2028 presidential campaign. Newsom’s national ambitions have never been veiled, but this year he for the first time acknowledged he’s considering it. Having amassed more than tens of thousands of new donors nationwide to support his ballot measure, he also now has a roster of supporters to call on in a potential campaign.\n\nCable news shows lit up with mentions of the governor’s success at pulling off the redistricting gambit. MSNBC commentator and former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill declared Newsom has “moved to the front of the pack” among potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders such as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\n“He’s in the top tier,” said Democratic pollster and strategist Celinda Lake. “It was a really outside-the-box idea, implemented well, implemented fast, united the party. And it also showed he was tough.”\n\nYet one victory in an off-year election driven by the nationwide mood of angry Democrats decidedly set against Trump does not necessarily predict a future successful campaign. Prop. 50 was purely anti-Trump, and Democratic strategist Matt Rodriguez said Democrats still need an independent vision to win back Congress or the White House.\n\nBut looking at possible 2028 contenders, “there’s no question (Newsom is) light years ahead of everyone else.”\n\n“He’s the only one driving his own news,” he said. “Everyone else is like a moth to flame.”\n\n‘Iterating’ a vision and a message\n\nNewsom’s prospects for national prominence weren’t always so bright. For years, he’s been experimenting with how to get attention by confronting Republicans on the national stage, challenging them to debates on Fox News and bankrolling red-state billboards advertising California’s reproductive rights. In 2023 he similarly called on other states’ lawmakers to follow his lead for a constitutional amendment on gun control. No other state joined the effort.\n\nIn the first few months of 2025, as Democrats struggled with how to recover from the 2024 loss to Trump, Newsom was podcasting with right-wing activists and mulling their successes. It was the latest in a series of his efforts to try on new political approaches, which the governor frequently describes to reporters as “iterating.”\n\nWhen Texas Democrats approached Newsom for support over the summer as they tried to fight off a Trump-backed GOP gerrymandering effort there, a counter-proposal from California was considered an extraordinary political risk for the governor.\n\nIt wasn’t clear all Democrats in California’s congressional delegation or the state Legislature were on board, let alone a majority of the state’s voters. But by the end of a 10-week campaign, so many people had donated to support the measure that Newsom told them to stop sending money, while two opposition campaigns failed to capture attention with a cohesive message.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever seen the entirety of the left of politics in California come together in this way in a campaign,” said Neel Sannappa, an organizer with the left-wing California Working Families Party and chair of the California Democrats’ Progressive Caucus.\n\nA knack for trolling\n\nNewsom succeeded, strategists said, by taking a risk in an almost impromptu way that was well-timed with voters’ mounting alarms about Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to American cities, aggressive immigration raids and redistricting efforts in other states.\n\nIt didn’t hurt his own standing that he was also engaging in a social media trolling campaign against Trump, adding to perceptions that he was willing to embrace the brash, unconventional politics that led to the president’s own rise. The posts — often AI-generated, sometimes crude, and always extremely online — have delighted Democrats in a way even skeptical progressives like Sannappa commended.\n\n“He was thrust into the spotlight as a result of this particular situation (with Texas) and I think he made the most of it,” said Brian Brokaw, a strategist who advises Newsom. “One of his greatest strengths is his ability to evolve with changing times and changing dynamics … It’s reflected in the positive results of last night.”\n\nMonths ago, Newsom already acknowledged that one day the tweets will get old, and he would need a new strategy.\n\n“We’re iterating,” he said at an August event hosted by Politico. “That’s been the cause of my life.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/04/election-2025-live-updates-results/86572339007/", "title": "2025 election recap: Dems sweep Virginia, NJ, California races", "text": "It was a good night for Democrats.\n\nA year after former Vice President Kamala Harris suffered an electoral beating by President Donald Trump, Democrats across the country – from Virginia to California – notched major victories in a sign of growing momentum ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nIn Virginia, a state with thousands of federal workers affected by the government shutdown and Department of Government Efficiency cuts, Abigail Spanberger soundly defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome-Earle Sears, reports say. In New Jersey, which last year saw hoards of voters move toward Trump, projections say Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill won against Republican businessman Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nNext door, in New York City, voters chose progressive Zohran Mamdani and his affordability platform over the more centrist former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nAnd in California, voters overwhelmingly supported Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting referendum allowing the state legislature to redo congressional maps and add up to five new Democratic-leaning seats ahead of the 2026 election.\n\nTrump kept his distance from the races this year, never having stepped on the campaign trail for any of his party’s contenders, though he still loomed on voter’s minds. Democrats' sweeping victories come as a troubling sign for the president and his party.\n\nRebuking Trump, California passes Prop 50 to redistrict in Democrats' favor\n\nEarly results indicate that California voters have passed Proposition 50, reports say, helping Democrats in the redistricting frenzy that will likely decide who controls the House in the final two years of Trump's second term.\n\nProp. 50 is a constitutional amendment allowing the state to temporarily stop using a nonpartisan commission to draw congressional district boundaries. Instead, leaders could use lines drawn by Democratic state lawmakers to increase the seats they hold in Congress. After the 2030 U.S. Census, the nonpartisan commission will resume drawing the lines.\n\nThe measure is one of the most important issues being decided on Election Day. It essentially negates the five new Republican-leaning congressional districts Texas created earlier this year at Trump's urging. At least a dozen states have changed their boundary lines or are in the process of doing so before the 2026 midterms.\n\nElection results maps and analysis: Democrats sweep 2025 races in NYC, Virginia, New Jersey, California\n\nConservative chair: ‘Republicans have clear opportunities to flip seats’ in California after Prop 50 win\n\nNational Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said in a statement after the passage of California’s Prop 50 the GOP can still flip seats in the state.\n\n\"No matter how Democrats redraw the lines to satisfy Gavin Newsom’s power grab, they can’t redraw their record of failure, and that’s why they will fail to take the House majority,” he said.\n\nThe redistricting race underway across the country began with Trump successfully urging Texas lawmakers to redraw district boundaries to be less favorable to Democrats, prompting California Dems to follow suit with districts less favorable to the GOP.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina have followed, suit and several states led by Democrats are also considering redrawing lines ahead of 2026.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says Republicans 'got our a--es handed to us tonight'\n\nOhio governor candidate Vivek Ramaswamy offered a stark assessment for Republicans on the Nov. 4 election results: \"We got our a--es handed to us.\"\n\nIn a video posted to X, Ramaswamy said the party's losses in governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as New York City's mayor race, offered lessons for his party.\n\n– Carl Weiser\n\nTrump renews call for Republicans to terminate filibuster after Democrats win elections\n\nTrump in an election night social media post renewed his call for Republicans to block the 60-vote threshold in the Senate known as the filibuster.\n\n“REPUBLICANS, TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER! GET BACK TO PASSING LEGISLATION AND VOTER REFORM!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nIn an earlier post, the president blamed Republicans’ poor election showing on his name not being on the ballot and the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nTrump is set to host Senate Republicans at the White House for a Wednesday morning breakfast.\n\n‘Plenty of work to do,’ Barack Obama says\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who campaigned over the weekend for Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia, congratulated Tuesday night's victors.\n\nHe called the results “a reminder that when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win,” in a post on X.\n\n“We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” Obama wrote.\n\nTexas' 18th Congressional District heads to runoff\n\nThe race to fill Texas' empty 18th Congressional District seat is headed toward a runoff, according to reports, with acting Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards receiving the necessary votes.\n\nThe district, which encompasses much of Houston, has been without a representative for nearly eight months. Democrat Sylvester Turner, a former Houston mayor, passed away abruptly less than two months after he was sworn into office.\n\nHe had won the seat to fulfill the remainder of former Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's term, who died in July 2024 at the age of 74. Both were members of the Congressional Black Caucus, contributing to the district's reputation as a decades-long center of Black political power.\n\nWhoever wins early next year will barely have time to get comfortable before switching to campaign mode again in March, when the district holds a primary for its newly redrawn borders ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nJack Ciattarelli concedes NJ governor’s race\n\nCiattarelli conceded the New Jersey gubernatorial race to Sherrill Tuesday night and joked that he’d eaten “more BLTs and onion soups” than anyone on record while barnstorming at New Jersey diners throughout the campaign.\n\n“Nobody is more disappointed than I am,” he said of the loss. “It is my hope that Mikie Sherrill has heard us in terms of what we need to do to make New Jersey that place where everybody believes they can achieve that American Dream.”\n\nElection results maps and analysis: Democrats sweep 2025 races in NYC, Virginia, New Jersey, California\n\n'Trump wasn’t on the ballot': President reacts to Democratic victories\n\nTrump blamed GOP election loses on the government shutdown and the fact that he wasn’t on the ballot in his first comments after key races were called.\n\n\"TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,\" according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote.\n\nDemocrats won big victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governors’ races in the first round of voting since Trump’s 2024 win.\n\nTrump to host Republican senators, give remarks at morning breakfast\n\nTrump is set deliver remarks to Senate Republicans at the White House during a Wednesday morning breakfast as the federal government shutdown becomes the longest in U.S. history at 36 days.\n\nTrump is scheduled to address Republicans at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nIt comes as the president has urged Republicans to break the 60-vote hurdle in the Senate known as the filibuster in order to reopen the government. That would allow for a simple majority to pass a Republican-backed spending resolution.\n\nTrump’s efforts, however, have been met by resistance from some Republican senators, including Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, who said Tuesday \"the votes aren’t there\" to get rid of the filibuster.\n\nWin for Josh Shapiro: Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices keep their seats\n\nThree Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices will keep their seats for another 10-year term as voters Tuesday sided with Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and rejected a GOP push to oust the trio in what has traditionally been a nonpartisan contest.\n\nJustices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht, who were elected as Democrats a decade ago to the commonwealth's highest court, won their retention elections Tuesday according to the Associated Press and NBC News. That's despite efforts to force an open judicial election for their seats in 2027. Shapiro, who is considered a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, urged voters to keep the three judges.\n\nVoters were asked Tuesday simply whether or not to retain the justices -- not to choose between them and a challenger. Pennsylvania elects judges to its supreme, superior and commonwealth courts first in a partisan election. However, retention elections are nonpartisan, meaning a justice's political affiliation is not included on official election materials, including the ballot itself.\n\nOnly one time has a state Supreme Court justice lost their retention election.\n\n– Matthew Rink\n\nCalifornia GOP Chair knocks Prop 50\n\nThe head of California's Republican Party said state GOP voters will be severely impacted if Prop 50 passes as anticipated.\n\n\"I think it's a shame,\" California Republican Party Chairwoman Corrin Rankin told KGO-TV on Election Day. \"I think that under no circumstance should any voter in California be disenfranchised while they have maps being drawn behind closed doors at the State Capitol by one or two persons.\"\n\nAccording to a recent poll by the University of California, Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, about six out of 10 likely voters support Prop. 50. It would redraw the state’s congressional districts and give Democrats a possible edge toward regaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAbout 26% of California's registered voters are Republican, according to the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank. The California GOP has said Prop 50's redrawn congressional maps, even temporarily, will hand the power back to state-level politicians, and not voters.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nJay Jones wins VA AG race, overcomes text scandal\n\nDemocrat Jay Jones secured victory in Virginia’s race for attorney general, according to NBC News and Fox News, overcoming a text message scandal that threatened his chances.\n\nDays before the election, polls showed Jones locked in a dead heat with the Republican incumbent attorney general, Jason Miyares. Jones, a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, led the race for months until reports surfaced in September that he once mused about shooting a Republican lawmaker in the head. He sent the messages to a GOP lawmaker in 2022.\n\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu will serve another term\n\nDemocratic Boston Mayor Michelle Wu won her bid for a second four-year term as mayor after running unopposed in the Nov. 4 mayoral election.\n\nA local ABC station projected her win, and unofficial city results showed a major lead over write-ins.\n\nWu, 40, became the first woman and person of color elected to lead the city in 2021. She has focused much of her campaign on local issues, including improving housing affordability. Boston has become a target of Trump’s crackdown on Democratic cities.\n\nThe mayor sailed through Boston's four-way Sept. 9 primary, defeating her primary challenger Josh Kraft, a fellow Democrat and the son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nMamdani defeats Cuomo in NYC\n\nZohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who shot to stardom and shook up Democratic politics, has won the race for mayor of New York City.\n\nThe Associated Press, NBC News and CNN called the race for Mamdani around 9:30 p.m., as his next-closest opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, trailed.\n\nMamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens, was at 1% in the polls when he launched an upstart campaign focused on the cost of living. He offered unabashedly left-leaning proposals including a rent freeze on rent-stabilized units, free buses and universal child care, paid for by levying taxes on the city’s wealthiest. Several of the city's billionaires donated millions of dollars to launch attack ads against him.\n\nSchumer: Election results a 'repudiation' of Trump\n\nTuesday's election results, which so far have brought sweeping victories for Democrats, represent a \"repudiation of the Trump agenda,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said.\n\n\"If Republicans want to keep blindly following Donald Trump into the abyss of chaos, let them. The rest of America is moving forward,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe comments came amid signs that Schumer is dealing with new restlessness among moderate Senate Democrats, many of whom have grown increasingly eager to work with their Republican counterparts to end the ongoing government shutdown.\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nSpanberger blasts 'chaos coming out of Washington'\n\nTrump’s targeting of the federal workforce loomed over the Virginia governor’s race, with Spanberger vowing again in her victory speech to protect the state’s jobs and “stand up to anyone who tries to harm our economy or the livelihoods of our Virginians.”\n\nTrump slashed federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency, and the government shutdown has also rocked federal workers. Spanberger campaigned on the issue, and her victory could indicate growing backlash to Trump’s policies.\n\nSpanberger slammed “those across the Potomac who are attacking our jobs” and vowed not to “stand by silently while you attack Virginia’s workers.”\n\n“I will always stand up for Virginia workers… and right now our federal workforce is under attack and the chaos coming out of Washington is killing Virginia jobs and creating economic uncertainty for tens of thousands of families,” she said.\n\nElection results maps and analysis: Democrats sweep 2025 races in NYC, Virginia, New Jersey, California\n\nDetroit elects Mary Sheffield as next mayor, making history as first woman to lead city\n\nDetroit City Council President Mary Sheffield made history Tuesday night, Nov. 4, according to the Associated Press and CNN, becoming the city's first woman mayor in an election she led from start to finish.\n\nSheffield defeated the Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr., pastor of Triumph Church, celebrating Tuesday night with hundreds of friends, family and supporters at a glitzy event at MGM Grand Detroit.\n\nThe 12-year city council veteran was the first mayoral candidate to form a committee in the race — two years before the election — to succeed Mayor Mike Duggan, who is opting to run for governor as an independent rather than seek a fourth term. She cruised to victory in the August primary, collecting 51% of the vote to Kinloch's 17% in a crowded nine-way contest.\n\n– Violet Ikonomova, Dana Afana, M.L. Erick\n\n'I’m working on it': Spanberger chides daughter for dirty room in victory speech\n\nIn a lighthearted moment during her victory speech, Spanberger, a mother of three, scolded one of her daughters for not cleaning her room while thanking her family for their support.\n\nExasperated, her daughter responded back, \"I’m working on it.\"\n\nSpanberger went on to acknowledge the history-making nature of her win. She is the first woman elected to lead Virginia in the state’s 236-year history.\n\nAfter she won, Spanberger said her husband told her children their mother was going to be governor. \"I can guarantee those words have never been spoken in Virginia before,\" she joked.\n\n\"It’s a big deal,\" she said. \"The history Virginia is making tonight is yours.\"\n\nVirginia chose ‘pragmatism,’ Spanberger says\n\nSpanberger, dressed in a dark red suit, strolled onto the stage at her victory party in Richmond, Virginia, Tuesday night to chants of \"Abby\" from the crowd.\n\nSpanberger, known as a centrist Democrat, leaned into her middle-of-the-road brand of politics in her victory speech and said the state had \"turned a page\" from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.\n\n\"Tonight, we sent a message,\" Spanberger said. \"We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship. We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.\"\n\nAtlanta reelects Democratic Mayor Andre Dickens\n\nMayor Andre Dickens has won his bid to lead Atlanta for another four years, reports say, following the city's decades-long tradition of reelecting their mayors for second terms.\n\nDickens, a Democrat and former Atlanta city councilmember, faced three challengers seeking to take his place as the city’s leader. He was elected by a wide majority in 2021 in a runoff election, replacing former mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms after she declined to run for a second term.\n\nAtlanta has long been a stalwart Democratic base in the South, while Georgia has become less reliably Republican in the last few presidential elections. Former President Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020 − the first time Democrats carried the state since 1992 − though it returned to Republicans in Trump's 2024 race.\n\nVP Vance's half brother loses in challenge of Cincinnati's Democratic mayor\n\nVice President JD Vance's half-brother, Republican Cory Bowman, lost his long-shot bid in the nationally watched Cincinnati mayoral race, reports say, falling short against Democratic incumbent Aftab Pureval.\n\nCrime had dominated the headlines and campaign in the southern Ohio local race.\n\nCincinnati leaders faced criticism this summer after several high-profile incidents, including the stabbing of Patrick Heringer in his home.\n\nBowman and Republicans tried to paint the city as overrun with crime. Pureval countered that the city leadership combatted crime through numerous measures, including implementing a stricter curfew and recruiting more officers.\n\n– Scott Wartman\n\nDemocrat Corey O'Connor wins Pittsburgh mayoral race\n\nDemocrat Corey O’Connor is the next mayor of Pittsburgh, reports say, defeating Republican challenger and former city police officer Tony Moreno.\n\nO'Connor is the Allegheny County Controller and a former Pittsburgh city councilor. He's the son of former mayor Bob O'Connor, who died while in office in 2006.\n\nHis win is a possible temperature gage in the city, the second-largest in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, after defeating the sitting Democratic mayor Ed Gainey in the May primary. Gainey is the city’s first Black mayor, and he represents a more progressive wing of the party. His defeat by the more centrist O'Conner has turned the race into a closely watched off-year election as next year's midterms draw closer.\n\nDemocrat Ghazala Hashmi wins historic Virginia lieutenant governor's race\n\nDemocrat Ghazala Hashmi is projected to win the Virginia lieutenant governor's race, becoming the first Muslim women ever elected to statewide office in the country. She defeated Republican John Reid, a conservative talk radio host and founder of the cultural heritage organization The Virginia Council.\n\nHashmi is an educator, who taught as a professor at the University of Richmond and Reynolds Community College. She was first elected to the Virginia Senate in 2019 and became the first Muslim and the first South Asian American in the state legislature.\n\nHashmi moved to the United States from India at age four with her family. She is married and has two adult daughters.\n\nIn Virginia, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor. The post is viewed as a stepping stone to the governor's mansion.\n\nDem groups praise Spanberger win\n\nDemocratic-leaning groups from Planned Parenthood to the gun-safety organization Giffords celebrated Spanberger’s victory in the Virginia governor’s race Tuesday night.\n\nPlanned Parenthood called Spanberger a \"proven champion for reproductive rights\" and said \"Virginians can count on her to protect access to birth control, abortion, fertility treatment, and miscarriage care.\"\n\nAbortion was a major issue for voters in the Virginia governor’s race as the state is set to weigh a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. Spanberger has been a vocal advocate of the amendment.\n\nPolls close in New Jersey at 8 p.m.\n\nPolls closed in New Jersey at 8 p.m. People already in line by the time of closing will still be able to cast a ballot.\n\nSpanberger wins Virginia governor's race\n\nSpanberger defeated Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race, reports say, dealing a blow to the Republican Party ahead of consequential midterm elections next year.\n\nSpanberger’s win is historic: She is the first woman elected to lead Virginia.\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown and Department of Government Efficiency cuts played a central role in the race, given the large population of federal employees in Virginia. Spanberger, 46, campaigned on the discontent of laid-off and furloughed federal workers, and she sought to highlight the economic toll of Trump’s agenda.\n\nPolls close in Virginia at 7 p.m.\n\nPolls are set to close in Virginia at 7 p.m. All voters in line by that time will be able to vote.\n\nImproper signs taken down at northern Virginia polling location\n\nSeveral political signs put up near a polling location in Frederick County have been taken down for not having a disclaimer about the person or organization behind them, an election official told USA TODAY.\n\nA Reddit user included a photo of the signs at the Evendale Elementary School polling location in a thread that had received hundreds of comments by Tuesday afternoon. The photo shows five signs, four of which are white with black font and include the messages \"I am Charlie Kirk,\" \"Democrat Policies Increase Crime,\" \"Democrats Hide Their Culpability With Lies\" and \"Spanberger Wants to Allow Boys in Girls Bathrooms.\"\n\nFrederick County Elections Director Rich Venskoske said his office received complaints about the sign on Tuesday morning, adding that several people expressed that they \"felt intimidated\" by them. He described the signs as \"distasteful\" but said they would have been permitted to remain in place if they had a disclosure.\n\nA sign for Frederick County School Board candidate Patrick North had the proper disclaimer and was not removed, Venskoske said.\n\nWinner of Virginia’s governor’s race set to make history\n\nWhether it’s Democrat Abigail Spanberger or Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, the winner of the Virginia governor’s race tonight will make history as the first woman elected to lead the state.\n\nThe two candidates for lieutenant governor will also make history. If she wins, Democrat Ghazala Hashmi will be the first Muslim woman elected to statewide office in the country. If Republican John Reid wins, he will be the first openly gay member of his party to win statewide office in the nation.\n\nHow do Dems feel about Virginia races? Pretty good, it seems.\n\nDemocrats appear confident about Abigail Spanberger’s chances of winning Virginia’s gubernatorial race, with the latest polls showing her up 10 points over her Republican opponent Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nCase in point: Rather than hitting the campaign trail, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-VA, was spotted at a college basketball game on the eve of the election. Kaine was supporting his alma mater, the University of Missouri, in a basketball game against Howard University in Washington, DC Monday night.\n\nNAACP sues over student voter registration in Virginia\n\nThe NAACP Virginia State Conference filed a lawsuit against election officials across the commonwealth, saying they illegally rejected voter registration applications from on-campus college students.\n\nThe complaint alleges that election officials required on-campus students to provide information including a dormitory name and room number with their voter registration applications.\n\n“This is a clear attempt to rob students of the right to vote in a state where they study and potentially live once they graduate,” NAACP senior associate general counsel Anthony P. Ashton said in a Nov. 3 news release. “Virginia’s own voter registration form does not ask for dorm room information, and federal law makes clear that immaterial omissions cannot be used to deny eligible citizens their right to vote. These practices are discriminatory, unlawful, and must stop immediately.”\n\nThe complaint accuses the plaintiffs of violating students’ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The affected students attend schools including Virginia State University, James Madison University, Norfolk State University and Virginia Commonwealth University, the NAACP said.\n\nTrump claims, without evidence, that there’s election fraud in California\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to sue over mail-in ballots cast in California while also slamming the state’s redistricting measure which aims to increase Democratic representation in the state.\n\nOn his Truth Social site, Trump called the California redistricting ballot measure, designed to counter a Texas effort to increase Republican representation, “a GIANT SCAM” without offering any specifics.\n\nThe California vote on that ballot measure, Trump claimed, “is RIGGED” but he provided no specifics of that either. “All ‘Mail-In’ Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are ‘Shut Out,’ is under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!” Trump wrote.\n\nAt the White House briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also claimed – while providing no details – that election fraud occurs in California.\n\nAsked what evidence Trump had, Leavitt said. “It is absolutely true that there is fraud in Caifornia’s elections. It is just a fact. … If you want to deny that, I’m happy to provide you all of the evidence” after the briefing.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a USA TODAY request for comment about the alleged details of election fraud in California and what kind of “very serious legal and criminal review” Trump was referring to.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nNew Jersey polling sites safe and secure after earlier bomb threats\n\nNew Jersey authorities say all polling sites are safe and secure after multiple locations received bomb threats earlier on Election Day.\n\nLaw enforcement officers were deployed to several sites where voters were casting ballots in response to \"swatting\" incidents - threats found to be non-credible, The Record, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nEight sites in Bergen County received threats in the early hours of the morning. Authorities didn't discover any suspicious items, and there is no remaining threat to the public, but they will stay \"engaged for the rest of Election Day,\" said Jeff Angermeyer, of the county's prosecutor's office.\n\nSome threats were directed at schools serving as local polling sites, forcing some students to stay home.\n\n\"A delayed opening would be too difficult,\" said Mark Schwarz, superintendent of Ridgewood public schools. \"We reluctantly decided to close schools for the day.\"\n\nWill billionaire Tom Steyer's $12 million Prop 50 bet pay off?\n\nWhile the Democratic party probably wasn't so crazy about billionaire Tom Steyer interjecting himself in what his camp describes as a \"non-traditional campaign\" in California's Proposition 50 redistricting race, maybe he brought more than he advertised.\n\nSteyer, the environmental activist and longshot 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spent more than $12 million during his self-promoted \"Stick It to Trump\" Prop 50 campaign. This includes two commercials airing heavily in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Sacramento, the state capital, and across social media.\n\nThe commercials: one features a spoof of President Donald Trump watching the results of Prop 50 passing, throwing french fries, and saying, \"I hate California.\" Another spot has Steyer accusing the president of trying to rig the 2026 midterm elections and bluntly urging California voters to \"let's stick it to Trump!\"\n\nThere were also sponsored rallies led by social media influencers, including supporters placing a smattering of \"Stick it to Trump\" and \"Yes on 50\" stickers over President Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Oct. 30. On Election Day, Trump on his Truth Social platform called Prop 50 a \"GIANT SCAM\" and said the voting itself is \"RIGGED.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a Nov. 3 memo, Steyer's camp believes his \"Stick it to Trump\" campaign supported the work of Governor Gavin Newsom’s Yes on 50 efforts to help \"push Prop 50 over the finish line.\" Prop 50 is a constitutional amendment pushed by Newsom that, if passed, would allow the state to temporarily stop using a nonpartisan commission and use lines drawn by its Democratic state lawmakers, possibly increasing their party's chances of winning more seats in Congress.\n\n\"This should be something for us all to celebrate,\" Steyer spokesperson Kevin Liao told USA TODAY.\n\nAnd Steyer's gamble will likely pay off in a Prop 50 victory on Election Day that could propel him on the list of possible candidates for California governor, said Brian Sobel, a longtime Bay Area-based political analyst.\n\n\"Oh, no question, Steyer will emerge as one of the Prop 50 winners just like Newsom, (Barack) Obama, and the other Democrats who made cameo appearances in those Yes on 50 ads,\" Sobel said. \"Going forward, Steyer may have to tone it down and not come across as a bit unbalanced.\n\n\"But today, Steyer looks like he gets to celebrate spending some of his fortune helping to gain an important victory,\" Sobel concluded.\n\nWhite House calls Mamdani ‘irresponsible’ over bomb-threat allegations\n\nAfter New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani linked Trump to bomb threats at New Jersey polling places, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the candidate “irresponsible.”\n\nMamdani called the bomb threats part of voter intimidation like Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud.\n\n“I think they are completely irresponsible and they are based on zero evidence,” Leavitt told reporters Nov. 4 at the Whtie House.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nEx-US Attorney General Holder backs Maryland's proposed redistricting strategy\n\nFormer US Attorney General Eric Holder said he supports Maryland Governor Wes Moore's decision to create a new advisory commission to consider redistricting in that state.\n\nHolder, who was attorney general under President Obama and is the current chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement on Nov. 4 that getting public feedback and making recommendations to Moore and Maryland's General Assembly to improve the state's congressional map will help ensure fairness.\n\n\"At a time when Donald Trump and his Republican allies show no signs of stopping their relentless campaign to undermine elections and manipulate the rules to cling to power, the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission in Maryland exemplifies the kind of leadership our democracy demands,\" Holder said.\n\nHolder believes the commission would demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability by \"putting power where it belongs—in the hands of the people.\n\n\"It stands in stark contrast to what we’ve seen in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina, and ensures that Maryland can take critical steps forward to ensure that our democracy can responsibly withstand — and overcome — this national gerrymandering crisis,\" Holder added.\n\nLawsuit filed in New Jersey over issues with hundreds of mail-in ballots\n\nNew Jersey Democrats filed a lawsuit in Bergen County over claims its election officials failed to notify voters about issues with their mail-in ballots so they could be addressed and counted, NorthJersey.com reported.\n\nThe emergency application came after the New Jersey Globe reported on Nov. 2 that there were roughly 300 “naked ballots,” or ballots that weren’t placed in an inner envelope, that were in danger of not being counted.\n\nThe Bergen County Board of Elections had a 3-3 party line deadlock in a vote over whether to notify the affected voters, the outlet reported. Democrats voted in favor of notifying voters, while Republicans opposed, citing staffing issues.\n\nThe New Jersey Democratic State Committee’s filing said the board’s failure to take action would “undoubtedly result in the disenfranchisement of approximately 300 voters in Bergen County.”\n\nThe committee asked the court to either order the board to provide a written notice to the affected voters and give them an opportunity to cure their ballots or have the board release the names of affected voters so they could vote on Nov. 4.\n\nMaryland Gov. Moore announces new redistricting\n\nWes Moore, Maryland's Democratic governor, announced a new commission to consider redistricting in the state as Californians consider a Democrat-backed plan to redraw their state's districts.\n\n\"President Donald Trump and his allies are trying to rig the system and are handpicking Republican states to go through redistricting processes,\" Moore said in a video statement released Election Day. \"While other states are determining whether or not they have fair maps, so will Maryland.\"\n\nIt comes as California is voting on a ballot initiative backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that would drastically redistrict the state.\n\nNewsom has pushed the campaign as an offset to President Donald Trump's push to redraw red states' districts in favor of Republicans ahead of the midterms.\n\nHigh turnout being reported in Virginia\n\nChief Election Officer Jason Long of Ward 2 in Staunton said Tuesday morning that voter turnout, so far, had surprisingly been higher than anticipated.\n\n“Turnout here has been a lot higher than anyone expected,” Long said. Of the ward’s roughly 3,800 registered voters, he said 450 had already voted in person by 10:40 a.m.\n\nOne of those voters was Debra Dawson, 29, who was with her daughter, 7-year-old Thea, who goes with her mother every year to vote.\n\n“I voted yesterday at school too,” Thea said.\n\nDawson said Virginia’s race for governor, pitting Republican Winsome Earle-Sears against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, was her main focus on Tuesday.\n\n“The governor race is really important to me,” Dawson said. “But all of them really are. I think voting in any election, big or small, local or wider, is very important.”\n\n– Brad Zinn\n\nJD Vance urges New Jersey voters to pick Ciattarelli after 'crap leadership'\n\nVice President JD Vance urged New Jersey voters to cast their ballot for Republican Jack Ciattarelli for governor on the morning of Election Day, saying the state has \"suffered\" under \"crap leadership.\"\n\n\"Get out there and vote for Jack if you live in NJ,\" he wrote on X. \"New Jersey is such a great state but it’s suffered too long under crap leadership.\"\n\nWhen do polls close in Virginia, New Jersey and California?\n\nPolls close in Virginia at 7 p.m. ET and New Jersey at 8 p.m. ET. California polls close at 8 p.m. PT.\n\nVirginia election results can be found here, while New Jersey's results are here and California's results are here.\n\nTrump looms large on Election Day\n\nThe Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia are making opposition to Donald Trump central to their pitches. In California, an ad urges voters to \"stick it to Trump,\" while New York City's frontrunner for mayor says he'll \"stand up\" to the president of the United States if he wins.\n\nTrump's name is not on the ballot in 2025. He's a lame duck whose political retirement looms in three years. But the off-year races culminating on Tuesday have nonetheless put a spotlight on the 79-year-old Republican.\n\nWhile Trump has largely stayed off the campaign trail – he spent much of the final week before Election Day on a trip to Asia – he's hardly gone dark on politics. He's made New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a frequent target as Republicans try to portray Democrats as too far left.\n\nCiattarelli told the USA TODAY Network that he speaks to Trump every couple of weeks, and the president reupped his endorsement in a recent social media post reminding Garden State voters: \"HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!\"\n\nBomb threat reported at New Jersey polling stations\n\nLaw enforcement is investigating email threats at polling places in Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmo Ocean and Passaic Counties, according to a statement from New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, the USA TODAY NETWORK reported.\n\nSome polling places have since reopened. At polling places that remained closed, voters were sent to other sits to pick up provisional ballots.\n\n“Voters should continue to have confidence that they can cast their ballot without fear of intimidation, and we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure a free, fair, and secure election,” Platkin wrote. “We will not tolerate any attempts to interfere with our elections, and we will swiftly hold accountable anyone who seeks to interfere with the safety or security of our electoral process.”\n\nVirginia election official says there are ‘concerns’ about postal service issues\n\nVirginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said the department has “concerns” about mail-in ballots making it to registrars’ offices around the commonwealth by the Friday deadline.\n\nBeals was responding to a question about the department’s confidence in the U.S. Postal Service during a Tuesday morning news briefing.\n\nShe said the department has worked “very closely” with the postal service in the lead up to the election, calling them “fantastic partners.”\n\n“While we have been very happy with the type of response that they’ve shown us, we do still have concerns and have heard from voters that there are concerns,” Beals said.\n\nShe said voters with concerns about their mail-in ballots could fill out a regular ballot at their polling place or contact their registrar’s office to confirm the status of their ballot.\n\nBeals also noted a polling location change in Newport News, Virginia, after a driver crashed their vehicle into a planned voting location at Ivy Farms Community of Faith Church over the weekend. The building was condemned, and the polling location was moved to South Morrison Family Education Center.\n\nRoughly 1.4 million Virginians had voted early as of Nov. 1, Beals said, with 1.1 million early votes cast in person and 300,000 returned through the mail.\n\nAnother news briefing is scheduled for 8 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nIn Virginia, no problems have been reported, according to the election department.\n\n– BrieAnna Frank\n\nJones and Miyares neck and neck in VA Attorney General race\n\nIn the race for Virginia attorney general, Democrat Jay Jones and Republican Jason Miyares, the incumbent, are neck and neck, according to recent polls.\n\nAn Emerson College/The Hill poll released on Nov. 2 showed Jones up by two points with 49% to Miyares' 47%. Other recent polls have showed the pair tied.\n\nThe election attracted national attention after texts Jones sent in 2022 saying the state's then-House speaker should get \"two bullets to the head\" were revealed. Jones later apologized for the texts, saying he was \"ashamed\" and \"embarrassed\" that he sent them.\n\nSpanberger and Sherrill hope to redefine Democrats\n\nThey both were members of the 2018 freshman class that helped Democrats retake the U.S. House. Both present themselves as kitchen-table centrists with extensive military and national security experience.\n\nAnd the two friends − who text each other regularly and were roommates on Capitol Hill − were even born in each other’s states.\n\nNow, Spanberger and Sherrill, two moderate gubernatorial candidates, are seen by some observers as a model for how Democrats can make a broad electoral appeal, in contrast to the party's socialist nominee for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, who has been a target for President Donald Trump.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey, Katie Sobko\n\nSpanberger sends condolences on ex-Vice President Dick Cheney\n\nAs Virginia voters took to the polls Tuesday morning, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger posted condolences about the passing of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nCheney served as second-in-command under President George W. Bush, but veered from Republican Party leadership following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump. Cheney endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris for president in the 2024 election.\n\n\"My prayers are with the family of Vice President Dick Cheney today — his wife Lynne Cheney, his daughters Liz and Mary, and their families — as they mourn his passing,\" Spanberger posted on X.\n\nPoll: Democrat Sherrill's lead against Republican Ciattarelli within margin of error\n\nA poll released Oct. 30 found the New Jersey race for governor could be growing tighter, with Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill edging 4 points ahead of Republican Jack Ciattarelli less than a week before Election Day.\n\nThe statewide poll from Suffolk University puts Sherrill's support among likely voters at 46%, while Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, stands at 42%, though the difference is still within the survey's margins of error. Another 7% of respondents said they were undecided and 3% refused to respond. Two other candidates on the ballot received 1% of support.\n\nA separate poll released Oct 31 showed Sherrill had a slight lead over Ciattarelli.\n\nThe AtlasIntel poll of more than 1,600 likely voters in New Jersey, which was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 30, showed Sherrill getting 50.2% of the vote compared to Ciattarelli's 49.3%, with a 2% margin of error.\n\nSherrill narrowly ahead, Nate Silver's 'most accurate' poll finds\n\nDemocrat Mikie Sherrill will narrowly eke out a win over Jack Ciattarelli, her Republican opponent, in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, according to a poll considered the \"most accurate\" by election analyst Nate Silver.\n\nAtlasIntel, which was considered the most accurate pollster in the 2020 presidential election, found Sherrill holds 50.2% Ciattarelli's 49.3%, according to a poll released on Oct. 31.\n\nPolling averages have shown Sherrill ahead of Ciattarelli by 4.6 to 6.6 points, still within the margin of error.\n\nPoll: Democrat Spanberger leads in Virginia\n\nA survey released Oct. 23 found Democrat Abigail Spanberger has a nine-point lead over Republican challenger and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor's race, seen as a national bellwether election.\n\nIn a Suffolk University poll of likely voters released Oct. 23, Spanberger garnered 52% of the vote among survey respondents, followed by Earl-Sears' 43%. Another 3% said they were undecided.\n\nEarle-Sears left out of Trump's GOP endorsements\n\nPresident Donald Trump has endorsed the Republican candidates for New Jersey governor and Virginia attorney general - Jack Ciattarelli and Jason Miyares - in glowing terms.\n\nCiattarelli \"IS A WINNER FOR NEW JERSEY,\" Trump wrote in all caps in an Oct. 20 Truth Social post. Miyares \"WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN,\" he wrote in an Oct. 5 post.\n\nNotably absent was Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican running for Virginia governor, who Trump has never endorsed by name.\n\nEarle-Sears provoked Trump's ire when, in 2022, she called Trump a \"liability\" and said \"voters want to move on.\" Trump hit back in a post at the time that he \"Never felt good\" about Earle-Sears. \"Always thought she was a phony.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/11/04/proposition-50-headed-to-victory-in-california-ventura-county/87073249007/", "title": "Proposition 50 gains decisive victory in California, Ventura County", "text": "Proposition 50 was approved by voters across California and in Ventura County.\n\nSeveral of Ventura County's Election Day polls were marked by long lines.\n\nProposition 50, California's attempt to thwart President Donald Trump, won a resounding victory across California and in Ventura County.\n\nAs of early morning on Nov. 5, 64% of California voters supported the measure’s plan to redraw districts to offset gerrymandering initiated by Trump in Texas and other states. About 36% opposed in a margin that caused many news agencies, including USA Today to call the race soon after polls closed.\n\nIn Ventura County, the margin was nearly as big, as reported in an election update at 1:15 a.m. Nov. 5. About 62% of the voters supported the measure and about 38% opposed it with more than 203,000 votes counted.\n\nThe measure allows the Legislature to temporarily redraw the state’s congressional districts in an effort to create five more seats Democrats can win. The state can use the new maps for congressional elections starting in 2026.\n\nThe nonpartisan commission empowered to draw district maps regains the job after the 2030 census. The proposition’s goal is offsetting Trump’s efforts in Texas that have created five new districts favoring Republicans.\n\nThe stakes were high. If the proposition brings a Democratic majority to the House, it could mean congressional investigations, legislative paralysis and possibly a third Trump impeachment. If Republicans can keep hold of the House in the midterm vote, it could allow the president to continue one of the most aggressive and disruptive agendas in modern presidential history.\n\nMany supporters saw the measure as a way “stick it to Trump,” as ads put it. Opponents questioned the legality of the measure and call it a bid for attention by Gov. Gavin Newsom who they contend is planning his own run for the presidency.\n\nDemocrat Katherine McNeil, 70, of Ventura, voted for the proposition. She said she felt redistricting in Texas meant her party had to fight fire with fire.\n\n“Hell, yes,” she said. “If they are going to play dirty to win, and that is what they are doing, by court cases, restricting, all of this nonsense, then there is really no other decision to come to. If we didn’t do this, we would be at such a disadvantage.”\n\nMany saw the election, and the redistricting, in partisan terms. Mark Bellini, a Republican from Ojai, said he was proud to oppose the measure and expressed concern about its apparent victory.\n\n“I’m hoping America wakes up to what’s going on and stops the Democrats from changing our country into something it wasn’t intended to be,” he said.\n\nExact turnout remained unclear the day after the election, but more than 184,000 Ventura County voters cast their ballots early — or about 35% of the county's about 526,000 voters. Another 15,000-plus voted in person on Election Day as long lines marked vote centers across the county.\n\nBallots not yet included in the turnout count include many of the people who voted on Nov. 4, those recently mailed in or left in drop boxes.\n\nVotes were still be counted on Nov. 5 and the next Ventura County election update was set for Nov. 6. County election officials are also scheduled to give a turnout estimate to the state on that day.\n\nUnder the new district maps, the two districts that cover most of Ventura County are considered fairly safe for Democrats and will remain largely unchanged.\n\nThe 24th District, currently held by Santa Barbara Democrat Salud Carbajal, will continue to include the city of Ventura and the Ojai Valley along with all of Santa Barbara County and some of San Luis Obispo County.\n\nMost of the 26th Distrit, currently held by Westlake Village Democrat Julia Brownley, will also stay the same. The city of Simi Valley, however, will be separated from the rest of Ventura County and added to the 32nd District, which is represented by San Fernando Valley Demorat Brad Sherman.\n\nThe district will also include part of the San Fernando Valley and all of Malibu and Pacific Palisades. Simi Valley is the only city in Ventura County with more Republicans than Democrats.\n\nThe measure means the drawing of congressional districts will likely no longer be seen as an independent, apolitical process but as another way for parties to compete with each other, said Haco Hoang, political science professor at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.\n\n\"This is going to set off an arms race in redistricting,\" said Tab Berg, conservative political consultant from Sacramento who predicted Republicans will gain more seats than they lose. Proposition 50 will also almost certainly bring more legal challenges.\n\nBoth sides threw money at the campaign. Supporters raised more than $170 million, according to the California Secretary of State's office, outdoing opponents who still spent more than $84 million.\n\nHoang said the day before the election that supporters and opponents framed the proposition in very base terms.\n\n“I think a lot of people see it as a referendum on Trump,” she said of those who voted for the proposition.\n\nPeople who voted no also appeared to see the battle through an existential lens.\n\n“It was an affirmation to keep Republicans and Trump in power – to preserve their agenda at all costs,” she said.\n\nThe real outcome of the election won’t be known until voters go to the polls in the mid-terms in 2026, said Tim Allison, adjunct political science professor at CSU Channel Islands in Camarillo.\n\n“The next step is in the hands of the voters,” he said. “The only thing that is predictable is that it’s unpredictable.”\n\nStar staff writers Dominic Massimino, Tony Biasotti and Makena Huey contributed to this report.

Sharice Davids, the state's only Democrat in Congress, called the failure to hold a special session a \"small victory.\"\n\nTOPEKA, Kansas - While Kansas Republican lawmakers won't call a special session, that doesn't mean the redistricting battle is over as President Donald Trump and Democrats continue the battle over who can create the most friendly campaign terrain for their party heading into the 2026 midterms.\n\nRepublicans in Kansas are promising to continue the effort to gerrymander the congressional maps for the express purpose of ousting the only Democrat from the state's congressional delegation.\n\nKansas state Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican, vowed that redistricting will be \"a top priority when the Legislature reconvenes in January.\"\n\n\"We're not backing down, and we're not sitting out of this fight,\" Masterson said.\n\nHis fellow Republican, Kansas state House Speaker Dan Hawkins, also suggested there will be \"a conversation about redistricting\" when the lawmakers return to Topeka for the 2026 legislative session.\n\n\"Even though they failed to force this special session, we know that this fight is not over,\" said U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas.\n\nShe said the November 2025 election results nationwide, which favored Democrats, has Republicans in Washington, D.C., \"panicking.\"\n\n\"They're going to stop at nothing to tighten their grip on Kansas,\" Davids said. \"They're going to take another run at this in January, another attempt to carve up Johnson County to redraw maps that voters never asked for all to protect their own political power.\"\n\nThe openly partisan mid-decade redistricting was kicked off by Trump ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. It started in Texas and spread to both red states and blue states.\n\nWhile the Kansas state Senate had enough signed petitions to call a special session scheduled to start Nov. 7, there were enough holdouts in the Kansas state House to block the effort. Republican legislative leaders had spent weeks circulating the petitions.\n\nMasterson, who is running for governor in 2026, said Senate Republicans \"did our part\" to answer Trump's call. Hawkins said the House faced \"an uphill battle with multiple agendas, scheduling conflicts and many other unseen factors at play.\"\n\n\"We are absolutely celebrating this small victory today,\" Davids said.\n\nRedistricting has become part of the GOP gubernatorial primary\n\nThe politics of gerrymandering in Kansas have become intertwined with the GOP gubernatorial primary in 2026.\n\nAmong the candidates promising to continue pushing partisan redistricting is Philip Sarnecki, whose campaign aired ads urging unnamed GOP holdouts to join the effort.\n\n\"Career politicians failed again to support President Trump and redraw the congressional maps in Kansas,\" Sarnecki said. \"It's time for new leadership in the state. As your governor, I will redraw the congressional maps in Kansas and add a Republican seat to Congress.\"\n\nKansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, the state's top election official and a Republican candidate for governor, reacted to the news of no special session with a post on X.\n\n\"Disappointing,\" Schwab said. \"CA and Laura Kelly 1, KS 0.\"\n\nCalifornia voters pass Prop 50 in response to Texas\n\nIn California, voters passed Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment to allow temporary redistricting. Democrats pushed the measure as a direct response to Republican gerrymandering in Texas. Prop 50 and Democratic gerrymandering in California essentially negates the five new Republican-leaning districts in Texas.\n\nThe Texas maps were created at Trump's urging.\n\n\"California Democrats are working overtime to silence Republicans and steal the House majority,\" Masterson said.\n\nRedistricting push comes ahead of 2026 midterm elections\n\nTrump's push for mid-decade redistricting comes seeks to secure the slim Republican majority in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 elections. Historically, the president's party typically loses seats in midterm elections.\n\n\"This whole thing got kicked off,\" Davids said, \"because Donald Trump knows that the policies that they're pushing are so extreme and so unpopular that they're not going to be able to win unless they cheat.\"\n\nDavids said the November 2025 election results nationwide show \"just how frustrated and, frankly, angry a bunch of people are.\"\n\nSarnecki has said Republicans losing control of Congress \"would be the end of the Trump agenda, and you can be 100% certain that Democrats will then try to impeach President Trump.\"\n\nMatt Gertken, the chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, is among those who are predicting that Republicans will lose control of the House.\n\n\"Democrats will definitely take the House,\" Gertken said. \"And some of you are thinking, well, they don't have any leadership. No, they don't. They don't have a plan. They don't have a leader. Doesn't matter.\"\n\nGertken, who spoke at an October public meeting of the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System trustees, said Republicans may retain control of the Senate in 2026. But losing the House would mean Trump \"won't be able to pass legislation\" and \"will have to rely much more heavily on executive orders.\"\n\n\"The President's approval rating is about 45%,\" Gertken said. \"It's not a terrible approval rating for President Trump, 45% is actually pretty good for President Trump. I've been watching his data for 10 years, so 10 years of evidence. But ... his approval on the economy is 43% and falling. Now that's a little bit of a problem.\n\n\"So in other words, voters are not fond of the trade war, and it's showing up in the fact that President Trump's approval rating on the economy is worse than in his first term.\"\n\nHe said Trump's trajectory is similar to Biden's, \"and obviously you don't want your opinion polling to look like Joe Biden, so this is a problem.\"\n\n\"Now if you're thinking, 'Ah, it's not that bad,' well just remember, what does a 45% approval rating get you in a midterm election? ... A 45% approval rating gets you a loss of 30 seats in the House of Representatives. So for those who are thinking a 45% approval rating isn't that bad, just look at history.\"\n\nJason Alatidd is a Statehouse reporter for The Topeka Capital-Journal.

Greg Abbott’s own remapping.\n\nMany states have explored the idea of redistricting, but few have established tangible plans. This is because redistricting typically happens at the start of every decade, and some states prohibit mid-decade changes. California and Texas have the most seats by far, and changes there could decide who controls the U.S. House of Representatives after midterm elections in 2026.\n\nA USA TODAY analysis shows California could flip six seats from the GOP to Democrats. Here’s a closer look at how the margins − the difference between the percentage of people who voted for each party − would shift in each of California’s districts under the new maps.\n\nSee the full analysis: How Prop. 50 can change California elections and shift Trump's strategy\n\nDemocrats win Virginia, New Jersey gubernatorial elections\n\nDemocrats took high-stakes governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey, which could set the stage for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger won after consistently leading her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, by about 10 points in polls. New Jersey Democrat Mikie Sherrill emerged as the victor after being locked in a dead heat with Republican Jack Ciattarelli in polling days before the race.\n\nEvery four years, the two elections are viewed as barometers of the American electorate’s opinion of the political party in power, given that they are the first major elections after the president’s inauguration. This year is no exception. Though Trump’s name is not on the ballot, he has been a major player in both contests.\n\nCiattarelli, once a never-Trump Republican, leaned into the president’s endorsement. He told the USA TODAY Network that he speaks with Trump every couple of weeks.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey governor races have predictable history\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia voters have a track record of electing a governor from the opposite party of the president. Here's a look at how those states have voted in the past:\n\nGet the whole story: See why Virginia and New Jersey's elections matter this year\n\nDid Virginia and New Jersey vote for Trump in 2024?\n\nAlthough Virginia and New Jersey leaned Democratic in the 2024 presidential elections, Trump made inroads in both states. In New Jersey, he decreased his margin of defeat by 10% from his loss in 2020.\n\nZohran Mamdani wins the race for mayor in NYC\n\nMamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, won the mayoral election in New York City on a progressive platform of fighting inequality, protecting immigrant rights and making housing more affordable. Many of those same issues impact voters across the country. New York mayors receive national attention because they run America’s biggest city.\n\nDid Texas redistricting pass?\n\nYes, but not in this election. In August, Texas Republicans approved a new state congressional map intended to flip U.S. House seats up for grabs in the 2026 elections. In an 88-52 vote Aug. 20, Republican legislators moved forward with a rare mid-decade redistricting measure, which helps improve Republicans' odds of holding a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nContributing: Janet Loehrke, Michael Collins, Erin Mansfield, and Terry Collins.\n\nThis is a developing story which may be updated.\n\n'We sent a message.': 5 takeaways from Democrats' 2025 elections sweep", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/10/13/proposition-50-plan-to-divide-san-joaquin-county-sparks-voter-debate/86612420007/", "title": "Proposition 50 plan to divide San Joaquin County sparks voter debate", "text": "San Joaquin County and the rest of California have begun voting on Proposition 50 in a high-stakes election that could result in the county being divided into five congressional districts.\n\nSupported by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the proposition would temporarily redraw California’s congressional districts before the Nov. 3, 2026, midterms. It would give Democrats a chance to gain five House seats and counter gerrymandering by the Texas Legislature in June.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had called on Texas lawmakers to redraw their legislative maps ahead of schedule, a move critics say was intended to help Republicans maintain control of Congress next year. Proposition 50 seeks to offset that advantage by revising California's own district maps.\n\nThe proposition would also temporarily suspend the congressional maps drawn by the state's independent redistricting commission. If approved by voters in the Nov. 4 special election, the legislatively drawn maps would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. They would be used until the independent redistricting commission draws new maps after the 2030 U.S. Census.\n\nUnder California’s proposed congressional maps, Lodi would be split among three districts and Stockton divided between two.\n\nIn San Joaquin County, where Trump received 48.92% of the vote compared to 48.03% for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, those who oppose Proposition 50 have expressed concerns that it is a partisan power grab that would dilute their political voice and disadvantage voters. Supporters, on the other hand, say the measure is necessary to counter gerrymandering in other states.\n\nFour days after ballots were mailed to San Joaquin County voters, David Cushman, 32, of Manteca, said he and his wife, Genevie, had voted no and turned in their ballots.\n\nCushman, who serves as chairman of the Republican Party of San Joaquin County, said he was opposed to the proposition because he was concerned the initiative would be expensive for taxpayers.\n\n\"This is a completely unnecessary election,\" Cushman said. \"We're spending more than $250 million for one question on the ballot, and if these lines are redrawn, it's going to be a huge affront to the people of California, but it's also going to be a disaster for San Joaquin County specifically.\"\n\nHow Proposition 50 could reshape San Joaquin County\n\nCushman said almost all of San Joaquin County is under one congressional district. Most of the county is in California's 9th Congressional District, represented by Rep. Josh Harder. A portion of the county lies in California's 13th Congressional District, represented by Rep. Adam Gray.\n\nCushman said he believes that is good for county residents. If the proposition passes, he fears it will lead to worse representation for those living in San Joaquin County.\n\n\"It gives us one voice when it comes to our representation,\" Cushman said. \"If Prop. 50 passes, we're going to be split up into five different districts and cities are going to be split up. Lodi in particular is going to be split up three ways, and that's not going to be good for residents here because we're going to have cities like Manteca, Ripon, Lodi and others that are going to be in districts that are going to be dominated by Bay Area cities. Our priorities and voices are going to be drowned out, and our representatives are not going to be listening to us.\"\n\nCushman also expressed concerns that the proposition goes against the state's independent redistricting process. He said he supports keeping the independent redistricting commission.\n\n\"It's resulted in good outcomes for California but also for San Joaquin County,\" Cushman said. \"Even as we are now, President Trump got 40% of the vote in California in 2024, and as it stands currently, Republicans have nine seats, so we're even below what President Trump got in terms of the seats that we have. If this passes, we could lose an additional four to five seats and even be further below. So, as it stands right now, we're already underrepresented in terms of our federal representation based on Republican support in this state — and apparently that's still not low enough for Gavin Newsom and not low enough for the politicians in Sacramento.\"\n\nHe also expressed concerns that it sets a dangerous precedent and questioned whether the new maps would actually be temporary, as Newsom and measure proponents are saying.\n\n\"I don't buy that, and I don't think most Californians would either,\" Cushman said. \"He has a long track record of promising things and going back on those later on. What's to say that if we have a Republican president elected in 2028, and a Republican in office for four years after Donald Trump is out of office, that it won't be another excuse for us to continue doing away with the independent commission? What's the criteria for keeping it and not keeping it? There are too many questions.\"\n\nSan Joaquin County residents weigh in on ballot measure\n\nDavid Diskin, 47, of Lodi, is a self-employed tech professional. He said Oct. 9 that he and his family's ballots were on their coffee table and that they intend to vote yes on Proposition 50.\n\n\"I'm thrilled that we have the opportunity to vote on it, unlike Texas,\" Diskin said. \"We get to make this constitutional amendment, and if enough people are in support of it, it will happen. If not, then that's really bad for our democracy, but at least it was a democratic process. A lot of people keep saying that we have, in our constitution, a redistricting commission, and that's true, but that commission was formed through the vote of the people back in 2008, and our constitution allows us to make amendments.\"\n\nDiskin said the commission was formed more than 15 years ago and that times have changed since then. He said he believes Proposition 50 is essential to preserve democracy and \"to catch us up to what Texas has done.\" He also called it \"unfortunate but hypocritical that the same people who are the loudest about spending money on this election were the ones behind the recall last time, and they had no problem spending that money.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that the majority of the people who are concerned about that cost had no problem supporting the recall initiative for Gov. Newsom years ago, and that cost is nearly the same,\" Diskin said. \"We all knew that was going to fail. We all knew that was going to be a waste of $200 million of taxpayers' money.\"\n\nDiskin said he \"absolutely adores and appreciates\" the redistricting commission. He said he thinks misinformation has circulated about its power being taken away indefinitely.\n\n\"There's a lot of mistrust in our government, and some of that is certainly well-deserved,\" Diskin said. \"Somehow a lot of these people have the impression that Prop. 50 does away with the redistricting commission or has the opportunity to take it away forever or for some indeterminate amount of time. I don't know where they got that idea or why there's that conspiracy theory that if we let Prop. 50 pass, we'll never see it again. I have to point out to people that are spreading these mistruths that it is literally written into the proposition — and thus the Constitution, if it should pass — that it expires in 2030.\"\n\nDiskin also said he found it hypocritical that Californians opposed to Proposition 50 claim to support independent redistricting even though Republicans in Congress have voted against creating a national version of it.\n\nIn 2021, congressional Democrats pushed several bills to overhaul the redistricting process, including the For the People Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. The measures would have banned partisan gerrymandering and set up independent, nonpartisan commissions to draw congressional districts in every state.\n\nThe For the People Act and the Freedom to Vote Act were blocked by Senate Republicans.\n\nIn September, Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla, both of California, led a bicameral group of lawmakers in reintroducing the Redistricting Reform Act of 2025. The legislation, which Lofgren has championed since 2005, would ban mid-decade redistricting nationwide and require every state to create independent redistricting commissions.\n\n\"I find it, again, hypocritical that all of these people in California who are naysaying Prop. 50 are all of a sudden super, super supportive of independent redistricting,\" Diskin said. \"They need to tell their Republican representatives to vote for the bill that's currently in the House that would require an independent commission nationwide. And again, every time it comes up in Congress, it is 100% Democrat-supported and 100% Republican-voted no. So I would love to understand that cognitive dissonance — where in California they're in support of it, but nationwide they're not. That doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nBarbara St. Urbain, 83, of Stockton, is a community activist who founded the San Joaquin Coalition for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (SJC4DEI), a coalition that brings together groups and individuals to support and advance the ideals of diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the county. She said Oct. 10 that she voted in support of Proposition 50.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about what's going on in our country,\" St. Urbain said when asked to explain her vote. \"Well, concerned is a very nice way of putting it. I'm very scared about what's happening to our democracy. Texas did a redistricting of the state so that they would have more Republican representatives in the House, and so this is a counterbalance to that.\"\n\nWatch: Prop. 50 In A Minute\n\nWhile St. Urbain believes Proposition 50 is necessary to preserve democracy, she said she is dissatisfied with how much the measure is costing taxpayers.\n\n\"I'm not thrilled with how much it's costing,\" St. Urbain said. \"However, I don't know that there's a cost to our democracy. This is the only way that we could respond. I do think it's a good idea, although I don't like having to spend all of this money.\"\n\nSt. Urbain said she believes a lot of people who are against Proposition 50 do not realize that the power to draw maps will return to the independent redistricting commission in 2031.\n\n\"It's part of the law,\" St. Urbain said. \"Others don't really know what it is; they just think that they should say no. I think, unfortunately, that's true for a lot of voters. They really don't know what's on the ballot. We need an informed electorate, and I don't think we really have that.\"\n\nStill, St. Urbain said, \"Democracy is great and everyone should vote.\"\n\nRecord reporter Hannah Workman covers news in Stockton and San Joaquin County.

Scientists say powerful ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nResidents on the small resort island of Polillo are accustomed to severe weather – their island sits in the northeastern Philippines, on the edge of the Pacific Ocean where storms typically gather strength and turn into typhoons.\n\nBut even they were stunned by the intensity of Typhoon Noru, known locally as Typhoon Karding, that turned from a typhoon into a super typhoon in just six hours before hitting the region earlier this week.\n\n“We’re used to typhoons because we’re located where storms usually land,” said Armiel Azas Azul, 36, who owns the Sugod Beach and Food Park on the island, a bistro under palm trees where guests drink coconut juice in tiny thatched huts.\n\n“But everything is very unpredictable,” he said. “And (Noru) came very fast.”\n\nThe Philippines sees an average of 20 tropical storms each year, and while Noru didn’t inflict as much damage or loss of life as other typhoons in recent years, it stood out because it gained strength so quickly.\n\nExperts say rapidly developing typhoons are set to become much more common as the climate crisis fuels extreme weather events, and at the same time it will become harder to predict which storms will intensify and where they will track.\n\n“The challenge is accurately forecasting the intensity and how fast the categories may change, for example from just a low-pressure area intensifying into a tropical cyclone,” said Lourdes Tibig, a meteorologist and climatologist with the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities.\n\nThe same happened in the United States last week when Hurricane Ian turned from a Category 1 storm into a powerful Category 4 hurricane before making landfall along the southwestern coast of Florida on Wednesday.\n\nSuch rapid intensification, as it’s known in meteorological terms, creates challenges for residents, authorities and local emergency workers, including those in the Philippines, who increasingly have no choice but to prepare for the worst.\n\nTyphoon Noru made landfall in the Philippines in the evening on September 25 as the equivalent of a Category 4 storm. earth observatory/NASA\n\nFrom storm to super typhoon\n\nWhen Azul received warning that Typhoon Noru was approaching the Philippines last Saturday, he began his usual preparations of setting up his generator and tying down loose items.\n\nAt that stage, Noru was predicted to make landfall on Sunday as the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nBut as the storm grew closer, it strengthened into a super typhoon, the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane, making landfall Sunday evening with ferocious winds that lifted waves and lashed properties on the shoreline.\n\nTyphoon Noru toppled beach huts and coconut trees at Sugod Beach and Food Park on Polillo Island, Quezon province, in the Philippines. Courtesy Armiel\n\nAzul said his community was fortunate to have TV signal in the resort, and as soon as they found out that the typhoon was much stronger than forecast, his staff brought in all the bistro’s outdoor furniture and tied down the roofs of their guesthouses, while local government units evacuated people living near the shore.\n\n“But other parts of the island which don’t have internet connectivity and only rely on radio signals might not have got the message in time,” he said.\n\nThe typhoon damaged the resort town, as strong winds toppled beach huts and damaged nearby fishing cages.\n\nAzul added that coconut trees planted across the island about a decade ago after Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) battered the area had just started to bear fruit but were now completely wiped out.\n\n“We have to pick up the pieces, and rebuild again,” he said.\n\nTyphoon Noru lashed through Sugod Beach and Food Park on Polillo Island, Quezon province, in the Philippines. Courtesy Armiel\n\nOn the main island of Luzon, Noru left a trail of destruction in the province of Nueva Ecija, known as the “rice granary” of the country.\n\nRuel Ladrido, 46, a farmer owner in Laur, Nueva Ecija, said his rice fields were not flooded but strong winds damaged his crops.\n\n“It didn’t rain hard near me, but the winds uprooted some of my fields. It will affect our harvest this season, but what can we do? I don’t know the extent of the damage yet, but we’ll have to plant again,” he told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nHigh winds brought by Typhoon Noru flattened rice fields at the Ladrido Farm in Laur, Nueva Ecija ,in the Philippines. Courtesy Ruel B Ladrido\n\nAs of Friday, 12 people had died in the aftermath of Noru, including five rescue workers in Bulacan province, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).\n\nThe estimated damage to agriculture ballooned to some 3 billion Philippine pesos (about $51 million), affected 104,500 farmers and fisher folk, and damaged over 166,630 thousand hectares of crop land, according to the NDRRMC.\n\nHarder to predict\n\nThe Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, is already vulnerable to typhoons, but as sea levels rise and ocean temperatures warm, the storms expected to become more powerful, according to research published in 2018.\n\nThe study found that the stronger typhoons carry more moisture and track differently. They are also “aggravated by sea level rise, one of the most certain consequences of climate change.”\n\nA separate study published last year, by researchers at the Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, found that typhoons in east and southeast Asia now last between two and nine hours longer and travel an average of 100 kilometers (62 miles) further inland than they did four decades ago. By the end of the century, they could have double the destructive power.\n\nAs such, it’ll become more difficult to forecast their track and predict ones that will quickly gain strength, or undergo rapid intensification – defined as when wind speeds increase by at least 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per hour) in 24 hours or less.\n\nAlthough rare, the Philippines is no stranger to this phenomenon as 28% of all tropical cyclones that made landfall in the country dating back to 1951 underwent rapid intensification based on official data, according to Gerry Bagtasa, a professor with the University of the Philippines’ Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology.\n\nBagtasa said factors such as high moisture, warm ocean surface temperatures and low wind shear determine the scale of rapid intensification, but those weather readings “don’t have to be extraordinary in their values” to create rapid intensification.\n\nHe remarked that Typhoon Noru’s track across the Philippine Sea before making landfall was “just average for this season” and the wind shear – or the change of wind speed and strength with height in the atmosphere – was not extraordinarily low.\n\nBagtasa also said forecasters find it difficult to predict rapid intensification in the Pacific, because even though satellite monitoring has improved, there isn’t enough data to forecast worsening weather events.\n\n“There are also many unprecedented events happening recently worldwide, and since forecasters typically rely on their past experiences, new events can ‘throw off’ forecasts, so to speak,” he said.\n\nAlways bracing for the worst\n\nMirian Abadilla, a doctor and municipal health officer in Cabangan, Zambales province, on the Philippine island of Luzon, has been involved in her community’s disaster management response since 1991.\n\nShe says in that time, typhoons have become harder to forecast, and her community has no choice but to prepare for the worst.\n\n“The typhoons are definitely getting stronger because of climate change, and getting harder to predict,” she said. “But each time we get hit with a typhoon, we try to keep improving our disaster response – that’s the only way for us to stay alert.”\n\nShe said local governments held meetings as Typhoon Noru approached the coast to go over relief and rescue plans.\n\n“Filipinos are getting better at disaster preparedness … because we have to be,” she said.\n\nEvery province, city, municipality and barangay in the Philippines is required to follow national disaster risk reduction and management system under an act imposed in 2010 to address the island nation’s climate vulnerability.\n\nLocal governments must conduct preemptive evacuation based on the projected warnings from the national weather department, and it’s recommended they hold regular disaster rescue drills with responders and host briefing seminars for communities.\n\nResidents wade through waist-deep flood waters after Super Typhoon Noru, in San Miguel, Bulacan province, Philippines, September 26, 2022. Adrian Portugal/Reuters\n\nIn a press briefing on Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. praised local government units for “doing a good job” in explaining the situation to the local population as Noru approached, and for carrying out evacuations that may have prevented mass casualties.\n\nBut he also seemed to acknowledge the unpredictability of the storms that regularly threaten the Philippine coast, and the need to always be prepared.\n\n“I think we may have gotten lucky at least this time, a little bit,” Marcos Jr. said.", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo Jan Camenzind Broomby", "Kathleen Magramo", "Jan Camenzind Broomby"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/asia/philippines-storm-megi-agaton-deaths-floods-evacuations-intl-hnk", "title": "Philippines storm Megi: Agaton's death toll rises as hundreds of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe death toll in the Philippines from tropical storm Megi has risen to 76 while hundreds of thousands of others remain displaced, authorities in the country said Wednesday.\n\nMany of the deaths came in landslides and floods caused when the storm made landfall on Sunday, battering the eastern and southern coasts of the Philippines with sustained winds of up to 65 kilometers (40 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 80 kph (49 mph).\n\nThe National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said at least 29 people remain missing and eight others are injured.\n\nMore than 920,000 people have been affected by the storm, over 200,000 people displaced, while more than 35,000 were pre-emptively evacuated, the council said.

In the United States, drought and sea level rise clashed at the mouth of the historically low Mississippi River. And in South Africa, climate change made rainfall that triggered deadly floods heavier and twice as likely to occur.\n\nYet against the backdrop of these catastrophic events, this year also sparked some glimmers of hope:\n\nScientists in the US successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used – a huge step in the decades-long quest to replace fossil fuels with an infinite source of clean energy.\n\nAnd at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Egypt, nearly 200 countries agreed to set up a fund to help poor, vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters they had little hand in causing.\n\n“There was some encouraging climate action in 2022, but we remain far off track to meet our goals of reducing global heat-trapping emissions and limiting future planetary warming,” Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. “There must be a stronger collective commitment and progress toward slashing emissions in 2023 if we are to keep climate extremes from becoming even more devastating.”\n\nHere are the top 10 climate and extreme weather stories of 2022.\n\n10. Tonga volcano eruption and global tsunami\n\nA zoomed-in view of the Tonga eruption, taken by Japan's Himawari-8 satellite, about 100 minutes after the eruption started. Simon Proud/Uni Oxford, RALSpace NCEO/Japan Meteorological Agency\n\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in January, it sent tsunami waves around the world. The blast itself was so loud it was heard in Alaska – roughly 6,000 miles away. The afternoon sky turned pitch black as heavy ash clouded Tonga’s capital and caused “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.\n\nThe underwater volcanic eruption also injected a huge cloud of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, more than 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) above sea level, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\nAt the time, experts said the event was likely not large enough to impact global climate.\n\nBut months later, scientists found that the eruption actually belched an enormous amount of water vapor into the Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The massive plume of water vapor will likely contribute to more global warming at ground-level for the next several years, NASA scientists reported.\n\n9. Rivers hit record lows\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Severe drought reveals incredible discovery at bottom of Mississippi river 00:45 • Source: CNN Severe drought reveals incredible discovery at bottom of Mississippi river 00:45\n\nSearing temperatures, lack of rainfall and low snowpack pushed some of the world’s most vital rivers to new lows this year.\n\nNorthern Italy saw its worst drought in more than 70 years. The 400-mile River Po hit a record low due to an unusually dry winter and limited snowpack in the Alps, which feeds the river. The drought impacted millions of people who rely on the Po for their livelihood, and roughly 30% of the country’s food, which is produced along the river.\n\nAlso fed by winter snowpack in the Alps along with spring rains, Germany’s Rhine River dropped to “exceptionally low” levels in some areas, disrupting shipping in the country’s most important inland water way. Months of little rainfall meant cargo ships began carrying lighter loads and transport costs soared.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, extreme drought spread into the central states and gauges along the Mississippi River and its tributaries plummeted. Barge traffic moved in fits and starts as officials dredged the river. The Mississippi River dropped so low that the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to build a 1,500-foot-wide levee to prevent Gulf-of-Mexico saltwater from pushing upstream.\n\n8. US passes landmark climate law\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs \"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\" into law during a ceremony in the State Dining Room of the White House in August. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nAfter more than a year of negotiations, Democrats in late July reached an agreement on President Joe Biden’s long-stalled climate, energy and tax agenda – capping a year of agonizing negotiations that failed multiple times.\n\nBiden signed the bill into law in August and signaled to the world that the US is delivering on its climate promises.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin was influential in delaying the bill’s passage. Multiple White House and Biden administration officials for months had tried to convince the senator to support the bill over dinners in Paris and ziplining in West Virginia.\n\nAn analysis suggests the measures in the bill will reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and would put Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030.\n\n7. Hurricane Nicole\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean 01:00 • Source: CNN 'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean 01:00\n\nHurricane Nicole was the first hurricane to hit anywhere in the US during the month of November in nearly 40 years. The rare, late-season storm also marked the first time that a hurricane made landfall on Florida’s east coast in November.\n\nAlthough Nicole was only a category 1, it had a massive wind field that stretched more than 500 miles, coupled with astronomically high tides that led to catastrophic storm surge. Homes and buildings collapsed into the ocean in Volusia County, with authorities scrambling to issue evacuation warnings.\n\nHurricane Nicole flooded streets, destroyed power lines and killed at least five people. The storm came just 42 days after deadly category 4 Hurricane Ian wreaked havoc on the west coast of Florida.\n\n6. A breakthrough at COP27\n\nProtesters demonstrate during the UN's COP27 climate conference in November in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed at the UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to set up a new fund for “loss and damage,” meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters. It was the first time wealthy, industrialized countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the US and the EU, agreed to establish such a fund.\n\n“We can’t solve the climate crisis unless we rapidly and equitably transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as hold wealthy nations and the fossil fuel industry accountable for the damage they have done,” Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.\n\n5. A summer of flooding\n\nSubmerged vehicles in Jackson, Kentucky, in July. Between 8 and 10 inches of rain fell within 48 hours from July 27 to 28 across Eastern Kentucky. The month was Jackson's wettest July on record. Michael Swensen/Getty Images\n\nThe summer’s series of floods started off in Yellowstone National Park in June, when extreme rainfall and rapidly melting snow washed out roads and bridges in the park, causing significant damage to the nearby town of Gardiner, Montana, at the park’s entrance. Authorities had to rescue more than 100 people from the floods.\n\nThe year also brought several 1,000-year rainfall events. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.\n\nDeadly flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky and around St. Louis in July after damaging, record-breaking rainfall in a short period of time.\n\nCalifornia’s Death Valley, after a yearslong dry spell, saw its rainiest day in recorded history.\n\nMeanwhile, down south, parts of Dallas, Texas, got an entire summer’s worth of rain in just 24 hours in August, prompting more than 350 high-water rescues.\n\n4. Europe’s deadly heat wave\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Wildfires threaten London during record-breaking heat wave 01:20 • Source: CNN Wildfires threaten London during record-breaking heat wave 01:20\n\nEurope experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022 by a wide margin. While the heat kicked off early in France, Portugal and Spain, with the countries reaching record-warmth in May, the most significant heat came in mid-July, spreading across the UK and central Europe.\n\nThe UK, in particular, topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time on record. Stephen Belcher, the UK Met Office’s chief scientist, said this would have been “virtually impossible” in an “undisrupted climate.”\n\nThroughout western Europe, the heatwaves gravely increased wildfire risk, with one London fire official noting that the 40-degree day led to an “unprecedented day in the history of the London Fire Brigade.”\n\n3. The West’s water crisis\n\nVideo Ad Feedback As water levels drop at this major lake, bodies begin to appear 03:19 • Source: CNN As water levels drop at this major lake, bodies begin to appear 03:19\n\nThe past few years have been a reality check for western states that heavily rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. Plagued by decades of overuse and a climate change-fueled drought, the river that serves 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico is draining at an alarming rate.\n\nThe water levels in its two main reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have plunged rapidly, threatening drinking water supply and power generation. In late July, Lake Mead – the country’s largest reservoir – bottomed out and has only rebounded a few feet off record lows. Its rapidly plunging levels revealed human remains from the 1970s and a sunken vessel from World War II.\n\nThe federal government implemented its first-ever mandatory water cuts this year for states that draw from the Colorado River, and those cuts will be even deeper starting in January 2023.\n\n2. Catastrophic flooding in Pakistan\n\nFlood-affected people carry belongings out from their flooded home in Shikarpur, Sindh province, in Pakistan in August. Asif Hassan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFloods caused by record monsoon rain and melting glaciers in Pakistan’s northern mountain regions claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people this summer, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages. More than a third of Pakistan was underwater, satellite images showed, and authorities warned it would take months for the flood waters to recede in the country’s hardest-hit areas.\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing “a monsoon on steroids,” referring to the role that the climate crisis had in supercharging the extreme rainfall. The hard-hit provinces Sindh and Balochistan saw rainfall more than 500% of average during the monsoon season.\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming emissions, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\n\n1. Hurricane Ian\n\nDestruction in the wake of Hurricane Ian on October 4 in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Ian was a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September and left a trail of destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. Insured losses from Ian are expected to reach up to $65 billion, according to recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re.\n\nThe storm first struck Cuba before undergoing rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a category 3 hurricane in just 24 hours – something scientists told CNN is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms. That same week, Super Typhoon Noru in the Philippines grew from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept, catching officials and residents unaware and unable to prepare.\n\nHurricane Ian’s size and intensity allowed it to build up a storm surge higher than any ever observed in Southwest Florida, devastating Fort Myers and Cape Coral. Ian killed more than 100 people, most by drowning.

On Sunday, Kyushu authorities took the unusual step of issuing a rarely used “special warning” in the hope of conveying the seriousness of the threat posed by the storm.\n\nA “large-scale disaster” could be also be imminent with extensive flooding and landslides, JMA warned. “The highest level of vigilance is required for rising water levels and flooding of rivers, landslide disasters and flooding of lowlands,” it said on Sunday.\n\nSeveral prefectures which include the cities of Fukuoka and Nagasaki, have been without electricity since the arrival of the typhoon, said the Kyushu Electric power company.\n\nNanmadol is the 14th typhoon Japan has experienced this year and comes after the country grappled with record setting heatwaves in June that caused massive power outage to millions of residents in the capital Tokyo and high numbers of heatstroke among the vulnerable elderly.\n\nNanmadol is expected to travel to central Japan toward Tokyo over the coming days and will maintain much of its strength as it moves, experts warned.\n\nFerries and bullet train services, as well as hundreds of flights have been canceled across the country due to the dangerous weather.", "authors": ["Junko Ogura Heather Chen Jake Kwon", "Junko Ogura", "Heather Chen", "Jake Kwon"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/24/noaa-super-typhoon-yutu-strongest-storm-ever-hit-u-s-soil/1759327002/", "title": "NOAA: Super Typhoon Yutu strongest storm to ever hit U.S. soil ...", "text": "HAGATNA, Guam – With sustained winds of 178 mph as its eye passed directly over the tiny U.S. island of Tinian early Thursday, Super Typhoon Yutu was the strongest storm on record to ever hit a U.S. territory, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nIt was also the second-strongest storm on record to ever hit any part of the United States, trailing only the 185-mph hurricane that hit the Florida Keys in 1935, according to the Weather Underground.\n\nTinian is one of the Northern Marinas Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the South Pacific Ocean with a population of 52,000 people. Saipan is the other major island in the commonwealth.\n\nThe storm has killed one person, a 44-year-old woman who had tried to take shelter in an abandoned building on Tinian that collapsed, the governor's office said.\n\nTinian suffered a direct hit, National Weather Service meteorologist Brandon Aydlett said. “This is the worst-case scenario.

San Nicolas said Thursday. \"The homes, main roads have been destroyed. Our critical infrastructure has been compromised. We currently have no power and water. Our ports at this time are inaccessible and several points within the island are inaccessible.\"\n\nThe island's \"power distribution system is completely destroyed,” San Nicolas said.\n\nYutu's trail of destruction may not be over yet as it continues to trek west over the western Pacific Ocean: The monstrous storm still has winds of 161 mph, gusting to 195 mph, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said. It could plow into Taiwan or the Philippines next week, the center said.\n\nSan Nicolas, a former attorney general for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, said he sent out a request for commodities to be brought to Tinian, like drinking water and ready-to-eat meals.\n\nWith no running water, Tinian stores have not reopened. He said roads are being cleared of debris, and Tinian’s airport runway is now usable.\n\nTyphoons form in the western Pacific Ocean and are the same type of storm as a hurricane. A \"super typhoon\" is equivalent to a Category 4 or 5 hurricane.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an emergency disaster declaration on Wednesday for Saipan and Tinian, along with the rest of the Northern Marianas, in anticipation of the typhoon. The commonwealth is 14 hours ahead of Eastern time.\n\nYutu, which intensified from a tropical storm to a super typhoon in only 30 hours, is tied as the fifth-strongest landfalling storm ever recorded globally, the Weather Underground reported. Ominously, 7 of the 10 strongest landfalls have occurred since 2006.\n\nThe storm has also tied Super Typhoon Mangkhut as the strongest storm on Earth this year, NASA said.\n\nOn Saipan, Rosalyn Ajoste remembers hearing loud ripping noises and screeching around 1:30 a.m., before her roof and windows blew off, causing water to flood her concrete-and-wood house in the village of Susupe.\n\n\"It was terrifying and dangerous,\" she said.\n\nPower could be out on Saipan for months.\n\nIn a statement, the governor of the Northern Marianas Islands, Ralph Deleon Guerrero Torres said the strong wind and rain tested the islands' spirits.\n\n\"Already, we know friends and family who have experienced the worst of these conditions,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to all who call the (Northern Marianas Islands) home. But what we suffer through together, we will overcome together.\"\n\nThree years ago, Typhoon Soudelor slammed Saipan and Tinian. Yutu, a Category 5 super typhoon, was more intense than Soudelor.\n\n\"It's one of the most powerful typhoons I've seen in my life,\" former Gov. Juan N. Babauta said Thursday morning. \"There's widespread destruction of property, from homes to cars. There's also destruction of utilities. Power poles were knocked down, blocking main and secondary roads.\"\n\n\"People are still in a state of shock,\" Babauta said. \"People are in desperate need of immediate housing, food and other assistance.

The students were finished with their lessons when the teachers got word there was a shooter in the building, she told CNN’s “New Day.”\n\nOne teacher went to lock the door, but Miah says the shooter was already right there — and shot out the window in the door.\n\nShe described it all happening so fast – her teacher backed into the classroom and the gunman followed. She told CNN he made eye contact with one of the teachers, said, “Goodnight,” and then shot her.\n\nHe opened fire, shooting the other teacher and many of Miah’s friends. She said bullets flew by her, and fragments hit her shoulders and head. The girl was later treated at the hospital and released with fragment wounds; she described to CNN that clumps of her hair were falling out now.\n\nMiah said after shooting students in her class, the gunman went through a door into an adjoining classroom. She heard screams, and the sound of shots in that classroom. After the shots stopped, though, she says the shooter started playing loud music – sad music, she said.\n\nThe girl and a friend managed to get her dead teacher’s phone and call 911 for help. She said she told a dispatcher, “Please come … we’re in trouble.”\n\nMiah said she was scared the gunman would return to her classroom to kill her and a few other surviving friends. So, she dipped her hands in the blood of a classmate – who lay next to her, already dead – and then smeared the blood all over herself to play dead.\n\nMiah said it felt like three hours that she lay there, covered in her classmate’s blood, with her friends.\n\nShe told CNN she assumed at that point the police hadn’t arrived on the scene yet.\n\nShe said afterward, she overheard talk of police waiting outside the school. As she recounted this part of the story to CNN, she started crying, saying she just didn’t understand why they didn’t come inside and rescue them.\n\nMiah’s mother said her daughter is traumatized and can’t sleep. The child’s parents have started a GoFundMe specifically to pay for her therapy.\n\nIn an effort to keep herself covered, Miah sat for the interview wrapped in a blanket, despite the warm temperatures.\n\nA cellphone alarm accidentally went off during the interview, and Miah was visibly unnerved by the noise. Her mother said that’s been happening a lot, and described an earlier incident where they were at a car wash and the sound of the vacuum cleaner “completely set her off.”\n\nMiah was too scared to speak on camera, or to a man, because of what she experienced, but she told CNN she wanted to share her story so people can know what it’s like to live through a school shooting. She says hopefully it can help prevent a tragedy like this from happening to other children.\n\nAlready a “miracle baby”\n\nMiah’s mother said she was born with a tumor in her abdomen and wasn’t expected to live much past her birth. She underwent extensive surgery to remove the tumor at age three; her mother already called her a “miracle baby” and said that’s even truer now.\n\nHer mother also told CNN that the morning of the shooting, Miah had an earache and she took her out of school to go to the doctor. On the way back, they stopped at Starbucks for a treat and her mother offered to let Miah skip school the rest of the day since it was one of the last days of classes before summer break and they were just watching movies.\n\nBut Miah insisted that she wanted to return to school to see her friends, so her mother dropped her back off at school – about an hour before the shooting.", "authors": ["Nora Neus Melissa Alonso Claire Colbert", "Nora Neus", "Melissa Alonso", "Claire Colbert"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/10/12/strong-typhoon-japan/17141627/", "title": "India lashed by big cyclone; typhoon hits Japan", "text": "Mohammed Shafeeq\n\nAssociated Press\n\nHYDERABAD, India (AP) — A powerful cyclone pounded a large swath of India's eastern seaboard with heavy rain and strong winds Sunday, killing at least two people and causing major damage to buildings and crops, one of two storms to lash Asia on the day.\n\nIn Japan, at least 35 people were reported injured as Typhoon Vongfong, packing winds of up to 180 kilometers (110 miles) per hour and heavy rain, hit the southern island of Okinawa and was aiming at the island of Kyushu, where authorities told 150,000 people to evacuate.\n\nCyclone Hudhud had winds of 195 kilometers (120 miles) per hour when the edge of the storm hit land after sweeping through the Bay of Bengal, Chief Staff Officer of India's Eastern Naval Command Rear Admiral S.K. Grewal told reporters. The cyclone's wind speed dipped to about 160 kph (100 mph), but was expected to pick up again later Sunday, he said.\n\nExperts said the storm was likely to cause widespread devastation along nearly 300 kilometers (185 miles) of India's east coast.\n\nAt least 400,000 people were evacuated from the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa states ahead of the storm, and hundreds of shelters were set up to house them. Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base, was bearing the brunt of the cyclone's fury.\n\nTelevision footage from Visakhapatnam showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and massive debris strewn in the streets. Electricity lines were disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official.\n\nFour districts in Andhra Pradesh that are home to more than 14 million people — Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari — were likely to be worst hit, including about 350 coastal villages.\n\nAt least two people were killed in the cyclone — one when a wall collapsed in Visakhapatnam, and the other when a tree toppled over in Srikakulam.\n\nAndhra Pradesh's chief minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, said that while the early evacuations had saved lives, the cyclone caused \"huge damage\" to buildings and crops in the coastal districts.\n\nGrewal said 30 diving and 20 rescue teams were on standby. Hundreds of rescuers from India's National Disaster Response Force were also spread out across Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.\n\nIndia's meteorological department said Sunday afternoon that the cyclone would weaken over the next 12 hours, with wind speeds gradually decreasing. But heavy rain was expected to lash Andhra Pradesh and Orissa for another three days. Other parts of central and northeastern India were also expected to see heavy rain.\n\nThe Indian Ocean is a cyclone hot spot. Of the 35 deadliest storms in recorded history, 27 have come through the Bay of Bengal — and have landed in either India or Bangladesh. In 1999, a cyclone devastated Orissa's coastline and killed at least 10,000 people.\n\nWhile India has a disastrous record of response to natural calamities, it managed last October to safely evacuate nearly a million people out of the path of Cyclone Phailin, the strongest tropical storm to hit India in more than a decade. Phailin destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of crops after it made landfall in Orissa, but claimed only about 25 lives.\n\nJapan's Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Vongfong could reach the Tokyo area by Tuesday.\n\nStrong winds from the storm knocked out power lines and toppled traffic signals and signposts on Sunday, and bullet train service was halted for several hours on Kyushu island. Authorities issued landslide warnings.\n\nWest Japan Railway Co., which operates trains in central Japan in the area surrounding the ancient capital of Kyoto, said that some train services would be shut down starting Monday afternoon because of the typhoon, and that the disruptions could continue through Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. military on Okinawa, where last week's typhoon killed three U.S. airmen who were washed out at sea, instructed personnel and their families to remain indoors Sunday until strong winds and rain subsided.\n\nAssociated Press writers Muneeza Naqvi in New Delhi and Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/world/2012/12/05/philippine-typhoon-deaths/1747495/", "title": "Death toll from Philippine typhoon nears 300", "text": "Bullit Marquez, Associated Press\n\nTyphoon Bopha was one of the strongest to hit the Philippines this year\n\nIn one province, it was hard to find any building or house with a roof left\n\nOfficials feared many more bodies could be found in the wreckage\n\n\n\nNEW BATAAN, Philippines — Stunned parents searching for missing children examined a row of mud-stained bodies covered with banana leaves while survivors dried their soaked belongings on roadsides Wednesday, a day after a powerful typhoon killed nearly 300 people in the southern Philippines.\n\nOfficials fear more bodies may be found as rescuers reach hard-hit areas that were isolated by landslides, floods and downed communications.\n\nAt least 151 people died in the worst-hit province of Compostela Valley when Typhoon Bopha lashed the region Tuesday, including 78 villagers and soldiers who perished in a flash flood that swamped two emergency shelters and a military camp, provincial spokeswoman Fe Maestre said.\n\nDisaster-response agencies reported 284 dead in the region and 14 fatalities elsewhere from the typhoon, one of the strongest to hit the country this year.\n\nAbout 80 people survived the deluge in New Bataan with injuries, and Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, who visited the town, said 319 others remained missing.\n\n\"These were whole families among the registered missing,\" Roxas told the ABS-CBN TV network. \"Entire families may have been washed away.\"\n\nThe farming town of 45,000 people was a muddy wasteland of collapsed houses and coconut and banana trees felled by Bopha's ferocious winds.\n\nBodies of victims were laid on the ground for viewing by people searching for missing relatives. Some were badly mangled after being dragged by raging flood waters over rocks and other debris. A man sprayed insecticide on the remains to keep away swarms of flies.\n\nA father wept when he found the body of his child after lifting a plastic cover. A mother, meanwhile, went away in tears, unable to find her missing children. \"I have three children,\" she said repeatedly, flashing three fingers before a TV cameraman.\n\nTwo men carried the mud-caked body of an unidentified girl that was covered with coconut leaves on a makeshift stretcher made from a blanket and wooden poles.\n\nDionisia Requinto, 43, felt lucky to have survived with her husband and their eight children after swirling flood waters surrounded their home. She said they escaped and made their way up a hill to safety, bracing themselves against boulders and fallen trees as they climbed.\n\n\"The water rose so fast,\" she told AP. \"It was horrible. I thought it was going to be our end.\"\n\nIn nearby Davao Oriental, the coastal province first struck by the typhoon as it blew from the Pacific Ocean, at least 115 people perished, mostly in three towns that were so battered that it was hard to find any buildings with roofs remaining, provincial officer Freddie Bendulo and other officials said.\n\n\"We had a problem where to take the evacuees. All the evacuation centers have lost their roofs,\" Davao Oriental Gov. Corazon Malanyaon said.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued an urgent appeal for $4.8 million to help people directly affected by the typhoon.\n\nThe sun was shining brightly for most of the day Wednesday, prompting residents to lay their soaked clothes, books and other belongings out on roadsides to dry and revealing the extent of the damage to farmland. Thousands of banana trees in one Compostela Valley plantation were toppled by the wind, the young bananas still wrapped in blue plastic covers.\n\nBut as night fell, however, rain started pouring again over New Bataan, triggering panic among some residents who feared a repeat of the previous day's flash floods. Some carried whatever belongings they could as they hurried to nearby towns or higher ground.\n\nAfter slamming into Davao Oriental and Compostela Valley, Bopha roared quickly across the southern Mindanao and central regions, knocking out power in two entire provinces, triggering landslides and leaving houses and plantations damaged. More than 170,000 fled to evacuation centers.\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, the typhoon was over the South China Sea west of Palawan province. It was blowing northwestward and could be headed to Vietnam or southern China, according to government forecasters.\n\nThe deaths came despite efforts by President Benigno Aquino III's government to force residents out of high-risk communities as the typhoon approached.\n\nSome 20 typhoons and storms lash the northern and central Philippines each year, but they rarely hit the vast southern Mindanao region where sprawling export banana plantations have been planted over the decades because it seldom experiences strong winds that could blow down the trees.\n\nA rare storm in the south last December killed more than 1,200 people and left many more homeless.\n\nThe United States extended its condolences and offered to help its Asian ally deal with the typhoon's devastation. It praised government efforts to minimize the deaths and damage.\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press writers Jim Gomez, Teresa Cerojano and Oliver Teves in Manila contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/weather/hurricane-fiona-forecast-canada-thursday", "title": "Hurricane Fiona could be Canada's strongest-ever storm | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCanadians are bracing for what could be the strongest storm to ever hit their country’s coast.\n\n“Every Nova Scotian should be preparing today and bracing for impact,” John Lohr, the minister responsible for the provincial Emergency Management Office, said in a Thursday news conference.\n\nHurricane Fiona has lashed the Caribbean, is forecast to brush by Bermuda as a dangerous Category 3 storm and shows no signs of slowing before it slams into Canada on Saturday morning.\n\n“This could be Canada’s version of (Hurricane) Sandy,” said Chris Fogarty, a meteorologist for Canada’s hurricane center, pointing to the size and intensity of Fiona and its combination of hurricane and winter-storm characteristics. Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states and all of the eastern seaboard, causing an estimated $78.7 billion in damage.\n\nFiona was about 1,200 miles southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Thursday morning, and the area is already bracing for a rare and historic impact.\n\n“Please take it seriously because we are seeing meteorological numbers in our weather maps that are rarely seen here,” said Fogarty.\n\nLohr, with the emergency management office in Nova Scotia, said the storm has the potential to be “very dangerous” for the province.\n\n“The storm is expected to bring severe and damaging wind gusts, very high waves, and coastal storm surges, intense and dangerous rainfall rates and prolonged power outages,” Lohr said Thursday. “The time to get ready is now before Fiona hits tomorrow evening.”\n\nThe lowest pressure ever recorded in Canada was 940 millibars in January 1977 in Newfoundland, said Brian Tang, an atmospheric science professor at the University of Albany. “Current weather forecast models are indicating that Fiona will make landfall in eastern Nova Scotia with a pressure around 925 to 935 millibars, which would easily set a new record,” he said.\n\nA pressure 920 to 944 millibars is typically found in a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nMany forecasters, including Fogarty, are comparing this storm to 2003’s Hurricane Juan, which battered the Canadian coast as a Category 2 storm.\n\n“That storm was much smaller. This one is huge,” said Fogarty.\n\nThe storm’s hurricane force winds extend 70 miles in either direction from its center – and tropical storm-force winds extend more than 200 miles. A path 140 miles wide could experience hurricane-force winds, and an area more than 400 miles across could experience tropical storm-force winds.\n\nAnd Fiona could grow even more by the time the storm reaches Canada, according to Tang.\n\nWhat Fiona could bring\n\nFiona is expected to reach Atlantic Canada on Friday evening, and the region will begin to experience deteriorating conditions earlier in the day.\n\nHere is the latest update on #Hurricane #Fiona.\n\n\n\nHurricane Fiona has the potential to be a landmark weather event in Eastern Canada this weekend, and we encourage the public to continue to monitor the forecasts regularly.\n\n\n\nRead the new bulletins at: https://t.co/QURfkCQp7W pic.twitter.com/RSdj9L75RI — ECCC Canadian Hurricane Centre (@ECCC_CHC) September 22, 2022\n\n“Fiona is purely a hurricane right now. As it begins to interact with a cold weather system and jet stream, it will transition into a superstorm with characteristics of both a strong hurricane and a strong autumn cyclone with hurricane-force winds, very heavy rain, and large storm surge and waves,” explained Tang.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is forecasting the storm “to continue producing hurricane-force winds as it crosses Nova Scotia and moves into the Gulf of St. Lawrence.” In fact, the storm could still carry winds over 100 mph when it slams onshore.\n\nNova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and western Newfoundland could receive up to 6 inches of rain, with some areas receiving up to 10 inches. This could result in significant flash flooding.\n\n“We want people to take it very seriously and be prepared for a long period of utility outages and structural damage to buildings,” explained Fogarty.\n\nLife-threatening storm surge and large waves are forecast for the region.\n\nMike Savage, the mayor of Halifax Regional Municipality, the capital of Nova Scotia, warned wave watchers and surfers to stay away from coastal areas, adding people who live near the coast “must be prepared to move on short notice and pay close attention to possible evacuation orders.”\n\n“Throughout our entire Halifax region you should be prepared for downed trees, extended power outages and local flood conditions,” the mayor added.\n\nCape Breton Regional Municipality Mayor Amanda McDougall said officials are preparing and working to ensure residents will be safe, as the area is in “the direct impact zone.”\n\n“We need to make sure that there’s going to be a center for people to go to prior to the storm because we know that there are different types of housing that are not going to be able to withstand the winds, the flooding, the way other buildings may,” McDougall said.\n\nHow to prepare for a hurricane\n\nSome of the waves over eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence could be higher than 39 feet, and the western Gulf will see waves from the north up to 26 feet in places, which will probably cause significant erosion on north facing beaches of Prince Edward Island, the Canadian hurricane center said.\n\nThe hurricane center also warns of coastal flooding, especially during high tide.\n\nIt’s been roughly 50 years since a storm this intense has impacted Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. Both of those were winter storms – in 1974 and 1976, Fogarty said. Many people won’t even remember those two storms, so forecasters are trying to send a clear message for residents to prepare.", "authors": ["Jennifer Gray Allison Chinchar", "Jennifer Gray", "Allison Chinchar"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}]}

Ferrari 166s, Jaguar XK120s, and Cadillac-Allards swerved alarmingly close to residents who stood behind flimsy wooden fences. Eventually, these races were banned, which opened the door to a new Midwestern recreation.\n\nSixty years ago, Road America was created: a motorsports complex with one of the country’s longest road circuits. Road America is unique among North America’s permanent road circuits in retaining its original layout. What the daredevils of 1955 raced on is the same track that is in use today.\n\nFour miles of rolling hills and plunging ravines lay the groundwork for founder Clift Tufte and local wealthy citizens to conceptualize the track, taking advantage of the natural topography of the glacial Kettle Moraine area. Road America’s first racing event took place in 1955 with the SCCA National, an exciting 148-mile race between Sherwood Johnson of Rye, N.Y., and Phil Hill of Santa Monica, Calif. A year later, the first professional race weekend debuted with the NASCAR Grand National during a time when NASCAR was only a regional Southern series and not very well known.\n\nFast forward to present day, where over 425 events are held annually at Road America, drawing around 800,000 visitors and contributing an impressive $70 million in economic impact. Some of Road America’s famous visiting series have included NASCAR, CART, Canadian-American Challenge Cup, and six-hour endurance racing.\n\n\"Road America is my favorite track in the world”, says racer Peter Cunningham. “I won my first big SCCA National race there at the June Sprints in 1984, and then earned my first professional win three years later in a three-hour endurance race.”\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nRoad America is easy to navigate for visitors, with open parking facilities for fans to watch the action from different turns and vantage points. Walking is also a popular way to see cars zoom past, with trails connecting the track areas. During major race weekends, Road America is open for spectator camping with areas reserved for tents and motorhomes.\n\nThere are around 100 different classes and events open to the public. These include go-kart exercises for corporate groups, motorcycle training to obtain a license, high-performance driving programs, and winter driving programs. “We teach people how to control their vehicles in tough conditions (so) that they can apply those skills on the highways,” says Mike Kertscher, director of business services at Road America.\n\nThis summer, Road America debuted the Silent Sporting event every Monday and Wednesday, where visitors can ride bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles, plus walk or run the track. Other activities at the facility include horse-drawn hayrides, paddock tours, scavenger hunts and paintball adventures.\n\nSummer of motorsports\n\nWhen locals are not getting fit at Road America, the summer days are devoted to the professional racing events.\n\nOn August 8, the IMSA Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge comes to Road America (and is also being streamed live on IMSA.com). The following day brings the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship and Continental Tire Road Race Showcase.Activities include tech talks, fan forums, car corrals and a Tour de RA bike event. The NASCAR XFINITY Series, SCCA Pro Trans-Am Series and Mazda MX-5 Cup roll into Road America Aug. 27-29, as the final of three road courses on the NASCAR XFINITY Series schedule. The event has historically brought an influx of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stars and various sports car series veterans. The last summer event at Road America will be the OPTIMA FACEOFF on Aug. 30, which includes autocross, road course, braking and acceleration challenges, a style and design competition and road rally. Find a complete calendar of events at RoadAmerica.com.\n\n“We have been coming up to Road America since the 1970s and I have been racing there since 1972,” says Dave Harris, a retired airline pilot from Illinois. Harris and his wife Kathy are one of many families who brought their children to the track, making it a generational hobby. “Those racing days are long, with inspections, tent set-up, and creating work spaces, so we practically potty-trained our kids there. We raised our children at Road America, and now my grandchildren go to Road America.”\n\nOff the track\n\nAfter a day at Road America, explore a plethora of activities in the Sheboygan County area. Start at Elkhart Lake, which Native Americans believed had healing qualities. During a boat ride, you will find peaceful woodlands surrounding the lake and see the protected lily pads that color Turtle Bay. A 20-minute drive from Elkhart Lake lands you in the charming town of Kohler, named after the appliance company and family. The Kohler Design Center conducts factory tours that highlight how their kitchen and bath products are made, while the small museum features vintage Kohler products.

The first race was a bar run from Woods Hole to Falmouth. Cape Cod’s biggest sporting event is an all hands on deck event at the Cape Cod Times.\n\nThe first time I covered it was back in the early 1980s, a young cub photographer. My assigned shooting position was a spot at Nobska Light, tasked with getting the steady stream of runners passing the iconic lighthouse.\n\nKeep in mind; this was back in the days of film. Our photo crew, which numbered three that year, all made their way back to Hyannis. Lining up outside the darkroom, we waited our turn, running color slide film through the Wing Lynch processing machine, only 8 rolls each run and 55 minutes a session.\n\nI had pulled out all the stops making images from atop the lighthouse and even running several rolls through a panoramic Widelux camera. I had high hopes. But, turns out my film run got eaten by the machine, yes it happened every so often, and I had nothing to show for the day save a few wet rolls of crumpled film. Not a great start to a career in road race photography.\n\nI graduated to a position at the finish line and finally after several years a spot on the chase truck. The truck was a big flatbed with a barrier in the back. Reporters would stand atop risers looking over the photographers jammed cheek to jowl at the tailgate, trying to be human tripods as we follow focused, no autofocus those days, making shots of the leaders.\n\nA chase motorcycle with a videographer was always in front of us so a clean shot was a challenge. When the truck approached the finish line, the driver would yell to everyone “hold on” and gun it down the hill past the Casino at Falmouth Heights; we all spilled out and tumbled to a spot at the finish line to capture the winners. You can’t put a price on that kind of fun.\n\nMy favorite coverage was always the aerial years, sometimes by plane and once by helicopter which produced one of my favorite photos of all time. The pilot removed the doors and off we went from Hyannis.\n\nI had a clear shooting position a couple hundred feet above the action, a dream come true. The image above was made along Surf Drive from directly overhead. The shadows became the runners, as the front pack raced to the finish line.\n\nIt was the beginning of the digital era and I knew I had something as we flew back to Hyannis, when, as the adrenaline wore off, I finally realized I had never buckled my seat belt for the entire ride, those were the days.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/communities/oxnard/2020/08/14/oxnard-police-street-racing-ventura-county-events-social-distancing/5582789002/", "title": "Arrests made at street race, public gathering - Ventura County Events", "text": "Complaints about street racing in Oxnard led to a major enforcement operation Thursday night that resulted in multiple arrests, authorities said.\n\n\"Last night was one of the larger enforcement actions we've conducted recently,\" said Oxnard Police Department Sgt. Ricardo Vazquez on Friday.\n\nThe effort included California Highway Patrol personnel, Vazquez said, and followed a joint training session involving both agencies.\n\nOfficers arrested two drivers on suspicion of taking part in a street race, six people on suspicion of aiding or engaging in an exhibition of speed and two drivers on suspicion of reckless driving. All were misdemeanor violations, officials said. Nine vehicles were towed.\n\nEnforcement started around 8 p.m. and lasted until 1:30 a.m. Friday. Officers worked at various locations in response to recent complaints about illegal racing, stunt driving including drifting and drag racing, as well as unauthorized car meets where owners of modified vehicles gather in large numbers.\n\nOne area is the corridor along North Oxnard Boulevard near Vineyard Avenue, Vazquez said. A week earlier, an estimated 400 cars had gathered in the nearby Home Depot parking lot on Esplanade Drive, he said.\n\nThe Rose Avenue corridor near Channel Islands Boulevard is another site of frequent complaints, he said. On Thursday night, officers observed an estimated 100 to 150 cars taking part in activities there.\n\nDuring Thursday night's enforcement, officers also followed participants to Perkins and Hueneme roads at the south end of the city. The stretch is commonly known to be used by street racers, Vazquez said, and car enthusiasts sometimes take over the roadway for stunt driving. About a half-dozen arrests and five tows during the enforcement took place at the Perkins location.\n\nThe high-visibility operation was intended not only to curb future events but to send a message to all participants, Vazquez said. Drivers will be arrested and cars towed, he said.\n\nWhat's more, spectators who assist illegal activities will also be cited. That includes people who block intersections, prepare roads for races, wave flags to initiate races and serve as timers.\n\n\"We are going to focus enforcement on those folks as well,\" Vazquez said.\n\nUnsanctioned events involving street racing, drag racing and drifting have increased in recent years, the department said, leading to the tough stance.\n\n\"The Oxnard Police Department will be taking a zero-tolerance approach to this dangerous and illegal behavior,\" authorities said in a release.\n\nSee what others are reading in the latest Ventura County news:\n\nDrivers of modified vehicles will be referred to a state referee for equipment inspections, officials said.

He doesn't believe recent lockdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic have fueled the latest uptick.\n\nRacing and related events are dangerous for everyone using the road, department officials said.\n\nOn July 30, an editor at the Orange County Register died after his pickup truck was hit by an alleged street racer in Santa Ana, the paper reported.

She is the first American woman to medal in the race since 1984, when Connie Carpenter and Rebecca Twigg finished 1-2 at the L.A. Olympics.\n\n“I think even though I came here with the confidence that I could earn a medal, when I crossed the line, yeah, I knew it had happened but I didn’t fully take it in and so it was just pretty overwhelming for me,” Faulkner said. “I think I had a lot of emotions around – I came in here with a lot of confidence today that I could do well but not everyone had confidence in me and so I think when I crossed the line it was like, ‘Wow, I made it happen even when a lot of people didn’t believe I could.’”\n\nFaulkner, 31, is a relative newbie to cycling, but no stranger to competitive athletics.\n\nShe grew up in a fishing village in Homer, Alaska, rowed collegiately at Harvard and entered the business world in finance and venture capital before she quit to pursue cycling in 2020.\n\nFaulkner said the discipline she learned as a rower and athletic engine she built in college have served her well as a cyclist, and she said she developed an appetite for risk – and the ability to calculate which risks are worth taking – that were on display in the narrow Paris streets Sunday.\n\n“I was a venture capitalist. I was working in finance, we were investing in early-stage technology companies and they were quite high risk,” Faulkner said. “And so a lot of what I learned how to do is how to take calculated risks and how to assess risk. And if there's a high risk but the reward is high, then it might be worth it. And I think in a race, I take that mindset with me throughout the race. It's like, ‘Well, there's a break up the road, there's a risk, and why not catch it?’ What is the risk reward ratio of being patient versus being aggressive? So that's something I definitely take with me.”\n\nFaulkner was a late add to the women’s road race after failing to qualify for one of the USA’s two spots at the Olympic trials. Taylor Knibb, who won a spot at trials – the top two finishers in time trials received spots in the road race – gave that up to focus on other events at the Olympics.\n\nFaulkner said she considered not racing Sunday to focus on team pursuit, an event the Americans are favored to win a medal in that begins Tuesday. She decided to stay in only after simulating both races and the break in between during training and feeling good about her chances both to medal Sunday and perform at a high level in team pursuit.\n\n“I made an agreement with my track coaches that I would only do the road race if I felt that I was medal capable and if any point if I got dropped from the front group and I was no longer in contention for a medal I would just pull out of the race and recover for team pursuit,” Faulkner said.\n\nBy the midpoint of the race, it was clear Faulkner would be in medal contention.\n\nShe spent most of the afternoon in a 12-racer pack ahead of the peloton, and pulled into a two-racer chase group with Kopecky in pursuit of co-leaders Vos and Bianka Vas with about 9 kilometers to go.\n\nFaulkner and Kopecky pulled even with Vos and Vas with just over 3 kllometers left, and Faulkner hit the gas and gunned it for the finish line.\n\n“I felt quite confident that as soon as we caught them, if I could get a small gap, it would probably be unlikely that they would cooperate and work together until the line to catch me,” Faulkner said. “And I also knew that my time-trialing capabilities are quite strong and that I could be strong when I was a (going) solo. So yes, when I was chasing with Kopecky, the first thing on my mind was as soon as we catch them, I have to go and head down until the finish.”\n\nDygert, who finished 15th, 3 minutes and 40 seconds off the lead, said seeing Faulkner’s name across the leaderboard when she crossed the line made the crash she endured Sunday well worth it.\n\n“Faulkner had an amazing ride,” Dygert said. “She’s been having a great year this year. Super impressive. She’s just shown over and over again that she has that power for those finals, so really impressive and she’s put a lot of work in and she’s doing a lot of track and I think that is really helped her and yeah, I’m super happy for her. This is huge. And her first Olympics, what a way to leave it with a gold medal.”\n\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.

It wasn’t until after World War II that organized road racing again became popular.\n\nBy 1950, road races were being held on both coasts from Pebble Beach, Calif., to Long Island, N.Y. Sports cars were better suited for road racing because of their maneuverability, cornering and speed.\n\nIt was time to bring them back — but where?\n\nAccording to “Historic Race Circuits,” “The open road sports car races held in 1950 through 1952 were conceived and operated by the members of the Chicago Region of the Sports Car Club of America. Jim Kimberly is acknowledged as the person who selected Elkhart Lake and was the driving force behind organizing the races along with Fred Wacker, Karl Brocken and C. Bayard Sheldon.\n\n“At the time, Elkhart Lake was at a low point in its economic history and Jim Johnson, president of the Elkhart Lake Bank, felt that the races would bring a new energy to the area. Joined by fire chief Ray Kramer and Resort owner Ollie Siebken Moeller, a strong community effort was mounted that resulted in dozens of volunteers coming forward to help organize the races. Gov. Walter Kohler, who had a summer home on Elkhart Lake, helped pave the way.”\n\nThose street races flourished 1950-52 in and around Elkhart Lake. Politics, safety issues and difficult neighbors put an end to the popular sport that had drivers in abundance, with crowds to match.\n\nFor a time, it seemed the era of racing in this part of Wisconsin was a pipe dream. Enter Clifton Tufte.\n\nHe was one of a small group of residents to recognize the degree to which Elkhart Lake could benefit economically from a permanent road course. He also loved racing and was willing to chase the dream.\n\nTufte was a civil engineer and president of the Elkhart Sand and Gravel Co., which had built its business as a major supplier of highway and railroad ballast in eastern Wisconsin.\n\nWhen the market dropped off, it found its greatest asset was the land it owned two miles south of Elkhart Lake.\n\nTufte’s experience with the Army Corps of Engineers and the state highway commission planning roads made him the perfect project manager. And what better use for a defunct gravel pit than a race course?\n\nIn October 1954, Road America was formed and stocks were sold, with 1,750 shares sold at $100 each, raising $175,000 for construction.\n\nTufte walked the land for months, planning and measuring, staking out turns even before the land thawed that spring of 1955. The first shovel was turned April 20 — bulldozers broke ground and grading began.\n\nTwenty-seven feet wide with a 175-foot drop across the course, it was built to the toughest standards around.\n\nIt is said that Tufte used to roll the circuit diagonally every day, helping to maintain its surface.\n\nCarpenters were still pounding nails into the pagoda the morning of the first race on Sept. 10, 1955.\n\nFour thousand bales of hay and 27,000 feet of snow fence were used as safety measures. More than 600 locals volunteered that first weekend, when “Tufte weather” made an appearance — rain before and rain after, but no rain on race day.\n\nRoad America’s program initially centered around three weekends in June, July and September. June Sprints, with more than 500 entries, became the signature amateur racing event in this country.\n\nRacing icon Carroll Shelby won those first June Sprints in 1956, surely a sign of great things to come.\n\nDescribed as old school, a crank and a perfectionist, Tufte was also a man of personal reserve and dignity — a man curious about everything. He served as track president from 1955-1978.\n\nThe track itself remains virtually unchanged 60 years later in this anniversary year, though advances in safety requirements have transformed it into a modern racing circuit.\n\nIt is still the first and only closed, privately owned course in the county — a smooth four miles of macadam.\n\nVision and enthusiasm were perhaps two of his greatest gifts. His dedication guaranteed racing in Elkhart Lake.\n\nTufte is — and will always be — Mr. Road America.\n\nBeth Dippel is executive director of the Sheboygan County Historical Society in Sheboygan Falls", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2025/02/16/daytona-500-weather-delay-nascar/78775054007/", "title": "Daytona 500 weather delay: What to know about restart at NASCAR ...", "text": "(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nThe 2025 Daytona 500 was in a lengthy weather delay. But after 3 hours, the race restarted ... for a short while.\n\nThe caution flag came out as drivers were set to complete Lap 8 because of rain in Turns 1 and 2. After three more laps, at 2:20 p.m., drivers parked along pit road under a red flag.\n\nRain fell for less than an hour, but the track needed time to be dried. Austin Cindric held the lead, followed by Ty Dillon, pole-sitter Chase Briscoe and Joey Logano.\n\nThe prospect of rain loomed over the 67th Great American Race throughout the week. Practice runs throughout Daytona Speedweek were pushed back or canceled because of rain, and NASCAR on Friday moved the start of the Daytona 500 up an hour to try to beat the weather.\n\nWeather also played a major part in the 2024 Daytona 500, with rain washing out Saturday's and Sunday's entire schedule. Last year's big race took place Monday, followed by the delayed Xfinity Series race.\n\nDaytona 500 restart: 2nd rain delay lasts just 20 minutes\n\nAt about 6:15 p.m., cars once again took to the track for a few caution laps. This time, they made it to the green flag at 6:22.\n\nRed flag reappears after drivers complete 9 caution laps\n\nFor the second time today, the Daytona 500 is under a red flag.\n\nAt 5:55 p.m., after nine laps run under caution, race officials instructed drivers to return to pit road and cover their cars. The expectation is that weather will be clear after this second, small cell passes.\n\nNASCAR calls drivers back to cars for Daytona 500 restart\n\nJust before 5 p.m., NASCAR announced it was calling drivers to return to their cars at 5:25. The Fox broadcast said NASCAR will proceed as though there will be no further rain delays, though radar shows Daytona Beach is not out of the woods yet. Fox said racing should resume by 6.\n\nTrack drying underway at Daytona International Speedway\n\nRain has lightened in the area surrounding Daytona International Speedway, and the track-drying process is underway.\n\nHow long it takes to dry a track depends on a number of factors, from the makeup of the track to the climate conditions: humidity, cloud cover, wind, etc. The Air Titans can dry the 2.5-mile track at Daytona in 90-150 minutes, but in decent conditions it could be done in about an hour.\n\nHow to watch Daytona 500: TV schedule, streaming info\n\nStart time: 1:30 p.m. ET\n\n1:30 p.m. ET TV channel: Fox\n\nFox Live streaming: Fubo (free trial)\n\nFubo (free trial) Radio: MRN | SiriusXM (Channel 90)\n\nCoverage of the 2025 Daytona 500 was scheduled to start at 1:30 p.m. Sunday, February 16 on Fox.

The measure will redraw Congressional maps, hurting the GOP.\n\nAfter riding high for months, President Donald Trump saw MAGA zeal collide with a growing backlash that helped deliver a wave of Democratic election victories, setting the stage for a big 2026 midterm clash.\n\nDemocrats swept statewide contests in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania and racked up victories in lower profile races, leaving party leaders jubilant and eager to declare the election a referendum on Trump.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the results are a \"repudiation of the Trump agenda.\" The president, meanwhile, blamed the government shutdown and the fact that he wasn't on the ballot.\n\nA former Trump campaign advisor said the president would shift his focus to the economy and affordability in 2026, even as Democrats saw the cost of living as a winning issue in next year's mid-term elections.\n\nTrump loomed large over the Nov. 4 contests, the first big test of voter sentiment since he won every swing state and the popular vote in 2024. The outcome couldn't have been better for Democrats.\n\nDemocrats Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey won races for governor by wide margins in states where Trump made gains in 2024, and California voters resoundingly approved a ballot measure aimed at checking Trump's efforts to create more Republican-leaning congressional seats.\n\nThe party saw a slate of new leaders emerge, most notably 34-year-old New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who energized young voters with a progressive agenda that drew Trump's ire.\n\nThe Democratic romp came as Trump's approval rating sags and 61% of voters in a new CNN/SSRS poll blamed Trump for the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nA 'big tent' moment for Democrats\n\nDemocratic wins on Nov. 4 signal a national backlash could be building against the Trump administration, but the wide divergence between some of the winning candidates renewed debates on the left about how best to run against Republicans.\n\nOn the one hand, there is Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist who won the New York City mayoral race with economic populist ideas such as free buses and universal childcare.\n\nOn the other hand, twin victories by Reps. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey in their state's governors races show a different path forward. Both candidates ran as pragmatists with national security backgrounds in campaigns that accentuated their bipartisan congressional records.\n\nMamdani's win and New York City's high turnout has emboldened some on the activist left to argue their ideas excite voters and motivate younger citizens to vote. But other liberals hold a different view and caution against overconfidence.\n\n\"I think it says more about the Republicans,\" Rahm Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff to President Barack Obama and Chicago mayor, told USA TODAY in a Nov. 5 interview about the election results. \"This was a referendum on Donald Trump and the Republican Party and their stewardship, and he got a massive whooping − full stop.\"\n\n--Phillip Bailey\n\nDemocrats tussle over Trump, redistricting\n\nPresident Donald Trump's redistricting initiative has pulled two powerful Democratic state legislators into a public spat, with Virginia's outspoken state Senate president slamming her Maryland counterpart for failing to respond to Republican efforts to redraw congressional maps in their favor.\n\nMaryland Senate President Bill Ferguson, who has opposed his Democratic-controlled state jumping in the national fray, celebrated the party's successful Nov. 4 results, saying a Democratic victory in Virginia governor's race shows that \"we don't need to rig the system to win.\"\n\n\"When we provide a better vision about the future − lower costs, better services, and real solutions to protect against Trump − voters overwhelmingly choose our leadership,\" Ferguson said in post on X.\n\nVirginia Senate President L. Louise Lucas apparently didn't appreciate the advice. \"Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points,\" Lucas, known to be an outspoken legislator, responded in a Nov. 5 post.\n\n\"Grow a pair and stand up to this president,\" she added. \"This is just embarrassing.\"\n\n--Phillip Bailey\n\nDems see advantage the Trump economy\n\nEnergy prices in New Jersey. Job cuts in Virginia. Sky-high rents in New York City.\n\nEconomic issues were a driving factor in Tuesday's off-year 2025 elections, putting persistently high consumer costs under President Donald Trump's administration in the spotlight and sounding alarm bells for the GOP as Democrats leveraged Americans' anxiety into a wave of victories that they hope will be a springboard toward the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe economy, often the decisive issue in any election, was the focus for both moderate Democrats running for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and the democratic socialist who won the New York City mayoral contest. All won convincing victories, as polling indicates voters are uneasy about Trump's economic stewardship amid trade wars, a sluggish job market and ongoing cost-of-living concerns.\n\n\"Democratic candidates, no matter where they are, no matter how they fit into our big tent party, are meeting voters at the kitchen table, not the gilded ballroom,\" Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in statement, adding: \"Democrats ran campaigns relentlessly focused on costs and affordability.\"\n\n--Zac Anderson\n\nVulnerable House Democrat won't run for reelection\n\nMaine Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who has consistently won a district that supported Trump for president, said Wednesday he will not run for reelection. He was facing a tough primary challenge, but said in a statement posted to social media that he believes he would have won.\n\n\"I’m confident that were I to run again, I would win. But recent events have made me reconsider whether the good I can do in Congress still outweighs the cost to my family,\" he said in the post. \"I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished in decades of public service. Now, I look forward to my next chapter: raising my young daughters with Izzy and spending more time with our family and friends.\"\n\n--Sarah D. Wire\n\nTrump will shift focus to affordability, campaign aide says\n\nAfter Democrats' heavy win Tuesday with campaigns focused on cost of living issues like energy costs, President Trump plans to refocus his messaging next year, his 2024 campaign political director, James Blair, told Politico's The Conversation.\n\nBlair pointed to the positive, kitchen-table focused ads run by Democratic candidates Tuesday night as a reason they won.\n\n\"I think you'll see the president talk a lot about cost of living as we turn the year and into the new year. The president is very keyed into what's going on and he recognizes, like anybody, that it takes time to do an economic turnaround but all the fundamentals are there and I think you'll see him be very, very focused on prices and cost of living,\" Blair said.\n\nTrump seemed less focused on prices and economic issues in remarks he delivered at a Miami event Wednesday.\n\n--Sarah D. Wire\n\nTrump says his administration ‘will help’ Mamdani as mayor\n\nTrump said his administration “will help” New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a dramatic change in tune after threatening for weeks to withhold federal funds from the city if Mamdani were elected.\n\n“Now let’s see how a communist does in New York,” Trump said in a speech in Miami, referring to Mamdani, a democratic socialist. “We’re going to see how that works out.”\n\nThe president added: “And we’ll help him. We’ll help him. We want New York to be successful. We’ll help him – a little bit, maybe.”\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says NYC ‘installed a communist’ with Mamdani’s victory\n\nTrump said New York City “installed a communist” with the election of Zohran Mamdani as the city’s next mayor, declaring, “As long as I’m in the White House, the United States is not going communist in any way, shape or form.”\n\nTrump ripped Mamdani during remarks at a business forum in Miami, one day after the self-described democratic socialist won the New York mayor’s race by a sizable margin by focusing on the cost of living and affordability.\n\n“I used to say we will never have socialists elected to any post in our country,” Trump said. “We skipped socialists and we put up a communist instead. That didn’t work out too well.”\n\nTrump said: “After last night's results, the decision facing all Americans could not be more clear, we have a choice between communism and common sense.”\n\nFor months ahead of the Tuesday’s election, Trump criticized Mamdani as a “communist” and threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City if he’s elected.\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nCalifornia Republicans sue to block Prop 50\n\nA group of California Republicans is suing over the state's new congressional maps, one day after voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50.\n\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairwoman Corrin Rankin, state Assemblymember David Tangipa, and their legal team announced on Nov. 5 they have filed a suit in federal court in Los Angeles claiming Prop 50 violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe lawsuit, which also represents 18 California voters, is asking the court for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block the Prop 50 maps so that California’s original maps − drawn by an independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission − stay intact for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThey allege ballot measure, led by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, improperly used voters' race, specifically Latino voters, as a factor in drawing new district boundaries and violates the 14th and 15th amendments. \"This whole process was a sham,\" Tangipa said.\n\nProp 50 was a response by Newsom and Democrats to redistricting in Texas that came at the request of President Donald Trump to gain Republican seats in the US House of Representatives.\n\nThey are being represented by the Dhillon Law Group, a San Francisco-based firm founded by Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, and a longtime Newsom rival.\n\nNewsom's press office in a post on X said, \"We haven’t reviewed the lawsuit, but if it’s from the California Republican Party and Harmeet Dhillon’s law firm, it’s going to fail. Good luck, losers.\"\n\n--Terry Collins\n\nJeffries talks 'momentum' after Dem sweep\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York called Tuesday's election a \"historic rejection of the extremism the American people have been experiencing\" and an embrace of Democrats' vision.\n\n\"Democrats have all of the momentum in the world. Republicans woke up this morning and realized that they are no longer in a 2024 electoral environment. That's over, and they're done,\" he told reporters.\n\n−Sarah D. Wire\n\nTrump says ‘we lost a little bit of sovereignty’ with Mamdani victory\n\nTrump took a swipe at Zohran Mamdani one day after the New York City mayor-elect’s resounding victory, saying “we lost a little bit of sovereignty last night in New York.”\n\nTrump made the remark during a speech at a business forum in Miami as the president celebrated the one-year anniversary of his 2024 election win..\n\n“On Nov. 5, 2024, the American people reclaimed our government,” Trump said. “We restored our sovereignty - we lost a little bit of sovereignty last night in New York, but we’ll take care of it, don’t worry about it.\"\n\nIn a political setback for Trump, Democrats on Tuesday swept elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, where Trump endorsed Mamdani’s chief rival, former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in the city’s mayoral election.\n\nTrump, who has mocked Mamdani as a “communist” and a “nut job,” has warned repeatedly that he might withhold federal funding from New York City under a Mamdani administration.\n\nNevertheless, Mamdani dared Trump to keep going after him in a combative election night victory speech.\n\n“If there is any way to defeat a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power,” Mamdani said. “This is not only how we stop Trump - it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nCalifornia Rep. Ken Calvert says he’ll run in newly formed district\n\nRep. Ken Calvert, California’s longest-serving current GOP congressman, could be headed for a member-on-member election next year in one of the state’s newly redrawn congressional districts.\n\nA large portion of Calvert’s existing district will be absorbed into California’s 40th Congressional District, which is already represented by GOP Rep. Young Kim, who may also decide to jockey for the seat next year. Kim has not released any statements on her plans for 2026.\n\nCalvert said in a statement Nov. 5 that he will run to represent that new district, which overlaps a large portion of the district he’s represented for decades. “No one else comes close to my record of service to the new 40th,” he said. “I’ve lived here my entire life and already represent the majority of this district in Congress.”\n\nThe new district is among those redrawn by Proposition 50, which voters swiftly passed on Nov. 4. As many as five Republican-leaning districts in the famously blue state could likely flip for a Democrat in the 2026 midterms due to the new district contours.\n\n−Kathryn Palmer\n\nWhite House basks in Trump's 2024 victory after bruising election night\n\nThe White House responded to Democrats’ election night sweep by looking backwards to President Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n“They said it couldn’t be done,” the White House wrote in a Wednesday post on X that included a video of political pundits talking down Trump’s chances ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nThe video makes no mention of the outcomes of Tuesday’s elections in which Democrats swept races in New Jersey, Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania and California.\n\nDemocrats’ big night has been widely interpreted as a repudiation of Trump’s first year in office. Yet following the bruising off-year elections losses for Republicans, Trump has blamed the outcome foremost on himself not being on the ballot.\n\n“They say that I wasn't on the ballot was the biggest factor,” Trump told Senate Republicans during a Wednesday morning breakfast. “I don't know about that, but I was honored that they said that.\"\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nGOP split on impact of Democrats' election wins\n\nOn the heels of big election wins for Democrats Tuesday night, Republicans at the highest leadership levels appeared split over whether to downplay the results – or take them as troubling indicators.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, stressed that Democrats were expected to come out on top.\n\n\"We knew in advance that they were going to take a victory lap,\" said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota. The races were ones \"we did not expect to win anyways,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana.\n\nOther Republicans, including President Trump, seemed to think the results underscored bigger problems.\n\n\"Last night, if that wasn't a message to all Republicans, then we've got our heads jammed in the ground,\" said Sen. Jim Justice, R-West Virginia.\n\n\"The lesson is that we've got to deliver on the campaign promises we made,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri.\n\n--Zachary Schermele\n\nSchumer congratulates Mamdani after snubbing his campaign\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he called Zohran Mamdani to congratulate him for his win in the New York City mayoral race.\n\nSchumer said the two had a “very, very good conversation.”\n\n“We said that we cared about New York City and that we look forward to working together to help the city and improve the city,” Schumer said at a press conference at the U.S. Capitol, where he touted Democrats wins in Tuesday's elections as a reason Republicans should try to negotiate to end the government shutdown.\n\nNeither Schumer, New York's senior senator, nor Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand endorsed Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in the election. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, defeated former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing the party primary.\n\n'And so it begins!' Trump reacts to Democratic sweep\n\nMamdani’s message on affordability is one that resonated with Democrats across the country, Schumer said.\n\n“The issue that he has stressed is being stressed by Democrats across the country, from one end of America to the other, the high costs that the Trump administration is imposing on us and their failure to do anything about it,” Schumer said.\n\n--Rebecca Morin\n\nMamdani says Cuomo didn't call to concede\n\nAfter networks declared Zohran Mamdani the winner against Andrew Cuomo on Nov. 4, the two gave their respective victory and concession speeches on election night. But Mamdani, the Democratic nominee who won with record turnout, never received a concession call from Cuomo, the former Democratic governor, according to Dora Pekec, Mamdani’s spokesperson.\n\nPolitico first reported that Cuomo had skipped the traditional courtesy that defines American politics. Mamdani has two phones and no call came from either, Pekec confirmed in a text message in the early hours of Nov. 5.\n\nHours later, Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo’s spokesperson, didn’t dispute the Mamdani campaign. “I’ll let their respective speeches be the measuring stick for grace and leave it at that,” Azzopardi said in a statement.\n\nCurrent Mayor Eric Adams, who endorsed Cuomo, posted a short video on election night congratulating Mamdani as mayor-elect. Adams outlined plans for the transition, and sought to ease concerns for voters who opposed Mamdani. Adams hasn't reached out to Mamdani yet, Pekec said.\n\nIn the evening, Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for Adams, said the mayor had sent a text message to Mamdani.\n\n-- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nIn military and federal worker-heavy Virginia, Spanberger's message hits home\n\nDemocrat Spanberger clinched victory as Virginia's next governor after she ran a campaign decrying the ongoing government shutdown and President Donald Trump's layoffs of federal workers.\n\nIt was a winning message in Virginia, which is among the states with the most military members and federal workers in the country.\n\nMilitary families in the state's Hampton Roads area, home to Naval Station Norfolk, the nation's largest naval base, told USA TODAY last month that they have been mired in stress and uncertainty since the shutdown began. Active duty servicemembers have received their last two checks after the Pentagon moved money between accounts at the last minute to pay them.\n\nBut many government workers in the area are furloughed, while those whose jobs are deemed essential to national security are forced to work without pay.\n\n\"It's out of my control,\" Kevin Henderson, one such worker, said in mid-October.\n\n-Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHouse Speaker says to not ‘read too much into’ Tuesday election results\n\nThe morning after Democrats’ sweeping wins in key elections in Virginia, New Jersey, California and New York, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Americans shouldn’t “read too much into” Tuesday night’s election results.\n\n“What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue,” Johnson said at his daily press conference at the U.S. Capitol. “We all saw that coming, and no one should read too much into last night's election results. Off year, elections are not indicative of what's to come.”\n\nJohnson specifically criticized Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist who won the New York City mayoral race. He said that Mamdani is a bellwether in how House Democrats, some of whom represent more moderate districts than New York City, “have embraced him with open arms.”\n\nGoing into the 2026 midterm election, Johnson said Republicans are going to be “bullish” on their record.\n\n“The midterm is going to be a great one for us,” he said. “We had a demographic shift in 2024. We have a very favorable election map on the Republican side, and it will be even more favorable once all the redistricting stuff has settled out. We have Democrats who are flailing. They have no leader. Their national leader now, as we noted, is Mamdani. He's a communist.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nMamdani taps five women to lead his transition team\n\nNew York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced five people for a transition team Wednesday morning that includes leaders in government and nonprofits. All were women.\n\nElana Leopold, one of Mamdani’s top campaign advisors, will be the executive director of the transition team.\n\nHe also announced four co-chairs:\n\nLina Khan, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission\n\nMaria Torres-Springer, former first deputy mayor\n\nGrace Bonilla, the head of the United Way of New York City\n\nMelanie Hartzog, former deputy mayor for health and human services\n\n− Erin Mansfield\n\nADL says it will create a 'Mamdani Monitor'\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League greeted Zohran Mamdani’s election as New York City mayor with pledges to monitor his administration closely to ensure that it does not create a hostile environment for the Jewish community\n\n“I've already gotten so many calls from Jewish New Yorkers who are concerned. And I'm here to tell you: if you are a Jewish New Yorker, @ADL has your back,” ADL chief executive officer Jonathan Greenblatt said in an X post on Nov. 5. “We will hold the Mayor-elect and his administration accountable.”\n\nMamdani has decried intolerance against people of all faiths, backgrounds and religions, and has sought to find commonality with the Jewish community. He’s met with Jewish leaders, courted Hassidic voters in Yiddish and attended Rosh Hashanah celebrations.\n\nGreenblatt, who made similar remarks on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, said Mamdani “campaigned on policies that could create a hostile environment for the Jewish community. He’s literally told us that he is going to pursue these policies. We are doubling down now because we believe him.”\n\nTo that end, Greenblatt said, the ADL was launching an “NYC Antisemitism Tipline” to report incidents in the city, “including on the streets, in schools, in their workplace.”\n\nAnd the group was establishing a “Mamdani Monitor” that Greenblatt said would become “a public-facing tracker monitoring policies, appointments and actions by the Mamdani Administration that impact Jewish community safety and security.”\n\n“The only path forward is one that recognizes that Jewish safety and rights require a strong, inclusive city and democracy where all are protected – and that a strong, inclusive New York City and democracy are not possible without real Jewish safety and security,” Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the separate Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement.\n\n--Josh Meyer\n\nMTG says politicians need to deliver\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia who often calls out her own party, appeared to put the blame at the feet of Republicans for not winning major elections Tuesday night.\n\n“Politics is no different from business,” she wrote on social media. “Business 101: If you don’t deliver what you promise, then don’t expect repeat customers.”\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nBernie Sanders, AOC celebrate Mamdani’s win\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, two self-described democratic socialists who campaigned for Mamdani, praised his election.\n\n“Starting at 1% in the polls, @ZohranKMamdani pulled off one of the great political upsets in modern American history,” Sanders, who grew up in Brooklyn, wrote on social media. “Yes. We CAN create a government that represents working people and not the 1%.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who represents part of The Bronx and Queens, simply posted an emoji of the Statue of Liberty.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nTrump ‘honored’ to be called factor in election\n\nTrump wasn’t on the ballot Nov. 4 but he told Senate Republicans he was “honored” that analysts called him a factor in state and local elections where Democrats won key races in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City, and a ballot initiative in California.\n\nIn Virginia, Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger became the state’s first female governor by defeating Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. In New Jersey, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill beat Republican Jack Ciattarelli for governor.\n\nAnd in New York City, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the mayor’s race against former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n\nTrump had urged voters to support Cuomo, and he held telephone rallies with supporters in New Jersey and Virginia to support Republicans in those states. But each of the winners campaigned against Trump’s policies and his influence on their jurisdictions.\n\n\"The shutdown was a big factor – negative – for the Republicans,” Trump said at a White House breakfast with Senate Republicans. “And they say that I wasn't on the ballot was the biggest factor. I don't know about that but I was honored that they said that.\"\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nCongressional Democrats ‘demand’ shutdown meeting with Trump\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders wrote Trump a letter Nov. 5 demanding a bipartisan meeting to negotiate an end to the government shutdown.\n\nTrump told Senate Republicans at a White House breakfast that the shutdown should end immediately. But most Senate Democrats have blocked approval of a short-term funding bill by arguing for greater spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that the GOP opposes.\n\n“We must get the government back open soon, and really immediately.,” Trump said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York,\n\n“We write to demand a bipartisan meeting of legislative leaders to end the GOP shutdown of the federal government and decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis,” the lawmakers wrote. “Democrats stand ready to meet with you face to face, anytime and anyplace.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nCalifornia hands major redistricting win to Democrats\n\nCalifornia voters delivered a rebuke to President Donald Trump by passing Proposition 50, an amendment backed by Gov. Gavin Newsome that would let the state's Democratic lawmakers redraw its district lines to increase their political power.\n\nNewsom has said the move would cancel out five new red districts created in Texas earlier this year after Trump pushed the state to redistrict in favor of Republicans. States are rushing to redistrict ahead of the midterm elections, which will decide whether Trump keeps the current Republican majority or faces a Democrat-led Congress that would impede his agenda.\n\n-Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhy did Democrats win big? Affordability, Jeffries says\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, on Wednesday morning said the message that resonated most with voters in the 2025: “Affordability.”\n\nDuring an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Jeffries said Democrats saw a sweep in races like the Virginia and New Jersey governor races, as well as the mayoral race in New York, because of the message of bringing down prices.\n\nDemocrat Abigail Spanberger, who won in Virginia, and Democrat Mikie Sherrill, who won in New Jersey, both ran as moderate Democrats. Zohran Mamdani, the winner of the New York City mayoral race, is a democratic socialist. But their message on driving down high costs is what resonated with voters in Tuesday’s election.\n\n“That’s the connective tissue that we’ve seen all across the country,” Jeffries said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nSherrill takes home New Jersey governor in another anti-Trump Democrat victory\n\nIn New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the race for governor, notching another blue victory on Election Night.\n\nLike Democrat Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, Sherrill ran a middle-of-the-road campaign that capitalized on Democrats' anger at President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Here in New Jersey, we know that this nation has not ever been, nor will it ever be ruled by kings,\" she said in her victory speech, in a nod to the \"No Kings\" protests against Trump.\n\nA former congressmember, Sherrill leaned into her military service as a Navy pilot. Ciattarelli, a Trump ally, had tried to call into question her military record.\n\n-Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nSpanberger will take over from Youngkin as Virginia governor in key Democrat win\n\nDemocrat Abigail Spanberger defeated Winsome Earle-Sears, her Republican opponent, in the Virginia governor race, a victory for Democrats buoyed by opposition to President Donald Trump in a state bordering the nation's capital.\n\nSpanberger was declared the winner soon after polls closed with 57.5% of the vote to Earle-Sears' 42.3%. She will take over from Glenn Youngkin, a key Republican governor.\n\nSpanberger, a former CIA officer and member of Congress, ran as a centrist and leaned into the impact of the shutdown and Trump's layoffs on Virginia's heavy population of federal workers.\n\nEarle-Sears, currently serving as the state's lieutenant governor, was glaringly left out of Trump's endorsements of Republican candidates.\n\n-Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nZohran Mamdani cruises to victory in intensely watched NYC mayoral race\n\nZohran Mamdani cruised to victory as New York mayor in an election that drew intense national attention.\n\n\"We are breathing in the air of a city that has been reborn,\" Mamdani told a packed crowd in his victory speech.\n\nMamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic Socialist who will be New York's first Muslim and youngest mayor, ran an affordability-focused campaign that electrified the city's young people. He defeated Andrew Cuomo, the scandal-ridden former governor of New York, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, a talk show host.\n\nThe race was called for Mamdani on Election Night as he took home 50.4% of the vote to Cuomo's 41.6% and Sliwa's 7.1%. It saw a record number of voters turn out - more than 2 million, the most for a New York mayoral race in more than half a century.\n\n--Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nTrump to host Republican senators, give remarks at morning breakfast\n\nTrump is set to deliver remarks to Senate Republicans at the White House during a Wednesday morning breakfast as the federal government shutdown becomes the longest in U.S. history at 36 days.\n\nTrump is scheduled to address Republicans at 8:30 a.m. ET, according to a schedule released by the White House.\n\nIt comes as the president has urged Republicans to break the 60-vote hurdle in the Senate known as the filibuster in order to reopen the government. That would allow for a simple majority to pass a Republican-backed spending resolution.\n\nTrump’s efforts, however, have been met by resistance from some Republican senators, including Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, who said Tuesday \"the votes aren’t there\" to get rid of the filibuster.\n\nRebuking Trump, California passes Prop 50 to redistrict in Democrats' favor\n\nCalifornia voters have passed Proposition 50, helping Democrats in the redistricting frenzy that will likely decide who controls the House in the final two years of Trump's second term.\n\nProp. 50 is a constitutional amendment allowing the state to temporarily stop using a nonpartisan commission to draw congressional district boundaries. Instead, leaders could use lines drawn by Democratic state lawmakers to increase the seats they hold in Congress. After the 2030 U.S. Census, the nonpartisan commission will resume drawing the lines.\n\nThe measure is one of the most important issues being decided on Election Day. It essentially negates the five new Republican-leaning congressional districts Texas created earlier this year at Trump's urging. At least a dozen states have changed their boundary lines or are in the process of doing so before the 2026 midterms.\n\n– Sarah D. Wire\n\n‘Plenty of work to do,’ Barack Obama says\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who campaigned over the weekend for Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia, congratulated Tuesday night's victors.\n\nHe called the results “a reminder that when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win,” in a post on X.\n\n“We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” Obama wrote.\n\nSpanberger blasts 'chaos coming out of Washington'\n\nTrump’s targeting of the federal workforce loomed over the Virginia governor’s race, with Spanberger vowing again in her victory speech to protect the state’s jobs and “stand up to anyone who tries to harm our economy or the livelihoods of our Virginians.”\n\nTrump slashed federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency, and the government shutdown has also rocked federal workers. Spanberger campaigned on the issue, and her victory could indicate growing backlash to Trump’s policies.\n\nSpanberger slammed “those across the Potomac who are attacking our jobs” and vowed not to “stand by silently while you attack Virginia’s workers.”\n\n“I will always stand up for Virginia workers… and right now our federal workforce is under attack and the chaos coming out of Washington is killing Virginia jobs and creating economic uncertainty for tens of thousands of families,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/communities/2022/03/14/margo-bartlett-just-thinking-column-minor-distraction-sometimes-needed-major-way-khrushchev/7041465001/", "title": "Just Thinking: Minor distraction sometimes needed in major way", "text": "Margo Bartlett\n\nColumnist\n\nThis will date me, but everything dates me.\n\nThe fact that I remember Emilio Delgado as a young Luis on “Sesame Street” dates me. That I was there when hand-held calculators, answering machines and microwave ovens all were greeted like the coming of the latest iPhone dates me. References to Ferrante & Teicher date me.\n\nWhat else dates me? My memories of growing up when Nikita Khrushchev was shaking his fist and threatening to bury me. Not me personally, but it felt like me. I’d sit on a playground swing and imagine Khrushchev standing on the asphalt in front of me. I’d tell him all the reasons he shouldn’t want to bomb the world, and he would concede that my arguments were sound. It would be so simple, once a 7-year-old girl in Ohio explained it all.\n\nI haven’t entered into peace talks with global oppressors for decades, but having reason to wish someone would is discouraging.\n\nThe world, it seems, is divided into two kinds of people: those who want to grow up, make friends, find interesting work, read books, sleep in, explore a little and eat ice cream and those who want power, preferably all of it. At any moment in time, billions of people are in the first group, and only a handful are in the second, but somehow, those few people always are the ones with their hands on the worst weapons.\n\nThat left me to reason with a tyrant of a no-longer-existent country, and it recently inspired a little girl named Iris, from Ireland, to write a note to the people of Ukraine. “I’m realy (sic) sorry about the war,” the note said. “I hope most of you survive.” She enclosed six coins and added, “Get better soon.”\n\nJust Thinking: First road race remains humbling memory\n\nI saw this note on the internet, the same place a person can find stories swearing that Russia is merely conducting a military training exercise, so I can’t promise that it’s genuine. I’m inclined to believe Iris and her letter are real, though, given my own conversations with Khrushchev during the famous Playground Accord of Northeastern Ohio. Not that I really can call them conversations. Nikita, as I remember, never came up with anything to say in his own defense. Some arguments are that persuasive.\n\nAs an adult – as a dated adult – looking back on my own diplomatic efforts and considering Iris’ desire to do something in the face of violence, I understand the impulse to write a note to the Ukrainians. I’d also write to Haitians, Syrians, Afghanis, all the people whose struggles are more life and death than complaints about supply-chain issues. Not that I haven’t done my own share of flouncing and pouting when my favorite chocolate milk isn’t waiting in a cooler for me to buy it. Other chocolate milk (here I might stamp my foot) just isn’t the same.\n\nAlso, I’m no more an expert on global relations than I am on anything else. I’m an expert in useless facts and, occasionally, spelling. And when I say “useless facts,” I mean facts so arcane they are never the correct response on Jeopardy! They don’t save the day when all else is lost. And unlike algebra, they never turn out to be something I use in real life after all. Unlike knowing how to perform an emergency tracheotomy or what to do when your car slides on ice, my areas of expertise are like the appendix I lost when I was 18: nonexistent.\n\nNevertheless, the urge to do something – write a letter, lecture a bully, sit on a swing and list the reasons peace is preferable to war or hold somebody’s hand – persists. Unfortunately, here we are, and all I can think to offer is this: I saw Ferrante & Teicher in concert years ago. The most interesting part about the experience was the person I was with: my dentist, who sneaked peanuts from his suitcoat pocket all evening while I, in turn, sneaked sidelong looks at him. It was like listening to piano music at a circus.\n\nSo this random memory is serving as a minor distraction today.

Josh Shapiro and rejected a GOP push to oust the trio in what has traditionally been a nonpartisan contest.\n\nJustices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht, who were elected as Democrats a decade ago to the commonwealth's highest court, won their retention elections Tuesday according to the Associated Press and NBC News. That's despite efforts to force an open judicial election for their seats in 2027. Shapiro, who is considered a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, urged voters to keep the three judges.\n\nVoters were asked Tuesday simply whether or not to retain the justices -- not to choose between them and a challenger. Pennsylvania elects judges to its supreme, superior and commonwealth courts first in a partisan election. However, retention elections are nonpartisan, meaning a justice's political affiliation is not included on official election materials, including the ballot itself.\n\nOnly one time has a state Supreme Court justice lost their retention election.\n\n– Matthew Rink\n\nCalifornia GOP Chair knocks Prop 50\n\nThe head of California's Republican Party said state GOP voters will be severely impacted if Prop 50 passes as anticipated.\n\n\"I think it's a shame,\" California Republican Party Chairwoman Corrin Rankin told KGO-TV on Election Day. \"I think that under no circumstance should any voter in California be disenfranchised while they have maps being drawn behind closed doors at the State Capitol by one or two persons.\"\n\nAccording to a recent poll by the University of California, Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, about six out of 10 likely voters support Prop. 50.

He offered unabashedly left-leaning proposals including a rent freeze on rent-stabilized units, free buses and universal child care, paid for by levying taxes on the city’s wealthiest. Several of the city's billionaires donated millions of dollars to launch attack ads against him.\n\nSchumer: Election results a 'repudiation' of Trump\n\nTuesday's election results, which so far have brought sweeping victories for Democrats, represent a \"repudiation of the Trump agenda,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said.\n\n\"If Republicans want to keep blindly following Donald Trump into the abyss of chaos, let them. The rest of America is moving forward,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe comments came amid signs that Schumer is dealing with new restlessness among moderate Senate Democrats, many of whom have grown increasingly eager to work with their Republican counterparts to end the ongoing government shutdown.\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nSpanberger blasts 'chaos coming out of Washington'\n\nTrump’s targeting of the federal workforce loomed over the Virginia governor’s race, with Spanberger vowing again in her victory speech to protect the state’s jobs and “stand up to anyone who tries to harm our economy or the livelihoods of our Virginians.”\n\nTrump slashed federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency, and the government shutdown has also rocked federal workers. Spanberger campaigned on the issue, and her victory could indicate growing backlash to Trump’s policies.\n\nSpanberger slammed “those across the Potomac who are attacking our jobs” and vowed not to “stand by silently while you attack Virginia’s workers.”\n\n“I will always stand up for Virginia workers… and right now our federal workforce is under attack and the chaos coming out of Washington is killing Virginia jobs and creating economic uncertainty for tens of thousands of families,” she said.\n\nElection results maps and analysis: Democrats sweep 2025 races in NYC, Virginia, New Jersey, California\n\nDetroit elects Mary Sheffield as next mayor, making history as first woman to lead city\n\nDetroit City Council President Mary Sheffield made history Tuesday night, Nov. 4, according to the Associated Press and CNN, becoming the city's first woman mayor in an election she led from start to finish.\n\nSheffield defeated the Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr., pastor of Triumph Church, celebrating Tuesday night with hundreds of friends, family and supporters at a glitzy event at MGM Grand Detroit.\n\nThe 12-year city council veteran was the first mayoral candidate to form a committee in the race — two years before the election — to succeed Mayor Mike Duggan, who is opting to run for governor as an independent rather than seek a fourth term. She cruised to victory in the August primary, collecting 51% of the vote to Kinloch's 17% in a crowded nine-way contest.\n\n– Violet Ikonomova, Dana Afana, M.L. Erick\n\n'I’m working on it': Spanberger chides daughter for dirty room in victory speech\n\nIn a lighthearted moment during her victory speech, Spanberger, a mother of three, scolded one of her daughters for not cleaning her room while thanking her family for their support.\n\nExasperated, her daughter responded back, \"I’m working on it.\"\n\nSpanberger went on to acknowledge the history-making nature of her win. She is the first woman elected to lead Virginia in the state’s 236-year history.\n\nAfter she won, Spanberger said her husband told her children their mother was going to be governor. \"I can guarantee those words have never been spoken in Virginia before,\" she joked.\n\n\"It’s a big deal,\" she said. \"The history Virginia is making tonight is yours.\"\n\nVirginia chose ‘pragmatism,’ Spanberger says\n\nSpanberger, dressed in a dark red suit, strolled onto the stage at her victory party in Richmond, Virginia, Tuesday night to chants of \"Abby\" from the crowd.\n\nSpanberger, known as a centrist Democrat, leaned into her middle-of-the-road brand of politics in her victory speech and said the state had \"turned a page\" from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.\n\n\"Tonight, we sent a message,\" Spanberger said. \"We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship. We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.\"\n\nAtlanta reelects Democratic Mayor Andre Dickens\n\nMayor Andre Dickens has won his bid to lead Atlanta for another four years, reports say, following the city's decades-long tradition of reelecting their mayors for second terms.\n\nDickens, a Democrat and former Atlanta city councilmember, faced three challengers seeking to take his place as the city’s leader. He was elected by a wide majority in 2021 in a runoff election, replacing former mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms after she declined to run for a second term.\n\nAtlanta has long been a stalwart Democratic base in the South, while Georgia has become less reliably Republican in the last few presidential elections. Former President Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020 − the first time Democrats carried the state since 1992 − though it returned to Republicans in Trump's 2024 race.\n\nVP Vance's half brother loses in challenge of Cincinnati's Democratic mayor\n\nVice President JD Vance's half-brother, Republican Cory Bowman, lost his long-shot bid in the nationally watched Cincinnati mayoral race, reports say, falling short against Democratic incumbent Aftab Pureval.\n\nCrime had dominated the headlines and campaign in the southern Ohio local race.\n\nCincinnati leaders faced criticism this summer after several high-profile incidents, including the stabbing of Patrick Heringer in his home.\n\nBowman and Republicans tried to paint the city as overrun with crime. Pureval countered that the city leadership combatted crime through numerous measures, including implementing a stricter curfew and recruiting more officers.\n\n– Scott Wartman\n\nDemocrat Corey O'Connor wins Pittsburgh mayoral race\n\nDemocrat Corey O’Connor is the next mayor of Pittsburgh, reports say, defeating Republican challenger and former city police officer Tony Moreno.\n\nO'Connor is the Allegheny County Controller and a former Pittsburgh city councilor. He's the son of former mayor Bob O'Connor, who died while in office in 2006.\n\nHis win is a possible temperature gage in the city, the second-largest in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, after defeating the sitting Democratic mayor Ed Gainey in the May primary. Gainey is the city’s first Black mayor, and he represents a more progressive wing of the party. His defeat by the more centrist O'Conner has turned the race into a closely watched off-year election as next year's midterms draw closer.\n\nDemocrat Ghazala Hashmi wins historic Virginia lieutenant governor's race\n\nDemocrat Ghazala Hashmi is projected to win the Virginia lieutenant governor's race, becoming the first Muslim women ever elected to statewide office in the country. She defeated Republican John Reid, a conservative talk radio host and founder of the cultural heritage organization The Virginia Council.\n\nHashmi is an educator, who taught as a professor at the University of Richmond and Reynolds Community College. She was first elected to the Virginia Senate in 2019 and became the first Muslim and the first South Asian American in the state legislature.\n\nHashmi moved to the United States from India at age four with her family. She is married and has two adult daughters.\n\nIn Virginia, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor. The post is viewed as a stepping stone to the governor's mansion.\n\nDem groups praise Spanberger win\n\nDemocratic-leaning groups from Planned Parenthood to the gun-safety organization Giffords celebrated Spanberger’s victory in the Virginia governor’s race Tuesday night.\n\nPlanned Parenthood called Spanberger a \"proven champion for reproductive rights\" and said \"Virginians can count on her to protect access to birth control, abortion, fertility treatment, and miscarriage care.\"\n\nAbortion was a major issue for voters in the Virginia governor’s race as the state is set to weigh a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. Spanberger has been a vocal advocate of the amendment.\n\nPolls close in New Jersey at 8 p.m.\n\nPolls closed in New Jersey at 8 p.m. People already in line by the time of closing will still be able to cast a ballot.\n\nSpanberger wins Virginia governor's race\n\nSpanberger defeated Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race, reports say, dealing a blow to the Republican Party ahead of consequential midterm elections next year.\n\nSpanberger’s win is historic: She is the first woman elected to lead Virginia.\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown and Department of Government Efficiency cuts played a central role in the race, given the large population of federal employees in Virginia. Spanberger, 46, campaigned on the discontent of laid-off and furloughed federal workers, and she sought to highlight the economic toll of Trump’s agenda.\n\nPolls close in Virginia at 7 p.m.\n\nPolls are set to close in Virginia at 7 p.m. All voters in line by that time will be able to vote.\n\nImproper signs taken down at northern Virginia polling location\n\nSeveral political signs put up near a polling location in Frederick County have been taken down for not having a disclaimer about the person or organization behind them, an election official told USA TODAY.\n\nA Reddit user included a photo of the signs at the Evendale Elementary School polling location in a thread that had received hundreds of comments by Tuesday afternoon. The photo shows five signs, four of which are white with black font and include the messages \"I am Charlie Kirk,\" \"Democrat Policies Increase Crime,\" \"Democrats Hide Their Culpability With Lies\" and \"Spanberger Wants to Allow Boys in Girls Bathrooms.\"\n\nFrederick County Elections Director Rich Venskoske said his office received complaints about the sign on Tuesday morning, adding that several people expressed that they \"felt intimidated\" by them. He described the signs as \"distasteful\" but said they would have been permitted to remain in place if they had a disclosure.\n\nA sign for Frederick County School Board candidate Patrick North had the proper disclaimer and was not removed, Venskoske said.\n\nWinner of Virginia’s governor’s race set to make history\n\nWhether it’s Democrat Abigail Spanberger or Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, the winner of the Virginia governor’s race tonight will make history as the first woman elected to lead the state.\n\nThe two candidates for lieutenant governor will also make history. If she wins, Democrat Ghazala Hashmi will be the first Muslim woman elected to statewide office in the country. If Republican John Reid wins, he will be the first openly gay member of his party to win statewide office in the nation.\n\nHow do Dems feel about Virginia races? Pretty good, it seems.\n\nDemocrats appear confident about Abigail Spanberger’s chances of winning Virginia’s gubernatorial race, with the latest polls showing her up 10 points over her Republican opponent Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nCase in point: Rather than hitting the campaign trail, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-VA, was spotted at a college basketball game on the eve of the election. Kaine was supporting his alma mater, the University of Missouri, in a basketball game against Howard University in Washington, DC Monday night.\n\nNAACP sues over student voter registration in Virginia\n\nThe NAACP Virginia State Conference filed a lawsuit against election officials across the commonwealth, saying they illegally rejected voter registration applications from on-campus college students.\n\nThe complaint alleges that election officials required on-campus students to provide information including a dormitory name and room number with their voter registration applications.\n\n“This is a clear attempt to rob students of the right to vote in a state where they study and potentially live once they graduate,” NAACP senior associate general counsel Anthony P. Ashton said in a Nov. 3 news release. “Virginia’s own voter registration form does not ask for dorm room information, and federal law makes clear that immaterial omissions cannot be used to deny eligible citizens their right to vote. These practices are discriminatory, unlawful, and must stop immediately.”\n\nThe complaint accuses the plaintiffs of violating students’ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The affected students attend schools including Virginia State University, James Madison University, Norfolk State University and Virginia Commonwealth University, the NAACP said.\n\nTrump claims, without evidence, that there’s election fraud in California\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to sue over mail-in ballots cast in California while also slamming the state’s redistricting measure which aims to increase Democratic representation in the state.\n\nOn his Truth Social site, Trump called the California redistricting ballot measure, designed to counter a Texas effort to increase Republican representation, “a GIANT SCAM” without offering any specifics.\n\nThe California vote on that ballot measure, Trump claimed, “is RIGGED” but he provided no specifics of that either. “All ‘Mail-In’ Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are ‘Shut Out,’ is under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!” Trump wrote.\n\nAt the White House briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also claimed – while providing no details – that election fraud occurs in California.\n\nAsked what evidence Trump had, Leavitt said. “It is absolutely true that there is fraud in Caifornia’s elections. It is just a fact. … If you want to deny that, I’m happy to provide you all of the evidence” after the briefing.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a USA TODAY request for comment about the alleged details of election fraud in California and what kind of “very serious legal and criminal review” Trump was referring to.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nNew Jersey polling sites safe and secure after earlier bomb threats\n\nNew Jersey authorities say all polling sites are safe and secure after multiple locations received bomb threats earlier on Election Day.\n\nLaw enforcement officers were deployed to several sites where voters were casting ballots in response to \"swatting\" incidents - threats found to be non-credible, The Record, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nEight sites in Bergen County received threats in the early hours of the morning. Authorities didn't discover any suspicious items, and there is no remaining threat to the public, but they will stay \"engaged for the rest of Election Day,\" said Jeff Angermeyer, of the county's prosecutor's office.\n\nSome threats were directed at schools serving as local polling sites, forcing some students to stay home.\n\n\"A delayed opening would be too difficult,\" said Mark Schwarz, superintendent of Ridgewood public schools. \"We reluctantly decided to close schools for the day.\"\n\nWill billionaire Tom Steyer's $12 million Prop 50 bet pay off?\n\nWhile the Democratic party probably wasn't so crazy about billionaire Tom Steyer interjecting himself in what his camp describes as a \"non-traditional campaign\" in California's Proposition 50 redistricting race, maybe he brought more than he advertised.\n\nSteyer, the environmental activist and longshot 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spent more than $12 million during his self-promoted \"Stick It to Trump\" Prop 50 campaign. This includes two commercials airing heavily in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Sacramento, the state capital, and across social media.\n\nThe commercials: one features a spoof of President Donald Trump watching the results of Prop 50 passing, throwing french fries, and saying, \"I hate California.\" Another spot has Steyer accusing the president of trying to rig the 2026 midterm elections and bluntly urging California voters to \"let's stick it to Trump!\"\n\nThere were also sponsored rallies led by social media influencers, including supporters placing a smattering of \"Stick it to Trump\" and \"Yes on 50\" stickers over President Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Oct. 30. On Election Day, Trump on his Truth Social platform called Prop 50 a \"GIANT SCAM\" and said the voting itself is \"RIGGED.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a Nov. 3 memo, Steyer's camp believes his \"Stick it to Trump\" campaign supported the work of Governor Gavin Newsom’s Yes on 50 efforts to help \"push Prop 50 over the finish line.\" Prop 50 is a constitutional amendment pushed by Newsom that, if passed, would allow the state to temporarily stop using a nonpartisan commission and use lines drawn by its Democratic state lawmakers, possibly increasing their party's chances of winning more seats in Congress.\n\n\"This should be something for us all to celebrate,\" Steyer spokesperson Kevin Liao told USA TODAY.\n\nAnd Steyer's gamble will likely pay off in a Prop 50 victory on Election Day that could propel him on the list of possible candidates for California governor, said Brian Sobel, a longtime Bay Area-based political analyst.\n\n\"Oh, no question, Steyer will emerge as one of the Prop 50 winners just like Newsom, (Barack) Obama, and the other Democrats who made cameo appearances in those Yes on 50 ads,\" Sobel said. \"Going forward, Steyer may have to tone it down and not come across as a bit unbalanced.\n\n\"But today, Steyer looks like he gets to celebrate spending some of his fortune helping to gain an important victory,\" Sobel concluded.\n\nWhite House calls Mamdani ‘irresponsible’ over bomb-threat allegations\n\nAfter New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani linked Trump to bomb threats at New Jersey polling places, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the candidate “irresponsible.”\n\nMamdani called the bomb threats part of voter intimidation like Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud.\n\n“I think they are completely irresponsible and they are based on zero evidence,” Leavitt told reporters Nov. 4 at the Whtie House.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nEx-US Attorney General Holder backs Maryland's proposed redistricting strategy\n\nFormer US Attorney General Eric Holder said he supports Maryland Governor Wes Moore's decision to create a new advisory commission to consider redistricting in that state.\n\nHolder, who was attorney general under President Obama and is the current chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement on Nov. 4 that getting public feedback and making recommendations to Moore and Maryland's General Assembly to improve the state's congressional map will help ensure fairness.\n\n\"At a time when Donald Trump and his Republican allies show no signs of stopping their relentless campaign to undermine elections and manipulate the rules to cling to power, the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission in Maryland exemplifies the kind of leadership our democracy demands,\" Holder said.\n\nHolder believes the commission would demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability by \"putting power where it belongs—in the hands of the people.\n\n\"It stands in stark contrast to what we’ve seen in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina, and ensures that Maryland can take critical steps forward to ensure that our democracy can responsibly withstand — and overcome — this national gerrymandering crisis,\" Holder added.\n\nLawsuit filed in New Jersey over issues with hundreds of mail-in ballots\n\nNew Jersey Democrats filed a lawsuit in Bergen County over claims its election officials failed to notify voters about issues with their mail-in ballots so they could be addressed and counted, NorthJersey.com reported.\n\nThe emergency application came after the New Jersey Globe reported on Nov. 2 that there were roughly 300 “naked ballots,” or ballots that weren’t placed in an inner envelope, that were in danger of not being counted.\n\nThe Bergen County Board of Elections had a 3-3 party line deadlock in a vote over whether to notify the affected voters, the outlet reported. Democrats voted in favor of notifying voters, while Republicans opposed, citing staffing issues.\n\nThe New Jersey Democratic State Committee’s filing said the board’s failure to take action would “undoubtedly result in the disenfranchisement of approximately 300 voters in Bergen County.”\n\nThe committee asked the court to either order the board to provide a written notice to the affected voters and give them an opportunity to cure their ballots or have the board release the names of affected voters so they could vote on Nov. 4.\n\nMaryland Gov. Moore announces new redistricting\n\nWes Moore, Maryland's Democratic governor, announced a new commission to consider redistricting in the state as Californians consider a Democrat-backed plan to redraw their state's districts.\n\n\"President Donald Trump and his allies are trying to rig the system and are handpicking Republican states to go through redistricting processes,\" Moore said in a video statement released Election Day. \"While other states are determining whether or not they have fair maps, so will Maryland.\"\n\nIt comes as California is voting on a ballot initiative backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that would drastically redistrict the state.\n\nNewsom has pushed the campaign as an offset to President Donald Trump's push to redraw red states' districts in favor of Republicans ahead of the midterms.\n\nHigh turnout being reported in Virginia\n\nChief Election Officer Jason Long of Ward 2 in Staunton said Tuesday morning that voter turnout, so far, had surprisingly been higher than anticipated.\n\n“Turnout here has been a lot higher than anyone expected,” Long said. Of the ward’s roughly 3,800 registered voters, he said 450 had already voted in person by 10:40 a.m.\n\nOne of those voters was Debra Dawson, 29, who was with her daughter, 7-year-old Thea, who goes with her mother every year to vote.\n\n“I voted yesterday at school too,” Thea said.\n\nDawson said Virginia’s race for governor, pitting Republican Winsome Earle-Sears against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, was her main focus on Tuesday.\n\n“The governor race is really important to me,” Dawson said. “But all of them really are. I think voting in any election, big or small, local or wider, is very important.”\n\n– Brad Zinn\n\nJD Vance urges New Jersey voters to pick Ciattarelli after 'crap leadership'\n\nVice President JD Vance urged New Jersey voters to cast their ballot for Republican Jack Ciattarelli for governor on the morning of Election Day, saying the state has \"suffered\" under \"crap leadership.\"\n\n\"Get out there and vote for Jack if you live in NJ,\" he wrote on X. \"New Jersey is such a great state but it’s suffered too long under crap leadership.\"\n\nWhen do polls close in Virginia, New Jersey and California?\n\nPolls close in Virginia at 7 p.m. ET and New Jersey at 8 p.m. ET. California polls close at 8 p.m. PT.\n\nVirginia election results can be found here, while New Jersey's results are here and California's results are here.\n\nTrump looms large on Election Day\n\nThe Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia are making opposition to Donald Trump central to their pitches. In California, an ad urges voters to \"stick it to Trump,\" while New York City's frontrunner for mayor says he'll \"stand up\" to the president of the United States if he wins.\n\nTrump's name is not on the ballot in 2025. He's a lame duck whose political retirement looms in three years. But the off-year races culminating on Tuesday have nonetheless put a spotlight on the 79-year-old Republican.\n\nWhile Trump has largely stayed off the campaign trail – he spent much of the final week before Election Day on a trip to Asia – he's hardly gone dark on politics. He's made New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a frequent target as Republicans try to portray Democrats as too far left.\n\nCiattarelli told the USA TODAY Network that he speaks to Trump every couple of weeks, and the president reupped his endorsement in a recent social media post reminding Garden State voters: \"HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!\"\n\nBomb threat reported at New Jersey polling stations\n\nLaw enforcement is investigating email threats at polling places in Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmo Ocean and Passaic Counties, according to a statement from New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, the USA TODAY NETWORK reported.\n\nSome polling places have since reopened. At polling places that remained closed, voters were sent to other sits to pick up provisional ballots.\n\n“Voters should continue to have confidence that they can cast their ballot without fear of intimidation, and we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure a free, fair, and secure election,” Platkin wrote. “We will not tolerate any attempts to interfere with our elections, and we will swiftly hold accountable anyone who seeks to interfere with the safety or security of our electoral process.”\n\nVirginia election official says there are ‘concerns’ about postal service issues\n\nVirginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said the department has “concerns” about mail-in ballots making it to registrars’ offices around the commonwealth by the Friday deadline.\n\nBeals was responding to a question about the department’s confidence in the U.S. Postal Service during a Tuesday morning news briefing.\n\nShe said the department has worked “very closely” with the postal service in the lead up to the election, calling them “fantastic partners.”\n\n“While we have been very happy with the type of response that they’ve shown us, we do still have concerns and have heard from voters that there are concerns,” Beals said.\n\nShe said voters with concerns about their mail-in ballots could fill out a regular ballot at their polling place or contact their registrar’s office to confirm the status of their ballot.\n\nBeals also noted a polling location change in Newport News, Virginia, after a driver crashed their vehicle into a planned voting location at Ivy Farms Community of Faith Church over the weekend. The building was condemned, and the polling location was moved to South Morrison Family Education Center.\n\nRoughly 1.4 million Virginians had voted early as of Nov. 1, Beals said, with 1.1 million early votes cast in person and 300,000 returned through the mail.\n\nAnother news briefing is scheduled for 8 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nIn Virginia, no problems have been reported, according to the election department.\n\n– BrieAnna Frank\n\nJones and Miyares neck and neck in VA Attorney General race\n\nIn the race for Virginia attorney general, Democrat Jay Jones and Republican Jason Miyares, the incumbent, are neck and neck, according to recent polls.\n\nAn Emerson College/The Hill poll released on Nov. 2 showed Jones up by two points with 49% to Miyares' 47%. Other recent polls have showed the pair tied.\n\nThe election attracted national attention after texts Jones sent in 2022 saying the state's then-House speaker should get \"two bullets to the head\" were revealed. Jones later apologized for the texts, saying he was \"ashamed\" and \"embarrassed\" that he sent them.\n\nSpanberger and Sherrill hope to redefine Democrats\n\nThey both were members of the 2018 freshman class that helped Democrats retake the U.S. House. Both present themselves as kitchen-table centrists with extensive military and national security experience.\n\nAnd the two friends − who text each other regularly and were roommates on Capitol Hill − were even born in each other’s states.\n\nNow, Spanberger and Sherrill, two moderate gubernatorial candidates, are seen by some observers as a model for how Democrats can make a broad electoral appeal, in contrast to the party's socialist nominee for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, who has been a target for President Donald Trump.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey, Katie Sobko\n\nSpanberger sends condolences on ex-Vice President Dick Cheney\n\nAs Virginia voters took to the polls Tuesday morning, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger posted condolences about the passing of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nCheney served as second-in-command under President George W. Bush, but veered from Republican Party leadership following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump. Cheney endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris for president in the 2024 election.\n\n\"My prayers are with the family of Vice President Dick Cheney today — his wife Lynne Cheney, his daughters Liz and Mary, and their families — as they mourn his passing,\" Spanberger posted on X.\n\nPoll: Democrat Sherrill's lead against Republican Ciattarelli within margin of error\n\nA poll released Oct. 30 found the New Jersey race for governor could be growing tighter, with Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill edging 4 points ahead of Republican Jack Ciattarelli less than a week before Election Day.\n\nThe statewide poll from Suffolk University puts Sherrill's support among likely voters at 46%, while Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, stands at 42%, though the difference is still within the survey's margins of error. Another 7% of respondents said they were undecided and 3% refused to respond. Two other candidates on the ballot received 1% of support.\n\nA separate poll released Oct 31 showed Sherrill had a slight lead over Ciattarelli.\n\nThe AtlasIntel poll of more than 1,600 likely voters in New Jersey, which was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 30, showed Sherrill getting 50.2% of the vote compared to Ciattarelli's 49.3%, with a 2% margin of error.\n\nSherrill narrowly ahead, Nate Silver's 'most accurate' poll finds\n\nDemocrat Mikie Sherrill will narrowly eke out a win over Jack Ciattarelli, her Republican opponent, in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, according to a poll considered the \"most accurate\" by election analyst Nate Silver.\n\nAtlasIntel, which was considered the most accurate pollster in the 2020 presidential election, found Sherrill holds 50.2% Ciattarelli's 49.3%, according to a poll released on Oct. 31.\n\nPolling averages have shown Sherrill ahead of Ciattarelli by 4.6 to 6.6 points, still within the margin of error.\n\nPoll: Democrat Spanberger leads in Virginia\n\nA survey released Oct. 23 found Democrat Abigail Spanberger has a nine-point lead over Republican challenger and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor's race, seen as a national bellwether election.\n\nIn a Suffolk University poll of likely voters released Oct. 23, Spanberger garnered 52% of the vote among survey respondents, followed by Earl-Sears' 43%. Another 3% said they were undecided.\n\nEarle-Sears left out of Trump's GOP endorsements\n\nPresident Donald Trump has endorsed the Republican candidates for New Jersey governor and Virginia attorney general - Jack Ciattarelli and Jason Miyares - in glowing terms.\n\nCiattarelli \"IS A WINNER FOR NEW JERSEY,\" Trump wrote in all caps in an Oct. 20 Truth Social post. Miyares \"WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN,\" he wrote in an Oct. 5 post.\n\nNotably absent was Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican running for Virginia governor, who Trump has never endorsed by name.\n\nEarle-Sears provoked Trump's ire when, in 2022, she called Trump a \"liability\" and said \"voters want to move on.\" Trump hit back in a post at the time that he \"Never felt good\" about Earle-Sears. \"Always thought she was a phony.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/04"}]}

Ashley Hinson declared her candidacy, saying \"I'm running to be President Trump's top ally in the United States Senate.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Joni Ernst will not seek a third term in 2026, she announced in a video message, leaving Iowa with its first open Senate race since she won her seat in 2014.\n\n\"After a tremendous amount of prayer and reflection, I will not be seeking reelection in 2026,\" Ernst, a Republican, said in the video message Tuesday, Sept. 2.\n\nSources familiar with Ernst's decision told the Des Moines Register on Aug. 29 that she was not expected to run again, but her video message was the first formal confirmation of her decision.\n\nErnst, now serving her second term, is the first woman elected to Congress from Iowa and the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate.\n\nThe former state senator served in the Iowa Army National Guard for 23 years and retired as a lieutenant colonel.\n\n\"This was no easy decision,\" Ernst said in the video. \"I love my state and country.

She is serving her third term in office after defeating a Democratic incumbent to win her seat in Congress in 2020.\n\n\"Service defines Senator Joni Ernst — from serving her country in uniform to fiercely fighting for Iowans in the U.S. Senate,\" Hinson said. \"Her story — from Red Oak to the Senate — is a powerful example of the American dream. Our country and state are better off because of Joni’s selfless service — I lead a heartfelt thank you from every Iowan.\"\n\nLater in the day, Hinson announced her candidacy for U.S. Senate on WHO Radio, saying, \"I'm running to be President Trump's top ally in the United States Senate.\"\n\n\"My priorities are Iowans' priorities ― I hear them every day,\" Hinson said in a statement. \"Securing our borders and deporting illegal aliens. Keeping men out of girls' sports and returning common sense to classrooms. Defending our farmers and supporting Iowa agriculture. Promoting peace through strength with the strongest and most lethal military in the world. Strengthening Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security for our seniors. And helping young Iowans who are trying to buy a house and start a family.\"\n\nErnst already faced a Republican primary challenge from former state Sen. Jim Carlin, who unsuccessfully ran a primary campaign against U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley in 2022, as well as Joshua Smith.\n\n'Good riddance,' Democrats say of Joni Ernst's plans not to seek reelection\n\nFive Democrats are seeking their party's nomination for U.S. Senate next year: state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris, former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage and former state lawmaker Bob Krause.\n\n“Good riddance,\" Lauren French, a spokesperson for the Senate Majority PAC, said in a statement. \"Joni Ernst came to Washington with empty promises and is leaving having gutted IA Health Link and making it harder for families to afford basic goods. But only after laughing in the face of Iowans living with the very real consequences of her actions.\n\nFrench said the open race in Iowa \"is just the latest example of Democrats expanding the senatorial map.\"\n\n\"The fact remains, regardless of who the GOP nominee is, they are going to have to answer to Iowans hurting because of the deep cuts to health care and nutrition assistance forced upon them by congressional Republicans,\" she said.\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said Ernst dropped out \"because she knows her support for Medicaid cuts is a nonstarter,\" adding that the GOP nominee \"will be saddled with the same toxic Republican agenda that's harming Iowa families.\"\n\n\"The energy is on our side heading into the midterms as Iowans are fed up with Washington Republicans spiking costs for working people to deliver tax cuts for billionaires,\" Hart said. \"In 2026, Iowans will elect a Democrat to the U.S. Senate who will prioritize making Iowa economically prosperous and a healthier state.\"\n\nIowa Republicans praise Joni Ernst's accomplishments in office\n\nErnst is a longtime advocate of trimming government spending, famously pledging to \"make 'em squeal\" in a 2014 campaign ad where she bragged that \"I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork.\" Last fall, she formed the Senate DOGE Caucus, which she chairs and which advocates for spending cuts.\n\nErnst, a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor, helped lead negotations on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, which was signed into law in 2022.\n\nAnd earlier this year, she was able to include an amendment in the Laken Riley Act known as \"Sarah's Law\" in memory of Council Bluffs woman Sarah Root, who was killed in 2016. The law requires the detention of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes that result in death or serious bodily injury.\n\nRepublican Party of Iowa Chair Jeff Kaufmann called Ernst \"a dedicated public servant.\"\n\n\"From the start, Joni set out to make Washington squeal, and she delivered,\" Kaufmann said in a statement. \"Her work to cut government waste, stop the abuse of taxpayer dollars, protect Iowa’s farms and small businesses and pass Sarah’s Law has left a lasting impact. Iowa is better off because of Senator Ernst’s leadership, and we are confident the next generation of Republican leaders will continue building on her incredible legacy.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa's senior senator, said \"it has been an honor\" to serve with Ernst in the Senate.\n\n\"As the Senate’s first female combat veteran and Iowa’s first woman elected to Congress, she broke barriers at every turn and accomplished what she set out to do: 'MAKE ‘EM SQUEAL,'\" Grassley said in a statement. \"After a long career in the Iowa National Guard as well as elected office, Joni has served our country and state with pride and distinction. Barbara and I wish her well and know that whatever she chooses to do in her next chapter, they will be lucky to have this outstanding leader on the team. I will miss serving with Joni but know she will enjoy having more time to cherish her favorite role, as a mother and grandmother.\"\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds thanked Ernst \"for your unwavering commitment to serving our state.\n\n\"It has been an incredible honor to work alongside you, and we are so grateful for everything you have accomplished for Iowans,\" Reynolds wrote on social media. \"Kevin and I wish you and your family the best in this next chapter of your lives.\"\n\nAttorney General Brenna Bird called Ernst \"a tireless advocate not only for the state of Iowa, but for all Americans.\"\n\n\"She has fought to keep our country safe, to protect the lives of the unborn, and to ensure our hard-earned money is spent wisely,\" Bird said on social media. \"I'm grateful for her work and her friendship. She has left an indelible mark on D.C., and I wish her the very best in her next venture.\"\n\nAgriculture Secretary Mike Naig called Ernst \"a strong voice for our farmers, rural communities and all who call this state home.\"\n\n\"From expanding markets for biofuels to championing rural small businesses and fighting burdensome federal regulations, she has never stopped working to make sure Iowa’s values and priorities are heard in Washington,\" he said in a statement. \"While I’m sad to see her step away, I’m grateful for her service, her leadership and her friendship, and I wish her the very best in her next chapter.\"\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

Joni Ernst will not seek reelection in 2026, according to two people familiar with her decision, setting off a major upheaval in one of Iowa's marquee midterm contests.\n\nSpeculation has swirled for months around Ernst's intentions as the senator delayed announcing a formal reelection campaign, despite hiring a campaign manager in June and scheduling her annual Roast and Ride fundraiser for October.\n\nErnst's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's the second time Iowa's political landscape has been upended by a retirement this year, after Gov. Kim Reynolds announced in April that she would not seek another term as governor.\n\nErnst was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014 and is serving her second term. She is the first woman elected to Congress from Iowa and the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate.\n\nThe former state senator served in the Iowa Army National Guard for 23 years and retired as a lieutenant colonel.\n\nErnst is a longtime advocate of reining in government spending, pledging to \"make 'em squeal\" in a 2014 campaign ad. Last fall, she formed the Senate DOGE Caucus, which she chairs and which advocates for spending cuts.\n\nErnst, a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor, helped lead negotations on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, which was signed into law in 2022.\n\nAnd earlier this year, she was able to include an amendment in the Laken Riley Act known as \"Sarah's Law\" in memory of Council Bluffs woman Sarah Root, who was killed in 2016. The law requires the detention of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes that result in death or serious bodily injury.\n\nIn the Senate, she sits on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Agriculture Committee and Armed Services Committee and chairs the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.\n\nShe won her first term in 2014 by more than 8 percentage points and secured reelection in 2020 by 6 percentage points.\n\nWhen first seeking the office in 2014, she promised to serve just two terms in the Senate — a pledge that both Republican and Democratic challengers have sought to use against her this year as she moved toward running for a third term.\n\nUS Rep. Ashley Hinson expected to run for Senate, source says\n\nErnst already faced a Republican primary challenge from former state Sen. Jim Carlin, who unsuccessfully ran a primary campaign against U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley in 2022, as well as Joshua Smith.\n\nBut her announcement is almost certain to spur higher-profile Republicans to enter the race.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican who represents Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, has been seen as a possible Senate candidate if Ernst chose not to run, and one of the sources said Hinson is expected to run in Ernst's place.\n\nHinson raised $854,000 in the most recent fundraising quarter, more than the $723,000 that Ernst brought in.\n\nHinson's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nErnst has endured national scrutiny over comments she made at a May 30 town hall, saying, \"well, we all are going to die,\" after a constituent shouted that people would die because of Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump's \"One Big, Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThe next day, after facing backlash, Ernst shared a sarcastic apology video that she filmed while walking through a cemetery.\n\nThe GOP senator also received criticism from the right earlier this year after raising concerns about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth while considering whether to support him for the job. She eventually voted to confirm him.\n\nAnd some Iowa conservatives have not forgiven Ernst for her vote in favor of the Respect for Marriage Act in 2022, which protected same-sex marriage by guaranteeing federal recognition of any marriage between two people if the union was valid in the state where they wed.\n\nSeveral Iowa Republican county parties voted to censure Ernst over the vote in 2022. At the time, Ernst said she stood by her vote and that the law \"improved religious liberty protections.\"\n\nOn Friday, Carlin announced the endorsement of state Sen. Sandy Salmon, who criticized Ernst for her vote.\n\n\"Sen. Carlin would not have voted for the 'Dis'-Respect for Marriage Act, which strengthened LGBT confusion as Sen. Ernst did,\" Salmon said in a statement announcing her endorsement.\n\nDemocrats pounce on news that Ernst isn't expected to run again\n\nFour Democrats are seeking their party's nomination for U.S. Senate next year: state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage.\n\nThe Democrats were quick to seize on the news that Ernst is not expected to run again.\n\n\"Whether it's Joni Ernst or someone else, they'll have to answer for supporting cutting Iowans' health care in favor of a tax break for billionaires,\" Turek wrote on social media. \"When I'm in the Senate, I'll never forget about Iowa.\"\n\nNorris said in a statement that \"Joni Ernst is seeing the writing on the wall that Iowans are ready for change.\"\n\n\"I’m a military mom on a mission with a record of bucking the status quo to get results for Iowa kids and families,\" she said. \"I'm ready to defeat any Republican to ensure Iowa has a leader in the Senate who will make sure Iowa families have a fair shot to get ahead with stronger public schools, affordable and accessible health care and an economy that works for everyone.\"\n\nWahls, in a statement, said \"Joni Ernst is retiring because she knows our campaign is on track to win.\"\"Our campaign was the strongest to take on Ernst, and I will take on any other politician who embraces the same corrupt agenda of the Washington establishment that screws over Iowans in favor of big corporations, billionaires and self-serving and cowardly politicians,\" he said.\n\nSage said \"we just got some great breaking news\" and said Ernst not running \"makes this seat more attainable for us now.\"\n\n\"Obviously, she didn't want to go against a pissed-off veteran, she didn't want to go against a pissed-off, working-class individual like myself,\" he said in a fundraising pitch to supporters.\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart criticized Ernst's record in a statement.\n\n\"Joni Ernst is retiring because she knows that Iowans are furious at her and Washington Republicans for threatening our health care and spiking costs for families,\" Hart said. \"No matter which Republican runs for this seat, they can’t hide from the harm the GOP has caused to working families across Iowa. Iowans continue to show that they are ready for change, and we will be working overtime to elect a Democrat to represent us in the Senate in 2026.\"\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/04/brenda-lawrence-will-not-run-for-reelection/9097717002/", "title": "Brenda Lawrence, Michigan's only Black member of US House, won ...", "text": "U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Southfield, announced Tuesday night she will not be running for reelection this year, meaning Michigan will lose its only current Black member of Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement released Wednesday: \"Over her four terms in the House, Congresswoman Lawrence has been a force for equality and justice for all. ... She has long fought to lift up working women and communities of color — from better maternal health care, to more apprenticeship opportunities, to action on gun violence and more.\"\n\nAn initial statement sent out by Lawrence's office on Tuesday night did not explain her decision not to run for a fifth two-year term to the U.S. House. On Wednesday, she clarified that she was leaving to spend more time at home.\n\n\"This is the right time to turn the page and spend more time with my family — my husband, daughter, son and granddaughter — and put them first,\" she said.\n\nIt had been widely speculated that Lawrence was dissatisfied with the new redistricting process, which in final maps released late last month connected her home base of Southfield and the west side of Detroit with Dearborn, Westland and other parts of western Wayne County she has not represented.\n\nOn Wednesday, she said her decision was not motivated by those changes.\n\n\"Redistricting was not a factor in my decision,\" she said. \"While it would have been a challenging race, I'm confident I would have been reelected.\"\n\nAlso on Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, announced she would run in that new district. Even though Tlaib lives in another part of Detroit, the new district connects much of the area she currently represents with Dearborn and Southfield.\n\nFirst elected to Congress in 2014, Lawrence represents a district that until now has connected Southfield and other parts of southeastern Oakland County with the east side of Detroit, downtown, Hamtramck and the Grosse Pointes.\n\n\"Today, after reflecting on my journey — and oh my goodness, what a journey — and having conversations with my family, I am announcing that I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,\" Lawrence said. \"I'm incredibly grateful for the people of Michigan's 14th Congressional District who have placed their trust in me — in me, a little Black girl from the east side of Detroit.\"\n\nLawrence, 67, said she will spend the rest of the year fighting to pass voting rights laws and protect women's rights and the environment. A former mayor of Southfield who ran unsuccessfully for Oakland County executive and lieutenant governor, she is the state's only Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nShe becomes the 25th Democratic member of the House to say she is not running for reelection this year. Only 11 Republican members have said they will not run. She is the only member of Michigan's delegation so far to say she is not running, though because of redistricting the state stands to lose at least two more of its current members.\n\nU.S. Reps. Haley Stevens, D-Rochester Hills, and Andy Levin, D-Bloomfield Township, are both running in the same Oakland County-based district; U.S. Reps. Bill Huizenga, R-Holland Township, and Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, are in the same district now in west Michigan and neither says he will move into a new district to run, though Upton has left open the possibility he may retire.\n\nLawrence's allies and others have raised questions about the new district boundaries, which were set by an independent commission and got rid of two majority Black districts currently in the state, the 14th, filled by Lawrence, and the 13th, which is filled by Tlaib. On Monday, some Detroit lawmakers said they plan to file suit against the new maps.\n\nMichigan will lose one congressional seat due to faster population growth in other parts of the country, bringing its total number of seats to 13. As part of the redistricting process, Lawrence's home in Southfield was merged both with parts of Tlaib's district and Dearborn, which is currently represented by U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn.\n\nDingell had already said that she planned to run in a new district anchored around Ann Arbor. Lawrence's decision, along with Tlaib's, is expected to set off a scramble to fill a solidly Democratic seat anchored in downtown Detroit, the Pointes and parts of Downriver.\n\nThere is also no question that Lawrence's departure will underscore concerns by Black voters, particularly in Detroit and its suburbs, that their political strength is being diluted.\n\n\"It is not lost on me that I'm currently the only Black member of the Michigan congressional delegation,\" Lawrence said, echoing those concerns. \"Whether it's in the halls of Congress, city halls, or local school boards, representation matters.\"\n\nDingell called Lawrence's \"commitment to her communities ... second to none.\"\n\n\"Throughout her 30 years in public service, she supported Michigan students while serving on the Southfield Public Schools Board of Education, gathered communities together as mayor of Southfield, and tied her work together as a representative fighting for American jobs and child care, among many other important issues, in Michigan’s 14th District. I’m thankful to have worked with Brenda.\"\n\nTlaib, one of the first two Muslim women in Congress and who is Palestinian American, said it has been an honor to work alongside Lawrence.\n\n\"As a Detroiter, a Michigander and a woman of color in politics, I send my deep gratitude to Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence for her partnership and support,\" Tlaib said. \"Detroit and its surrounding communities have been blessed to be represented by notable, historic and pioneering figures in Congress — Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence will truly go down in history as one.\"\n\nContact Todd Spangler attspangler@freepress.com.

Kim Reynolds says she won't seek reelection to another ...", "text": "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced on social media Friday she will not seek reelection to another term — an unexpected move that resets the state's political landscape ahead of a 2026 midterm election year.\n\n\"Today, I want to share a personal decision with you. One that was not made lightly, but comes with a full heart and a deep sense of gratitude,\" she said in a simple, straight-to-camera video. \"After a lot of thought, prayer and conversations with my family, I have decided that I will not seek re-election in 2026.\"\n\nReynolds, 65, noted in the video that her family has supported her \"through every challenge and every victory.\"\n\n\"Now, it’s time for me to be there for them,\" she said. \"To help them through the next stage of life. To watch every track meet and basketball game; to see them grow before they’re all grown. That doesn’t mean I’m slowing down just yet. I’ll be working hard for you every single day until my term ends.\"\n\nReynolds' husband, Kevin, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2023, although she told reporters in 2024 he was doing well after receiving treatment.\n\nReynolds began her career in public service as a clerk in the Clarke County Treasurer’s Office and then was elected county treasurer.\n\nShe served under Republican Gov. Terry Branstad as his lieutenant governor beginning in 2011, and she succeeded him to the top post in 2017 after he resigned to serve in President Donald Trump's first administration as ambassador to China.\n\nShe became Iowa's first female governor and won election to her first full term in 2018. She was reelected in a landslide victory in 2022.\n\nFrom the archive: Kim Reynolds becomes Iowa's first female governor\n\nKim Reynolds transformed Iowa through tax code, education policy and more\n\nReynolds has overseen transformational change in Iowa during her tenure as governor, reshaping the state’s tax code, education system and executive branch structure.\n\nDuring her time in office, Iowa has gone from an 8.98% top income tax rate down to a 3.8% flat tax that kicked in for all income taxpayers on Jan. 1, giving Iowa the sixth-lowest income tax rate in the country among those that have an income tax.\n\nReynolds has also signed laws eliminating Iowa’s inheritance tax, making retirement income tax-free and cutting corporate and property taxes.\n\nIn all, Reynolds has boasted that the tax cuts she has signed into law will reduce Iowans’ taxes by $24 billion over a decade.\n\nHer changes to Iowa’s education system have been just as significant.\n\nThe centerpiece of Reynolds’ education agenda is a universal “school choice” law that makes every Iowa family eligible for thousands of dollars of taxpayer-funded scholarships to pay for private school expenses. The program will be open to every family, regardless of income, in the coming school year.\n\nReynolds finally signed the law in 2023 after a three-year battle with reluctant House Republicans that saw the governor work to oust several sitting GOP lawmakers by endorsing their primary challengers.\n\nReynolds has worked for years to cut down the size of state government, signing into law a reorganization of the state’s executive branch in 2023 that slashed the number of cabinet-level agencies from 37 to 16, eliminated hundreds of open positions and gave the governor more direct control over executive branch employees.\n\nThe next year, she signed a law eliminating dozens of state boards and commissions.\n\nShe's also made strides in limiting abortion access in the state and removing civil rights protections for transgender Iowans.\n\nReynolds seemed to find her footing as governor through the COVID-19 pandemic. She told the Des Moines Register in a 2023 interview that she emerged both more confident and more willing to stand firm under intense scrutiny and pressure.\n\n“I came out a different governor,” she said. “I really believe that.”\n\nAfter shutting down businesses and schools in the pandemic’s early months, Reynolds was at the forefront as Republican governors around the country pushed to get kids back in the classrooms, ban mask mandates and push back against vaccine mandate.\n\nThe pandemic claimed the lives of more than 10,000 Iowans.\n\nReynolds seemed to reach the peak of her political power following the pandemic and the 2022 elections.\n\nBut she took a risk endorsing a candidate ahead of the 2024 Republican presidential caucuses, putting her thumb on the scale for friend and fellow governor, Ron DeSantis of Florida.\n\nIt earned her the ire of Trump, who called her \"disloyal\" and pledged it would be \"the end of her political career.\"\n\nBut Reynolds endorsed Trump going into the general election, and she has joined him multiple times in Washington, D.C., to celebrate advancing his agenda. Trump has thanked Reynolds for her leadership in the state.\n\nRepublican leaders offer praise for Kim Reynolds after announcement not to seek reelection\n\nImmediately after her announcement, praise for the governor began pouring in from her Republican allies across the state.\n\n“Gov. Reynolds has been a generational leader for our state and party,\" Republican Party of Iowa Chair Jeff Kaufmann said in a statement. \"Under her bold, conservative leadership, Iowa now sits as one of the best states in the entire country. Taxes are low, cash reserves are full, our freedoms defended, and Iowa’s future has never been brighter.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra issued a statement congratulating Reynolds, saying she \"exemplified the endless possibilities of bold, conservative leadership.\"\n\n“Serving with Gov. Reynolds in the state Senate and working with her to pass the largest income tax cut in state history at the time, I saw firsthand her love for Iowa and her devotion to our families and communities,\" he said. \"She quickly became a close friend.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson called Reynolds \"the best governor in America.\"\n\n\"Iowa has been blessed by her leadership, and I have been blessed by her friendship,\" she said. \"The impact she leaves will be immeasurable and countless lives have been made better because of her tireless service. I join every Iowan in saying thank you — we are all grateful for your love of Iowa and your dedication to our state.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Zach Nunn called Reynolds an \"inspiration\" both for his own daughters and \"girls across our state.\"\n\n\"Governor Reynolds led Iowa to prosperity with commonsense, solutions from tax cuts to economic growth,\" he said in a statement. \"She helped me fight human trafficking & fentanyl in Iowa, balance our state’s budget and help make Iowa one of the best places to raise a family.\"\n\nAnd U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks called Reynolds a \"trailblazer.\"\n\n\"Under her leadership, Iowa became one of the best managed states, cutting taxes, shrinking bureaucracy, and creating a national model for efficient and effective government,\" Miller-Meeks said in a statement. \"And Iowa is now one of the best states to retire in.\"\n\nDemocrats look ahead to reset 2026 gubernatorial campaign\n\nDemocrats in the state have been hoping to strongly contest the governor's race in 2026, particularly in a midterm year when national political dynamics have historically favored the party that doesn't control the White House.\n\nOn Friday, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart issued a statement looking forward to the next election cycle.\n\n“Iowa Republicans’ decade in control of state government has left Iowa 49th in economic growth and with a $900 million budget deficit thanks to taxpayer handouts to special interests and vouchers for wealthy families who already send their kids to private schools,\" she said. \"In 2026, voters will get to hold them accountable for taking our state in the wrong direction. It’s time to vote for a governor who will put Iowans to work, lower costs and support our rural areas.”\n\nIowa's lone Democrat elected to statewide office, Auditor Rob Sand, is expected to run make a run for governor though he has made no formal announcement.\n\nSand announced earlier that he had raised more than $8 million during 2024, giving him a formidable war chest that overshadowed even with Reynolds had raised as an incumbent.\n\nBoosted by $7 million in donations from his wife and in-laws, Sand tallied about $8.6 million in receipts between January and December of last year, and he entered 2025 with about $7.5 million in cash on hand.\n\nIn a social media post, Sand wished Reynolds well in retirement.\n\n\"Public office is a demanding path in a way that few truly understand,\" he said. \"I wish Gov. Reynolds and her family well in retirement.\"\n\nIowa House Democratic Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, said in a statement that “Iowans are ready to turn the page on Kim Reynolds’ legacy of division and politics.\"\n\nKonfrst has said she's considering running for Congress in the 3rd Congressional District, which includes Des Moines.\n\n\"After a decade of failed leadership, there’s a reason Reynolds is the least popular governor in America: Iowans are worse off than they were a decade ago,\" she said. \"It’s time for a governor who will build an economy that works for everyone. It’s time for a governor who knows that public money is for public schools. It’s time for a governor who will bring balance and common sense back to Iowa. It’s time for a governor who will put people over politics.”\n\nWhat Republicans will run for governor in Kim Reynolds' place?\n\nRepublican Brad Sherman, a Williamsburg pastor and former state representative, announced in February he would run for governor in 2026, regardless of what Reynolds chose to do.\n\nSherman was an early endorser of Trump ahead of the 2024 GOP presidential caucuses. He was expected to run to the political right of Reynolds on issues such as eminent domain and the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Reynolds' decision to bow out is expected to open the floodgates to a rush of potential Republican contenders who wouldn't have challenged the incumbent Reynolds for the seat.\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a statement congratulating Reynolds and hinting that she would be considering a run herself.\n\n\"In the weeks ahead, Bob and I will pray and consider what this decision means for our future,\" she said in a statement. \"I appreciate the calls of encouragement I've already received. I am committed to continuing my work on behalf of Iowans and to support President Trump as he works to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nFormer Trump campaign advisor Chris LaCivita quickly posted to social media encouraging Bird, a 2024 Trump endorser, to run for governor.\n\nTrump lauded Bird on the night of his 2024 Iowa Caucus win, telling the crowd during his victory speech: \"She's going to be your governor someday.\"\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Brad Ellsworth in Indiana’s 8th congressional district but ultimately decided to stand down. But 2010 looked a lot better for Republicans nationally, and Bucshon declared his intention to challenge Ellsworth.\n\nThen came U.S. Sen. Evan Bayh’s surprise announcement on Feb. 15, 2010 that he would not run for re-election. Coming just four days before the deadline to file for Senate and House seats, the bombshell announcement set in motion an unexpected chain of events.\n\nEllsworth announced on the last day for filing that he would run for Bayh’s seat. The 8th District, in turn, became an open seat for election purposes — and an inviting target. Five GOP candidates already had filed to run. Two more followed.\n\nBacked by national Republican congressional leaders, Bucshon had all the advantages that counted in a GOP primary featuring a whopping eight candidates — but he scraped by his closest competitor, Owen County-based conservative activist Kristi Risk, by a surprisingly close 33-29% margin.\n\nIt had been a race in which only a plurality of votes was needed to win. Like Risk, most of the other Republican candidates were identified with the conservative Tea Party movement. Political analysts later said if just one or two of those candidates had dropped out, Risk — outgunned financially and organizationally by Bucshon — would have won.\n\nThe retirement decision was made at Christmas\n\nBucshon’s announcement that he will retire from Congress didn’t come as late in the game as Bayh’s did 14 years ago — but it did come as a surprise. He had said he intended to run in the 21-county 8th District at least one more time in 2024. The filing period for congressional candidates in Indiana begins Wednesday and ends on February 9.\n\nThe 61-year-old Bucshon, who lives in Evansville when he's in the 8th District, told the Courier & Press he arrived at his decision not to run for an eighth two-year term over the Christmas holiday.\n\n\"Every two years I think about what the right thing to do is, both for the office and for my family, and I came to the conclusion that it's time to move on to the next stage of my life,\" he said. \"I don't know what I'll do next, but I'm going to retire from Congress.\"\n\nWith Monday’s announcement, Bucshon now joins about two dozen House members who are seeking other offices or retiring heading into the 2024 election.\n\nBucshon said early in his congressional career that he envisioned staying perhaps 10 or 12 years.\n\nCongress was never meant to be a lifelong career, he said Monday.\n\n\"People should come and serve for a period of time and then other people should have the opportunity to serve,\" he said. \"I really believe that, and that was part of the decision-making process.\"\n\nWhat is Bucshon's legacy in Congress?\n\nIn Congress, Bucshon has established himself as a subject matter expert in health care and a serious, sober minded — if unspectacular — legislator. He isn’t seen on national news shows at night weighing in on the culture wars that roil politically polarized America.\n\nThe former heart surgeon arrived on Capitol Hill in January 2011 with his sights set on a slot on the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee. The oldest standing legislative committee in the House, Energy and Commerce had developed the controversial health care reform package that roiled the previous year’s mid-term elections.\n\nIt is, in the parlance of Congress, an “A” committee — one of the three most critical and coveted, the others being Appropriations and the tax law-writing Ways and Means. It also has the widest jurisdiction of any congressional committee, including aspects of telecommunications, healthcare, consumer protection, food and drug safety, environmental and energy policy and interstate and foreign commerce. Members deal with a complex web of competing business interests.\n\nBut Bucshon had aimed too high. He had to plod through his first four years on the Hill with less prestigious assignments before the House GOP leadership finally looked his way.\n\nBucshon's legislative profile on Congress.gov speaks to one reason he isn't the go-to congressman on hot-button issues: his issues aren't sexy, using that term in the political sense.\n\nBucshon has advocated forcefully for fixes to the way Medicare pays physicians. On other issues, such as changing a law that ties Medicare payments to value instead of volume, his has been a prominent voice. Along with other members of the House GOP Doctors Caucus, Bucshon last year crafted a discussion draft of a bill intended to ensure more reliable payments for physicians.\n\nBucshon said he wants his legacy in Congress to be that of a member \"who fought for access to quality health care.\"\n\n\"We extended the Medicaid program for pregnant mothers for a full year,\" he said. \"We had a couple of pieces of legislation over the years that took away co-pays for critical things that people might need in health care.\n\n\"So overall, big picture, the work I've done on a lot of things related to health care to increase access and quality of health care for the American people, is probably the biggest thing.\"\n\nBucshon has said he works \"in the weeds\" to effect change in Congress. He acknowledged there is no single splashy, highly publicized piece of legislation bearing his name.\n\n\"But there's a lot of smaller things that I've been involved in over the years that I think have made the system better,\" he said. \"It's not perfect, but I think that's been my focus.\"\n\n'A very serious legislator'\n\nSeveral of Bucshon’s colleagues in Congress — Republicans and Democrats — told the Courier & Press in 2018 that he is a solidly effective member.\n\n“He’s a workhorse, not a show horse,” said Minnesota Republican Tom Emmer, who now serves as U.S. House Majority Whip. “On health care issues, on insurance issues related to health care, Larry is a guy that has some very significant influence behind the closed doors.\n\n“Larry is a guy that people listen to within our (Republican) conference when he talks — because he’s not always talking.”\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan said Bucshon doesn’t preen for the cameras, doesn’t take cheap shots and doesn’t do anything policy-wise that indicates he is anything less than sincere about improving health care.\n\n“Larry cares about this stuff. He takes leadership on issues. We might not vote the same way, but he cares about stuff,” said Dingell, a colleague of Bucshon’s on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nColorado Democratic Congresswoman Diana DeGette teamed up with Bucshon in 2017 to draft the Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act, designed to improve regulatory oversight of diagnostic tests.\n\n\"(Bucshon's) medical background really helps him have some of the substantive information,\" said DeGette, also a member of the subcommittee on health.\n\nDeGette represents a progressive, urban Denver-area district. She called Bucshon \"a very serious legislator.\"\n\n\"He's no-nonsense. He gets it done,\" she said. \"And if he disagrees with you he knows why, and he'll say why, and then you can work through it.\"\n\nBy one measure, Bucshon’s record of legislative achievement has improved as he has built seniority in Congress.\n\nThe 8th District congressman was the 32nd most effective of 222 Republicans who served in the House in 2021-22, according to a “Legislative Effectiveness Score” devised by the Center for Effective Lawmaking. He ranked 149th most effective of 250 Republicans who served in the House in 2015-16. In his first term in 2011-12, he ranked 231st of 245 House Republicans.\n\nThe Center, a partnership between the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University, factors into its formula the importance of legislation offered by members, how many of the bills move forward in the lawmaking process and how far they go.\n\nThe elections haven't been close\n\nBucshon leaves Congress having never lost an election in his Southern and West Central Indiana district. But it wasn’t because no one was willing to take him on.\n\nAlthough he built his power and influence as he went in Congress, Bucshon was dogged by challenges from within his own party in his first four re-election campaigns. The general line of attack from Republican primary election challengers: Bucshon hadn’t distinguished himself as a revolutionary conservative whose actions in Congress could move the needle on issues.\n\n\"He's just part of the ol' gang, the Republican establishment that more or less works hand in glove with the Democrats,\" said Dr. Richard Moss, who challenged Bucshon in 2016 and 2018. \"They come back (to their districts), they make their claims, they make their promises — then they go to Washington and they vote as big government and liberal Republicans.\"\n\nBut Bucshon turned back all the intraparty challenges by substantial margins, defeating one of his primary opponents by 50 percentage points.\n\nThe veteran Republican congressman has solidified his hold on the 8th District by assiduously cultivating a public profile in its 21 counties and by using all the advantages of incumbency. He is helped by the fact that the 8th District's political terrain is favorable for the GOP.\n\nThe district hasn’t changed much as a result of redistricting effected in 2021. In the following year’s election, the 8th District retained Vanderburgh, Warrick, Posey and Gibson counties. Bucshon also had to tend to Orange County, the part of Crawford County that wasn’t already in the district and part of Fountain County. It made no difference politically: Bucshon won 66% of the vote against Democrat Ray McCormick and Libertarian Andrew Horning.\n\nNone of Bucshon’s Democratic challengers has garnered more than 36 percent of the vote against him since former state Rep. Dave Crooks got 43% in 2012. Bucshon beat his 2018 opponent, William Tanoos, by 12 points in Tanoos' home base, Vigo County.\n\nBucshon may not be on the ballot this year, but he won't be absent from the campaign trial. He said he anticipates helping the Republican nominee to succeed him. And no, he won't be endorsing anyone before the May 7 GOP primary election.\n\n\"I would expect a legitimate Democratic candidate to get to an open seat race,\" he said.\n\nWith Bucshon's announcement on Monday, that race begins now.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/texas/state-bureau/2017/12/14/report-farenthold-withdraw-race/951287001/", "title": "U.S. Rep Blake Farenthold says he won't seek re-election", "text": "U.S. Rep.

He said that \"unacceptable behavior has been alleged in those stories.”\n\nMike Bergsma, chairman of the Nueces County Republican Party, told the USA Today Network he was sorry to see Farenthold exit the race.\n\n\"It's a damn shame,\" he said. \"He's been an excellent congressman, and I'm sorry this has happened. One wonders whether anyone could have survived scrutiny that intense.\"\n\nFarenthold, who turned 56 this week, has been under intense fire since it was disclosed that he settled a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former aide with $84,000 in taxpayers’ money. He has said the settlement was a strategic decision to put the matter to rest even though he insists the charges are untrue.\n\nThe U.S. House Ethics Committee is looking into the allegations even though the Office of Congressional Ethics has said the allegations were unfounded.\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio, the leader of the of the National Republican Campaign Committee, said he agrees with Farenthold's decision to leave.\n\n\"Congress must work harder to hold ourselves to a higher standard, which is why the House took action to ensure this body is a safe and constructive workplace for all,\" he said. \"However, there is still more work to be done.”\n\nEditorial: My son is not a f***tard, congressman.\n\nFarenthold's 27th District is considered safe Republican territory but Democrats pounced on the decision, saying the congressman should resign.\n\n\"What he did is unacceptable,\" said state Rep.

Michael Cloud is that kind of leader.”\n\nEditorial: One way for Farenthold to live up to his promises\n\nThen U.S. Rep. Roger Williams announced his support for Bech Bruun, a Corpus Christi native who last week resigned as chairman of the Texas Water Development Board to challenge Farenthold. Williams was the first member of the Texas GOP delegation in Washington to publicly break with the incumbent.\n\n“Bech is exactly the kind of person I would be proud to call a colleague in the United States Congress,” Williams, R-Weatherford, said in a news release distributed by Bruun. “Bech knows what it means to be a good steward of your hard-earned tax dollars.”\n\nAfter reports surfaced that federal funds paid the harassment suit settlement, Farenthold said he would repay the Treasury. As of Thursday, he was still waiting on House lawyers to guide him through such a process and for a bank loan to clear, said Bob Haueter, his chief of staff.\n\nThe deadline for a candidate to withdraw from the March 6 Texas primaries has passed, meaning Farenthold's name will remain on the ballot, a spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State's office said.\n\nThe GOP primary field for the 27th congressional district is crowded.

The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan handicapper, rates 29 Republican-held seats as either toss-ups or leaning or likely Democratic, while just three Democrat-held seats are tossups or lean or likely Republican.\n\nChris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey, said on ABC News that Ryan’s decision was a sign he didn’t think he would be speaker after the election.\n\n\"If you're a betting person, you're betting on the Democrats for the House in the fall,\" Christie said.\n\nRyan was asked on Fox News whether he was \"abandoning his troops.\"\n\n“No, not at all,” he replied, noting he would continue his record pace of fundraising, which saw him raise $11 million from January through March. Since 2017, he transferred $40 million from his campaign account to the political fund that supports GOP candidates around the country.\n\n“I don’t think anybody’s election is going to hinge on whether Paul Ryan is speaker of the House. I think we’re going to have a strong record to run on,” he said.\n\nThat record includes an overhaul of the tax code that Trump signed in December, and a budget agreement to steeply increase military spending that Trump signed in March.\n\nBut the tax changes came after Ryan abandoned his goal of offsetting tax cuts with the elimination of loopholes and deductions so there was no increase in the deficit. He also wanted a tax code so simple most returns could be filed on a postcard.\n\nThe 2012 candidate for vice president on nominee Mitt Romney’s ticket, Ryan criticized Trump during the 2016 election over his racially tinged comments and his crude remarks about women.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ryan denied discomfort with the direction that Trump was taking the Republican Party was a factor in his decision to retire.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Ryan said. \"I’m grateful to the president for giving us this opportunity to do big things.\"\n\nTrump tweeted out praise on Wednesday: \"Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!\"\n\nRomney praised Ryan on Twitter for stepping into the speakership at a critical time.\n\n\"He unified the House, passed scores of bills, and led with integrity, honor and dignity,\" Romney wrote. \"The country will miss Speaker Ryan.\"\n\nRyan said one of his regrets was that Congress had not revamped entitlement programs. He was the architect of a plan that would have converted Medicare, for example, to a program where the government subsidized coverage by private insurers.\n\n“More work needs to be done, and it really is entitlements,” Ryan said. “That's where the work needs to be done, and I'm going to keep fighting for that.”\n\nRyan's announcement, although rumored for months, still caught many Republicans by surprise Wednesday. But GOP lawmakers said they understood his decision.\n\n\"He is answering a higher calling, and that is to his family,\" said Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C.\n\nDemocrats hailed Ryan's retirement as a sign that he knows GOP will take big losses.\n\n“Stay tuned for more retirements as Republicans increasingly realize that their midterm prospects are doomed,\" said Tyler Law, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nRyan will stay speaker throughout the rest of the year, but his announcement is likely to set off a battle for leadership in the House that will not be decided until after the November elections. Possible replacements include Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., now Ryan's second-in-command, and Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., now the third-ranking House member.\n\nScalise downplayed speculation in an appearance on Fox News before Ryan's announcement.\n\n\"A lot of people are saying, ‘What are they going to run for next year,’ but it really becomes irrelevant if [Democrat] Nancy Pelosi is Speaker of the House,\" Scalise said. \"And clearly that’s what she’s intending on doing and they’re raising a lot of money on their side. We need to make sure we hold the House.\"\n\nRyan was a fiscal conservative, but his efforts to be a more pragmatic leader led to conflicts with the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members griped that Ryan was too quick to compromise with Democrats.\n\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said it was not clear if Ryan would be able to serve out the remainder of the year as leader while his top deputies were angling to succeed him.\n\n“I think the next few weeks will determine whether that happens or not,\" Meadows said. \"Everyone will start jockeying for position immediately. They won’t wait for nine months.”\n\nRep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said it was too early to talk about who would replace Ryan.\n\n“The bigger issue right now is just trying to maintain the majority,” said Dent, who is retiring this year. He said Republicans face a “toxic” environment, but the battle would be a referendum on Trump rather than Ryan’s leadership.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins, Marilyn Icsman\n\nThe list: Here are the members of Congress retiring at the end of 2018", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/11"}]}

Ron DeSantis have not yet publicly commented on Cheney's death.\n\nCheney and Trump had a contentious relationship, with Cheney calling Trump a threat to the republic.\n\nFormer Vice President Richard (Dick) Cheney died Monday, Nov. 3. Flags have been flown at half-staff since at the White House and all across the United States.\n\nFour days later, President Donald Trump has yet to address Cheney's death or issue the traditional proclamation ordering flags to be lowered, although Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that he was \"aware\" of Cheney's passing and flags were lowered \"in accordance with statutory law.\" Despite belonging to the same party, the two men had a contentious relationship.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis also has not publicly commented on his fellow Republican leader or issued his own proclamation, although he ordered flags to be lowered last year in honor of former President Jimmy Carter and former U.S. senator and Florida governor Bob Graham, both Democrats. He has also ordered half-staff flags in 2025 for numerous fallen first responders and law enforcement, shooting victims, Pope Francis, assorted local officials and pro wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nBoth men issued proclamations in September for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nFew Republican politicians have had much to say about Cheney, the \"War on Terror\" architect and a powerfully influential and controversial figure under former President George W. Bush who arguably paved the way for the current Trump administration with his efforts to establish the “unitary executive theory” and draw more power to the executive branch of government.\n\nFlorida politicians react to Cheney's death\n\nJeb Bush, former Florida governor and brother of George W. Bush, called Cheney a \"wonderful person and a great patriot\" in an X post Tuesday.\n\nIn his own X post, Sen. Rick Scott, also a former governor of Florida, said that Cheney dedicated his life to serving the country. \"Ann and I are praying for the Cheney family and all who knew him during this time,\" he said.\n\nAs of Nov. 6, there have been no public comments from Sen. Ashley Moody, DeSantis' former attorney general, or Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former senator from Florida.\n\nThere has also been no public mention from Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, R-District 19 and the current frontrunner for the Republican candidate for governor in 2026.\n\nCheney, 84, who had suffered several heart attacks over the years, died surrounded by family from complications of pneumonia, and cardiac and vascular disease.\n\nWhy hasn't Trump addressed Cheney's death?\n\nIt may not be surprising that Trump is not honoring Cheney's passing.\n\nOne of the last things Cheney did in public was call Trump a threat to the nation in a 2022 ad supporting the ultimately unsuccessful re-election of his daughter, former Wyoming congressperson Liz Cheney, who voted for Trump's second impeachment and was vice chair of the committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection. She later endorsed and even campaigned for Trump's opposition, former vice president and Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nA few days before his election to a second term in November 2024, Trump called Liz Cheney \"a deranged person\" and \"a very dumb individual\" at a campaign event in Glendale, Arizona. \"She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?\" he said.\n\n\"In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Cheney said in the ad. \"He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.\n\n\"He is a coward,\" Cheney said.\n\nIn 2024, Cheney said he was voting for Harris for president.\n\nDo flags fly at half-staff after death of former vice presidents?\n\nYes. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, flags are flown at half-staff after the death of a vice president.\n\nHow long do flags fly at half-staff for the death of a former vice president?\n\nThe flag is flown at half-staff from the day of death until interment of a former vice president, according to the Flag Code.\n\nFlags are flown at half-staff for 30 days after the death of a president or former president, which occurred after the death of former President Jimmy Carter, which overlapped Trump's inauguration in January.\n\nWhere should US flag be flown at half-staff for Cheney?\n\nThe flag should fly at half-staff at all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and its territories and possessions, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nWhen, where will Dick Cheney's funeral take place?\n\nAs of Thursday, Nov. 6, details on Cheney's funeral or final resting place have not been made public by his family or the White House.\n\nCheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska and grew up in Wyoming, where he later retired. His funeral would likely take place in one of those two states.\n\nWill Dick Cheney lie in state?\n\nCheney could conceivably receive a state funeral, as presidents and other prominent politicians have in the past. Those that do lie in state in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC for mourners to pass by.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nov. 4, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said Republican leadership was reviewing “protocol” about the possibility, The Hill reported.\n\n“I think we’re checking the protocols on that. I’ll let you know soon,” the outlet reported Thune told reporters.\n\nHow to correctly fly your flag at half-staff\n\nOn days when the flag is flown at half-staff, it should first be raised \"briskly\" to the top of the pole for an instant and then lowered slowly to the half-staff position, according to the U.S. Flag Code.\n\nBefore lowering the flag, it should again be raised to the top before being lowered for the day.\n\nDo flags fly at half-mast or half-staff?\n\nOn ships and at naval stations ashore, flags are flown at half-mast.\n\nOn shore, flags are flown at half-staff.\n\nContributing: Susan Page, Melina Khan, USA Today", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/trump/2025/11/04/trump-on-former-vice-president-dick-cheney-death/87088664007/", "title": "Trump on former Vice President Dick Cheney death", "text": "President Donald Trump and former Vice President Dick Cheney exchanged barbs over the last few years, but what has Trump said about Cheney's passing?\n\nCheney died at the age of 84 on Nov. 3 of complications of pneumonia as well as cardiac and vascular disease, his family announced in a statement.

As a congressional member, he suffered two additional heart attacks. The fourth occurred following the presidential election in 2000 as a battle ensued over who was the winning candidate.\n\nCheney had a cardiac defibrillator implanted as vice president. In February 2010, he had a fifth heart attack after leaving office. Five months later, he was outfitted with a device that helped pump blood and compensate for increasing heart congestion. He underwent a heart transplant in March 2012 and a quadruple bypass surgery in 1988.\n\nCheney once revealed that he had the wireless function of his defibrillator turned off due to concerns terrorists might attempt to send his heart a fatal shock remotely, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHis condition inspired him to co-author a book with cardiologist Jonathan Reiner titled Heart: An American Medical Odyssey.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY in 2013, Reiner said the following of Cheney's condition: \"He has the longest history of heart disease of any of my patients...He has the most complex history in terms of how difficult his disease became, the most number of moving parts.

It also came on the same day that two Minnesota state lawmakers were shot - with one killed alongside her husband - in a pair of politically-motivated attacks from a gunman still on the loose. Both lawmakers were members of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\n\nBack in Washington, it was not immediately clear how many people attended the event at the National Mall, which was the first military parade in the nation’s capital since the end of the Gulf War in 1991. But it appeared to be vastly fewer than the 200,000 who had been expected, perhaps a result of the threat of rain looming in the evening forecast.\n\nThe parade, which was projected to cost $40 million in taxpayer dollars, started 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. A 21-gun salute and a performance of “Hail to the Chief” welcomed the president and first lady before the parade began with the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, depicting the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.\n\nOn stage, Trump was also joined by Vice President JD Vance, members of his Cabinet including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Republican lawmakers such as Rep. Marjorie Taylore Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nMassive fireworks display caps military parade\n\nA massive fireworks display over the National Mall concluded Trump’s military parade as the president and first lady watched from their stage.\n\nSpeakers hailing the virtues of U.S. soldiers played over loudspeakers as the fireworks blasted from near the Washington Monument – mimicking the city’s Fourth of July celebration that will comes in less than one month.\n\nThe soundtrack for the fireworks also included several American anthems including “America the Beautiful.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump hails ‘fiercest and bravest fighting force’ at military parade\n\nTrump hailed the U.S. Army as the “fiercest and bravest fighting force ever to stride the face of the earth” and commended soldiers who have fought and died for the country in patriotic-themed remarks after the parade concluded.\n\n“The Army keeps us free to make us strong. And tonight, you have all American very proud,” Trump said in a seven-minute speech. “Every other country celebrates their victories. It’s about time America did, too.”\n\nTrump traced U.S. military operations from the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, and from World War I and II into the modern times.\n\n“Our soldiers never give up, never surrender and never give up. They fight, fight, fight,” he said, echoing what became one of his slogans after he escaped an assassination attempt in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump said there is “no earthly force more powerful than” an Army solider, before pointing to the sacrifices of the army. “Our soldiers have poured their blood out by the bucket load.”\n\n“Thanks to their extraordinary service and devotion, 250 years later, America stands tall, America stands proud, and America stands free,” he said. “We're the hottest country in the world right now. Our country will soon be greater and stronger than ever before.”\n\nVice President JD Vance noted June 14 is also his wedding anniversary during his remarks introducing Trump. After finishing his speech, Trump and Melania Trump were handed a folded American flag by an officer before singer Lee Greenwood performed “God Bless the USA.” A fireworks display in front of the Washington Monument then erupted.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\n‘I love you, honey’: VP Vance celebrates wedding anniversary at parade\n\nNot only did the military parade fall on Trump’s birthday. It also coincided with Vice President JD Vance’s 11th wedding anniversary with second lady Usha Vance.\n\n“Happy birthday, Mr. President,” Vance said as he introduced Trump before the president’s remarks. “But I would get in trouble if I didn’t mention that it’s also my wedding anniversary. And so, to my lovely wife: I love you, honey.”\n\nDirecting his comment to the U.S. soldiers, Vance said the country is proud of them.\n\n“The way that we honor and respect you is, No. 1: We never ask you to go to war unless you absolutely have to,” Vance said. “And No. 2, when we do ask you to go to war, we give you the weapons and the support needed to kick the hell out of the enemy and come back home safely.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nDC workers prepare for cleanup\n\nAs parade crowds begin to disperse, D.C. government workers are already preparing to pick up the mess. Bright orange street sweepers and trash trucks sat waiting on 14th Street NW.\n\nEric Blalock, one of the sweeper operators, said the litter from thousands of parade attendees will be cleaned up by 5 am.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\n‘Have a great life’: Trump presides over Army reenlistment ceremony\n\nAs the parade portion of the festivities concluded, Trump presided over a reenlistment ceremony for hundreds of military members recommitting themselves to service in the U.S. Army.\n\nTrump read their oaths aloud, and the soldiers repeated his words.\n\n“Welcome to the United States Army and have a great life,” Trump said after the ceremony concluded.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nHowitzer cannons, Abrams tanks make their way to Trump’s stage\n\nMore than an hour into the parade, the U.S. Army began to show off some of its modern equipment including portable howitzer cannons and M1 Abrams Tanks.\n\nBoth were used extensively in the Gulf War.\n\nMetallica’s “Enter Sandman” played over the loudspeakers as the machinery made its way in front of Trump’s stage.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhy did people attend the military parade?\n\nParade attendees came out for a variety of reasons — some said they were there for Trump, some to support the military, and others said they just wanted to see the spectacle.\n\nJoe Cook, a 33-year-old self described American history buff, traveled from Baltimore to see what he called a “moving museum” of old military aircraft’s and vehicles.\n\nHe didn’t care that the parade fell on Trump’s birthday and hoped, if anything, it would make the display more spectacular.\n\n“You know him, he lathers everything in gold,” Cook said.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\nClassic rock anthems blare over military parade\n\nClassic rock anthems provided the soundtrack of the military parade as the event shifted to modern tanks and equipment used during the war on terror.\n\nAmong the hits blaring on the speakers included Heart’s “Barracuda,” ACDC’s “Thunderstruck,” Van Hallen’s “Jump” and Led Zeppelin’s “Good Times Bad Times.” Members of Led Zeppelin, ironically, are from Great Britain.\n\nSome of the soldiers peaking out of their tanks pumped their fists to the music.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTanks roll by president as Gulf War, war on terror recognized\n\nSoldiers dressed in Gulf War-era uniforms marched by the president in a display that also included military tanks instrumental in the war to liberate Kuwait.\n\nThe tanks were part of the Desert Storm operation led by President George H.W. Bush in 1991.\n\nSoldiers from the global war on terror following the 9/11 terrorist attacks - which included military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan - were showcased next. The parade included a tank from that period of warfare.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCryptocurrency company Coinbase announced as a parade sponsor\n\nA narrator for the parade announced the cryptocurrency exchange company Coinbase as a sponsor of the parade, which has included soldiers from all military eras honoring the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army\n\nTrump has developed a cozy relationship with the crypto industry - and his latest financial disclosure form released June 13 showed its also made him tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn May, Trump hosted about 220 investors who plowed a combined $148 million into his crypto venture. The dinner was a reward for making the leaderboard in a contest to be among the top purchasers of the $TRUMP meme coin, a type of cryptocurrency.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nSoldiers from World War I and II march by Trump\n\nTrump watched and saluted as military members depicting soldiers from World War I and later World War II made their way past his stage.\n\nDressed in uniforms from those eras, some waved at the president and his guests as they marched by.\n\nAmong the troops showcased were the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, whose troops played an instrumental role in the Normandy landings during World War II, and the 101st Airborne Division based in Fort Campbell Kentucky.\n\nMore than 6,000 army soldiers are expected to march in the parade.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWeather update: Light rain\n\nLight rain started to fall on the parade as soldiers in World War I-uniform marched past Trump.\n\nA B-25 bomber flew over the mall ahead of the World War II contingent.\n\nArmy spokesman Steve Warren said the weather, so far, wasn’t a problem.\n\n“There are more than 1,000 paratroopers here today. When it rains, most paratroopers look up at the sky and say ‘is that all you got?’”\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nFife and drum corps, Golden Knights perform for Trump\n\nThe first military members to perform in front of Trump’s stage was the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, a group that depicts the uniforms and instruments used by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.\n\nNext, several parachutes from the Golden Knights Parachute team jumped from planes with their equipment.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCrowd sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to Trump as military parade begins\n\nTwo military tanks are positioned in front of the stage where Trump, Cabinet members and other top allies are watching. The White House is in the backdrop.\n\nSome in the crowd started singing happy birthday to the president after Trump arrived on stage with first lady Melania Trump.\n\nA short video ahead of the parade chronicled the history of the U.S. Army beginning with its role in the Revolutionary Army that gave the United States its freedom.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nParade-goers unworried about early start\n\nThousands of people still zig-zagged Constitution Avenue waiting in line to get into the parade viewing area as the event began.\n\nElijah Donello, 20, said he has waited for more than an hour and isn’t worried about the parade starting early. “We’ll be in position by the time it gets here,” he said.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump arrives for the parade earlier than scheduled\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrived at his viewing stand to watch the parade at 5:43 p.m. ET, about a half hour earlier than originally scheduled as evening rain and thunderstorms loom in the forecast.\n\nTrump’s appearance suggests the parade will get underway earlier than the original 6:30 p.m. ET start time, perhaps to avoid the chance of lightning that could disrupt the event.\n\nTrump will watch the parade next to some of his Cabinet members, Republican lawmakers and other top allies.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump Cabinet members, allies assemble to watch parade with president\n\nMuch of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, Republican lawmakers and other top Trump allies have assembled for the president’s military parade that will mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army on Trump’s 79th birthday.\n\nThose situated in a viewing stand where Trump will watch the parade include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins and White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought.\n\nAlso watching from the stand are Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylore Greene of Georgia, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, Maria Salazar of Florida, Rich McCormick of Georgia, singer Lee Greenwood (performer of “God Bless the USA,” a Trump favorite) and Dana White House, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n\n- Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers\n\nProtesters and Trump supporters bicker along parade line\n\nAnti-Trump protesters milled, for the most part quietly, along the perimeter of the parade line, though at times they clashed with the presidents supporters.\n\nOne man asked the protesters how much they were being paid.\n\nPaul Williams, 58, yelled back “freedom is free.”\n\nA school teacher from Silver Spring, Maryland, Williams said military parades in the U.S. aren’t “unprecedented” but he is worried about the “atmosphere” of this one, and how much it could cost the federal government.\n\n“I think it's just inappropriate to be celebrating,” he said.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nArmy spokesman on weather forecast: 'This parade will happen'\n\nThe Army’s daylong festival on the National Mall, celebrating its 250th anniversary, came off without a hitch, Army spokesman Steve Warren said.\n\nThe weather, though muggy, cooperated for events like fitness challenges.\n\n“The festival has been a great success,\" Warren said \"People from all walks of life spent the day connecting with soldiers and learning about America’s Army. The parade will be icing on the Army’s birthday cake.\"\n\nPerhaps.\n\nRain and possible thunderstorms crept toward Washington from the west late Saturday afternoon.\n\n“The Army doesn’t have any concerns about the weather,\" Warren said. \"This parade will happen.\"\n\nIf the weather turns nasty, the Army could modify or cancel flyovers by aircraft.\n\n\"But the parade is a go,\" Warren said.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nParade goers line up for blocks\n\nThe line to get into the parade extends multiple city blocks, stretching around the Smithsonian Museum of American History, and then looping back into the street.\n\nVendors are wheeling carts along the road, selling hats, T-shirts and Spongebob Squarepants Popsicles.\n\nThose waiting say the line has moved quickly. Standing near the front, waving a red fan, Chelsea Monk, 34, said she had only waited about five minutes.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nWhite House protesters disperse\n\nThe demonstrators outside the White House are dispersing after more than an hour of protesting. Hundreds are headed home, to the metro, and back to their hotels.\n\nLeo Pargo, one of the event’s organizers, said they have no plans to protest the parade beginning at 6:30 p.m.\n\n—Rachel Barber\n\nProtest signs outside the White House\n\nThough the demonstration outside the White House is not officially a “No Kings” protest, several attendees have written the slogan on their signs.\n\nOther signs include “Due process is for everyone,” “Immigrants make America great,” and “Those who ban history want to repeat it.”\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\nRefuse Fascism’ demonstration begins in D.C.\n\nThere weren’t any ‘No Kings’ protests originally scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C. during Trump’s military parade but reports early Saturday afternoon show a small demonstration beginning to form.\n\nA group called “Refuse Fascism” started assembling in Logan Circle with about 500 people reportedly marching to Lafayette Park just in front of the White House.\n\n“Fascist America – We say no! Now’s the time for Trump to go,” the crowd chanted, according to the NBC affiliate in Washington.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMAGA merch for sale\n\nAbout a block from the festival, local vendors are selling “Make America Great Again” red baseball caps and white cowboy hats.\n\nTrump shirts are for sale including one that depicts the president in front of the White House and reads “daddy’s home.”\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nThe sun is out in Washington\n\nAlthough potential showers and thunderstorms are expected Saturday evening, it’s a sunny and humid 82 degrees in Washington as of 2:30 p.m.\n\nTrash cans at the National Mall are overflowing with water cups as attendees heat up and apply sunscreen.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\nWho sponsored the festivities?\n\nSigns around the festival list several companies as sponsors of the event.\n\nAmong them are Walmart, Lockheed Martin, and RTX, formerly known as Raytheon Technologies.\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nMusic on the main stage\n\nCountry music artist Noah Hicks took the main stage to perform several songs, including his yet to be released single “Small Town Does.”\n\nNearby, families play Connect Four, cornhole and flag football on the grass.\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nLast military parade in D.C. was 1991\n\nSupporters say it’s a much-needed showcase of American pride celebrating the Army, while critics slam it as a president's ego trip.\n\nBut Saturday’s military parade isn’t the first in the nation’s capital. That last one was the National Victory Celebration, which took place June 8, 1991, two months after the end of Operation Desert Storm.\n\n“By God, we’ve kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all,” President George H.W. Bush said in March 1991, after the U.S.-led coalition kicked the Iraqi army out of Kuwait in a war that lasted about 100 hours.\n\nSome back then called the parade -- which cost about $12 million before inflation -- \"a waste of time, effort and money,\" but mostly it was a patriotic celebration that turned out roughly 800,000 people that didn't feature nationwide protests.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump: A ‘rainy day’ brings good luck\n\nThe president isn’t letting a poor forecast dampen his mood as he celebrates his 79th birthday and the Army’s 250th.\n\n“OUR GREAT MILITARY PARADE IS ON, RAIN OR SHINE,” Trump said in a Saturday morning post on Truth Social, his social media platform. “REMEMBER, A RAINY DAY PARADE BRINGS GOOD LUCK. I’LL SEE YOU ALL IN D.C.”\n\nRain and thunderstorms might damper the massive military showcase as much eastern half of the country are experiencing showers through the weekend. Remember the event is standing room only, according to the Secret Service.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Mother Nature has crashed a Trump event. If you recall, in January his second inauguration had to be moved to inside the U.S. Capitol due to intense cold.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nFitness competition underway\n\nDripping in sweat, U.S. Army Maj. Andres Nanez is proud he and his team finished the fitness competition on the National lawn in 10 minutes and seven seconds.\n\nThe timed test of endurance features a rope climb, Echo Bike ride, a three-person dead lift of more than 500 pounds, burpees and more, as spectators cheer on participants.\n\nNanez left the Fort Bragg base in North Carolina to attend the Saturday’s festivities with his fellow soldiers and family.\n\n“Representing the U.S. Army is what brought us all together and to compete at the biggest stage,” Nanez said. “Definitely enjoying this moment.”\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\n‘God saved Trump so he can save America’\n\nDecked in a red, white, and blue suit embellished with the iconic image of President Donald Trump holding his fist in the air after an assassination attempt in Butler, Penn., Tien Tran drew attention from the crowds at the national Mall Saturday morning.\n\n“I’ve been wearing this since after the assassination attempt. I’ve been to rallies and to the inauguration,” Tran said. “God saved Trump so he could save America and he will save the world.”\n\nHe’s in town for one day celebrate the military and Trump’s birthday, which he says he celebrates every year in Orange County, Calif.\n\nHe sides with Trump in his ongoing arguments between his state’s governor over deployment of the National Guard after protests following ICE raids, saying Gavin Newsom has “failed” Californians.\n\n“They protest because either they are paid to do so or because they don’t love this country,” he alleged. “I’m a legal immigrant and I love this country and I don’t want to see it being destroyed.”\n\n—Rachel Barber\n\nDon’t forget, it’s Flag Day, too\n\nIt isn’t just the president and the Army’s birthdays.\n\nJune 14 also is when Old Glory, America's symbol of freedom with its 50 stars and 13 stripes, is celebrated.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\n‘It's pretty cool’: Army’s past on display with historic uniforms\n\nOnlookers will see hundreds of military vehicles and thousands of soldiers on Saturday that will be grouped together for each major era of the Army’s history.\n\nAs USA TODAY previously reported, of the roughly 7,000 soldiers flocking to D.C. from bases around the world, about 1,000 will be dressed up in the historical uniforms from Revolutionary War, Civil War, both world wars and other major conflicts.\n\nThe costumes were rented from the Motion Picture Costume Company – a Los Angeles-based contractor, and were used at a June 11 performance known as the Twilight Tattoo, which is open to the public weekly from May through July.\n\n\"It's pretty cool,\" Private Jonathan Cole, who wore a Gulf War-era camouflage uniform ahead of Saturday's parade, told USA TODAY.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey, Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nArmy recruitment up 10% ahead of Trump parade\n\nPart of Saturday’s parade is making a patriotic appeal to future soldiers after years of the Army struggling to meet its recruitment goals.\n\nU.S. military officials announced the branch met its annual recruiting target of 61,000 in the first week of June, which was a full four months ahead of the scheduled. That is roughly 10% higher than the 55,000 recruits the Army reported having last year.\n\n\"This achievement represents a significant turning point for the Army and indicates a renewed sense of patriotism and purpose among America's youth,” the Army said in a June 3 statement.\n\nSecretary of the Army Dan Driscoll attributed the rise to the “decisive leadership” of Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, but others have spotlighted the Future Soldier Preparatory Course, which was established in August 2022.\n\nFormer Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the Associated Press, for instance, that the program established under Biden might be responsible for as much as a third of this year's recruiting totals.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWho does and doesn’t like the Army, Trump b-day parade\n\nAs mentioned before, Americas might not like the cost of Saturday’s parade but a plurality do like the idea of holding one.\n\nA new AP-NORC poll found 40% of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s decision versus 29% who disapprove.\n\nAs you may have expected, Democrats and liberal-leaning Americans aren’t too excited about it. Just 20% approve of the president’s decision while 50% disapprove, according to the survey.\n\nBut it’s a hit among Republicans and conservative-minded adults, with a whopping 67% giving Trump a thumbs up compared to only 11% who object.\n\nAmong independents, slightly more favor the parade than object with 27% approving and 19% disapproving. The remaining 54% said neither.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nAmerican metal on full display\n\nWhatever you might think of Saturday’s parade, there’s no question D.C. streets will feel the weight.\n\nThe Army has made special preparations to minimize damage to the roadways as tons of vehicles and artillery will be coming through the nation’s capitol, such as:\n\nThe M1A2/Abrams tank : Arguably, the most impressive and fearsome weapon in the parade, or pretty much anywhere at 70 tons, the tank entered Army service 45 years ago and first saw combat in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. It carries a 120mm cannon, robust armor and has a top speed of 45 mph.\n\n: Arguably, the most impressive and fearsome weapon in the parade, or pretty much anywhere at 70 tons, the tank entered Army service 45 years ago and first saw combat in Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

It destroyed radar installations in Iraq during Desert Storm and provided air cover for convoys and troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump, the oldest president, turns 79 today\n\nSaturday's parade might may also draw attention to Trump being the oldest commander-in-chief in U.S. history.\n\nBorn June 14, 1946, when Harry Truman was president, he set the record for oldest person to take office at 78 years and 7 months, ahead of Joe Biden, who was 78 years and 2 months when he took office in January 2021.\n\nThe age of American elected officials has been a topic of concern lately, mostly due to questions raised around Biden's acuity that hounded him for most of his term. Democrats have tried to do the same to Trump, such as when he mixed up the Japanese car company Nissan and the Japanese steel company Nippon last month.\n\n\"He is not the same person that I dealt with just four years ago, and he's incapable of even a train of thought,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said of Trump in a recent interview.\n\nBut that narrative hasn't stuck to Trump, who is known to ramble in public speeches but comes off as more vigorous to the public than Biden did.\n\n— Phillip M.

Yukon Police Chief John Corn said partner agencies held meetings right up until Friday, June 20, as various OKC departments planned the event, which became a reality Sunday night when the Thunder secured the title.\n\n\"It's quite elaborate planning,\" Corn said.\n\nThe Moore Police and Norman Police departments, stationed in suburbs south of OKC, and the Edmond Police Department, headquartered just north, also have been asked to assist.\n\nMoore spokesman Clint Byley said members of Moore police would be present in downtown OKC as part of the South Metro SWAT Team, a multi-jurisdictional unit that also includes Norman police and the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office.\n\nFor OKC police, Tuesday's parade will come less than 48 hours after another major event — Sunday night's championship game at the Paycom Center downtown. Police also planned ahead for that event, blocking off inbound traffic into downtown OKC's Bricktown area late Sunday immediately after the team's win.\n\nDowntown OKC was 'pretty peaceful' after Thunder win Sunday night\n\nOKC police Sgt. Gary Knight said that, given the historic nature of the celebration, police saw few issues Sunday night into Monday downtown.\n\n\"It was pretty peaceful, and we had a lot of people out there, but there was nothing major that happened,\" Knight said. \"As far as police work goes, people behaved themselves, for the most part, really well.\"\n\nPolice did respond to a shooting around 10:30 p.m. Sunday on the east side of Scissortail Park.\n\nKnight said a teenager was shot and had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nWhile there was concern on social media about the shooting's possible connection to the championship given the park's proximity to the Paycom Center, Knight said the incident was not related \"in any way, shape, form or fashion to the game or the post-game celebration.\"\n\nOne person was initially detained in connection to the shooting, but Knight said no arrest had been made as of early Monday.\n\nAfter Sunday night's game, some fans of the team were videoed jumping for joy into the Bricktown Canal. The city's Parks and Recreation Department later advised residents against doing so. While the parks department did not mention it directly, many on social media recalled a tragic situation when a man died and another was injured after being electrocuted by a broken light at the Bricktown Canal in 2018.\n\n\"Listen, we get it. THUNDER UP! But you guys: stop jumping in the canal,\" the parks department said in social media posts Monday. \"First of all, it's against the rules. Second of all, our nanobubble scrubber technology is still working to clear the water. And there is, um, a ways to go before that's all good.\"\n\nOklahoma City departments shutting down ahead of parade\n\nThe city's various departments have also been at work for weeks to plan Tuesday's parade, ever since the Thunder made the NBA playoffs in early June. City management announced Monday that city offices would close and most city services would be unavailable on the day of the parade.\n\n\"Conducting City business in person downtown will be almost impossible on parade day, so I decided to close,\" City Manager Craig Freeman said in a statement. \"Closing will also make more parking available for the thousands of people attending the parade. Plus, many of our Utilities, Parks and Public Works crews are needed to support parade operations.\"\n\nAhead of the parade, OKC Police Chief Ron Bacy encouraged people to bring the \"best versions of yourself\" to the celebration, adding that the Thunder had represented the city well in the NBA competition and that residents should want to match the team's efforts.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we represent them the way that they've represented us on the biggest stage: with dignity, with class, and with respect,\" Bacy said.\n\nHe also said that attendees should have a plan before they arrive on how to reunify if they end up lost or separated from their party.\n\n\"Again, we want everyone to stay safe,\" Bacy said. \"If you see something, say something.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/14/shooting-kansas-city-chiefs-victory-parade/72602293007/", "title": "Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting leaves 1 dead and 21 injured", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Kansas City Chiefs parade shooting for Wednesday, Feb. 14. For the latest news on shooting, view our live updates file for Thursday, Feb. 15.\n\nBullets ripped through crowds of spectators following a Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl victory parade attended by tens of thousands Wednesday, killing one and injuring at least 21 others in the nation's latest shooting assault at a major sports or concert venue.\n\nKansas City, Missouri, police confirmed shots were fired west of Union Station at around 2 p.m. local time. Interim Fire Chief Ross Grundyson said at a news conference that 22 people suffered gunshot wounds, including one fatality, eight with immediately life-threatening injuries, seven with life-threatening injuries, and six with minor injuries.\n\nSeveral people near the parade route were carried away on stretchers.\n\nLisa Augustine, spokesperson for Children’s Mercy Kansas City, said the hospital was treating 12 patients from the rally, including 11 children, some of whom suffered gunshot wounds.\n\nPolice Chief Stacey Graves said three people have been detained, but detectives are investigating whether one person was among a group of bystanders who assisted police and possibly tackled an assailant.\n\n“I’m angry at what happened today. The people who came to this celebration should expect a safe environment,” Graves said at a news conference.\n\nRadio station KKFI said in a Facebook post Wednesday evening that DJ Lisa Lopez-Galvan, host of “Taste of Tejano,” was killed in the shooting.\n\n“This senseless act has taken a beautiful person from her family and this KC Community,” KKFI said.\n\nLopez-Galvan, whose DJ name was “Lisa G,” was an extrovert and devoted mother from a prominent Latino family in the area, said Rosa Izurieta and Martha Ramirez, two childhood friends who worked with her at a staffing company. Izurieta said Lopez-Galvan had attended the parade with her husband and her adult son, a die-hard Kansas City sports fan who also was shot.\n\n“She’s the type of person who would jump in front of a bullet for anybody — that would be Lisa,” Izurieta said.\n\nSome of the Chiefs' players spoke at the rally but were not in the line of fire when shots rang out. A team official said players and coaches were not injured and were on buses leaving the area.\n\nMore than 800 law enforcement officers were providing security for the parade route, Graves said. Several hundred thousand people had been expected to attend the parade celebrating the Chiefs' championship victory Sunday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland were briefed on the shooting. Biden said late Wednesday night that the shooting stirs deep emotion because of its ties to a Super Bowl celebration and he asked people to \"make your voice heard in Congress.\" He said the end goal is to ban assault weapons, to limit high-capacity magazines, strengthen background checks, and keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is the most unifying event in America,\" Biden said. \"Nothing brings more of us together. And the celebration of a Super Bowl win is a moment that brings a joy that can’t be matched to the winning team and their supporters. For this joy to be turned to tragedy today in Kansas City cuts deep in the American soul.\"\n\nAgents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were at the parade and assisting local police, the Justice Department said in a statement.\n\nShootings at victory rallies are not unheard of in recent years. After the Denver Nuggets’ championship parade last year, a shooting took place in downtown Denver that injured two people, though police said they didn’t believe the incident was associated with the actual celebration. Also last year, an argument resulted in shots being fired at a parking lot near the Texas Rangers’ World Series championship parade. Nobody was injured.\n\nA shooting at a concert in Dallas left one dead and 16 injured in 2022. In October 2017, a gunman opened fire on the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada from his 32nd-floor suites in the Mandalay Bay hotel. He fired more than 1,000 rounds, killing 60 people and wounding at least 413 in what remains the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in American history.\n\nState officials 'out of harm's way' after attending parade\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson said he was at the parade with first lady Teresa Parson when shots were fired, but they had safely evacuated.\n\n“State law enforcement personnel are assisting local authorities in response efforts,” Gov. Parson said in a social media post. “As we wait to learn more, our hearts go out to the victims.”\n\nKansas Gov. Laura Kelly was also at the rally but posted an update that she was safe.\n\n“At the end of the Chiefs rally, shots were fired near Union Station. I have been evacuated and am out of harm's way. I encourage everyone to follow instructions and updates from @kcpolice. Please stay safe,” Kelly said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nKansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas attended the parade with his wife and mother and had to run for cover when gunfire broke out.\n\n“I think that’s something that all of us who are parents, who are just regular people living each day, have to decide what we wish to do about,” Lucas said. “Parades, rallies, schools, movies. It seems like almost nothing is safe.”\n\nWitnesses recount chaos when gunfire broke out\n\nKevin Sanders, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, said he heard what sounded like firecrackers and then people running. After that initial flurry, calm returned, and he didn’t think much of it. But he said 10 minutes later, ambulances started showing up.\n\n“It sucks that someone had to ruin the celebration, but we are in a big city,” Sanders said.\n\nOfilio Martinez, 48, said he heard shots fired a couple blocks away about 10 or 15 minutes before the gunfire near the Union Station rally.\n\n“This is making me nervous, scared,” he said.\n\nGunfire broke out less than half an hour after Chiefs fans concluded their parade in celebration of the Super Bowl victory. The rally was scheduled to end at Union Station with speeches by players and coaches.\n\nKansas City was in high spirits before parade\n\nFans in Kansas City got to experience yet another parade celebrating the Super Bowl champions. This year, Tara Bennett said it was more special as she and her friends cheered the team on throughout the season and defended their title as Super Bowl Champions.\n\n\"It was exciting and so much fun seeing the players coming down and having fun with people with their family celebrating the city,\" Bennett, a Kansas City resident, said. \"It was beautiful today and we kept taking layers off because it was warm with the sun beating down.\"\n\nThat was ripped away when she saw news about a possible shooting spread as she and her friend walked toward their car. Their fears were confirmed when they turned on the radio.\n\nBennett, an active volunteer with Moms Demand Action, said the state has been weakening gun laws for nearly a decade, allowing people to purchase a gun and conceal rifles without a permit, according to both Everytown for Gun Safety and the National Rifle Association.\n\n\"This shouldn't have happened and shouldn't have marred and scarred everyone and given a black eye to the city,\" Bennett said.\n\nNFL, Chiefs express condolences\n\nThe National Football League said it was \"deeply saddened by the senseless shooting\" that sent shockwaves through Kansas City as throngs of paradegoers ran for cover.\n\n“Our thoughts are with the victims and everyone affected,” the NFL said.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs confirmed all of its players, coaches, staff and their families were safe and accounted for.\n\n\"We are truly saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred outside of Union Station at the conclusion of today’s parade and rally. Our hearts go out to the victims, their families, and all of Kansas City,” the Chiefs said in a statement.\n\nChiefs players took to social media to share their condolences. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes said on X he is \"praying for Kansas City\" in the wake of the shooting.\n\nChiefs players react to shooting: First responders 'should be celebrated today'\n\nGun advocates demand for change in wake of shootings\n\nAs Kansas City reeled from the shooting tragedy, activists across the country once again called on lawmakers to take action against gun violence.\n\nKris Brown, president of gun violence prevention group Brady, noted the shooting happened on the sixth anniversary of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. There, 17 people were killed by a gunman who is serving multiple life sentences without parole.\n\n“I am heartbroken for the community of Kansas City, the victims and their families, and frankly for all Americans. We should not have to live in daily fear of being shot and killed at parades, at school, or anywhere,” Brown said. “Gun violence is preventable and we have the solutions. We must be resolved to end this deadly epidemic and free America from gun violence.”\n\nHillary Schieve, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and mayor of Reno, Nevada, joined the chorus of voices on Wednesday calling on Capitol Hill to take action.\n\n“Again and again, year after year, we are forced to ask: what will it take for this nation to do something about the easy access to guns in our country? And what will it take for Congress to address this senseless violence that is plaguing far too many American communities?” Schieve said.\n\nEverytown, Mom Demand Action and Students Demand Action said in a Wednesday news release the Super Bowl victory parade should've been \"pure joy\" but became a tragedy for a community. MDA Executive Director Angela Ferrell-Zabala said in the release the shooting is a marker for politicians to roll back gun laws.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said, “This shooting is yet another reminder that no parade, no church, no school — really, nowhere at all — is safe from America’s gun violence crisis.\"\n\nParkland shooting anniversary: 6 years later, school librarian works hard to make her space the safest\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/palm-springs/2024/11/03/as-election-nears-politics-loomed-over-palm-springs-pride-parade/76035634007/", "title": "As election nears, politics loomed over Palm Springs Pride Parade", "text": "Parades and politics are often inextricably linked, and that was certainly the case during the Greater Palm Springs Pride Parade on Sunday.\n\nCandidates for both local and national office attended, hoping their visibility at the event that attracts thousands would persuade some voters to their side. This year, however, politics loomed over the proceedings, with the election two days away and a showdown between former President Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris on the ballot.\n\n\"Pride is a political activity, so the parade itself is an opportunity for folks to celebrate who want to celebrate. And it’s the opportunity for folks to raise awareness on the issues that are important to them,\" said Greater Palm Springs Pride President and CEO and Palm Springs Councilmember Ron deHarte.\n\n\"People look at Pride weekend as a big celebration, but it is an act of social justice,\" he added. \"It’s an act of political activism, with the LGBTQ community and their allies coming out and showing the impact that the LGBTQ community has in Palm Springs. It really demonstrates the scope and the depth of how far the LGBTQ community reaches in the city.\"\n\nBeginning at 10 a.m. in downtown Palm Springs and stretching into the afternoon, this year's pride event featured many of the familiar floats and participants from years past. It served as a celebration of LGBTQ+ strength and acceptance, and showcased community support.\n\nFor some, the election appeared top of mind. Harris/Walz T-shirts adorned several viewers and a few wore Democrat Vice-President candidate Tim Walz's signature camouflage hat.\n\nAttendee James Larson said the election was \"constantly\" on his mind. He's participated in the parade for the last two years, but decided to watch it this year.\n\n\"It's very consequential for us, because I think LGBT people are in jeopardy if Trump wins,\" he said. \"We're out here to try to celebrate what we hope is going to be Kamala Harris' victory.\"\n\nTrump's insignia was noticeably absent from the parade route, perhaps not a surprise given Palm Springs has 19,803 registered Democrats and only 4,380 registered Republicans according to the latest voter data. Still, the parade could be seen as a counter point to a rally the former president held just outside Coachella about three weeks ago, bringing thousands of his supporters to the area.\n\nBut for some, the parade was an opportunity to escape the sometimes toxic rhetoric of the campaign trail. Elle Nouveau, a drag queen from Idaho, visited Palm Springs to participate in the parade with a friend.\n\n\"I'm in a very red state, so I'm escaping this weekend,\" Nouveau said. \"I don't have a huge community where I'm from, so just to see this many people out, with queer people everywhere and openness is really fun to see. I really enjoy it.\"\n\nThis year's parade featured artist Aaron Allen Marner as the grand marshal. Local dignitaries were carried in stylish cars and volunteers handed out goodies and candy to viewers. Alaska Airlines even brought a large balloon in the shape of an airplane, which appeared to have trouble with the occasional gust of wind.\n\nIt could be a bit overwhelming, especially for a first-time participant. Loretta Scheurer moved to Palm Springs about a year ago and went to her first parade on Sunday.\n\n\"So far it's nice,\" she said as she waited for the parade to begin. \"I have no idea what it's going to be, but it's exciting to just stand for people.\"\n\nSam Morgen covers the city of Palm Springs for The Desert Sun.

But their 2020 title came amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and public health protocols in effect in Los Angeles at the time prevented a parade from happening.\n\nThis year was different. The Dodgers were once again the best team in baseball and then backed it up in the 2024 postseason. Accordingly, the city of Los Angeles and the team had a huge celebration to commemorate this team's accomplishments on Friday. It even included a nod to Fernando Valenzuela, the franchise great who died right before the World Series began last month.\n\nThis was a memorable afternoon for Dodgers' players and fans alike, one that they all said afterwards exceeded even their grandest expectations. The team received its long-awaited parade treatment from throngs of fans that lined the streets of Los Angeles and a sold-out celebration ceremony at Dodgers Stadium in which all the team's stars spoke.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports chronicled all the best highlights and moments live and you can relive them below:\n\nSAVE THE MOMENT: Dodgers are World Series champions! Celebrate with stunning commemorative book\n\nDodgers' celebration is over, but Clayton Kershaw isn't done\n\nThe formal ceremony at Dodger Stadium is over as most of the members of the 2024 World Series champions took the stage and thanked the fans. But many fans, players and their families are lingering, with the MLB simulcast providing more interviews with the Dodgers. Clayton Kershaw was among those to appear and he used it to make sure everyone knew his emotions weren't a symbol for any sort of finality.\n\n\"I'll remember this the rest of my life,\" Kershaw said. \"I'm so thankful that I'm gonna get to retire with a Dodger jersey on my back. Not soon, but whenever that day comes.\"\n\nShohei Ohtani speaks at Dodgers World Series celebration\n\nNo interpreter needed for the Dodger Stadium celebration.\n\nClayton Kershaw: 'Dodger for life'\n\nThe mic went from Mookie Betts to a tearful Teoscar Hernandez and then to Clayton Kershaw. The moment sank in for everyone as the crowd roared. Kershaw, a member of the Dodgers for 17 years, looked overwhelmed with emotion. He missed the Dodgers' postseason run due to injury.\n\n\"I've waited for this day for so long. I've waited to celebrate a long time,\" Kershaw told the crowd. \"I didn't have anything to do with this championship but it's the best feeling in the world.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I love you guys. Dodger for life,.\" Kershaw added before posing once more with the World Series trophy along with the entire team.\n\nDodgers celebration features expletives, 'Fat Joe' jokes\n\nKiké Hernandez, shirtless during the Dodgers' parade, just came out and dropped something akin to a wrestling promo as Dodgers players come up one-by-one to speak to the Dodger Stadium crowd.\n\nManager Dave Roberts called for the team to run it back. Walker Buehler took the mic and simply declared the Dodgers champions with a little profanity mixed in. Then came Hernandez.\n\n\"Who has more championships in the 2020s than us?\" Hernandez asked rhetorically. \"Absolutely nobody.\"\n\nHe then thanked Ice Cube, both for Friday's performance and the performance before Game 2. Hernandez said the Dodgers knew \"we'd already won it\" as soon Ice Cube came out. He then took a dig at the New York Yankees and Fat Joe's performance before Game 3 at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"He used to be fat, but he's not fat anymore,\" Hernandez said. \"After that performance, we'd already won.\"\n\nIce Cube opens Dodger Stadium World Series celebration\n\nActor, rapper and entrepeneur Ice Cube opened the Dodger Stadium World Series celebration Friday with a performance, just like he did during Game 2 of the World Series. Wearing a No. 24 Dodgers jersey, he performed a couple of his songs and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts eventually joined him dancing on the stage set up in the outfield.\n\nThe rest of the Dodgers and their families are beginning to make their way out to the stage now.\n\nKiké Hernandez lost his shirt; Shohei Ohtani won't\n\nDodgers outfielder Kiké Hernandez was at the front of his doubledecker bus during the Dodgers parade moving to the music without a shirt on.\n\nDodgers teammate Shohei Ohtani was subsequently asked from atop his bus on the MLB Network simulcast whether he might take his shirt off at some point during today's celebration.\n\n\"No,\" Ohtani said immediately in English, bypassing his translator. \"Never.\"\n\nEarlier in the interview, Ohtani expressed astonishment at the number of Dodgers fans in attendance along the parade route. The players are starting to arrive at Dodger Stadium for today's sold-out celebration ceremony.\n\nDodger Stadium sings happy birthday to Fernando Valenzuela\n\nWith Friday’s festivities occurring on Fernando Valenzuela’s birthday, the Dodger Stadium crowd made sure to pay tribute to the late pitching legend.\n\nActor Edward James Olmos took the mic and talked about Valenzuela’s legacy to Los Angeles and he started singing happy birthday before the rest of the crowd joined in. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJack Flaherty wants to stay with Dodgers\n\nDodgers pitcher Jack Flaherty was acquired at the trade deadline to add depth to the pitching staff for the final push toward the postseason.\n\nFlaherty pitched Game 1 and Game 5 of the World Series to help the Dodgers’ win their first title since 2020.\n\nThe right-hander will be a free agent this offseason.\n\n\"I love this city and I never want to leave,\" Dodgers pitcher Jack Flaherty said from the parade on Spectrum SportsNet LA.\n\nThe Harvard Westlake alum grew up a Dodgers fan but mentioned that he had no idea just how much the team meant to the city of Los Angeles.

Williams\n\nOrel Hershiser sweater\n\nOrel Hershiser, who helped pitch the Dodgers to the World Series championship in 1988 and is currently a broadcaster for the team, was seen at Friday's parade in familiar if not nostalgic attire.\n\nHershiser was wearing the same sweater (or at least something eerily similar) that he wore to celebrate the Dodgers' championship 36 years ago.\n\nHershiser's fashion sense is certainly up for debate.\n\nShohei Ohtani's dog, Decoy, ready for parade\n\nWith the Dodgers players bringing their families along for the championship parade, star Shohei Ohtani made sure to bring his.\n\nThe slugger’s famous dog, Decoy, joined his father on the route. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWalker Buehler beer bong at Dodgers World Series parade\n\nThe parade is underway as the buses move through downtown Los Angeles and we've already seen a candidate for the Dodgers player enjoying himself the most. Pitcher Walker Buehler was captured on camera atop his doubledecker bus using a beer bong while wearing the 1988 game-worn Orel Hershiser jersey he wore walking into Dodger Stadium for Game 1 of the World Series.\n\nIt was given to him by Hershiser, who won the 1988 World Series as a Dodgers pitcher and was laughing along during the MLB Network broadcast of the parade as this all played out. Hershiser declared he no longer needed or wanted the jersey back.\n\nThey're having a lot of run in the streets of L.A. today.\n\nDodgers parade will also be Fernando Valenzuela tribute\n\nThe first Dodgers World Series championship parade since 1988 is being held on what would have been Fernando Valenzuela's 64th birthday. The Dodgers legend, who was a member of that 1988 team, died last month and the team did not initially announce a cause of death or more details. Tributes came from far and wide during the World Series and they'll continue for today's celebration given the circumstances.\n\nA memorial in Valenzuela's honor is being filled with a new wave of messages – including Happy Birthday balloons – as fans flood Dodger Stadium for today's celebration.\n\nDodgers arriving soon on doubledecker buses\n\nThe Dodgers' players, staff and their families are aboard doubledecker buses while on the parade route, and aerial coverage from the USA TODAY live stream of today's events captured their departure from Dodger Stadium and impending arrival for the start of the parade. The streets are filled with Dodger blue at this point. Horns are beeping as the buses get closer to all the fans. What a scene.\n\nDodger Stadium crowd growing\n\nLOS ANGELES — If the crowd at the parade in downtown Los Angeles wasn’t already a frenzy, just a few miles north, Dodger Stadium is already getting packed for the championship celebration.

Mayor Karen Bass indicated in a social media post Friday morning the city is expecting “tens of thousands” of people to come downtown for the day’s festivities and the first Dodgers’ championship parade since 1988.\n\nWhen is Dodgers World Series parade?\n\nThe Dodgers and their fans will celebrate the 2024 World Series title on Friday, Nov. 1, which is also Fernando Valenzuela’s birthday. The Dodgers' legend died on Oct. 22 due to an undisclosed illness. The Dodgers last paraded in Los Angeles after winning the 1988 World Series.\n\nWhat time is Dodgers World Series parade?\n\nThe Dodgers' parade in downtown Los Angeles is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. ET (11 a.m. local). Following the parade, a special ticketed ceremony at Dodger Stadium will begin at approximately 3:15 p.m. ET (12:15 p.m. local).\n\nWhat will Dodgers World Series parade feature?\n\nThe Dodgers' parade commemorating their 2024 World Series title will begin at Gloria Molina Grand Park on Spring Street in front of City Hall in downtown Los Angeles. Mayor Karen Bass will officially kick off the parade, according to the team, and it will then continue on a 45-minute route from 1st Street to Grand Avenue to 5th Street, culminating at the intersection of 5th and Flower Street.

The city celebrated a championship after winning the 2018 Super Bowl and will get to do it again seven years later.\n\nAs part of the post-championship festivities, the Eagles' home city will throw a parade for the new NFL champions. The players, along with coaches, staff, family members and other select people will proceed through the city passing hundreds of thousands, if not more than one million fans cheering them all on.\n\nIn Philadelphia, it's a huge special occasion for a city with several teams that have come up just short of the title in recent years.\n\nHere's everything we know so far about the Eagles' Super Bowl parade:\n\nWhen is Eagles' Super Bowl parade?\n\nOn Monday morning, the official City of Philadelphia government social media account announced that the Super Bowl parade will take place Friday, Feb. 14.\n\nIn a social media post late Sunday night, the team declared \"See ya Friday\" with a Bradley Cooper-narrated video of Broad Street.\n\nThe video and caption suggested not only the date of the parade but also hinted that the Super Bowl parade will once again process down Broad Street.\n\nHow to watch Eagles' Super Bowl parade\n\nNFL Network will cover the celebration in Philadelphia and have it available to stream on NFL.com.\n\nEagles' Super Bowl parade route\n\nThe team could copy what it did in 2018 with a parade route starting at Broad Street and Pattison Avenue and going toward the Philadelphia Museum of Art via the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\n\nWeather forecast for Eagles' Super Bowl parade\n\nAccording to Accuweather forecasts, Philadelphia will see near-freezing highs for most of the week even after the snow and rain passes through.

Meanwhile, some politicians and advocates are again questioning where in America it is truly safe to gather in celebration.\n\nIn 2017 a gunman shot more than 11,000 rounds of ammunition at an outdoor country music concert near his Las Vegas hotel as fans crouched in terror, killing 60. In 2022, a man with a rifle fired into a July 4th parade outside Chicago. Parents frantically ran, some holding their children and seven died.\n\nAnd now, 11 children were shot in the moments after a Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City on Wednesday, where thousands of red-clad fans ran for their lives across confetti-strewn streets. In total 22 people suffered gunshot wounds, including one fatality, Interim Fire Chief Ross Grundyson said.\n\n“I think that’s something that all of us who are parents, who are just regular people living each day, have to decide what we wish to do about,” said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, who attended the parade with his wife and mother and had to run for cover when gunfire broke out.\n\n“Parades, rallies, schools, movies. It seems like almost nothing is safe,” he said.\n\nShootings at US celebrations keep happening\n\nBullets at sports events, parades and concerts are still relatively rare. But they resonate deeply in a nation that has a long tradition of gathering and celebrating together. In recent years, numerous examples have made national headlines:\n\nBaltimore homecoming celebrations in October 2023 : A shooting at Morgan State University left five people wounded during homecoming celebrations in northeast Baltimore. The incident prompted an hourslong lockdown of the historically Black college and campus leaders canceled homecoming activities for the remainder of the week.\n\n: A shooting at Morgan State University left five people wounded during homecoming celebrations in northeast Baltimore.

Video game tournaments in 2018: Nearly 1,000 people were attending the Art All Night Festival in Trenton, New Jersey, when a shooting erupted in June. A dispute between rival gang members quickly turned into a shooting that killed one person and injured 22 others. About two months later, another shooting rampage occurred in Jacksonville, Florida. Three people died, including the shooter, and 11 others were wounded on Aug. 26 during a Madden 19 video game tourney in downtown Jacksonville.\n\nRenewed calls for stricter gun laws\n\nIn Kansas City, more than 800 law enforcement officers were on hand to provide security along the parade route, said Police Chief Stacey Graves.\n\nBut in a nation awash in guns, it's hard for law enforcement to prevent such attacks. Some leaders and activists say that means the nation needs stricter gun laws in general.\n\n“This shooting is yet another reminder that no parade, no church, no school – really, nowhere at all – is safe from America’s gun violence crisis,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said after the Kansas City shooting.\n\nLucas has joined with mayors across the country in calling for new laws to reduce gun violence, including mandating universal background checks.\n\nMoms Demand Action Executive Director Angela Ferrell-Zabala said the shooting should prompt politicians to tighten gun laws.\n\nShe said the Super Bowl victory parade should have been \"pure joy\" but became a tragedy for the community.\n\nAmerican attitudes toward gun violence seem to be shifting slightly. Six in 10 adults last year said gun violence was a very big problem in the country, up 9 percentage points from 2022, according to the Pew Research Center. Almost 2 in 3 said they expect the level of gun violence to increase over the next five years.\n\nThe Super Bowl – watched this year by more than 1 in 3 Americans – \"is the most unifying event in America,\" President Joe Biden said late Wednesday.\n\n\"Nothing brings more of us together. And the celebration of a Super Bowl win is a moment that brings a joy that can’t be matched to the winning team and their supporters. For this joy to be turned to tragedy today in Kansas City cuts deep in the American soul.\"\n\nHe called for a ban on \"assault weapons,\" limits on high-capacity magazines and strengthened background checks.\n\n\"Today’s events should move us, shock us, shame us into acting. What are we waiting for? What else do we need to see?\" he said.\n\nParade worries used to be different\n\nWhen the San Francisco 49s won the Super Bowl in 1982, their city threw a disastrous parade, in part, because officials had planned for 25,000 people to attend and instead 500,000 showed.\n\nIt was a case of “civic negligence,” the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, because police moved part of the parade route to accommodate the crowd, meaning many who had lined up for hours never got to see their team go by. “It was the worst parade I never saw,” 49ers fan John Sheridan told the paper.\n\nToday officials must speak to other issues.\n\n“I appreciate the bravery and coordination of the law enforcement officers, first responders, and health care workers for ensuring a swift, orderly evacuation and caring for the victims,” Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kan., of neighboring Kansas City, Kansas, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“The traumatic memories of today will stick with children, families and community members for far too long. This does not reflect the spirit of Kansas City, and I support those asking for a chance to ensure a brighter and safer future,” she posted.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/24/new-york-gay-pride-parade-lgbtq/728922002/", "title": "New York's Gay Pride parade celebrates LBGTQ identify", "text": "NEW YORK – Thousands of people clad in rainbow colors marched Sunday through Greenwich Village and up Fifth Avenue for the annual Gay Pride parade, a massive celebration of LGBTQ identity.\n\nOne of this year's grand marshals was tennis legend Billie Jean King, along with transgender advocate Tyler Ford and civil rights organization Lambda Legal.\n\nLady Gaga’s \"Born This Way\" blared from loudspeakers as people marched, danced, stomped and watched along the route. The attire at the 49th annual parade was loud and proud – rainbow suspenders, leopard heels, thongs and fairy wings.\n\nBut the jubilant mood was also tinged with frustration. Signs deriding President Donald Trump, who has not acknowledged LGBTQ Pride month for the second year in a row, rose above banners declaring love.\n\nThe first Gay Pride parade was held in 1970 after the 1969 Stonewall Riots, a series of violent demonstrations against a police raid that targeted the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. The parade was then more of a protest against discrimination than a celebration of diversity.\n\nThe rights of LGBTQ people – those identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer – have made great strides the past few decades, and the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015 was a major victory for the community.\n\nBut the Supreme Court ruled this month in favor of a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple on religious grounds. And Trump pushed for a ban on transgender people serving in the military.\n\nCities across the country hold pride parades and festivals throughout June. Other cities with parades Sunday included Chicago, San Francisco, Minneapolis and Seattle.\n\n\"I think the march is a good opportunity to showcase the variety of the LGBT community and a lot of the most pressing issues people are facing now,” said Ryan Thoreson, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who specializes in LGBTQ issues and attended the march.\n\nPeople seemed particularly politically engaged this year, carrying signs that spoke to immigration and health care in addition to LGBTQ issues, he said.\n\n\"It was very loud, it was very jovial,\" said Kerri Berney, who is from New York City. Berney considers herself a \"straight ally\" and came to the parade to support LGBTQ family members. \"Everyone was in a good mood.\"\n\nVictoria Sax, 44, of Long Island marched Sunday in her first NYC Pride Parade.
