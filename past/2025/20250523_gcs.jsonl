The kind of joy usually reserved for blowing out birthday candles.\n\nIt wasn't the first Disney movie I’d seen. In a childhood that perfectly coincided with Disney's animation renaissance, I’d already had a steady diet of “The Little Mermaid,” “Aladdin” and “Beauty and the Beast” VHS tapes. (I loved the latter so hard that even before I was saying full sentences, I was demanding repeat viewings: “Video, video!”)\n\nBy the time “Tangled” and “The Princess and the Frog” came out, I was a teenager using my little sister as an excuse to see animated films in theaters.\n\nIt is clear that I am the person Disney trusts will be excited for new versions of its classic movies. I’m old enough to have grown up with the original movies, but young enough to post exuberantly about their remakes on social media.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSo far, I’ve been a faithful fan looking forward to the live-action versions. I was psyched for “Beauty and the Beast” and “Aladdin.” Sure, I compared them to the originals, but not in vain. I had fun seeing them. I mouthed the song lyrics. I learned the new ones.\n\n'It wasn't lost on me': How Donald Glover found his inner Simba after losing his father\n\nBut with the new “Lion King” (in theaters now), I suddenly became over it. It being the whole concept of encouraging a studio to reimagine my favorite childhood films. This time, the rhythms of African drums were drowned out by the sound of Disney cashing checks. I was left feeling used for my fandom.\n\nDon’t get me wrong; I love the film's Shakespearean story. Royal heir forms unlikely friendships as he tries to avoid the devastating present, only to realize he must confront his past in order to move forward. There’s a lot to unpack there regarding death, family, responsibility and virtue. It is by all accounts a great movie stuffed with hit songs.\n\nThe 2019 version of “The Lion King,” with photo-realistic CGI and perhaps the greatest voice cast ever assembled, is still good. Beautiful, even.\n\nBut it feels cheap.\n\nThe new film is almost in-your-face about how high tech its graphics are, taking 30 extra minutes of run time for sweeping shots of gorgeous animals roaming a computer-generated Kenya. But that cutting-edge, hyper-realistic look doesn’t fit the decades-old story. It seems better suited for, well, something new. Something that surprises. You know, like “Coco\" and \"Moana\" did.\n\nMore than the same old plot being ill-suited to a brand-new technology, it doesn't give young viewers what I had: a story they've never seen and music they've never heard. The remake is fun, but it's not novel. It feels like a feature-length meme, entirely derivative, whereas when I was young, I had something completely new to wholeheartedly embrace in repeat viewings and claim as mine.\n\nBy regurgitating classic films, Disney is robbing would-be fans of the magic of discovery that made their movies so special to me. It's also cheating a generation of aspiring Annas and Elsas who've embraced the belter \"Let It Go\" from 2013's smash phenom \"Frozen\" as their own anthem.\n\nAs we know, though, Disney isn't halting its production of remakes. Instead, it keeps adding more – including “Mulan” and “The Little Mermaid,” two movies right in my sweet spot. But I'm no longer jazzed about the prospect of revisiting them in live action.\n\nYes, it’s great that kids will get to see a primarily Asian cast directed by a woman in the live-action “Mulan.” But you know what would be better? The same team behind a fresh story about a Chinese woman prevailing.\n\nAnd, sure, Halle Bailey as Ariel in “Little Mermaid is inspired casting. But wouldn’t fans be better off watching the R&B singer lead a new narrative, rather than one about a teen who literally gave up her voice just so she could win over a cute boy she knows nothing about?\n\nToo many tweaks make the movies feel as though they're not honoring the originals; too few and they're boring retreads. Disney, I'll make a deal: If you refocus your efforts on making new content, I promise I'll show up, and bring a young relative.\n\nDisney, delight me, again!", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/03/22/disney-live-action-movies-ranked/82555151007/", "title": "Disney live-action movies ranked, 2025's 'Snow White' included", "text": "Love movies?

Your favorite Disney animated film from when you were a kid is probably getting remade, already has been or is being written on a developmental whiteboard somewhere deep in the House of Mouse.\n\nTim Burton’s 2010 revamp of “Alice in Wonderland” kicked off a spate of successful live-action reimaginings – or ones with realistic computer-generated critters – for many old-school Disney films. The latest is an updated musical version of \"Snow White\" (in theaters now) starring Rachel Zegler as the title character and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. More are on the way, including \"Lilo & Stitch\" (out May 23), \"Moana\" (July 10, 2026) – featuring Dwayne Johnson from the animated movies – and upcoming redos of \"Hercules\" and \"Tangled.\"\n\nIn honor of a new \"Snow White,\" here are all the Disney live-action remakes, prequels and sequels, definitively ranked from worst to best.\n\n23. ‘Alice Through the Looking Glass’ (2016)\n\nWithout Tim Burton around for the mediocre fantasy follow-up, this is not a movie as much as it is a contest for Johnny Depp (as the Mad Hatter), Helena Bonham Carter (the unhinged Red Queen) and Sacha Baron Cohen (new antagonist Time) to see who gets the title for Most Eccentric Wonderlander. Spoiler alert: The audience is the one who loses.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n22. ‘102 Dalmatians’ (2000)\n\nCruella de Vil (Glenn Close) cured of her fur-craziness? Riiiiight. This forgettable sequel has Close’s nutty villainess and not much else, with a story centering on ex-convict Cruella on the straight and narrow until the sounds of Big Ben send her and a French furrier (Gerard Depardieu) on a dog-napping spree to capture 102 Dalmatians for the greatest coat of them all.\n\n21. ‘Christopher Robin’ (2018)\n\n“Winnie the Pooh” regulars like Pooh, Eeyore and Tigger come alive in post-World War II England to help their old pal – and now a family man – Christopher Robin (Ewan McGregor) get his hopeful groove back. Chaos follows these stuffed animals when they hit civilization, and the movie rights itself into a fluffy, endearing affair after starting as a real downer.\n\n20. ‘The Jungle Book’ (1994)\n\nBack in the day, the family-friendly adventure hewed closer to the Rudyard Kipling source material than the 1967 cartoon, and that man cub Mowgli (Jason Scott Lee) grows up to be a Tarzan-like dude who runs into the recognizable characters (King Louie, Kaa, Baloo) but also gets into a love triangle with his childhood friend (Lena Headey) and her soldier fiancé (Cary Elwes).\n\n19. 'Pinocchio' (2022)\n\nDirector Robert Zemeckis finds mixed results marrying broad comedy and pop-culture references with the title wooden boy's adventurous quest to become a real kid. At least Tom Hanks embraces his signature \"America's Dad\" vibe as kindly Italian woodcarver Geppetto and Cynthia Erivo sings a stellar \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" that dares you to stop the waterworks.\n\n18. ‘101 Dalmatians’ (1996)\n\nCast as the classic Disney madwoman, Glenn Close shredding scenery like a cheap dog toy is the obvious appeal here as fashion maven Cruella schemes to steal the Dalmatian pups of her employee (Joely Richardson) and her new video-game designing husband (Jeff Daniels). Come for all the doggie high jinks – thanks to a ton of animatronic animals and a John Hughes screenplay – and stay for Close getting dunked in a vat of molasses.\n\n17. 'Lady and the Tramp' (2019)\n\nFeeling like she doesn't belong after her owners have a baby, purebred cocker spaniel Lady (voiced by Tessa Thompson) goes on a sugary-sweet 1910s-set romantic adventure with street-smart mutt Tramp (Justin Theroux). The real dogs are ridiculously adorable, there's of course a scene with a meatball and spaghetti noodle, and the results could be a lot worse for the Mickey Mouse equivalent of a Hallmark Christmas movie.\n\n16. ‘The Jungle Book’ (2016)\n\nA darker turn from the more humorous 1967 animated musical, Jon Favreau creates an immersive world of extraordinarily realistic animals and a wolf-raised human boy Mowgli (Neel Sethi). The cast is absurdly good – Bill Murray as the lazy bear Baloo, Lupita Nyong’o as Mowgli’s adopted canine mom Raksha – but the film lacks the emotional connection to match its dazzling effects.\n\n15. 'Peter Pan & Wendy' (2023)\n\nStop us if you've heard this one before: London youngster Wendy Darling (Ever Anderson) and her brothers are taken on a great Neverland adventure by Peter (Alexander Molony) and run afoul of Captain Hook (Jude Law). The family flick just doesn't do anything that interesting or innovative with the familiar \"Pan\" narrative, though writer and director David Lowery's penchant for cool fantasy landscapes lessens the disappointment.\n\n14. 'Alice in Wonderland' (2010)\n\nYoung Alice (Mia Wasikowska) runs away from stifling English society to an insane place that Tim Burton was born to realize, with playing-card soldiers and familiar faces (or eyes, as the case may be) of characters like the Cheshire Cat. Sure, the plot’s kind of a mess, but warrior Alice is an empowering turn while Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter’s big-headed Red Queen are splendidly strange.\n\n13. ‘Aladdin’ (2019)\n\nThe high-profile redo isn’t exactly a whole new world, and Robin Williams’ genius Genie is still the best. That said, Will Smith channels his charismatic Big Willie Style days for a blue-skinned magic man who pops onscreen, but the true highlights are the youngsters: Mena Massoud is solid as the movie’s title street rat, while Naomi Scott really sings as an improved, more impassioned Princess Jasmine.\n\n12. 'The Little Mermaid' (2023)\n\nPlayed by the talented Halle Bailey, young mermaid Ariel yearns to be on land, has the hots for Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) – who at least gets a character arc this time – and agrees to a bad deal with witchy Ursula (Melissa McCarthy). Even with Bailey singing her lovestruck heart out, Rob Marshall's redo doesn't make the same refreshing splash as the 1989 animated classic but gets points for trying with a more logical narrative.\n\n11. ‘Dumbo’ (2019)\n\nOn paper, it’s a weird combo: director Tim Burton’s oddball dark quirkiness and an adorable flying elephant. The filmmaker takes the simplistic story of the 1941 cartoon, adds in a lot more human elements (including Colin Farrell as a World War I vet trying to reconnect with his children) and Burton’s signature aesthetic while keeping a childlike sense of wonder.\n\n10. ‘The Lion King’ (2019)\n\nWhile Jon Favreau’s update plays it too safe in terms of storytelling – if you’ve seen the 1994 “Lion King,” you’ve seen this one – it’s hard to argue with how awesome the thing looks. Cutting-edge visual effects create a world of talking photorealistic animals that might as well be a nature documentary, and attention is paid to livening up the humor, with Billy Eichner’s funny, overdramatic meerkat Timon showing up everybody, including Beyoncé.\n\n9. 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' (2009)\n\nGuess who's coming to dinner? When adopted daughter Aurora (Elle Fanning) gets engaged, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) is invited to meet the royal parents (and future in-laws), and a mom fight breaks out between the reformed villain in horns and one seriously evil queen (Michelle Pfeiffer). It's a dark and dazzling sequel that digs into Maleficent's magical origins and lets Jolie and Pfeiffer strut their A-list stuff.\n\n8. 'Snow White' (2025)\n\nThe seven little dudes aren't in the title anymore but are still in the movie. That's not great, but Rachel Zegler is as the main reason why this musical revamp of the 1937 Disney classic works. Snow sings about getting her princess groove back, butts heads with her Evil Queen stepmother (a campy Gal Gadot) and gets a little help from her short new friends. Even better, no charming princes needed.\n\n7. 'Mulan' (2020)\n\nNo cute dragons, no singing, no problem. Director Niki Caro's version is a more serious affair than its predecessor but also more meaningful, with a talented all-Asian cast fueling an empowering, female-driven martial-arts extravaganza. Yifei Liu's Mulan weighs dishonoring her family vs. saving her father (Tzi Ma) and defending the country from invaders, and the tale is an eye-popping fantasy adventure about embracing one's self.\n\n6. 'Mufasa: The Lion King' (2024)\n\nOscar-winning filmmaker Barry Jenkins brings Shakespearean drama – and Lin-Manuel Miranda songs – to the Pride Lands with this origin story of Mufasa and Scar. Before he becomes the \"Lion King,\" Mufasa (voiced by Aaron Pierre) is a youngster washed away from his family who forms a fast friendship with prince Taka (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), though brotherhood turns into betrayal in this prequel that balances humor and gravitas.\n\n5. ‘Beauty and the Beast’ (2017)\n\nBill Condon’s big-budget musical take manages to improve on the 1991 original, the only non-Pixar animated film to nab an Oscar nomination for best picture. Centering on the unlikely romance between provincial girl Belle (Emma Watson) and her monstrous love interest (Dan Stevens), this “Beauty” casts a spell with new show tunes, fleshed-out side players and a visually impressive, surprisingly witty man-beast.\n\n4. ‘Pete’s Dragon’ (2016)\n\nDirector David Lowery nixes the tunes of its trippy 1977 predecessor and leans hard into the kid-friendly story of a feral boy (Oakes Fegley) and his whimsical and furry dragon BFF who’s at risk of being found out in a Pacific Northwest small town. Robert Redford is the cool grandpa of the project but even he can’t outshine the fuzzy green CGI dragon when he takes flight.\n\n3. ‘Maleficent’ (2014)\n\nPlayed with venom and vigor by Angelina Jolie, the classic supervillainess gets the “Wicked” treatment in the “Sleeping Beauty” revisit. That infamous snoozing curse she puts on Aurora (Elle Fanning) is born from the bad romance and betrayal that befall the once-heroic, formerly winged title fairy, and “Maleficent” has some interesting things to say about true love and the unreliable nature of storytelling.\n\n2. 'Cinderella' (2015)\n\nKenneth Branagh's glass-slippered redo scales the pinnacle of what Disney can do with its remakes, mainly by pulling back from the over-the-top magic – though there is still plenty – and instead focuses like a laser on the dramatic trials and rousing triumphs of its central character. Top-notch casting is the cherry on top, with Lily James as the supremely likable Cinderella, Richard Madden as her down-to-earth prince, Cate Blanchett as the detestable stepmother with her own imperfect backstory, and Helena Bonham Carter as one lovably flighty fairy godmother.\n\n1. 'Cruella' (2021)\n\nDisney's queen of mean rockets to the top of the charts – and not just because we're worried about our pups. Stone is a sinful delight as orphaned Estella, who represses her darker side until troubling truths are revealed about her deliciously evil boss (Emma Thompson), and Cruella is born as Estella's highly fashionable, vengeful true self who takes London culture and several posh galas by storm. Loud, brash and even a bit touching, \"Cruella\" chews up the rulebook for a reinvention that's reverential as well as refreshing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/05/23/new-lilo-and-stitch-movie-elvis-music/83767200007/", "title": "Lilo & Stitch: Elvis references, Stitch merch and a visit to Graceland", "text": "AI-assisted summary The 2002 Disney film \"Lilo & Stitch\" introduced a new generation to Elvis Presley through its soundtrack and Elvis-loving main character.\n\nDisney released a live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch\" in 2025, which retains some Elvis elements but de-emphasizes them compared to the original.\n\nStitch made an appearance at Elvis' Graceland estate in Memphis ahead of the premiere of the new \"Lilo & Stitch\" movie.\n\nElvis and Ann-Margret. Elvis and Nancy Sinatra.\n\nThose teams were popular with audiences. But not as popular as Elvis & Lilo & Stitch.\n\nReleased in 2002, Disney's animated feature film \"Lilo & Stitch\" introduced audiences to a lonely young Hawaiian girl and Elvis fan named Lilo, and her new \"pet,\" Stitch, a somewhat dog-esque genetically engineered extraterrestrial who liked to rampage but really yearned for a hug. Together, the duo pursued 'ohana (a Hawaiian term for \"family\") while playing \"Suspicious Minds\" on a portable record player and battling space aliens.\n\nLike Stitch's stolen spaceship when it crash-landed on the island of Kauaʻi, the movie made an impact. It earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature (it lost to Miyazaki's \"Spirited Away,\" as any movie would), and collected $273 million at the international box office. (In comparison, 1964's \"Viva Las Vegas,\" with Elvis and Ann-Margret, earned the equivalent of $94 million, in 2025 dollars.)\n\nOn May 23, Disney released a new \"Lilo & Stitch,\" the latest in its series of more-or-less live-action remakes of beloved animated features (other examples — all with digitally animated characters — include \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Mulan\" and \"Snow White,\" to name a few). Directed by Dean Fleischer Camp (who charmed audiences with the low-budget \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\"), the new \"Lilo\" preserves but de-emphasizes its predecessor's Elvis connection.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nEven so, in the actual live-action world — the world of Disney and Graceland, of marketing and merchandise, of fans of music and movies — Elvis & Lilo & Stitch remain inseparable.\n\n\"The amazing thing is that each generation gets introduced to Elvis in a different way, and for a certain generation, 'Lilo & Stitch' was how they were introduced to Elvis,\" said Angie Marchese, vice president of archives and exhibits at Graceland.\n\n\"Now in their mid-20s, these people became fans because of the Disney movie,\" she said. \"And now there's a whole new generation of kids who will be introduced to Elvis and his music through this new live-action version.\"\n\nPremiere and 'public appearance' at Graceland\n\nOn May 22, the evening before the movie's official release date, Disney hosted an invitation-only screening of the new movie in the 464-seat theater at The Guest House at Graceland, the hotel on Elvis Presley Boulevard that is located just north of the Elvis mansion. Attendees — mostly Elvis fans already connected to Graceland via various mailing lists — packed the house. They snagged free \"Lilo & Stitch\" posters and leis, and posed for selfies against Hawaiian backdrops and alongside larger-than-life Stitch figures, dressed in Elvis garb (there was a \"Blue Hawaii Stitch,\" a \"Jailhouse Rock Stitch,\" and a \"50000000 Million Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong Gold Lamé Suit\" Stitch).\n\nEarlier in the day, an animatronic Stitch in a rhinestone-studded jumpsuit and a miniature motorized pink vehicle toured Graceland, to the surprise and likely delight of fans. \"The lovable renegade alien, who happens to love the music of Elvis Presley, arrived at the gates to Graceland Mansion in a pink convertible before going across the street to view the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll’s jumpsuits and pink Cadillac at Elvis Presley’s Memphis entertainment complex,\" stated a Disney press release about the publicity event. The headline described Stitch as \"Everyone's Favorite Elvis-Loving Alien.\"\n\nThe ballyhoo echoed similar fanfare that heralded the release of the first \"Lilo & Stitch\" 23 years earlier.\n\nIn 2002, the movie's arrival coincided with Graceland's yearlong commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death; Jack Soden, CEO of Elvis Presley Enterprises, told The Commercial Appeal that the release of an Elvis-connected \"classic G-rated Disney flick\" would open \"a powerful market\" for Graceland.\n\nIn 2002 as in 2025, Disney and Graceland hosted an invitation-only local premiere for \"Lilo & Stitch,\" but the earlier event was more elaborate. The screening of the film at Downtown's now-vanished multiplex, the Muvico Peabody Place 22, was followed by what The Commercial Appeal called a \"lavish luau\" in front of the ticket pavilion at Graceland, complete with fire dancers, leis made from actual orchids, bamboo huts and costumed movie characters. Testifying to the event's importance, the guest of honor was longtime Disney executive Roy E. Disney (who died in 2009 at 79), the nephew of Walt Disney, who at the time was vice chairman of the Disney company and chair of Disney Feature Animation.\n\nThe Los Angeles premiere of the 2002 movie had occurred about a week earlier. Priscilla Presley attended, and told reporters that \"Lilo & Stitch\" offered \"a great message to bring family back together again because really, that’s what it’s all about. Elvis was very much a family man, regardless of what you hear. He loved family and he always came home.\"\n\nStitch merch\n\nIn 2025 as in 2002, Disney and Elvis Presley Enterprises are banking on the appeal of \"Lilo & Stitch.\" The gift shops at Graceland now are stuffed with items from the grandiloquently labeled \"Disney Stitch Inspired by Elvis Collection,\" created by NECA, a pop culture collectibles company. Ranging from $12.99 to $34.99, these include plush and plastic figures of all sizes, showcasing Stitch in Elvis garb. Stitch-as-Elvis pins and other items also are available.\n\nMeanwhile, vintage 2002 \"Lilo & Stitch\" collectibles continue to be popular on eBay and elsewhere; these include eight McDonald's Happy Meal toys, one of which presents Stitch in an Elvis jumpsuit, strumming a guitar atop a surfboard.\n\nThe new 'Lilo & Stitch'\n\nThe new \"Lilo & Stitch,\" for the most part, is remarkably faithful to its inspiration, even to the inclusion of a clip from the same B-movie, 1958's \"Earth vs. The Spider.\" But — somewhat surprisingly, in the wake of the hit Baz Luhrmann biopic — the new movie has less Elvis than the old.\n\nYes, the soundtrack showcases the same songs (\"Heartbreak Hotel,\" \"Devil in Disguise,\" \"Hound Dog\"), in basically the same situations (although the remake totally bungles the Stitch-as-record-player \"Suspicious Minds\" scene); but the live-action Lilo (played by Maia Kealoha) is less the Elvis evangelist than was her cartoon counterpart.\n\nIn the first film, Lilo pays Stitch the ultimate compliment: \"You look like an Elvis fan.\" She pulls out an 8-by-10 \"Blue Hawaii\" portrait of Elvis and declares: \"Elvis was a model citizen.\" She adds: \"I have compiled a list of his traits for you to practice.\" This leads to comic scenes of Stitch strumming a guitar while wearing an Elvis-style jumpsuit and pompadour. The film's happily-ever-after end credits include a vacation \"photo\" of Stitch and his new human family posing in front of the gates of Graceland. None of this is in the new movie — although Stitch appears, briefly, in his Elvis jumpsuit during the end credits.\n\nMaybe we'll get more Elvis — for better or worse? — in the sequel. The first direct-to-video feature film followup to the 2002 release was \"Stitch! The Movie\" (which was in turn followed by two sequels and a TV series). Perhaps due to budgetary reason, that 2003 film licensed only one Elvis song, the thematically appropriate but hardly epochal \"Slicin' Sand,\" from 1963's \"Blue Hawaii.\" The lyrics did not give Leiber & Stoller sleepless nights. Encourages Elvis, while serenading a bevy of beauties: \"Dance, dance, dance/ 'til your toes get tan/ We're gonna have us a ball on the beach/ Slicin' sand...\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/05/12/highest-grossing-animated-films/11729384002/", "title": "Highest grossing animated movies: See the top 10 of all time", "text": "While last year's \"Barbie\" dominated the box office, the biggest movie of 2024 is an animated one.\n\nPixar's \"Inside Out 2,\" the sequel to the 2015 hit, made an estimated $155 million in North American ticket sales in its first weekend, making it the biggest debut of the year so far.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe $150 thousand-budget Disney film is the 2019 sequel to \"Frozen,\" which follows Princess Anna and her sister Queen Elsa, whose ice powers place their kingdom in perpetual winter. Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad return in \"Frozen II\" to journey to an enchanted forest to discover the origin of Elsa’s magical powers.\n\nThere’s some debate as to whether \"Frozen II\" deserves the crown of highest-grossing animated film. Disney’s 2019 \"The Lion King\" remastered the original 1994 movie in hyper-realistic CGI. The film made $1.66 billion worldwide, well outpacing Frozen’s sequel.\n\nBut Disney classified the film as live-action, not animated, despite it being nominated for best animated feature at the 2019 Golden Globes. \"The Lion King\" includes one live shot in the film’s opening. Director Jon Favreau told SlashFilms he doesn’t consider it live-action or animated, saying \"to say it’s animated … is misleading.\"\n\nTop 10 highest-grossing animated movies\n\nHere are the highest-grossing animated movies of all time, according to IMDbPro’s Box Office Mojo:\n\nFrozen II (2019): $1.45 billion Frozen (2013): $1.28 billion Incredibles 2 (2018): $1.24 billion Minions (2015); $1.16 billion Toy Story 4 (2019): $1.073 billion Toy Story 3 (2010): $1.067 billion Despicable Me 3 (2017): $1.034 billion Finding Dory (2016): $1.029 billion Zootopia (2016): $1.02 billion Despicable Me 2 (2013): $971 million\n\nHigh-earning movies vary differently depending on what metrics you’re looking at.

Chris Sanders reprises his role as the voice of Stitch.\n\n\"(Galifianakis) is really funny and creative and he just told me to keep going on with my dreams,\" Kealoha recalls. \"Also, Sydney (Agudong) taught me how to be a great big sister now that I have a little brother. She's just a great role model.\"\n\nKealoha says it was \"amazing\" to watch the movie at the premiere and she hopes to act more.\n\n\"I would like to do my own TV show,\" she says confidently. \"Maybe like an action movie or 'M3GAN 3' or maybe a 'Lilo & Stitch 2.' Bing, bang, boom, let's go!\"\n\nKealoha laughs as she makes the \"boom\" noise and animatronic Stitch nods in approval.

The record was previously held by another Disney sequel, \"Frozen II,\" which in 2019 grossed $125 million over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n\"Moana 2\" also broke the record for the biggest five-day opening weekend ever, Disney noted, surpassing \"The Super Mario Bros.

In recent years, several of the company's cartoons underperformed at the box office, including the \"Toy Story\" spin-off \"Lightyear,\" the sci-fi adventure \"Strange World,\" and \"Wish,\" a princess musical celebrating Disney's 100th year anniversary.\n\nSome analysts speculated that Disney had trained audiences to watch its animated films at home by releasing multiple Pixar films directly on Disney+ during the pandemic, and it would therefore be difficult to get families to resume seeing them in theaters.\n\nBut in June, Disney's \"Inside Out 2\" turned things around in a big way, grossing $1.6 billion worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing animated film in history. The question for Disney now is whether families will turn out in theaters for an original animated movie, such as next summer's \"Elio,\" or whether they will reserve their theatergoing for large sequels.\n\nDisney also faced multiple live-action failures last year, from \"The Marvels\" to \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" casting a pall over its 100th anniversary.\n\nBut even outside of animation, the company has fared better in theaters in 2024. Its Marvel brand also rebounded with \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" which set a record for highest grossing R-rated film.\n\nBut \"Moana 2\" represents a unique case of a movie setting box office records after not being intended to play theatrically at all. The sequel was originally imagined as a Disney+ streaming series, but in February, Disney made the surprise announcement that the show would be a theatrical release instead. It was a rare instance of a blockbuster movie being announced and released in the same calendar year.\n\nAfter the success of \"Moana 2\" and \"Inside Out 2,\" audiences can expect Disney to continue doubling down on sequels. Several are already on the way, including \"Zootopia 2,\" \"Toy Story 5,\" \"Frozen 3,\" \"Frozen 4,\" and \"Incredibles 3.\"\n\n\"We're leaning a little bit more into sequels and franchises,\" Disney CEO Bob Iger said during an earnings call earlier this year. \"Given the environment, and given what it takes to get people out of their homes to see a film, doing that, leaning on franchises that are familiar, is actually a smart thing.\"\n\n\"Moana 2\" also teases a possible third film in the series that has not yet been confirmed.

The movie was a hit for Disney in 2016, grossing $687 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. Per Nielsen, it was also the most-viewed film on any streaming service in 2023, surpassing new releases like \"The Super Mario Bros Movie.\"\n\nFor Disney, much is riding on the success of \"Moana 2\" after several of the company's recent animated films, including \"Wish,\" \"Strange World\" and \"Lightyear,\" flopped in theaters.\n\nSee the official poster for 'Moana 2'\n\nBefore the trailer's release, Disney debuted the first official poster for \"Moana 2,\" which shows Maui's fish hook on the beach with Moana in the background.\n\n'Moana 2' plot: What is the sequel about?\n\nIn \"Moana 2,\" Moana receives an \"unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors\" and must \"journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she's ever faced,\" Disney previously shared.\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

But this version of \"Mulan\" – which offers more action, less singing – actually improves a great deal on the fantasy fable of a young Chinese woman (Yifei Liu) who takes the place of her ailing father (Tzi Ma) in the Imperial Army. Mulan is a butt-whupping warrior extraordinaire worth the emotional investment.\n\nWhere to watch: Disney+ (as a $30 premium add-on)\n\nIf you enjoy your entertainment on the existential side: 'I’m Thinking of Ending Things'\n\nThe very strange tale stars Jessie Buckley as a young woman reconsidering her relationship with a fairly new boyfriend (Jesse Plemons) while driving through a snowstorm to visit his oddball parents (Toni Collette and David Thewlis). Its meta-strangeness is let down by chatty ruminations on musical theater and movie reviews, as well as a predictable twist, though it does boast a wonderfully awkward family dinner.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nIf you're in need of a cheesy romantic comedy: 'Love, Guaranteed'\n\n\"She's All That\" fans unite! It's been years since her teen-movie days, yet Rachael Leigh Cook is still all that as a pro bono lawyer needing a cash influx, and she's hired by a charming bachelor (Damon Wayans Jr.) who wants to sue a dating app for its \"guarantee\" of love after 1,000 dates.

You can still get your Maisie Williams thriller fix with this tale of a young woman who gets embroiled in a bad situation with her boyfriend (Ian Kenny) and his ne'er-do-well pals when a house robbery goes wrong and the elderly residents (Sylvester McCoy and Rita Tushingham) come home, turning the tables on the whippersnappers.

The raunchy comedy is a throwback in every way, however, from the return of Shore's 1990s \"Weasel\" persona to a bunch of sexist and homophobic jokes a few decades too late. An engaged couple (Aimee Teegarden and Mike Castle) buys their dream home only to find out that the party-animal squatter (Shore) who won't leave comes with it, beginning a cold war that puts the youngsters' backyard wedding in jeopardy.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV, FandangoNOW, Google Play\n\nIf you've been wondering what Ryan Phillippe has been up to: 'The 2nd'\n\nThe thriller casts Phillippe as a Secret Service agent picking up his son (Jack Griffo) from college for holiday break when a hostage situation breaks out and a mysterious antagonist (Casper Van Dien) aims to nab the daughter (Lexi Simonsen) of a Supreme Court Justice about to weigh in on an important gun-rights case. It's a decent action movie done no favors by a ham-fisted political bent.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV, Vudu, FandangoNOW\n\nIf your heart still breaks over Robin Williams: 'Robin’s Wish'\n\nThe iconic funnyman's suicide in 2014 shocked everyone, from fans to his family, and this moving documentary digs into the whys: Williams had been suffering from a debilitating condition called diffuse Lewy body dementia, which wasn't diagnosed until his autopsy.

But she won't be alone.\n\nWalt Disney Studio's decision last week to fast-track a Mulan remake sends a clear message: Girl power is a major priority in the studio's push to retell its famed animated catalog in a live-action format.\n\nMulan (in theaters Nov. 2, 2018) joins strong heroine company. 2014's Maleficent featured Angelina Jolie and a twist on 1959's animated Sleeping Beauty. Live-action Cinderella followed in 2015 and the upcoming Beauty and the Beast, with Emma Watson as Belle, is one of the most anticipated films of 2017.\n\n\"We don't have a lot of female heroes onscreen, but this has become a strong cog in the Disney live-action machine,\" says Jeff Bock, box office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. That the studio is remaking Mulan, not one of its biggest animated hits, illustrates the priority being placed on lead heroines, he says.\n\n\"Marvel’s superheroes are Captain America, Thor and Iron Man,\" says Sean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios motion picture production. \"And ours are Cinderella and Maleficent, Belle and Mulan.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhy 'Mulan' is hands down the best Disney cartoon of the '90s\n\nDisney has plans to remake male hero-centric animated hits such as The Lion King and a sequel to this summer's hit The Jungle Book. But the immediate live-action remake calendar features Beauty and the Beast (March 17), Mulan (conducting a global search for its director and female star, as fans lobby on the Internet for appropriately Asian casting) and Mary Poppins Returns (December 25, 2018, with Emily Blunt as the beloved nanny).\n\nThis heroine surge can be sourced to 2010's Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton's retelling of the 1951 animated tale with Mia Wasikowska as a plucky Alice. Disney executives took notice when it raked in close to $335 million at the U.S. box office.\n\n\"It was a billion-dollar movie (worldwide) with Alice at the center. More than box-office success, it gave insight into storytelling possibilities,\" says Bailey. Maleficent, with Jolie attached as the evil fairy who casts the spell on Princess Aurora, was already in development, but \"empowered female live-action movies became more of a strategic priority.\"\n\nSurprise! Angelina Jolie to return for 'Maleficent 2'\n\nMaleficent and Cinderella became well-regarded successes, breathing new life into antiquated storylines. Jolie told USA TODAY that her Maleficent gave a new dimension to the Sleeping Beauty baddie, showing \"people can be villainous and still, there is much more to them to understand.\"\n\nLily James found her prince in the updated retelling of 1950's Cinderella. \"But this Cinderella wasn’t a damsel in distress. She could save herself,\" says Alicia Malone, correspondent for the movie ticket website Fandango.com. \"Beyond seeing these characters onscreen, there are modern, empowering messages for girls.\"\n\nThere have been missteps in Disney's heroine live-action climb, such as this summer's sequel bomb Alice Through the Looking Glass, which earned a fraction (less than $300 million worldwide) of the original's haul. \"But that was sequel fatigue and story problems,\" says Malone. \"Not a downward audience trend.\"\n\nDisney will continue this strong female movement with undated projects already in the pipeline, including a live-action Little Mermaid for 2017 with Lin-Manuel Miranda and Alan Menken collaborating musically. Jolie will star in a Maleficent sequel, with a screenplay underway, and Reese Witherspoon is slated to star in a live-action Tinker Bell film.\n\n\"We love the empowered heroine,\" says Bailey. \"There are a lot of great characters here. We have a deep bench.\"\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/11/12/disney-plus-marvel-star-wars-fare-little-bingeing/2515657001/", "title": "Disney+: Has Marvel and Star Wars, no R-rated fare, little bingeing", "text": "BURBANK, Calif. – The company that got its fame from a 1928 silent cartoon short featuring an animated mouse is betting the bank on a new streaming future with Disney+, which launches Tuesday.\n\nDisney CEO and Chairman Robert Iger calls the new subscription video service \"the biggest project\" undertaken by the company under his tenure. The entertainment giant invested $1 billion in programming alone, in an attempt to make Disney+ a must buy for consumers.\n\nHow so? For starters, all movies produced by Disney from 2019 and beyond – such as \"Frozen 2\" and \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" – will air exclusively on Disney+ after their theatrical and home video runs. To stoke demand for the service, those movies are unlikely to air anytime soon on Disney-owned ABC, the Disney Channel, the Freeform or FX channels, or any other pay cable network.\n\nDisney+ launch:Here's everything you need to know about new streaming service\n\nDisney+ (DisneyPlus.com), which went live early today, is stocked with nearly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from shows within its core brands.\n\nThat's evident in its Apple-influenced interface (at least as seen on Roku early Tuesday morning). There's a black backdrop, where the iTunes movies and TV shows menus had gray and pastel-colored backgrounds – dominated by those five logos: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. The latter is among Disney's most recent acquisition, 21st Century Fox, which includes National Geographic.\n\nClick any of the icons and you'll be transported to an area devoted to that studio's content. The Disney section welcomes you with the familiar animation of the Magic Castle; the Pixar section with its iconic bouncing desk lamp.\n\nBillboarded atop those icons are clickable suggested jewels from the Disney's abundance of content riches: \"Avatar,\" \"Avengers: Endgame,\" \"The Simpsons,\" \"Captain Marvel,\" and new entrants created exclusively for Disney+ such as \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.\"\n\nSimilar to Netflix and Amazon's video streaming services, Disney+ has categories such as \"Recommended For You,\" \"Hit Movies,\" \"Trending,\" \"Continue Watching,\" \"Originals,\" and – here's where Disney will shine – \"Out of the Vault.\"\n\nJust browse along the offerings from Disney's vault: \"The Lion King,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"The Little Mermaid,\" \"The Jungle Book,\" \"Cinderella,\" \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" The list goes on. It's a whole new world of streaming ... if you are a lover of all things Disney.\n\nBut not everything created by Disney's roster of studios will appear on its new streaming rival to Netflix.\n\nDisney+ will not show films that are R-rated, for instance. \"There will be nothing on Disney+ that’s not branded or family friendly,\" Kevin Mayer, the chairman of Disney's direct to consumer division, said during a recent preview event at the Disney studios here.\n\nInstead, Disney is positioning Hulu as the adult streaming alternative to Disney+, and it will likely be the home, Mayer says, for R-rated content such as the \"Deadpool\" films, produced by Fox but starring Marvel characters.\n\nHulu, begun as primarily a consortium of three broadcast networks – NBC, ABC and Fox – is now majority-owned by Disney. Fox's stake was part of Disney's $71 billion acquisition of the Fox movie and TV studios, which became official earlier this year. Also earlier this year, the Disney-controlled Hulu paid $1.4 billion for the 9.5% stake owned by AT&T.\n\nAlso, for completists, there are a few selections currently absent in the Disney+ library including \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi,\" and \"Solo: A Star Wars Story.\" But those titles will find their home in the service soon, Disney says.\n\nAt the preview, journalists got to try out the Disney+ app on iPads, iPhones and Apple TV. A search through the Disney animated film classics showed most of the expected titles mentioned above – but not the controversial \"Song of the South,\" long derided by critics as a racist revisionist history of slaves in the south.\n\nHowever, Disney is chock full of content from the library, including the old Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons, live-action nature documentaries produced by Walt Disney in the 1950s, a new live-action Star Wars series, \"The Mandalorian,\" new reboots of Disney Channel fare like \"Lizzie McGuire\" and \"High School Musical\" and a new, live-action re-do of \"Lady and the Tramp,\" featuring real dogs in place of the animated characters.\n\nWhat you won't be able to do on Disney+, at least at launch, is binge on multiple episodes of new series, as you can on Netflix. New episodes will drop, one by one, each Friday at 12:01 a.m. PT.\n\nHow spoiled us bingers are was immediately apparent early Tuesday after the end of the first episode of \"The Mandalorian.\" The well-paced and impressive first episode will likely leave viewers wanting an immediate second helping of the Star Wars-based series. Instead, viewers might be suggested a revisiting of 1980's \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"\n\nSome good news: Folks who start watching Tuesday will get two episodes of new shows this week, with the second airing on Friday.\n\nDisney+ costs $6.99 monthly, an aggressive price move that's almost half of the most popular tier for No. 1 streamer Netflix, and $2 more than Apple TV +, which just launched Nov. 1.\n\nThe family-oriented channel is also available as a bundle, with ESPN+ and Hulu, for $12.99 monthly. New customers to Verizon cable TV, broadband or cellular service can get Disney+ free for one year, too.\n\nDisney+ will be available on most of the usual streaming devices, including Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Google Chromecast and assorted TVs with smart TV functionality.\n\nDisney executives predict the new service will have between 60 million to 90 million subscribers by 2024, and that Hulu, now at 28 million subscribers, will grow to 40 to 60 million subscribers.\n\nMike Snider reported from Tysons Corner, Virginia.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham & Mike Snider on Twitter @jeffersongraham & @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/12"}]}

His victory would be a big blow to the pro-Western government, many of whose leading members have been tainted by corruption allegations.\n\nDodon, who favors closer ties with Moscow, tapped into widespread dissatisfaction with high-level graft under the pro-European government that came to power in 2009. A former Communist Party member, he has pledged to \"restore broad and friendly ties with Russia.\"\n\nWith about 95 percent of the votes counted, Dodon had 49.29 percent of the vote, election authorities said. If no candidate secures more than 50 percent of the votes, there will be a runoff on Nov. 13 between the top two candidates.\n\nDodon said he was hopeful that he would still win in the first round when all the votes were counted.\n\n\"I consider our victory inevitable and everyone should understand this including our political opponents,\" he told reporters at the Socialist Party's headquarters in the capital Chisinau hours after polls closed.\n\nMaia Sandu, an ex-World Bank economist and a pro-European figure who has vowed to be tough with endemic corruption, was in second place with 37.42 percent of the vote. Nine candidates ran for the post, the first time Moldovans have elected a president in 20 years to lead the ex-Soviet republic.\n\n\"Whatever the results, we want to change the political class and we will continue with this project,\" Sandu said, speaking to reporters at the offices of the Action and Solidarity Party which she leads. \"When I say change I mean real change. Let's get rid of all the corrupt people and bring new people with integrity.\"\n\nDodon also has vowed to federalize Moldova to include the breakaway eastern region of Trans-Dniester, which gets military and economic support from Russia.\n\nBut analysts say there are unlikely to be major shifts in foreign policy even if Dodon wins. Moldova's president has limited powers and all major policies must be approved by Parliament, which is dominated by pro-European parties. The popular election, however, could bring the post more influence and authority.\n\nBoth the European Union, together with the U.S. and Russia, seek to have more influence over the impoverished agricultural nation of 3.5 million. Moldova is landlocked between EU member Romania and Ukraine.\n\nElection authorities said turnout was 48.92 percent when polls closed at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT).\n\nMoldova was thrown into political turmoil in 2014 with the disappearance of more than $1 billion from the banking system. Weeks of street protests followed and six prime ministers took office in one year.\n\n\"This day is important for Moldova. It will be a new beginning. I voted against those who have been in power for seven years, against the oligarchs and the looting of the banking system,\" Dodon said.\n\nAndrei Boico, a 53-year-old worker, said he thought that if Dodon was elected, Moscow would lift a trade embargo on fruit, vegetables and wine that it placed on Moldova in 2014 in retaliation after it signed an association agreement with the EU.\n\n\"I think we need to revise our relations with Russia,\" Boico said. \"Without good relations ... we can't have economic growth.\"\n\nSandu is the preferred option for those who want Moldova to join the European mainstream.\n\nValentina Cretu, a 41-year-old businesswoman, said she supported Sandu because she had pledged to fight corruption and move closer to the EU.\n\n\"Without the EU, Moldova can't get rid of poverty and corruption,\" Cretu said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/30"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/960694/turkeys-knife-edge-election", "title": "Turkey's knife-edge election | The Week", "text": "Turkey heads to the polls next week for the most tightly contested and important presidential election in a generation.\n\nThe vote on 14 May, which coincides with parliamentary elections, could define the course of the country for decades and have huge ramifications for the region, the war in Ukraine and the future course of Nato and the European Union.\n\nA reported case of gastroenteritis has “disrupted Erdogan’s attempts to seize momentum in the run-up to Turkey’s most important election in generations”, said Al Jazeera.

If no one reaches the majority threshold a second-round run-off is held between the two highest-polling candidates, this year scheduled for 28 May.\n\nAccording to Politico, 2023 is “expected to be the most hotly contested race in Erdogan’s 20-year rule” as he faces a neck-and-neck race against the main opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) and presidential nominee for the six-party Nation Alliance bloc.\n\nThe 74-year-old Kilicdaroglu “cuts a starkly different figure than the incumbent” said The Independent. “Where Erdogan is a mesmerising orator, the unassuming Kemal Kilicdaroglu is soft spoken,” the paper added. As the “polarising Erdogan has grown increasingly authoritarian, Kilicdaroglu has built a reputation as a bridge builder and vows to restore democracy,” The Independent continued. This has earned him the nickname the “Turkish Gandhi”.\n\nHaving defied expectations to unite the opposition behind him, polls give Kilicdaroglu a “slight edge” but there are many intangibles that could sway the result either way.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nA record turnout is predicated this year with nearly five million first-time voters, many of whom have only ever known Erdogan as leader, expected to cast their ballot. “Turkey’s demographics are also expected to play a role”, said CNN, with most of the provinces struck by the February earthquake being strongholds of Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP), leading to claims that at least a million displaced voters could be denied the chance to vote.\n\nIn his favour is the decision by former presidential candidate and centrist Homeland Party leader Muharrem Ince to stand, potentially drawing enough votes away from Kilicdaroglu to carry Erdogan through to a run-off. The Financial Times reported Erdogan is “counting on diaspora support as he battles to cling to power”, courting German Turks and increasing the number of polling stations across Europe in search of votes. There is also a big unknown around supporters of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), which has backed Kilicdaroglu and are expected to play a “decisive role” in the elections, said CNN.\n\nThe parliamentary elections are also too close to call, although Erdogan’s AKP currently holds a slight lead.\n\nWhere will the election be decided?\n\nIn the 20 years since coming to power, Erdogan and AKP have “left a deep mark on the country – expanding the role of Islam in the traditionally secular state and growing Turkey’s influence abroad”, said Foreign Policy. “But years of unorthodox economic policy and a deadly February earthquake have undermined confidence in the government, leading many voters to question the reputation for competent administration that has traditionally been central to the AKP’s appeal.”\n\nEven before the earthquake, Turkey had been struggling with a long-running currency crisis that last year saw inflation hit 85%. Voters also list the country’s slide into authoritarianism as a key concern. Tapping into these fears, The Independent said the Nation Alliance has “vowed to roll back Erdogan’s efforts to concentrate vast powers in the president’s hands” while the coalition has also pledged “to reinstate a parliamentary democracy with checks and balances, to return to more conventional economic policies and to fight corruption”.\n\nErdogan has instead “focused on listing his achievements, including the construction of millions of new houses, and his push to resurrect Turkey’s military might”, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIf, as current polls suggest, Erdogan loses the vote by a small margin, “it opens up the possibility for him to contest the results”, said CNN, “and if past experience is a gauge, then the president and his AK Party may not take a defeat lying down”.\n\n“Much of the anxiety surrounding Turkey’s presidential contest – and how Erdogan will respond to its results – is a consequence of his unique position in Turkish political history,” said Foreign Policy. “It is hard to imagine Erdogan gracefully accepting defeat because it would be unprecedented: no Turkish president has ever been directly voted out of office”.\n\nWere he to cling on to power, “the fear in the West is that he will see this as his moment to push toward an increasingly religiously conservative model, characterised by regional confrontationalism, with greater political powers centred around himself,” said Politico.\n\nThe news site added that the election “will also weigh heavily on security in Europe and the Middle East”. The candidate who is elected “stands to define: Turkey’s role in the NATO alliance; its relationship with the US, the EU and Russia; migration policy; Ankara’s role in the war in Ukraine; and how it handles tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean”, it concluded.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/29/politics/us-midterm-elections-explainer", "title": "How US midterm elections work | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhether you’re the most hardened of political junkies or you only tune in every other November to vote, it’s always a good idea to brush up on some of the terms you hear thrown around during election season and remind yourself who is up for election and how CNN assesses these races. Here are the answers to some basic questions a lot of people might be asking.\n\nWhen is Election Day?\n\nUS elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November every other year. Election Day 2022 is on November 8.\n\nWho can vote?\n\nMost American citizens who are 18 and over can vote. There are exceptions, such as for people convicted of a felony, although they can vote in certain states.\n\nDoes a voter need to be registered?\n\nVoter registration is required in every state but North Dakota. The deadline for voter registration varies. Some states require registration around a month before Election Day. Many now allow people to register on Election Day.\n\nWho can vote early?\n\nMost states now offer some form of early voting, either by mail or in person. The rules vary by state.\n\nWhich states vote by mail?\n\nEight US states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington — and the District of Columbia mail every voter a ballot. Some others allow early voting for everyone, and others require an excuse, although almost anyone can do some form of early voting.\n\n\n\nWhy are only a third of senators up for election?\n\nSenators serve six-year terms, and there are federal elections every two years. The seats are broken up into three classes, and about a third of the Senate is on the ballot every two years. The 2022 election features Class III senators. See the race ratings by Inside Elections.\n\n\n\nWhy are all 435 House members up for election every two years?\n\nThe House of Representatives is the piece of the federal government that is closest to the people. Putting House members up for election every two years allows voters more direct and immediate control of the direction of their government.\n\nWhat is a “flipped seat” or “pickup”?\n\nA flipped seat or pickup is one in the House or Senate that voters take from one party and entrust to the other party. Because of redistricting, nine House seats – including seven new seats where there is no incumbent and two where two incumbents are running against each other – cannot be classified as pickups for either party.\n\nWhy does the number of gubernatorial races fluctuate every cycle?\n\nEach state treats its governors slightly differently. Forty-eight of the 50 US states elect governors to four-year terms. Two states, New Hampshire and Vermont, elect governors to two-year terms. Most states, 36 of them, hold their governor elections in midterm election years between presidential elections. Three states, Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana, elect governors in off-year elections the year before a presidential election. Two states, New Jersey and Virginia, elect governors in off-year elections the year after a presidential election.\n\nWhat is an “incumbent?”\n\nAn incumbent is a lawmaker or elected official running for reelection.\n\nWhat is a special election?\n\nWhen a senator retires, dies or leaves office before his or her term ends, the state’s governor usually appoints a placeholder to fill the seat. Then there’s often a chance for voters to have their say, usually at the next possible federal election. That’s how Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia were first elected in 2020 in special elections and why in 2022 both men are running for a full six-year term.\n\nThis year, there are special Senate elections in Oklahoma, where Republican Sen. James Inhofe will be resigning next year, and in California, where Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla, who was appointed to replace Vice President Kamala Harris, is running both to fill the remainder of Harris’ term (which ends in January) and to win the next term.\n\nHouse members cannot be appointed, so when a House seat becomes vacant there needs to be a special election to fill it. This year, there’s a special election in Indiana to serve the last couple months of Rep. Jackie Walorski’s term. Walorski died in August.\n\nWhat is ranked-choice voting?\n\nA number of cities and states are experimenting with ways to give voters more access to the political process and to potentially depolarize politics. Ranked-choice voting is a system in place for most elections in Maine and Alaska where voters rank their choices in order of preference instead of picking a single candidate. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, the bottom candidate is dropped and the second choice of the voters who selected that candidate gets those votes. That process repeats until a winner emerges.\n\nWhat does “estimated vote” mean?\n\nBased on data including turnout in previous elections, pre-election ballots cast or requested, and pre-election polling, organizations can anticipate how many votes are expected in a given election. An estimated vote can under- or overestimate the actual vote, and the percentage reporting may move up or down throughout Election Night depending on how those estimates are adjusted as analysts assess real-time data. As those estimates solidify, they can be useful in predicting how many votes remain to be counted.\n\nWhat are exit polls?\n\nExit polls are large-scale polls conducted by a consortium of news organizations among early and absentee voters and voters on Election Day. They are conducted as voters leave polling stations, on Election Day and in many states at early voting locations, and also by telephone or online ahead of Election Day to account for mail-in and early voting.\n\nWhat does “down ballot” mean?\n\nThe top of the ticket is the race that the largest number of people in a state will see on their ballot. In a presidential year, those candidates are at the top of the ticket. Candidates in more local races are down ballot. A candidate for the House, for example, is down ballot from a presidential candidate. A mayoral candidate is down ballot from a House candidate.\n\nHow can CNN project a race without any votes in?\n\nThis is a task CNN takes very seriously. Based on previous election results, exit polling, recent opinion polls, early voter turnout and other factors, it is sometimes possible to see that one particular candidate will win a race. If there is any chance of an upset, CNN will refrain from projecting a race.\n\nHow does CNN make projections?\n\nUsing a mix of many factors, including current and previous election results, real-time exit polling, recent opinion polls, voter registration data and more, CNN’s decision desk is frequently able to reliably project that a candidate has received enough support to win. It is a projection, however, and not the final word. State officials and courts have the official say.\n\nWhat is a ballot initiative? How does a state decide to put one on the ballot?\n\nWhile most laws are passed by state legislatures or Congress, many states put some questions directly to voters during elections. These can range from issues like marijuana legalization to abortion or tax measures. The ballot initiatives give voters a more active role in choosing the direction of their laws.\n\nWhat is a CNN “key race”? Who decides that?\n\n“Key race” is a subjective term. Most politics watchers generally agree that only a subset of races is truly competitive in November, and these are generally considered the key races. Political parties spend more money on these races. Reporters spend more time covering them.\n\nOf the 35 Senate races on the ballot in 2022, the election forecasters at Inside Elections consider three to be true toss-ups and another four to tilt toward either Republicans or Democrats. Nineteen House races are true toss-ups, although many more could wind up being closely contested. Five governor races are toss-ups. See the Inside Elections ratings for Senate, House and governor. Key races can also be races that might be less competitive but have broader implications or feature especially notable candidates.\n\nWhat is the balance of power?\n\nPolitical parties have more power when they control the House or Senate by winning a majority of the seats in that chamber. The party in power controls committees that write legislation and decides which measures will get a vote on the floor. In the House, the party with at least 218 seats has the majority and, assuming it can unite behind one candidate, selects the Speaker of the House. In the Senate, the party with 51 votes has the majority.\n\nHow does the vice president tiebreaker work in the Senate?\n\nThe vice president’s official duty is to serve as president of the Senate, although few modern vice presidents have spent much of their time on Capitol Hill. In votes where there is a tie, the vice president can cast a tiebreaking vote. In the current Senate, where there is an even split of Republican and Democratic votes (two independents currently in the Senate usually side with Democrats), the vice president’s tiebreaking vote also gives Democrats control of the chamber.\n\nWill we know who wins on Election Day?\n\nDon’t count on final answers in every race on election night. With so many people voting early and by mail and so many close elections, there’s a good chance that it will take days or weeks to figure out who won some races. The margins of power in both the House and Senate are close enough that it could take days to know who will have a majority of seats.", "authors": ["Zachary B. Wolf Ethan Cohen", "Zachary B.

Although she’s still in pursuit of her first-ever Olympic gold medal, Smith said she’s “thrilled” to add more hardware to her collection, no matter the color. Team USA also picked up silver medals in shooting and equestrian team jumping, in addition to bronze medals in sailing and archery to bring the U.S. Olympic medal count to 43.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. men’s national soccer team was knocked out by Morocco in a 4-0 loss on Friday, ending the team’s best run in the Olympics in almost 25 years. The men's 3x3 basketball team, on the other hand, picked up its first two wins of the Paris Games against China and France after suffering four straight losses.\n\nCatch up on everything that went down Friday with USA TODAY Sports' highlights and more from throughout the day.\n\nDo future Olympics become hunt for those who are different?\n\nPARIS – There’s a term we use a lot in sports for people who have a natural gift so unique, and so far above what we expect to see even from the best athletes in their field, that they immediately stand out as different.\n\nWe call them freaks.\n\nI’ve been thinking about that a lot ever since the usual bad-faith actors began to attack a young woman – yes, woman – from Algeria, needing little more than a short video clip, a vague piece of propaganda from a discredited and Russian-backed sports organization and their own biases about what a female body is supposed to look like. - Dan Wolken\n\nRead Dan Wolken's column on boxer Imane Khelif\n\nCaeleb Dressel isn't the swimmer he was in Tokyo, and that's OK\n\nCaeleb Dressel, the American swimming superstar of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, stood bare-chested, just off the pool deck, earnestly trying to put into words what had just happened to him over 45 minutes Friday night at the Paris Olympics.\n\n“I’d like to be performing better,” he said. “I’m not. I trained to go faster than the times I’m going. I know that so, yeah, it’s tough, a little heartbreaking, a little heartbreaking for sure.”\n\nIn the final of the men’s 50 freestyle, an event in which he set the Olympic record in winning the gold medal at the last Olympics, Dressel finished a disappointing sixth. His time of 21.61 seconds was well off the 21.07 he swam three years ago, and also slower than the 21.41 he swam at the U.S. trials in June. - Christine Brennan\n\nRead Christine Brennan's column here.\n\nIce Cube challenges Olympic 3x3 basketball winner to play Big3\n\nThe United States is struggling more than expected in the 3x3 basketball competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and Ice Cube believes he has the solution. The rapper and actor, who founded the Big3 basketball league seven years ago, thinks his best players need to be included when the Olympics come to Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nIce Cube is so confident about this that Friday, during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show,” he challenged the gold medal winner in men’s 3x3 basketball this year to a high-stakes exhibition game later this month before the Big3’s championship game takes place in Boston on Aug. 18.\n\nMcAfee offered to give the winning team $100,000. Ice Cube pledged to pay all expenses and chip in additional money for the winning team. - Mark Gionnotto\n\nRegan Smith thrilled with silver, will keep fighting for gold\n\nNANTERRE, France — With six Olympic medals over two Games, American swimmer Regan Smith has the kind of hardware that would make any Olympic hopeful or daydreaming wannabe envious.\n\nHer five silvers, including three at the Paris Olympics, and a bronze are more than enough for her to be proud of, with strong times accompanying them. That’s how she said she felt after silver No. 4 in the women’s 200-meter butterfly Thursday, and again after silver No. 5 in the 200-meter backstroke Friday.\n\n\"If I had gotten a silver medal and I had been a second slower, I think I would have been really disappointed in myself because that wasn't putting my best foot forward, that wasn't what I was capable of doing,\" Smith said about the 200 back final and the second time she finished behind Australian gold medalist Kaylee McKeown.\n\n\"So I think you get to 2:04.2 – that’s one of my fastest times ever, and I think I really gave Kaylee a run for it, and I made things really close and exciting.

Mateta scored in the fifth minute Friday, and goalkeeper Guillame Restes made four saves to secure the 1-0 win that sent France into the semifinals of the Olympic men’s tournament.\n\nMichael Olise appeared to give France a second goal in the 81st minute but it was disallowed after VAR determined there had been a foul in the buildup.\n\nThe hosts will now play Egypt on Tuesday in Lyon after Egypt beat Paraguay on penalties.\n\nIn the other semifinal, Morocco will face Spain on Tuesday in Marseille.

The Netherlands' Manon Veenstra (34.954 seconds) won silver and Switzerland's Zoe Claessens took bronze in a match attended by French president Emmanuel Macron.\n\nWilloughby (36.171 seconds) got off to a fast start but got caught in traffic on the first turn and couldn't catch Sakakibara, who won all three of her semifinal heats and was the No. 1 seed in the finals.\n\n\"It was just a tough one, it's a tough one to swallow,\" Willoughby said. \"I thought I rose to the occasion and unfortunately the turn was what it was and it's kind of just racing action.

After the race, a jovial Fisher, 27, took a victory lap around Stade de France with the American flag draped over his shoulders and a smile stretched across his face.\n\nIt was the first medal in the 10,000 meters for Team USA since Galen Rupp won the silver at the 2012 London Olympics. - Lindsay Schnell\n\nRent paid, but USA's Veronica Fraley falls short in discus qualifying\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France − Team USA women's discus thrower Veronica Fraley let it fly in the right frame of mind Friday, but it didn't fly quite far enough. Fraley's best throw among three went 62.54 meters (205.2 feet), leaving her ranked 13th in qualifying, one spot short of a 12-team field for medal finals.\n\nAs recently as a couple days ago, she wasn't sure the right frame of mind would even be possible.\n\nThe Vanderbilt student, who will graduate later this month with her second masters degree, made news via social media Thursday with some honesty about her personal finances that proved to stir the right people. She took to her X account to reveal that Vanderbilt had only assisted with 75% of her rent, and rapper Flavor Flav and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian came to the immediate rescue with a pledge to get Fraley's shortfall covered. As it turned out, they not only covered her rent for the month, they picked up the tab for the remainder of the year. - Chase Goodbread\n\nUSA's Valarie Allman dominates in discus qualifying\n\nTeam USA's Valarie Allman blew away the field Friday in the Paris Olympics women's discus qualifying, unleashing a throw of 69.59 meters on her first attempt that proved to be the best distance of the competition. Allman knew she wouldn't have to make her second or third attempts immediately, turning to the back of the cage and acknowledging fans with two arms raised high.\n\nThe automatic qualifying distance was 64.0 meters, but only six of 12 athletes who reached the finals surpassed it. Allman, who won gold in the event at the Tokyo Games in 2021, looked primed for back-to-back gold medals, beating the next best throw of the day by 3.96 meters (Sandra Elkasevic, Croatia). Medal finals of the women's discus throw will be held Aug. 5. - Chase Goodbread\n\nBMX racer Kye White leaves on stretcher after Olympic crash\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – BMX racer Kye Whyte of Great Britain was taken off the course on a stretcher after crashing in the second run of men’s semifinals Friday at the Paris Olympics.\n\nWhyte was injured seconds into his second run of the night when he clipped the back tire of another racer after the first jump.\n\nWhyte finished fifth in Heat 2 of the first run of the semifinals in a time of 38.808 seconds. He won silver in BMX racing at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAmerican racer Kamren Larsen also crashed in his second run of the semifinals. Larsen walked off the course under his own power after the crash, which occurred when he hit the elbow of another rider on the first turn.\n\nAll three Americans advance to final in shot put\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Ryan Crouser, Joe Kovacs and Payton Otterdahl advanced to Saturday’s men’s shot put final.\n\nCrouser threw 70 feet, 6¼ inches on his first attempt and exited the qualifying round. Otterdahl stopped after his first attempt of 70 feet, 7¼ inches was good enough to advance.\n\nKovacs took all three first-round throws, but qualified with a toss of 69 feet, 8¼ inches.\n\nItaly’s Leonardo Fabbri’s throw of 71 feet, 4¾ inches was the best mark of the opening round.\n\nThe men’s shot put final is Saturday at 1:35 p.m. ET.\n\nCrouser, the two-time Olympic champion, is trying to become the first shot putter ever to win three Olympic gold medals in the event. - Tyler Dragon\n\n2 Americans advance in women's 800\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Two Americans have advanced to the semifinals of the women’s 800, with Nia Akins and Juliette Whittaker finishing in second and third, respectively, in their 800 heats.\n\nAkins ran a 1:59.67 and Whittaker finished in 2:00.45, good enough for 17th and 28th overall in the six total heats.\n\nThe 800 was the surprise race of the 2024 Olympic track and field trials, held in Eugene, Oregon. There, defending gold medalist Athing Mu, whose long, loping stride is as recognizable as her megawatt smile, tripped and fell, finishing last. Mu and her coaches filed multiple protests but they were denied, along with her appeal. Though eligible, she was not selected for 4x400 relay pool either.\n\nAmerican Allie Wilson, who finished sixth in her heat (1:59.69) advanced to the repechage round, a new feature at the Paris Olympics. What is the repechage round, you ask? Let us explain. -Lindsay Schnell\n\nCaeleb Dressel doesn't qualify for 100 butterfly final\n\nCaeleb Dressel had a tough day in the pool Friday.\n\nDressel finished in sixth place off the podium in the 50-meter freestyle, an event he won gold in at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Nearly 40-minutes later, Dressel was back in the pool for the men’s 100-meter butterfly semifinals, another event he brought home gold in at the Tokyo Games. However, Dressel didn’t qualify for the final after finishing fifth in his semifinal heat at 51.57. He did not advance with his time either.\n\nDressel was visibly upset after not qualifying for the final to defend his title.\n\nIt ended a busy day for Dressel. Earlier Friday, he raced for Team USA in the mixed 4x100-meter medley relay heats. Dressel will have another chance in the pool in the mixed 4x100-meter medley relay final on Saturday. - Cydney Henderson\n\nFrance's Leon Marchand wins fourth gold\n\nFrench swimmer Leon Marchand is golden, again.\n\nMarchand picked up his fourth Olympic gold medal in the pool on Friday by winning the 200-meter individual medley and nearly set a world record in the process. Marchand finished just 0.06 seconds off American Ryan Lochte’s world record set in 2011. Marchand’s time of 1:54.06 was still good for an Olympic record.\n\nMarchand becomes only the fourth swimmer in Olympic history to win four individual gold medals at a single Olympic Games, joining Americans Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and German swimmer Kristin Otto.\n\nPhelps and French president Emmanuel Macron were among the spectators in the crowd cheering on Marchand. And despite the world watching, Marchand said he was “more relaxed than usual.” Why? “Because I’ve won like three gold medals before,” he said.\n\nGreat Britain’s Duncan Scott finished with silver and China’s Wang Shun got bronze. American Carson Foster finished just off the podium in fourth place. - Cydney Henderson\n\nKaylee McKeown sweeps backstroke gold; Regan Smith takes silver\n\nNANTERRE, France — Australian star Kaylee McKeown swept the women’s backstroke events at the Olympics for the second consecutive Games, winning Friday’s 200-meter backstroke final with a time of 2:03.73, an Olympic record.\n\nShe also won the women’s 100-meter backstroke — she finished ahead of Team USA’s Regan Smith with silver — earlier this week and was golden in both events three years ago at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nSmith finished second to win silver with a 2:04.26 race, while Canadian Kylie Masse was fast enough for bronze. - Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nCameron McEvoy wins 50 free; Caeleb Dressel finishes sixth\n\nNANTERRE, France — The title of fastest swimmer in the world now belongs to Australia's Cameron McEvoy, Friday’s Olympic gold medalist in the men’s 50-meter freestyle, the shortest and fastest event in the pool.\n\nMcEvoy won with a time of 21.25 in a race that’s all about brute strength and power. He out-touched Benjamin Proud of Great Britain, who won silver, and France's Florent Manaudou, who won bronze.\n\nTeam USA’s three-time Olympian Caeleb Dressel, 27 — who was the defending Olympic champion in the 50, one of his eight total gold medals — finished sixth. - Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nOlympic golf desperately needs a team format. Here's a proposal.\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – This has been great, but something is missing.\n\nSure, the American men’s golfers at this week’s Olympics tournament, like other countries, have been wearing the same outfits and the Team USA hats.\n\nBut they aren’t a team. Not really. Not when it counts.\n\nThey are competing for an individual prize only. Short of practice rounds together earlier this week, the Americans’ routines haven’t been different from any other golf tournament.\n\nThere's no camaraderie, and that’s a shame. - Gentry Estes\n\nRead the full column from Gentry Estes\n\nImane Khelif had to hide soccer training\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif, ensnarled in an Olympics controversy surrounding gender eligibility, said earlier this year in an interview with UNICEF that it was her ability to dodge punches from boys that led her to take up boxing.\n\nKhelif said that as a teenager she \"excelled\" at soccer, though boys in the rural village of Tiaret in western Algeria where she grew up teased and threatened her about it. Soccer was not a sport for girls, they said.\n\nRead the full story from USA TODAY's Kim Hjelmgaard.\n\nOlympics men's basketball quarterfinals update\n\nUSA, Canada, Germany, France, Australia and Brazil have qualified for the quarterfinals of the men’s 5x5 basketball event, the final two spots will be determined by the result of Saturday’s game between Serbia-South Sudan.\n\nThe winner of Serbia-South Sudan advances to the quarterfinals, and the loser of that game will be in a tiebreaker scenario with Greece for the final spot in the quarters.\n\nPoint differential is the tiebreaker, and Greece, which is done with group play, is minus-8 in that department. Headed into their game Saturday, Serbia is plus-15 and South Sudan minus-6.

He handed the baton off to Little in first place. Little extended Team USA’s lead and got the baton to Deadmon. Deadmon widened the lead and Brown took the race home with a world-record time of 3:07.41.\n\nFrance ran a 3:10.60 to advance in second place and Belgium’s 3:10.74 was good enough for the third and final qualifying spot.\n\nThe top three in each heat, plus the next two fastest times advanced to the final. — Tyler Dragon\n\nAmerican Whittni Morgan advances to 5,000m final\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Whittni Morgan turned in a season best 5,000-meter time Friday in the second heat of qualifying, advancing to the final after running a 15:02.14 and finishing sixth in her heat. Paris is Morgan’s first Olympics.\n\nTwo other American women, Elise Cranny and Karissa Schweizer, managed to sneak into the final, running the the last two qualifying times of the first heat. Cranny finished in 14:58.55 while Schweizer clocked a 14:59.64.\n\nSchweizer, 28, finished 11th in the 5,000 at the Tokyo Games, while Cranny, also 28, finished 13th.\n\nKenya’s Faith Kipyegon, the gold medal favorite and defending world champion, turned in the fastest time of both heats, finishing in 14:57.56.

The Republican presidential nominee made his first \"Black jobs\" remark while explaining his thoughts on immigrants' impact on the U.S. economy. — Jonathan Limehouse\n\nChina's Huang Yaqiong gets gold medal — and marriage proposal\n\nHuang Yaqiong teamed with Zheng Siwei to win the gold medal in the women's badminton mixed doubles competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics, beating Kim Wonho and Jeong Naeun of South Korea (21-8, 21-11). Then, once Yaqiong went through the medal ceremony, fellow Chinese badminton player Liu Yuchen had a surprise for her.\n\nYuchen – who won a silver medal in the men’s doubles competition at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and competed in men’s doubles again during these Paris Games – pulled out a ring, got down on one knee and proposed.\n\nAlready holding flowers in her hands from the medal ceremony, Yaqiong quickly said yes. The proposal was shown on the videoboard at the Porte de la Chapelle Arena in Paris and the crowd celebrated along with the couple. — Mark Giannotto\n\nSchauffele, Matsuyama, Fleetwood top golf leaderboard\n\nDefending Olympic men's golf champion Xander Schauffele is in excellent position to bring the gold home to the United States once again.\n\nSchauffele, who has already won the PGA Championship and British Open this year, fired a 5-under 66 on Friday to join a three-way tie for the lead after two rounds of play.\n\nFor two days at Le Golf National, only one factor – big or very, very small – has seemingly been able to slow Schauffele: Got to watch out for those ants.\n\n\"It was an ant pile, or whatever you want to call it, in their home,\" he said. \"So I didn't want to mess with it too much.\"\n\nFirst-round leader Hideki Matsuyama of Japan shot a solid 3-under 66 at Golf Nacional in Paris to join Schauffele. And Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood had the round of the day (a 7-under 64) to create the three-way tie at 11-under. — Steve Gardner and Gentry Estes\n\nPolice investigate death threats against opening ceremony director\n\nAuthorities in Paris have launched a hate speech investigation after the Paris Olympics opening ceremony artistic director Thomas Jolly filed a complaint, alleging he was the subject of death threats.\n\nJolly filed the complaint with the Paris prosecutor’s office Tuesday, four days after the opening ceremony. In the complaint, he said he had been defamed and endured \"public insults.\"\n\nThe opening ceremony has been a source of controversy and scrutiny, featuring scenes of drag queens and another homage to a festival honoring the Greek god Dionysus that many thought was a parody of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting \"The Last Supper.\"\n\nThe online backlash caused organizers of the 2024 Paris Games to apologize earlier this week. — Scooby Axson\n\nRussian athletes clinch first medals\n\nRussia was banned to compete as a country in the Paris Olympics, but approved athletes were permitted to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, or AINs.\n\nAnd with only 15 of these athletes participating, there haven't been many opportunities for Russian Olympians to pocket medals. Until now.\n\nWomen's tennis players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider advanced to the gold medal match of the women's tennis doubles, ensuring at least a silver at these Games. Andreeva and Shnaider beat Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo of Spain in the semifinal, 6-1, 6-2, on Friday.\n\nThe Russian duo will play Sunday in the final at Roland Garros.\n\nMeet the painter with the best seat at Paris Olympics most iconic venue\n\nPARIS — Peter Spens, a London-based painter, has spent the past eight days at the Paris Olympics in a perch atop the media standard high above the beach volleyball court at Eiffel Tower Stadium overlooking the famous French landmark.\n\nFor the third consecutive Olympics, the International Volleyball Federation (FIBV) has commissioned Spens to paint a mural of one of the game’s fastest growing and most popular sports.\n\nSpens started drawing this year’s painting last Friday and has been at the venue ever since, using oil paint to add striking detail to his work. When he’s done, the painting will hang at FIBV headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. Eventually, every beach volleyball winner will receive a signed print.\n\n\"It’s nice,\" Spens said. \"It’s like for two weeks every four years I become a beach volleyball painter.\" — David Birkett\n\nUSMNT's loss in quarters shows how far it has to go\n\nPARIS — It took all of seven minutes to end the best run by the U.S. men's soccer team at the Olympics in almost 25 years.\n\nThat’s how much time elapsed between second-half goals by Ilias Akhomach and Achraf Hakimi, both of which came off U.S. mistakes. What had been a close game became a rout, allowing Morocco to move onto next week’s semifinals with a 4-0 win.\n\nWhile the Americans will try and find some comfort in making their deepest run since 2000, when they finished fourth in Sydney, this was yet more proof they remain very far away from contending with the best teams in the world.\n\nMorocco was clearly the better team, finishing with a whopping 8-1 advantage in shots, and the Americans just as clearly had no answer for the Atlas Lions. Worse, both goals from the run of play were the result of U.S. miscues. — Nancy Armour\n\nUSA's Casey Kaufhold, Brady Ellison win team archery bronze\n\nThe United States' Casey Kaufhold and Brady Ellison combined Friday to win the bronze medal in the archery mixed team competition.\n\nThe Americans beat India 6-2 in the bronze medal match after losing 5-3 to Germany in the semifinals.\n\nAgainst India, the U.S. opened with perfect 10 with the first arrow in all four sets.\n\nThe medal for Kaufhold, 20, is the first for a U.S. female archer since 1988 and a nice consolation after the world's No. 1 suffered an early upset defeat in the individual competition in the Paris Games.\n\nIt was the fourth medal for Ellison, 35, who is in his fifth Olympics and still searching for his first gol. He'll try for that Sunday in the final four rounds of the men's individual tournament. — Gentry Estes\n\nIga Swiatek wins bronze medal\n\nIga Swiatek knocked off Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia 6-2, 6-1 in the women's singles bronze medal match to become Poland's first tennis player to win an Olympic medal in tennis.\n\nChina's Qinwen Zheng and Croatia's Donna Vekic will face off in the gold medal match Saturday.\n\nUSMNT eliminated by Morocco\n\nMorocco is moving on to its first ever men's Olympic semifinals.\n\nMorroco beat the United States 4-0, getting a final goal when Mehdi Maouhoub converted a penalty kick. Team USA made it out of the knockout stage at the Olympics for the first time since 2000.\n\nMorroco will play the winner of Japan vs. Spain in the semis.\n\nTaiwan boxer wins Olympics opener\n\nLin Yu-Ting of Taiwan won her opening bout in the women’s competition as the issue of gender and eligibility criteria continued to generate anger and confusion. Capitalizing on her length and quickness, the 5-foot-10 Lin beat Uzbekistan's Sitora Turdibekova on points by unanimous decision.\n\nLin and Imane Khelif were disqualified from the 2023 world championships for reportedly failing gender eligibility criteria at an event run by the International Boxing Association. — Josh Peter\n\nMorocco up 3-0 on USMNT\n\nHope is dwindling for the U.S. men's soccer team, which finds itself down 3-0 against Morocco.\n\nMorocco extended its lead to 2-0 in the 63rd minute when Ilias Akhomach scored on an assist from Oussama Targhalline. Achraf Hakimi scored seven minutes later to give Morocco the 3-0 lead.\n\nChase Budinger, Miles Evans lose in straight sets\n\nThe men's beach volleyball tandem of Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost 21-18, 21-11 to Spain's Pablo Herrera and Adrian Gavira. They are no longer in control of their own destiny, awaiting the results of the Netherlands-France match to find out where they place in pool and if they move on.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz will play for gold\n\nSpain men's tennis star and three-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz will get a chance to add a gold medal to his trophy case.\n\nAlcaraz, 21, cruised to a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada to become the second-youngest man in the history of the Olympics to reach the men's singles final.\n\nMorocco strikes first against USMNT\n\nPARIS − A questionable penalty has the U.S. men in a hole.\n\nMorocco leads the Americans 1-0 at halftime of their quarterfinal match Friday after Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 29th.\n\nThe Atlas Lions dominated the first half – four shots on goal to none, and a 66-34 edge in possession – and U.S. goalkeeper Patrick Schulte tipped a dangerous curling shot by Ilias Akhomachi over the crossbar in the 13th. But it took Rahimi’s penalty to get Morocco on the board.\n\nIn the 28th minute, Nathan Harriel and Oussama El Azzouzi were both going for a ball and Rahimi came in late. It looked as if Harriel got Rahimi on the underside of the calf, though the contact didn’t look severe. Still, there was contact and it occurred in the box, so a penalty was called.\n\nSchulte actually guessed correctly, diving to his right. But Rahimi’s shot skirted beneath his fingers and into the net, putting Morocco ahead.\n\nThe U.S. men are trying to extend their best run in the Olympic tournament since 2000, when they finished fourth. − Nancy Armour\n\nVERSAILLES, France — For the second straight Summer Olympics, the United States equestrian jumping team has won silver.\n\nThe trio of Laura Kraut, Karl Cook and McClain Ward – and their horses Baloutine, Caracole de la Roque and Ilex, respectively – accomplished the feat Friday at the historic Chateau de Versailles, with the Grand Canal and palace in the distance. − Chris Bumbaca\n\nCan Schauffele win back-to-back golds?\n\nXander Schauffele, who won gold at the Tokyo Olympics, heads to the clubhouse with another excellent round. He sits atop the leaderboard at 11-under-par after 36 holes of the Olympic golf tournament at Le Golf National. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama is tied with Schauffele through 13 holes. Tommy Fleetwood sits one stroke back.\n\nUS sailing duo claims bronze in skiff\n\nIan Barrows and Hans Henken gave Team USA its first-ever Olympic medal in men's skiff during sailing competition Friday in Marseille.\n\nBarrows and Henken built on strong finishes earlier in the week and finished fourth in the medal race -- pushing them past Ireland for the bronze.\n\nSpain earned the gold and New Zealand took silver. − Steve Gardner\n\nCunningham advances to high jump final\n\nU.S. high jumper Vashti Cunningham didn’t think the qualifying round in her third Olympics would be challenging.\n\nCunningham cleared the bar at 6 feet, 3½ inches on her third attempt and had to wait for the final results to see if she had advanced to the final round.\n\nCunningham found out that she qualified into the women’s high jump final while speaking to reporters after the event. She let out a sigh of relief and was visibly emotional.\n\n“Thank you, lord. I’m sweating right now,” Cunningham said. “This means that God isn’t done with me and has a plan. I knew he had a plan for me at the beginning. I didn’t know it was gonna look like this – third time clearances and scrapping to get into the final. But I’m just blessed.”\n\nThirteen women advanced to Sunday’s women’s high jump final. Ukraine’s Yaroslava Mahuchikh is the No. 1 qualifier with a clearance of 6 feet, 4¾ inches. Cunningham and Serbia’s Angelina Topić were the final two qualifiers in the event.\n\nCunningham placed 13th at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and sixth at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nAmerican Rachel Glenn wasn’t so lucky. Glenn finished in 15th with a jump of 6 feet, 2 inches and didn’t advance. − Tyler Dragon\n\nWin or go home for U.S. men's soccer team\n\nPARIS − The U.S. men are facing Morocco, and a very hostile crowd, as they try to keep their best run in 24 years going.\n\nThis is the Americans’ first trip to the quarterfinals since 2000, when they finished fourth, their best showing in the Olympic tournament. They’re playing Morocco, which has two of the best players in the tournament in leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi and Achraf Hakimi, along with most of the fans at Parc des Princes.\n\nThe winner of this game advances to the semifinal Monday in Marseille, where they’ll play either Japan or Spain.\n\nThe other big quarterfinal is Argentina vs. host France, who also faced off in the World Cup final in 2022. Though the Olympics are a U-23 tournament for the men, teams are allowed three overage players and all three of Argentina’s are from that World Cup-champion team: Julian Alvarez, Thiago Almada and Geronimo Rulli, the backup goalkeeper. − Nancy Armour\n\nSchauffele atop Olympic golf leaderboard\n\nHideki Matsuyama was atop the leaderboard after the first round of Olympic golf at Le Golf National. But Xander Schauffele, fresh off major victories at The PGA Championship and The Open Championship, has taken command of the lead in the second round with a two-stroke lead after 16 holes. He opened with a 6-under-par 65 in the opening round of the Paris Olympics.\n\nSlovakia swimmer Tamara Potocka is under medical assessment after collapsing following her women's 200m individual medley heat, a venue official said. The venue's media manager confirmed Potocka was conscious and under medical assessment.\n\nWalsh, Douglass advance to semi's in women’s 200m individual medley\n\nAmerican's Alex Walsh and Kate Douglass made it to the semifinals in the women’s 200m individual medley. Walsh’s time of 2:10.48 was 0.58 slower than the 2:09.90 by Canada’s Summer McIntosh and 0.2 behind China’s Yu Yiting. Douglass swam a 2:10.70 to rank fifth among the qualifiers.\n\nDisappointing day for USA in women's rowing\n\nVAIRES-SUR-MARNE, France. − After Team USA won a gold medal in the men's four rowing event at the Paris Games on Thursday, disappointing finishes for the United States followed on Friday at Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium.\n\nIn an event being discontinued by the Olympics following the Paris Games, the Team USA tandem of Molly Reckford and Michelle Sechser finished last among six boats in lightweight women's double sculls action, with a time of 6:55.60. Great Britain won gold (6:47.06), followed by Romania (silver) and Greece (bronze). In the women's pair finals, Team USA's Azja Czajkowski and Jess Thoennes finished fourth with a time of 7:05.31 as the Netherlands (6:58.67) took gold, followed by Romania (silver) and Australia (bronze).\n\nMedal competition in rowing concludes Saturday with four events, three of which Team USA has qualified for: women's single sculls, women's eight, and men's eight. − Chase Goodbread\n\nKatie Ledecky cruises in 800 freestyle qualifying heat\n\nKatie Ledecky cruised to a comfortable victory in her qualifying heat in the 800-meter freestyle. She owns the fastest 16 times in history in this event, though this (8:16:62) was not one of them.\n\nShe will be looking for an unprecedented fourth consecutive gold medal in the event − her final one at the Paris Olympics − which is scheduled to start at 3:09 p.m. ET (9:09 p.m. in Paris) on Saturday, August 3.\n\nIn addition, one more gold medal for Ledecky would be her ninth, breaking a tie with Jenny Thompson and giving her the most by any American woman in Olympic history. − Steve Gardner\n\nPARIS − Sha'Carri Richardson had a fast Olympic debut.\n\nRichardson won her opening round heat of the women's 100 with a time of 10.94. She had a decent start but surged by the other sprinters around 30 meters and cruised the rest of the way.

He is “painfully devoid of slogans”, but strikes a chord by “being sincere and sticking to his academic roots”.\n\nArévalo’s “distinguishing” characteristic is that “he’s just an outsider”, Freeman told the Financial Times (FT), without alliances to “other tainted factions”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe “calm” man was born in Uruguay, “when his parents were exiled from their native land”, said El País. His father, Juan José Arévalo, was the beloved president behind Guatemala’s nascent democracy in the 1940s, known as the Democratic Spring. It ended violently when his successor was overthrown by the CIA-backed coup in 1954, leading to civil war and four decades of repression and economic stagnation.\n\nThe Seed Movement emerged in the heat of protests that “convulsed” the country in 2015, known as the Guatemalan Spring. The UN-backed organisation known as CICIG (International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala) exposed widespread political corruption, in a scandal that forced President Otto Pérez Molina’s resignation. The Seed Movement formed as a political party in 2018.\n\nThe sociologist and former diplomat “appealed to voters angry at the influence over the state exercised by a sprawling network of political, military and economic elites,” said The Economist, with ties to organised crime, which Guatemalans call “the pact of the corrupt”.\n\nWhat happened in the elections?\n\nIn anticipation of the elections, the president “packed the courts and the electoral tribunal with loyalists”, wrote Guatemala experts Anita Isaacs, Rachel A. Schwartz and Alvaro Montenegro in an essay for The New York Times in July. The regime then “enlisted these entities to distort the Constitution and tamper with election procedures to tilt the political playing field in their favour”.\n\nThe Supreme Electoral Tribunal barred three popular candidates from running for election, on “manufactured charges of malfeasance”, “paving the way for Arévalo”.\n\nDespite polling at 3% before the elections, according to Prensa Libre, Arévalo finished second in the first round of voting on 25 June, with just under 12% of the vote.\n\nTorres and her allies challenged the results, and in July, the country’s top court froze certification of the first-round results, ordering the ballots to be reviewed. The “topsy-turvy election” was “thrown into further turmoil”, said USA Today, when the attorney general’s office raided the electoral authority office in July.\n\nRafael Curruchiche, a “controversial” special prosecutor in the attorney general’s office, temporarily suspended Arévalo’s party amid “thin” accusations of vote-counting irregularities. He also claimed that the Seed Movement party illegally collected false signatures when it established itself. Both Curruchiche and the attorney general, Consuelo Porras, have been sanctioned by the US and accused of corruption.\n\nThe move “drew swift calls for Guatemalans to take to the streets in protest”, and warnings from Western officials about threats to democracy.\n\nIndependent election monitors, the Organization of American States (OAS), concluded that there was “no reason to suspect that there were irregularities”. The EU, which monitored the vote, called the electoral process the “clearly manifested will of citizens”.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe outgoing president, conservative Alejandro Giammattei, congratulated Arévalo and invited him to start the transition in January. The elections were carried out “in peace, with few isolated incidents”, Giammattei posted on Twitter.\n\nBut Arévalo will face “an uphill battle in governing”, said the FT, with his party holding only 23 out of 160 Congress seats, “forcing it to forge alliances or a coalition to pass legislation”.\n\nWhatever happens could have “a decisive impact” in a region “so closely tied to the United States and key to securing the southern border”, said USA Today. More than 220,000 Guatemalans entered the US via the Mexico border in 2022, according to Border Patrol figures – more than any other Central American country.\n\nAs demonstrated by Gabriel Boric in Chile or Gustavo Petro in Colombia, said El País, “the task of governing on the basis of hope and change isn’t so simple”.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/02/europe/hungary-election-viktor-orban-preview-intl", "title": "Viktor Orban, the EU leader who can't quit Putin, faces a united front ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSix weeks ago, Hungary’s election campaign looked and sounded very different.\n\nThe stakes were already high. Viktor Orban, the longest-serving national leader in the European Union, was seeking to extend his authoritarian premiership deep into its second decade. His rival, leading a united front of opposition parties, bluntly denounced Orban’s crusade against independent institutions and the rule of law.\n\nBut the political focus was resolutely domestic. When foreign policy took center stage, it was usually raised by Orban to tout his international credentials – such as on February 1, when he boasted of his political longevity while in Moscow, a few feet from his staunch ally President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNow, everything has changed. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine later that same month has upended the race, recasting its protagonists and rewriting their pitches. It has left Orban, widely regarded as the EU’s most pro-Kremlin leader, walking a political tightrope. And it has shone a spotlight on a years-long entanglement between him and the Russian President, two strongmen whose political journeys bear some notable similarities.\n\n“If you want to analyze the election campaign, you have to draw a line on February 24,” said Andrea Virág, director of strategy at the Republikon Institute think tank in Budapest, Hungary’s capital. “Since the war started, it’s completely different.”\n\nThe race – which will culminate in Sunday’s election – is now portrayed by the opposition as a crossroads between Hungary’s eastern and western horizons. “We only have one choice: we must choose Europe instead of the east,” opposition candidate Péter Marki-Zay, the man carrying the hopes of every Orban critic, told supporters this month.\n\nMarki-Zay leads a united coalition of every major opposition party – a last-gasp and fragile effort that symbolizes how dramatically anti-Orban parties have been sidelined in recent votes.\n\nWar on Hungary’s border has also added urgency to what was already a thorny relationship between its government and the EU. While Orban has supported most of Europe’s sanctions against Russia, back home the political pragmatist – who has maintained relationships with dictators and democrats for years – has focused his pitch on keeping Hungary out of the conflict, and has dodged numerous opportunities to disavow Putin even as the Russian leader wages war.\n\nNow, Orban’s political future rests on the success of his most complicated shapeshift yet – into a self-declared peacekeeper who won’t quit Russia.\n\nOrban met with Putin in Moscow just three weeks before Russia began its invasion. Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Putin critic-turned-admirer\n\nWhen Putin, then serving as Russian prime minister, launched his first invasion of a neighboring country in 2008, Orban – at that time in opposition, following a first term as prime minister that ended in 2002 – clamored to condemn him.\n\nBut during his second, 12-year stint in power, Orban has embraced a friendly and reliant relationship with Moscow that has made him an outlier in Europe. In a 2014 speech setting out his intentions to build an “illiberal state” in Hungary, he cited Russia as an example; in their February meeting, as Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border, Orban spoke glowingly to Putin of their bonds.\n\nThe relationship between the two strongmen is underpinned by economic reliance but also ideological similarities, according to Péter Krekó, the director of the Budapest-based Political Capital Institute.\n\n“Orban’s Hungary is very far from Putin’s Russia – but Orban mentioned already that Russia is one of his role models,” Krekó said. “This anti-Western, ultra-conservative, anti-LGBTQ worldview … (and) an ideology based on state-sponsored information” is “quite similar” to Putin’s early moves as President, he added.\n\n“Orban is the most pro-Putin prime minister (in the EU) and he did not expect the invasion at all,” Krekó said.\n\nMeanwhile, as most EU countries have united in their support for Ukraine, Orban’s relationship with Kyiv has deteriorated over the years. He has impeded the country’s attempts to form closer relations with NATO, and has clashed with successive governments in Kyiv. On Wednesday, his foreign minister accused Ukraine’s government of coordinating with Hungary’s opposition parties, without citing evidence.\n\nThat dynamic has complicated recent EU efforts to punish Russia for its invasion. While Hungary has ultimately supported most sanctions unveiled so far, Orban has been adamant that measures are not extended to imports of Russian oil and gas. Most of Hungary’s oil and natural gas imports come from Russia, and 90% of Hungarian families heat their homes with gas, Orban said during a recent visit to London.\n\n“If the sanctions are extended to energy, a situation will arise in which the Hungarian economy will find itself under unbearable pressure, and meanwhile this will probably not harm the Russians an iota,” a spokesperson for the Hungarian government told CNN, setting out Orban’s position.\n\nSupporters of Orban's Fidesz party march in Budapest on March 15. Orban has been adamant that he will not support sanctions that target Russian energy experts. Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn that context, most observers expected Putin’s war to harm his ally’s political fortunes. The opposition had long criticized Orban’s so-called Eastern Opening endeavor, which targets trade with authoritarian governments in Russia, China and Turkey.\n\n“Putin is rebuilding the Soviet empire and Orban is just watching it with strategic calm,” opposition leader Marki-Zay said at a rally this week, Reuters reported.\n\nInstead – thanks to his repeated claims that his rival would send Hungarian troops into Ukraine – Orban’s slight but significant lead in opinion polls has risen since the invasion. Marki-Zay has rejected those suggestions.\n\n“The Prime Minister really shines in situations like this,” Virag said. “He really likes to position himself as the defender of Hungary – that’s why their campaign strategy has always been to create enemies, and dangers to Hungary.”\n\nHungary has taken in more than 350,000 Ukrainian refugees since the invasion, comparable to neighboring Slovakia but fewer than Poland, Romania and Moldova, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nIn an independence day speech on March 15, Orban pledged not to send any weapons into Ukraine. He made no mention of Putin by name, and declined to cast Russia as the aggressor, instead framing the conflict as one between eastern and western powers, with Hungary “a piece in their game.”\n\n“We’re helping those in trouble, but at the same time we’re not taking a single step that could drag Hungary into trouble,” a spokesperson for Orban’s government added to CNN. “We can’t help anyone while at the same time destroying ourselves – for example, by getting involved in a war that’s not our war, in which we have nothing to gain and everything to lose.”\n\nThat equivocation appears to have helped his electoral standing. But it is losing him yet more friends in Europe.\n\nPoland’s President Andrzej Duda, the EU leader most sympathetic to Orban’s stances on social conservatism and the rule of law, broke with his ally to condemn his policy towards Ukraine last week. “Given the deaths of hundreds and thousands of civilians … it’s hard for me to understand this approach,” Duda told the TVN24 news channel. “This policy will be costly for Hungary, very costly.”\n\nAnd in a speech to the European Council last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pointedly told Orban: “You have to decide for yourself who you are with.\n\n“There is no time to hesitate,” Zelensky added. “It’s time to decide already.”\n\n‘Hungary is a different country now’\n\nOrban has comfortably seen off every electoral challenger he has faced in the past decade, helped in large part by a number of institutional reforms that have bolstered his grip on power and tilted the playing field against opposition voices.\n\n“Hungary now is a completely different country than it was 12 years ago,” Virag said. “The whole structure of the state has changed; institutions act like part of the government.”\n\nOrban has locked horns with EU leaders for years over his country’s hardline immigration policies and for clamping down on democratic institutions, including civic organizations, the media and education facilities.\n\nHis Fidesz party was suspended from the European Parliament’s main center-right bloc in 2019, and Hungary – along with Poland – recently lost a legal battle over the EU’s effort to block funding to the countries, in response to their democratic backsliding.\n\nHungary passed a law in 2017 that imposes restrictions on nongovernmental organizations receiving foreign funding. It prompted comparisons with Russia’s Foreign Agent Law, which has been used to crack down on opposition voices and independent media.\n\nMeanwhile, university reforms ensured that facilities will now be run by foundations, whose trustees are to be appointed by Orban’s government, which critics said would extend the ideological imprint of Orban’s party into Hungary’s higher education classrooms.\n\nPeter Marki-Zay's rival campaign has focused on what he calls Orban's \"corrupt dictatorship.\" Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAnd the EU has frequently taken issue with Hungary over rule of law issues. A 2018 law, passed soon after Orban secured a third consecutive term, created new courts overseen by the justice minister to handle cases concerning “government business,” such as tax and elections.\n\nA government spokesperson told CNN that the country’s constitution, which was enacted in 2011 during Orban’s current stint in power, “stipulates that everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression and that Hungary recognizes and protects the freedom and diversity of the press.”\n\nBut for many Hungarians resisting the country’s illiberal trend, this election represents a desperate final push against governmental interference.\n\n“There are parallel realities existing right now in Hungary,” said Szabolcs Panyi, an investigative journalist who said he was one of many Hungarian reporters whose phones were monitored by Pegasus spyware. “One half of Hungarian society, [which] is consuming state media, sees Orban as a savior who is protecting Hungary from the western global liberal elite.”\n\nPanyi foresees a wider threat. “There’s a very viable possibility that this propaganda machine that has been tried and tested in Hungary could be exported to support like-minded right-wing leaders,” he said.\n\nThose who consume government-friendly media networks in Hungary now frequently see a “pro-Russian narrative,” including suggestions that Ukrainian aggression sparked conflict, which have helped Orban land his anti-interventionist message, Panyi said.\n\n“They have an enormous media empire,” Krekó added of Orban’s government. “There are opposition voices, but they are much more silent. And by default, (Hungarians) bump into the government’s messaging.”\n\nThe electoral process too has been targeted. A law passed in 2011 redrew the lines on the electoral map, in what opposition parties and the media criticized as blatant gerrymandering. A government spokesperson denied that claim, telling CNN it was “unfounded and implies a lack of knowledge about the Hungarian electoral system.” Last month, Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE), recommended a full-scale international monitoring operation at the April 3 poll – a rare move for an EU state – after assessing claims of “a general deterioration of the conditions for democratic elections.”\n\nA political experiment\n\nThe far-reaching implications of Orban’s rule have led his critics to a last-ditch political gambit. “It took some time, but the opposition saw that their only real chance to have some success is to unite,” Virag said.\n\nNow, all six significant opposition parties – from the Greens and Liberals to the previously far-right Jobbik – have put their substantial ideological differences on hold to unite behind Marki-Zay, a conservative small-town mayor who himself once voted for Orban.\n\nMarki-Zay’s campaign initially focused on what he called Orban’s “corrupt dictatorship,” before Russia’s invasion forced a pivot. But Marki-Zay has since capitalized on the Ukrainian crisis too, painting Orban as a budding authoritarian following Putin’s model.\n\nUnlike most electoral leaders, Marki-Zay is openly downbeat about his chances. In an interview with the Financial Times in February, he put his chances of victory at just 40% -- and opinion polling agree that a victory would be a surprise, if not a shock. Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n“European integration, democracy and market economy are highly important values … and the most important (issue) is to root out corruption,” he said at a rally in late March, Reuters reported.\n\nMuch of his message has relied on Hungarian fatigue with an increasingly powerful government. “What will decide this election is that the majority of people is fed up with the past 12 years,” supporter Sandor Laszlo told Reuters at another opposition rally. “Hungary deserves calm and peace at last,” a second voter, Maria Cseh, said.\n\nBut should he pull off victory on Sunday, Marki-Zay will face even greater difficulties in power. “It’s not an easy job to keep this coalition together; the six parties are very different,” Virag said.\n\nCulture wars and a controversial referendum\n\nMarki-Zay’s profile has itself posed a challenge to Orban. A Catholic father-of-seven, and mayor of the southern heartland city of Hódmezővásárhely, his victory in opposition primaries neutralized the Prime Minister’s preferred line of attack: that his opponents are out-of-touch, Westernized social liberals.\n\nFor years, anti-migrant rhetoric and policies were the hallmark of Orban’s foreign policy. But following the easing of the European migrant crisis sparked by the Syrian conflict, much of his attention has turned to LGBTQ+ people, a trend replicated in neighboring Poland.\n\nThat crusade is “very important” to the current government, Virag said, in order to “convince voters there is a danger to Hungary, but Viktor Orban is here to defend (them).”\n\nOn the same day as the election, a referendum will take place on Orban’s controversial law that bans the “teaching of sexual orientation” and gender reassignment to children. The government amended a law late last year that banned referendums being held on the same day as an election, ensuring his right-wing base is motivated to turn out.\n\n“We are united and therefore we will also win the referendum with which we will stop at our borders the gender madness sweeping across the Western world,” Orban said during his March 15 speech.\n\nThe controversial LGBTQ+ education law, passed last year, bears similarities to Russia’s law against homosexual “propaganda,” which was similarly condemned by the West, and LGBTQ+ activists say its wording conflates them with pedophiles and further isolates them from Hungarian society.\n\n“Around the world, governments are mobilizing tired and offensive stereotypes portraying LGBT people as a threat to children to drum up political support,” Ryan Thoreson, an LGBT rights researcher for global watchdog Human Rights Watch, told CNN in reference to the vote in Hungary. “Human rights shouldn’t be put to a vote.”\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called the law a “shame” that goes against EU values, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte went as far as saying Hungary “has no place in the EU anymore.”\n\nBut putting the issue to a referendum alongside a national election vote has been dismissed as a stunt by many observers. “The Hungarian population is not very liberal when it comes to cultural issues,” but it doesn’t have strong feelings about LGBT+ people, Virag said. “Even before the war it was a minor issue.”\n\nRhetoric around the referendum has been far eclipsed by the parliamentary vote, and it is possible it will not reach the threshold of valid votes from 50% of the electorate required to be deemed valid – the same fate that befell a similarly controversial 2016 referendum on EU migrant quotas. The LGBTQ+ education law is nonetheless already in force.\n\nThe results of the referendum, however, are unlikely to deter Orban if he claims the main prize of another four years in office.\n\nA failure by the united opposition front would give further proof of Orban’s dominance over Hungarian politics, and if he claims a sizable majority, he would be expected quickly to move to consolidate his position further.\n\n“With each election, Hungary is becoming more and more illiberal. The election is becoming more and more unfair,” Krekó said.\n\n“If the opposition cannot reach a majority, or push Orban into a very tight majority, the next time will be even more difficult.”", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/11/harris-trump-debate-transcript/75168681007/", "title": "What was said during Harris-Trump presidential debate, word for word", "text": "Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris took to the stage for their first presidential debate on Tuesday evening. The 90-minute debate took place in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center and was moderated by \"World News Tonight\" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the exchange between the two presidential nominees:\n\nDAVID MUIR: Tonight, the high-stakes showdown here in Philadelphia between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump. Their first face-to-face meeting in this presidential election. Their first face-to-face meeting ever.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: A historic race for president upended just weeks ago. President Biden withdrawing after his last debate. Donald Trump is now up against a new opponent.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The candidates separated by the smallest of margins. Essentially tied in the polls nationally. And in the key battlegrounds, including right here in Pennsylvania, all still very much in play. The ABC News Presidential Debate starts right now.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Good evening, I'm David Muir. And thank you for joining us for tonight's ABC News Presidential Debate. We want to welcome viewers watching on ABC and around the world tonight. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump are just moments away from taking the stage in this unprecedented race for president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: And I'm Linsey Davis. Tonight's meeting could be the most consequential event of their campaigns, with Election Day now less than two months away. For Vice President Kamala Harris, this is her first debate since President Biden withdrew from the race on July 21st. Of course, that decision followed his debate against President Donald Trump in June. Since then, this race has taken on an entirely new dynamic.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And that brings us to the rules of tonight's debate: 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. No topics or questions have been shared with the campaigns. The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions. And this is the clock. That's what they'll be seeing. Two minutes for rebuttals and one minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses. Their microphones will only be turned on when it's their turn to speak. No prewritten notes allowed. There is no audience here tonight in this hall at the National Constitution Center. This is an intimate setting for two candidates who have never met.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump won the coin toss. He chose to deliver the final closing statement of the evening. Vice President Harris selected the podium to the right.\n\nDAVID MUIR: So let's now welcome the candidates to the stage. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Kamala Harris. Let's have a good debate.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Nice to see you. Have fun.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Welcome to you both. It's wonderful to have you. It's an honor to have you both here tonight.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Good evening, we are looking forward to a spirited and thoughtful debate.\n\nDAVID MUIR: So let's get started. I want to begin tonight with the issue voters repeatedly say is their number one issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living in this country. Vice President Harris, you and President Trump were elected four years ago and your opponent on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters, are you better off than you were four years ago? When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans are better off than they were four years ago?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, I was raised as a middle-class kid. And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy. Because here's the thing. We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people. We know that young families need support to raise their children. And I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000, which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time. So that those young families can afford to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children. My passion, one of them, is small businesses. I was actually -- my mother raised my sister and me but there was a woman who helped raise us. We call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start-up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy. My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America's deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that Trump's sales tax would actually result for middle-class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, I have no sales tax. That's an incorrect statement. She knows that. We're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money, they can't. It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do. They've taken in billions of dollars from China and other places. They've left the tariffs on. When I had it, I had tariffs and yet I had no inflation. Look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation has -- which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries. We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history. We were at 21%. But that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago. This has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class. On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. And they're coming in and they're taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions. Unions are going to be affected very soon. And you see what's happening. You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country. And they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. And we have to get them out. We have to get them out fast. I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country. I'll do it again and even better.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We are going to get to immigration and border security during this debate. But I would like to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I would love to. Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us. Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century. Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess. What we have done and what I intend to do is build on what we know are the aspirations and the hopes of the American people. But I'm going to tell you all, in this debate tonight, you're going to hear from the same old, tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling. What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again. I believe very strongly that the American people want a president who understands the importance of bringing us together knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you a minute here to respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Number one, I have nothing to do, as you know and as she knows better than anyone, I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't want to read it, purposely. I'm not going to read it. This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas. I guess some good, some bad. But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do -- everybody knows I'm an open book. Everybody knows what I'm going to do. Cut taxes very substantially. And create a great economy like I did before. We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic. And the pandemic was, not since 1917 where 100 million people died has there been anything like it? We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic. We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. We made ventilators for the entire world. We got gowns. We got masks. We did things that nobody thought possible. And people give me credit for rebuilding the military. They give me credit for a lot of things. But not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic. But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs. These were jobs, bounce back. And it bounced back and it went to their benefit. But I was the one that created them. They know it and so does everybody else.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, Donald Trump has no plan for you. And when you look at his economic plan, it's all about tax breaks for the richest people. I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy, and the best economists in our country, if not the world, have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America. What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse. Mine would strengthen the economy. What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan would actually explode the deficit. Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year would invite a recession. You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues. And I'd invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's just a sound bite. They gave her that to say. Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance and many of those professors, the top professors, think my plan is a brilliant plan, it's a great plan. It's a plan that's going to bring up our worth, our value as a country. It's going to make people want to be able to go and work and create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money for our -- for our country. And just to finish off, she doesn't have a plan. She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences, like run-Spot-run. Four sentences that are just oh, we'll try and lower taxes. She doesn't have a plan. Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I do want to drill down on something you both brought up. The vice president brought up your tariffs you responded and let's drill down on this because your plan is what she calls is a essentially a national sales tax. Your proposal calls for tariffs as you pointed out here, on foreign imports across the board. You recently said that you might double your plan, imposing tariffs up to 20% on good coming into this country. As you know many economists say that with tariffs at that level costs are then passed onto the consumer. Vice President Harris has argued it’ll mean higher prices on gas, food, clothing medication arguing it costs the typical family nearly four thousand dollars a year. Do you believe Americans can afford higher prices because of tariffs.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They aren’t gonna have higher prices what’s gonna have and who’s gonna have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years. I charge, I was the only president ever China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars and so were other countries and you know if she doesn’t like ‘em they should have gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs but those tariffs are there three and a half years now under their administration. We are gonna take in billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. I had no inflation, virtually no inflation, they had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country because I’ve never seen a worse period of time. People can’t go out and buy cereal bacon or eggs or anything else. These the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they’ve done. They’ve destroyed the economy and all you have to do it look at a poll. The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90% that the Trump economy was great that their economy was terrible.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris I do want to ask for your response and you heard what the president said there because the Biden administration did keep a number of the Trump tariffs in place so how do you respond?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let’s be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we’ve ever seen in the history of America. He invited trade wars, you wanna talk about his deal with China what he ended up doing is under Donald Trump’s presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military basically sold us out when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century. Which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies, focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on A.I. and quantum computing, focusing on what we need to do to support America’s work force, so that we don’t end up having the on the short end of the stick in terms of workers' rights. But what Donald Trump did let’s talk about this with COVID, is he actually thanked President XI for what he did during COVID. Look at his tweet. \"Thank you, President XI,\" exclamation point. When we know that XI was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of COVID.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I’ll let you respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, they bought their chips from Taiwan. We hardly make chips anymore because of philosophies like they have and policies like they have. I don't say her because she has no policy. Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window. She's going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat. She's gone to my philosophy. But if she ever got elected, she'd change it. And it will be the end of our country. She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father's a Marxist professor in economics. And he taught her well. But when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly where it's I believe 21 million people, not the 15 that people say, and I think it's a lot higher than the 21. That's bigger than New York state. Pouring in. And just look at what they're doing to our country. They're criminals. Many of these people coming in are criminals. And that's bad for our economy too. You mentioned before, we'll talk about immigration later.\n\nWell, bad immigration is the worst thing that can happen to our economy. They have and she has destroyed our country with policy that's insane. Almost policy that you'd say they have to hate our country.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President trump, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I want to turn to the issue of abortion. President Trump, you've often touted that you were able to kill Roe V. Wade. Last year, you said that you were proud to be the most pro-life president in American history. Then last month you said that your administration would be great for women and their reproductive rights. In your home state of Florida, you surprised many with regard to your six-week abortion ban because you initially had said that it was too short and you said, \"I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.\" But then the very next day, you reversed course and said you would vote to support the six-week ban. Vice President Harris says that women shouldn’t trust you on the issue of abortion because you’ve changed your position so many times. Therefore, why should they trust you?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay. And that's not okay with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe V. Wade into the states.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And through the genius and heart and strength of six supreme court justices we were able to do that. Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. 85% of Republicans do. Exceptions. Very important. But we were able to get it. And now states are voting on it. And for the first time you're going to see -- look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years. Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that's what happened, happened. Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas the vote was somewhat liberal. Much more liberal than people would have thought. But each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it. And the supreme court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. Madam vice president, I want to get your response to President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies. And that’s not actually a surprising fact. Let's understand how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe V. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care. In one state it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest. Which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I have talked with women around our country. You want to talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot? She didn't want that. Her husband didn't want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don't want that. And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe V. Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. But understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025 there would be a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025 there would be a national abortion -- a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages. I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about one's own body, should not be made by the government.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Thank you, Vice President Harris.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there she goes again. It's a lie. I'm not signing a ban. And there's no reason to sign a ban. Because we've gotten what everybody wanted. Democrats, Republicans and everybody else and every legal scholar wanted it to be brought back into the states. And the states are voting. And it may take a little time, but for 52 years this issue has torn our country apart. And they've wanted it back in the states. And I did something that nobody thought was possible. The states are now voting. What she says is an absolute lie. And as far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Would you veto a national abortion ban if it came to --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I won't have to because again -- two things. Number one, she said she'll go back to congress. She'll never get the vote. It's impossible for her to get the vote. Especially now with a 50-50 --essentially 50-50 in both senate and the house. She's not going to get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk. You know what it reminds me of? When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. The student loans -- and then her I think probably her boss, if you call him a boss, he spends all his time on the beach, but look, her boss went out and said we'll do it again, we'll do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the supreme court. So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about -- this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost. To the millions and millions of people that had to pay off their student loans. They didn't get it for free. But they were saying -- it's the same way that they talked about that, that they talk about abortion.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: But if I could just get a yes or no. Because your running mate J.D. Vance has said that you would veto if it did come to your desk.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn't discuss it with J.D. In all fairness. J.D. -- And I don't mind if he has a certain view but I think he was speaking for me but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get -- they didn't even come close to getting student loans. They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved. So it doesn't matter what she says about going to congress. Wonderful. Let's go to congress. Do it. But the fact is that for years they wanted to get it out of congress and out of the federal government and we did something that everybody said couldn't be done. And now you have a vote of the people on abortion.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, I want to give you your time to respond. But I do want to ask, would you support any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe V. Wade. And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening. It's insulting to the women of America. And understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans. Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs, who can barely afford childcare as it is, have to travel to another state to get on a plane sitting next to strangers, to go and get the health care she needs. Barely can afford to do it. And what you are putting her through is unconscionable. And the people of America have not -- the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot, in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice president Harris --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, I have to respond. Another lie. It's another lie. I have been a leader on IVF which is fertilization. The IVF -- I have been a leader. In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts, I saw the people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in. I've been a leader on it. They know that and everybody else knows it. I have been a leader on fertilization, IVF. And the other thing, they -- you should ask, will she allow abortion in the eighth month, ninth month, seventh month?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Come on.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Would you do that? Why don't you ask her that question --\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Why don't you answer the question would you veto –\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That’s the problem. Because under Roe v. Wade.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Answer the question, would you veto--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month -\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's not true.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And probably after birth. Just look at the governor, former governor of Virginia. The governor of Virginia said we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do with the baby.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We're going to turn now to immigration and border security. We know it's an issue that's important to Republicans, Democrats, voters across the board in this country. Vice President Harris, you were tasked by President Biden with getting to the root causes of migration from Central America. We know that illegal border crossings reached a record high in the Biden administration. This past June, President Biden imposed tough new asylum restrictions. We know the numbers since then have dropped significantly. But my question to you tonight is why did the administration wait until six months before the election to act and would you have done anything differently from President Biden on this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So I'm the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. And let me say that the United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came up with a border security bill which I supported. And that bill would have put 1,500 more border agents on the border to help those folks who are working there right now over time trying to do their job. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. I know there are so many families watching tonight who have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl in our country. That bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings. But you know what happened to that bill? Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said kill the bill. And you know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And understand, this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions, who actually addresses the problems at hand. But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight even when it's not the subject that is being raised. And I'm going to actually do something really unusual and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies because it's a really interesting thing to watch. You will see during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your, your desires. And I'll tell you, I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first. And I pledge to you that I will.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, on that point I want to get your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I would like to respond.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just ask, though, why did you try to kill that bill and successfully so? That would have put thousands of additional agents and officers on the border.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First let me respond as to the rallies. She said people start leaving. People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So, she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. That's because people want to take their country back. Our country is being lost. We're a failing nation. And it happened three and a half years ago. And what, what's going on here, you're going to end up in World War 3, just to go into another subject. What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at what's happening to the towns all over the United States. And a lot of towns don't want to talk -- not going to be Aurora or Springfield. A lot of towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating -- they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame. As far as rallies are concerned, as far -- the reason they go is they like what I say. They want to bring our country back. They want to make America great again. It's a very simple phrase. Make America great again. She's destroying this country. And if she becomes president, this country doesn't have a chance of success. Not only success. We'll end up being Venezuela on steroids.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I just want to clarify here, you bring up Springfield, Ohio. And ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I’ve seen people on television\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just say here this ...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food. So maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I’m not taking this from television. I'm taking it from the city manager.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Again, the Springfield city manager says there's no evidence of that.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We’ll find out\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond to the rest of what you heard.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Talk about extreme. Um, you know, this is I think one of the reasons why in this election I actually have the endorsement of 200 Republicans who have formally worked with President Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain including the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congressmember Liz Cheney. And if you want to really know the inside track on who the former president is, if he didn't make it clear already, just ask people who have worked with him. His former chief of staff, a four-star general, has said he has contempt for the constitution of the United States. His former national security adviser has said he is dangerous and unfit. His former secretary of defense has said the nation, the republic would never survive another Trump term. And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric, when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed, I think the choice is clear in this election.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you a quick minute to respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. Thank you. Because when I hear that -- see, I'm a different kind of a person. I fired most of those people. Not so graciously. They did bad things or a bad job. I fired them. They never fired one person. They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people whose, whose, were just killed viciously and violently killed and I got to know the parents and the family. They should have fired all those generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen. So when somebody does a bad job I fire them. And you take a guy like Esper. He was no good, I fired him. So he writes a book. Another one writes a book. Because with me they can write books. With nobody else can they. But they have done such a poor job. And they never fire anybody. Look at the economy. Look at the inflation. They didn't fire any of their economists. They have the same people. That's a good way not to have books written about you. But just to finish, I got more votes than any Republican in history by far. In fact, I got more votes than any president, sitting president in history by far.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me continue on immigration. It was what you wanted to talk about earlier. So let's get back to your deportation proposal that the vice president has reacted to as well. President Trump, you called this the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country. You say you would use the National Guard. You say if things get out of control you'd have no problem using the U.S. military.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: With local police.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You also said you would use local police. How would you deport 11 million undocumented immigrants? I know you believe that number is much higher. Take us through this. What does this look like? Will authorities be going door to door in this country?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. It is much higher because of them. They allowed criminals. Many, many, millions of criminals. They allowed terrorists. They allowed common street criminals. They allowed people to come in, drug dealers, to come into our country, and they're now in the United States. And told by their countries like Venezuela don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down? You know why? Because they've taken their criminals off the street and they've given them to her to put into our country. And this will be one of the greatest mistakes in history for them to allow -- and I think they probably did it because they think they're going to get votes. But it's not worth it. Because they're destroying the fabric of our country by what they've done. There's never been anything done like this at all. They've destroyed the fabric of our country. Millions of people let in. And all over the world crime is down. All over the world except here. Crime here is up and through the roof. Despite their fraudulent statements that they made. Crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime. And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country, but Vice President the...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: use me, the FBI -- they were defrauding statements. They didn't include the worst cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud. Just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. I'll let you respond, Vice President Harris.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I think this is so rich. Coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing. And let's be clear where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement. The former vice president called for defunding, federal law enforcement, 45,000 agents, get this, on the day after he was arraigned on 34 felony counts. So let's talk about what is important in this race. It is important that we move forward, that we turn the page on this same old tired rhetoric. And address the needs of the American people, address what we\n\nneed to do about the housing shortage, which I have a plan for. Address what we must do to support our small businesses. Address bringing down the price of groceries. But frankly, the American people are exhausted with the same old tired playbook.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Every one of those cases was started by them against their political opponent. And I'm winning most of them and I'll win the rest on appeal. And you saw that with the decision that came down just recently from the Supreme Court. I'm winning most of them. But those are cases, it's called weaponization. Never happened in this country. They weaponized the justice department. Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fani Willis -- to the attorney general of New York and the D.A. In New York. Every one of those cases. And then they say oh, he was -- he's a criminal. They're the ones that made them go after me. By the way, Joe Biden was found essentially guilty on the documents case. And what happened in my documents case? They said oh, that's the toughest of them all. A complete and total victory. Two months ago it was thrown out. It's weaponization. And they used it. And it's never happened in this country. They used it to try and win an election. They're fake cases.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. A really quick response here, Vice President Harris, on this notion of weaponization of the justice department.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well let's talk about extreme. And understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the white house again. Understand, this is someone who has openly said he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate the constitution of the United States. That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. Someone who has openly expressed disdain for members of our military. Understand what it would mean if Donald Trump were back in the white house with no guardrails. Because certainly, we know now the court won't stop him. We know J.D. Vance is not going to stop him. It's up to the American people to stop him.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINDSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in your last run for president...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is the one that weaponized. Not me. She weaponized. I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me. They talk about democracy. I'm a threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy – With the fake Russia Russia Russia investigation that went nowhere.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We have a lot to get to. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in your last run for president you said you wanted to ban fracking. Now you don't. You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons. Now your campaign says you don't. You supported decriminalizing border crossings. Now you're taking a harder line. I know you say that your values have not changed. So then why have so many of your policy positions changed?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So my values have not changed. And I'm going to discuss every one -- at least every point that you've made. But in particular, let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania. I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking. My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil. As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle-class kid raised by a hard-working mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager. The values I bring to the importance of home ownership knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, is a value that I bring to my work to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term. My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather. And my focus then, on protecting women and children from violent crime, is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable. My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done. Protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling. The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down, it's in lifting people up. I intend to be that president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father and I learned a lot from him. But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars. Many, many billions. And when people see it, they are even surprised. So, we don't have to talk about that. Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years. Uh, defund the police. She's been against that forever. She gave all that stuff up, very wrongly, very horribly. And everybody's laughing at it, okay? They're all laughing at it. She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies. Like, she was big on defund the police.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That’s not true. [mouthed, not audible]\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In Minnesota, she went out -- wait a minute. I'm talking now. If you don't mind. Please. Does that sound familiar?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Don’t lie. [lie is audible]\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She went out -- she went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals that killed people, that burned down Minneapolis, she went out and raised money to get them out of jail. She did things that nobody would ever think of. Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this. She wants to confiscate your guns and she will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania. If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one. Just to finish one thing, so important in my opinion, so, I got the oil business going like nobody has ever done before. They took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof. They immediately let these guys go to where they were. I would have been five times, four times, five times higher because you're talking about 3 1/2 years ago. They got it up to where I was because they had no choice. Because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling. You saw what happened to gasoline. So, they said let's go back to Trump. But if she won the election, the day after that election, they'll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead. We'll go back to windmills and we'll go back to solar, where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out. You ever see a solar plant? By the way, I'm a big fan of solar. But they take 400, 500 acres of desert soil--\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are not good things for the environment that she understands.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, we have a lot of issues that we have to get to. We're out of time. Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Linsey, thank you. We have an election in just 56 days. I want to talk about the peaceful transfer of power, which of course we all know was a cornerstone of our democracy and the role of a president in a moment of crisis. Mr. President, on January 6th you told your supporters to march to the Capitol. You said you would be right there with them. The country and the world saw what played out at the Capitol that day. The officers coming under attack. Aides in the West Wing say you watched it unfold on television off the Oval Office. You did send out tweets, but it was more than two hours before you sent out that video message telling your supporters to go home. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You just said a thing that isn't covered. Peacefully and patriotically, I said during my speech. Not later on. Peacefully and patriotically. And nobody on the other side was killed. Ashli Babbitt was shot by an out-of-control police officer that should have never, ever shot her. It's a disgrace. But we didn't do -- this group of people that have been treated so badly. I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people? That she allowed to pour in. She was the border czar. Remember that. She was the border czar. She doesn't want to be called the border czar because she's embarrassed by the border. In fact, she said at the beginning, I'm surprised you're not talking about the border yet. That's because she knows what a bad job they've done. What about those people? What’s, when are they going to be prosecuted -- when are these people from countries all over the world, not just South America, they're coming in from all over the world, David, all over the world. And crime rates are down all over the world because of it --\n\nDAVID MUIR: But let me just ask you--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But when are those, David, when are those people going to be prosecuted? When are the people that burned down Minneapolis going to be prosecuted or in Seattle? They went into Seattle, they took over a big percentage of the city of Seattle. When are those people going to be prosecuted?\n\nDAVID MUIR: But let me just ask you--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You might ask her that question.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You were the president. You were watching it unfold on television. It's a very simple question as we move forward toward another election. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day? Yes or no.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech. I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big. I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know. I said, you know, this is going to be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it. And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others. I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me. It was just two weeks ago, her daughter has a tape of her saying she is fully responsible for what happened. They want to get rid of that tape. It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security. Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The question was about you as president, not about Former Speaker Pelosi. But I do want Vice President Harris to respond here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I was at the Capitol on January 6th. I was the Vice President-Elect. I was also an acting senator. I was there. And on that day, the president of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's Capitol, to desecrate our nation's Capitol. On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured. And some died. And understand, the former president has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason. But this is not an isolated situation. Let's remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate, and what did the president then at the time say? There were fine people on each side. Let's remember that when it came to the Proud Boys, a militia, the president said, the former president said, \"Stand back and stand by.\" So for everyone watching who remembers what January 6th was, I say we don't have to go back. Let's not go back. We're not going back. It's time to turn the page. And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you. To stand for country. To stand for our democracy. To stand for rule of law. And to end the chaos. And to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy ‘cause you don't like the outcome. And be clear on that point. Donald Trump the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath, if this -- and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let's turn the page on this. Let's not go back. Let's chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just follow up here--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have said blood bash, bath. It was a different term, and it was a term that related to energy, because they have destroyed our energy business. That was where bloodbath was. Also, on Charlottesville, that story has been as you would say, debunked. Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse -- all of these people, they covered it. If they go an extra sentence, they will see it was perfect. It was debunked in almost every newspaper. But they still bring it up just like they bring 2025 up. They bring all of this stuff up. I ask you this. You talk about the Capitol. Why are we allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border? How come she's not doing -- and I'll tell you what I would do. And I would be very proud to do it. I would say we would both leave this debate right now, I'd like to see her go down to Washington, D.C. during this debate ‘cause we're wasting a lot of time. Go down to -- because she's been so bad, it's so ridiculous. Go down to Washington, D.C. And let her sign a bill to close up the border. Because they have the right to do it. They don't need bills. They have the right to do it. The President of the United States, you'll get him out of bed. You'll wake him up at 4:00 in the afternoon, you'll say come on. Come on down to the office, let's sign a bill. If he ... if he signs a bill that the border is closed, all he has to do is say it to the border patrol, who are phenomenal. If they do that, the border is closed.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those people are killing many people, unlike J-6.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We talked immigration here tonight. I do want to focus on this next issue to both of you. Because it really brings us, this into focus. Truth in these times that we're living in. Mr. President, for 3 and a half years after you lost the 2020 election you repeatedly falsely claimed that you won, many times saying you won in a landslide. In the past couple of weeks leading up to this debate, you have said, quote, you lost by a whisker, that you, quote, didn't quite make it, that you came up a little bit short.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said that?\n\nDAVID MUIR: Are you now acknowledging that you lost in 2020?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't acknowledge that at all.\n\nDAVID MUIR: But you did say that.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said that sarcastically. You know that. It was said, oh we lost by a whisker. That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. All you have to do is look at it. And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten. I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten. The election, people should never be thinking about an election as fraudulent. We need two things. We need walls. We need -- and we have to have it. We have to have borders. And we have to have good elections.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our elections are bad. And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote. They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that's why they're allowing them to come into our country.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I did watch all of these pieces of video. I didn't detect the sarcasm, lost by a whisker, we didn't quite make it, and we should just point out as clarification, and you know this, you and your allies, 60 cases in front of many judges. Many of them --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No judge looked at it.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And said there was no widespread fraud.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They said we didn't have standing. That's the other thing. They said we didn't have standing. A technicality. Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn't have standing, the President of the United States doesn't have standing? That's how we lost. If you look at the facts, and I'd love to have you -- you'll do a special on it. I'll show you Georgia and I'll show you Wisconsin and I'll show you Pennsylvania and I'll show you -- we have so many facts and statistics. But you know what? That doesn't matter. Because we have to solve the problem that we have right now. That's old news. And the problem that we have right now is we have a nation in decline and they have put it into decline. We have a nation that is dying, David.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you. Vice President Harris, you heard the president there tonight. He said he didn't say that he lost by a whisker. So he still believes he did not lose the election. That was won by President Biden and yourself. But I do want to ask you about something that's come up in the last couple of days. This was a post from President Trump about this upcoming election just weeks away. He said, \"When I win, those people who cheated,\" and then he lists donors, voters, election officials, he says \"Will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, which will include long-term prison sentences.\" One of your campaign's top lawyers responded saying, \"We won't let Donald Trump intimidate us. We won't let him suppress the vote.\" Is that what you believe he's trying to do here?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people. So, let's be clear about that. And clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that. But we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election. And I'm going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States. And world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you. And they say you're a disgrace. And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost, because you did in fact lose that election, it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That's deeply troubling. And the American people deserve better.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I'll give you one minute to respond, Mr. President.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you about world leaders. Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men -- they call him a strong man. He's a tough person. Smart. Prime Minister of Hungary. They said why is the whole world blowing up? Three years ago it wasn't. Why is it blowing up? He said because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid. And I don't like to use the word afraid but I'm just quoting him. China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him. Look at what's going on with North Korea, by the way. He said Russia was afraid of him. I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one but he ended the XL pipeline. The XL pipeline in our country. He ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany. The biggest pipeline in the world. Look, Viktor Orban said it. He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president. But when this weak pathetic man that you saw at a debate just a few months ago that if he weren't in that debate he'd be running instead of her, she got no votes, he got 14 million votes, what you did, you talk about a threat to democracy. He got 14 million votes and they threw him out of office. And you know what? I'll give you a little secret. He hates her. He can't stand her.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: But he had 14 million votes. They threw them out. She got zero votes. And when she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed. And now she's running. I don't understand it but I'm okay with it – because I think we’re going to do pretty well.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, your time is up. We've got a lot more to get to.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Turning now to the Israel-Hamas war and the hostages who are still being held, Americans among them. Vice President Harris, in December you said, \"Israel has a right to defend itself\" but you added, \"It matters how.\" Saying international humanitarian law must be respected, Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians. You said that nine months ago. Now an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are dead. Nearly 100 hostages remain. Just last week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there's not a deal in the making. President Biden has not been able to break through the stalemate. How would you do it?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let's understand how we got here. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, slaughtered 1,200 Israelis. Many of them young people who were simply attending a concert. Women were horribly raped. And so absolutely, I said then, I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end. It must when, end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal and we need the hostages out. And so we will continue to work around the clock on that. Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians. But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, how would you negotiate with Netanyahu and also Hamas in order to get the hostages out and prevent the killing of more innocent civilians in Gaza?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I were president it would have never started. If I were president Russia would have never, ever -- I know Putin very well. He would have never -- and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years. Have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people when you add it up. Far worse than people understand what's going on over there. But when she mentions about Israel all of a sudden -- she hates Israel. She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers. She wanted to go to the sorority party. She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now. And I've been pretty good at predictions. And I hope I'm wrong about that one. She hates Israel. At the same time in her own way she hates the Arab population because the whole place is going to get blown up, Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone. It would have never happened. Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had. Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror. And they are spheres of terror. Horrible terror. They had no money. It was a big story, and you know it. You covered it. Very well, actually. They had no money for terror. They were broke. Now they're a rich nation. And now what they're doing is spreading that money around. Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen. Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. I will get that settled and fast. And I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I'm President-Elect, I'll get it done before even becoming president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, he says you hate Israel.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people. He knows that. He's trying to again divide and distract from the reality, which is it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy. It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one according to himself. It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine. It is well known when that he said when Russia went into Ukraine it was brilliant. It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong un. And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear, they can manipulate you with flattery and favors. And that is why so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace. That is why we understand that we have to have a president who is not consistently weak and wrong on national security including the importance of upholding and respecting in highest regard our military.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're the ones -- and she's the one that caused it, that's weak on national security by allowing every nation last month for the year, 168 different countries sending people into our country. Their crime rates are way down. Putin endorsed her last week. Said I hope she wins. And I think he meant it. Because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible. It wouldn't have happened with me. The leaders of other countries think that they're weak and incompetent. And they are. They're grossly incompetent. And I just ask one question. Why does Biden go in and kill the Keystone pipeline and approve the single biggest deal that Russia's ever made, Nordstream 2, the biggest pipeline anywhere in the world going to Germany and all over Europe? Because they're weak and they're ineffective. And Biden, by the way --\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Gets paid a lot of money --\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Thank you. We have a lot of issues to get to.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We'll be right back with much more of this historic ABC News presidential debate from the National Constitution Center right here in Philadelphia. Back in a moment.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And I want to turn to the war in Ukraine. We're now 2 1/2 years into this conflict. Mr. President, it has been the position of the Biden administration that we must defend Ukraine from Russia, from Vladimir Putin, to defend their sovereignty, their democracy, that it's in America's best interest to do so, arguing that if Putin wins he may be emboldened to move even further into other countries. You have said you would solve this war in 24 hours. You said so just before the break tonight. How exactly would you do that? And I want to ask you a very simple question tonight. Do you want Ukraine to win this war?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want the war to stop. I want to save lives that are being uselessly -- people being killed by the millions. It's the millions. It's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting, which are fake numbers. Look, we're in for 250 billion or more because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are. They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with nato. They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not going to protect you anymore. So that may be one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people. But you take a look at what's happening. We're in for 250 to 275 billion. They're into 100 to 150. They should be forced to equalize. With that being said, I want to get the war settled. I know Zelenskyy very well and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship. And they respect your president. Okay? They respect me. They don't respect Biden. How would you respect him? Why? For what reason? He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin. Hasn't spoken to anybody. They don't even try and get it. That is a war that's dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president. If I win, when I'm President-Elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get them together. That war would have never happened. And in fact when I saw Putin after I left, unfortunately left because our country has gone to hell, but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left, I said oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good strong point of negotiation. Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him. He had no idea how to stop it. And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War 3. Don't kid yourself, David. We're playing with World War 3. And we have a president that we don't even know if he's -- where is our president? We don't even know if he's a president.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And just to clarify here.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They threw him out of a campaign like a dog. We don't even know, is he our president? But we have a president...\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President,\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: ...that doesn't know he's alive.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Your time is up. Just to clarify the question, do you believe it's in the U.S. best interests for Ukraine to win this war? Yes or no?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think it's in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done. All right. Negotiate a deal. Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to take this to Vice President Harris. I want to get your thoughts on support for Ukraine in this moment. But also as commander in chief if elected how would you deal with Vladimir Putin and would it be any different from what we're seeing from President Biden?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, first of all, it's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me. I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that's not who we are as Americans. Let's understand what happened here. I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded, tried through force to change territorial boundaries to defy one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I met with President Zelenskyy. I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself. Days later I went to NATO's eastern flank, to Poland and Romania. And through the work that I and others did we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense. And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country. If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. And understand what that would mean. Because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is NATO. And what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their Independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris Thank you. We heard from both of you on Ukraine tonight. Afghanistan came up in the last hour -- I wanted her to respond to something you said earlier.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have to respond.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Please I'll give you a minute here.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women. But he would have been sitting in Moscow\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: (inaudible)\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Quiet, please. He would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now. But eventually, you know, he's got a thing that other people don't have. He's got nuclear weapons. They don't ever talk about that. He's got nuclear weapons. Nobody ever thinks about that. And eventually uh maybe he'll use them. Maybe he hasn't been that threatening. But he does have that. Something we don't even like to talk about. Nobody likes to talk about it. But just so you understand, they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started. Three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid. They said the wrong things. That war should have never started. She was the emissary. They sent her in to negotiate with Zelenskyy and Putin. And she did and the war started three days later.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's the kind of talent we have with her. She's worse than Biden. In my opinion, I think he's the worst president in the history of our country. She goes down as the worst vice president in the history of our country. But let me tell you something. She is a horrible negotiator. They sent her in to negotiate. As soon as they left Putin did the invasion.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. You did bring up something, you said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. Vice President Harris, have you ever met Vladimir Putin, can you clarify tonight?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yet again, I said it at the beginning of this debate, you're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella. And that is another one. When I went to meet with President Zelenskyy, I've now met with him over five times. The reality is, it has been about standing as America always should, as a leader upholding international rules and norms. As a leader who shows strength, understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy. And that is very much what is at stake here. The President of the United States is commander-in-chief. And the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the benefit of personal flattery.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir Putin. I do want to talk about Afghanistan. It came up in the first hour of this debate.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: David, one thing.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to move on to Afghanistan.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Secretary General Stoltenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen, he got these countries, the 28 countries at the time, to pay up. He said I've never seen -- he's the head of NATO. He said I've never seen -- for years we were paying almost all of NATO. We were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, if you don't pay we're not going to protect you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Otherwise we would've never gotten it. He said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Thank you. I want to turn to Afghanistan. We witnessed a poignant moment today on Capitol Hill honoring the soldiers who died in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I do want to ask the vice president, do you believe you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I will tell you, I agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did. And as a result, America's taxpayers are not paying the $300 million a day we were paying for that endless war. And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century. But let's understand how we got to where we are. Donald Trump when he was president negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine. He calls himself a dealmaker. Even his national security adviser said it was a weak, terrible deal. And here's how it went down. He bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists, Taliban terrorists released.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: And get this -- no, get this. And the president at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David. A place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders. And this former president as president invited them to Camp David because he does not again appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be commander in chief with a level of respect. And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military, fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, your response to her saying that you began the negotiations with the Taliban.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, thank you. So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of them, with snipers. And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing. That's the fighting force within Afghanistan. They don't bother doing that because you know, they deal with the wrong people all the time. But I got involved. And Abdul is the head of the Taliban. He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a picture of my house? I said you're going to have to figure that out, Abdul. And for 18 months we had nobody killed. We did have an agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo. It was a very good agreement. The reason it was good, it was -- we were getting out. We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers. We wouldn't have left many Americans behind. And we wouldn't have left -- we wouldn't have left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful military equipment behind. And just to finish, they blew it. The agreement said you have to do this, this, this, this, this, and they didn't do it. They didn't do it. The agreement was, was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to move on.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And these people did the worst withdrawal and in my opinion the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And by the way, that's why Russia attacked Ukraine. Because they saw how incompetent she and her boss are.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. I want to move on now to race and politics in this country. Mr. President, you recently said of Vice President Harris, \"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.\" I want to ask a bigger-picture question here tonight. Why do you believe it's appropriate to weigh in on the racial identity of your opponent?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't. And I don't care. I don't care what she is. I don't care. You make a big deal out of something. I couldn't care less. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.\n\nDAVID MUIR: But those were your words. So, I'm asking --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. All I can say is I read where she was not Black, that she put out. And, I'll say that. And then I read that she was black. And that's okay. Either one was okay with me. That's up to her. That's up to her.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, your thoughts on this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I think it's – I mean honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race. And let's remember how Donald Trump started. He was a, a, a—land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families. Let's remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black President of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me \"Can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?\" Knowing that regardless of people's color or the language their grandmother speaks we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, this is now your third time --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: This is the most divisive presidency in the history of our country. There's never been anything like it. They're destroying our country. And they come up with things like what she just said going back many, many years when a lot of people including Mayor Bloomberg agreed with me on the Central Park Five. They admitted -- they said, they pled guilty. And I said, \"Well if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty -- then they pled we're not guilty.\" But this is a person that has to stretch back years, 40, 50 years ago because there's nothing now. I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world and I'm going to build it again. It's going to be bigger, better, and stronger. But they're destroying our economy. They have no idea what a good economy is. Their oil policies -- every single policy -- and remember this. She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad – and she can't get away with that.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you, your time is up. Linsey ..\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I want to respond to that, though. I want to just respond briefly. Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people. I believe in what we can do to strengthen our small businesses, which is why I have a plan. Let's talk about our plans. And let's compare the plans. I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction, to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work. I have a plan. $6,000 for young families for the first year of your child's life. To help you in that most critical stage of your child's development. I have a plan that is about allowing people to be able to pursue what has been fleeting in terms of the American dream by offering a ... help with down payment of $25,000, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. That's the kind of conversation I believe, David, that people really want tonight as opposed to a conversation that is constantly about belittling and name-calling. Let's turn the page and move forward.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. Let's turn to policy – let's turn to policy\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump we have to move on. President Trump.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let's turn to policy, please.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She has a plan to defund the police. She has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, we do have to move on to other issues.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: She has a plan to not allow fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. That's what her plan is until just recently.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: The former president has said something twice and I need to respond too. I just need to respond one time to what he has said multiple times.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I'm sorry, we're going to move on, Vice President Harris. This is now your third time running for president. you have long vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. You have failed to accomplish that. You now say you're going to keep Obamacare. Quote, unless we can do something much better. Last month you said, quote, we're working on it. So tonight, nine years after you first started running, do you have a plan and can you tell us what it is?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare was lousy health care. Always was. It's not very good today. And what I said, that if we come up with something, we are working on things, we're going to do it and we're going to replace it. But remember this. I inherited Obamacare because Democrats wouldn't change it. They wouldn't vote for it. They were unanimous. They wouldn't vote to change it. If they would have done that, we would have had a much better plan than Obamacare. But the Democrats came up, they wouldn't vote for it. I had a choice to make when I was president, do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never going to be great. Or do I let it rot? And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away. I decided -- and I told my people, the top people, and they're very good people -- I have a lot of good people in this -- that administration. We read about the bad ones. We had some real bad ones too. And so do they. They have really bad ones. The difference is they don't get rid of them. But let me just explain. I had a choice to make do I save it and make it as good as it can be or let it rot? And I saved it. I did the right thing. But it's still never going to be great. And it's too expensive for people. And what we will do is we're looking at different plans. If we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it. But until then I'd run it as good as it can be run.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: So just a yes or no, you still do not have a plan?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have concepts of a plan. I'm not president right now. But if we come up with something I would only change it if we come up with something better and less expensive. And there are concepts and options we have to do that. And you'll be hearing about it in the not-too-distant future.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in 2017 you supported Bernie Sanders' proposal to do away with private insurance and create a government-run health care system. Two years later you proposed a plan that included a private insurance option. What is your plan today?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, first of all, I absolutely support and over the last four years as vice president private health care options. But what we need to do is maintain and grow the Affordable Care Act. But I, I'll get to that, linsey. I just need to respond to a previous point that the former president has made. I've made very clear my position on fracking. And then this business about taking everyone's guns away. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, understand, just look at the history to know where people stand. When Donald Trump was president, 60 times he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 60 times. I was a senator at the time. When, I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate and the late great John McCain, who you have disparaged as being – uh, you don't like him, you said at the time because he got caught, he was an American hero. The late great John McCain, I will never forget that night. Walked onto the Senate floor and said no, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan. And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing conditions. I don't have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like? Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes? And thankfully, as I've been vice president and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of you the American people. Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate dr, drug prices. He never did. We did. And now we have capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month. Since I've been vice president we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000 a year. And when I am president we will do that for all people understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And the plan has to be to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not get rid of it, (in audible) in terms of where Donald Trump stands on that.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I want to move to an issue that's important --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She made a mistake. Number one, John McCain fought Obamacare for ten years. But it wasn't only him. It was, All of the Democrats that kept it going. And you know what? We could do much better than Obamacare. Much less money. But she won't improve private insurance for people. Private, medical insurance. That's another thing she doesn't want\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they want to have private. She wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you. We have another issue that we'd like to get to that's important for a number of Americans, in particular younger voters, and that's climate change. President Trump, with regard to the environment, you say that we have to have clean air and clean water. Vice President Harris, you call climate change an existential threat. The question to you both tonight is what would you do to fight climate change? And Vice President Harris, we'll start with you. One minute for you each.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, the former president had said that climate change is a hoax. And what we know is that it is very real. You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up. You ask anybody who has been the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go. We know that we can actually deal with this issue. The young people of America care deeply about this issue. And I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels. We have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been vice president. We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world. Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs. And I'm also proud to have the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and Shawn Fain, who also know that part of building a clean energy economy includes investing in American-made products, American automobiles. It includes growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants, not closing them like what happened under Donald Trump.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That didn't happen under Donald Trump. Let me just tell you, they lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month. It's going -- they're all leaving. They're building big auto plants in Mexico. In many cases owned by China. They're building these massive plants, and they think they're going to sell their cars into the United States because of these people. What they have given to China is unbelievable. But we're not going to let that. We'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country. Because they will kill the United Auto Workers and any auto worker, whether it's in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place. What they've done to business and manufacturing in this country is horrible. We have nothing because they refuse -- you know, Biden doesn't go after people because supposedly China paid him millions of dollars. He's afraid to do it. Between him and his son. They get all this money from Ukraine. They get all this money from all of these different countries. And then you wonder why is he so loyal to this one, that one Ukraine, China? Why is he? Why did he get 3 1/2 million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Why did he get -- why did she pay him 3 1/2 million dollars? This is a crooked administration, and they're selling our country down the tubes.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We'll be right back with closing statements from both of our candidates. A historic night, this ABC News Presidential Debate from Philadelphia. Back in a moment.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The time has come for closing statements. And Vice President Harris, we begin with you.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country. One that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past. And an attempt to take us backward. But we're not going back. And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us and we can chart a new way forward. And a vision of that includes having a plan, understanding the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes, the ambition of the American people, which is why I intend to create an opportunity economy, investing in small businesses, in new families, in what we can do around protecting seniors, what we can do that is about giving hard-working folks a break in bringing down the cost of living. I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining America's standing in the world and ensuring we have the respect that we so rightly deserve including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world. I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. I'll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a D.A. I was an attorney general. A United States senator. And now vice president. I've only had one client. The people. And I'll tell you, as a prosecutor I never asked a victim or a witness are you a Republican or a Democrat. The only thing I ever asked them, are you okay? And that's the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first. I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next 10 and 20 years to build back up our country by investing right now in you the American people.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So, she just started by saying she's going to do this, she's going to do that, she's going to do all these wonderful things. Why hasn't she done it? She's been there for 3 1/2 years. They've had 3 1/2 years to fix the border. They've had 3 1/2 years to create jobs and all the things we talked about. Why hasn't she done it? She should leave right now, go down to that beautiful white house, go to the capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do. But you haven't done it. And you won't do it. Because you believe in things that the American people don't believe in. You believe in things like we're not going to frack. We're not going to take fossil fuel. We're not going to do, things that are going to make this country strong, whether you like it or not. Germany tried that and within one year they were back to building normal energy plants. We're not ready for it. We can't sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision. But I just ask one simple question. Why didn't she do it? We're a failing nation. We're a nation that's in serious decline. We're being laughed at all over the world. All over the world, they laugh, I know the leaders very well. They're coming to see me. They call me. We're laughed at all over the world. They don't understand what happened to us as a nation. We're not a leader. We don't have any idea what's going on. We have wars going on in the Middle East. We have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine. We're going to end up in a third World War. And it will be a war like no other because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan. What these people have done to our country, and maybe toughest of all is allowing millions of people to come into our country, many of them are criminals, and they're destroying our country. The worst president, the worst vice president in the history of our country.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump thank you. And that is our ABC News presidential debate from here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center. I'm Linsey Davis.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And I'm David Muir. Thank you for watching here in the U.S. And all over the world.

He formerly was a correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Europe and Asia. The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion at CNN.\n\nParis CNN —\n\nFrance, Europe and the free world have survived a substantial challenge to their collective well-being. While some 1,200 miles away, Russian President Vladimir Putin suffered a profound blow as Emmanuel Macron defeated far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, a Putin ally, to become the first French President in a generation to win reelection.\n\nDavid A. Andelman CNN\n\nThe outcome of the contest between the two – France’s youngest leader since Napoleon and the three-time aspirant to become the nation’s first female President – was never a lock for either candidate. After a hard-fought first round among 12 candidates two weeks ago, the top two faced off in the runoff Sunday.\n\nShortly after the majority of polls had closed across the country, pollsters projected Macron to take 58.2% of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.8%.\n\nVoters simply opted, in these challenging times, for a safe middle ground rather than a firebrand far-right candidate who promised to rip up the economy and society and pivot France ever closer to Russia – all in the interest of change that the French have never truly embraced. What Le Pen did do for most of her determined supporters was to demonstrate that she could be “presidential” – but president of a France where a majority of the French people are unlikely to aspire to living.\n\nThe size of Macron’s margin, despite the high abstention rate – the highest in at least two decades – could give him a substantial boost toward a definitive majority in the National Assembly when elections to fill its 577 seats are held in June.\n\nAbove all, Sunday’s election effectively did resolve, at least for the moment, the biggest question raised during the campaign: Do most French people really want to change all that much about their country and especially a government that has served them so well for the entirety of the Fifth Republic that has endured for nearly three-quarters of a century? Especially now that Macron is in the position of assuming the de facto leadership of Europe, filling the vacuum left by last year’s departure of longtime German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Macron defined what his second and final five-year term will look like with a passion equal to the attacks of his challenger, Le Pen, who painted France with a single-color palette. Her campaign manifesto included amending the French Constitution to restrict immigration she deemed a threat to France’s identity.\n\nMacron observed that he wants a rainbow France, a nation receptive to new ideas at home or abroad, one that is comfortable as a leader of the European Union, NATO and the free world, that is prepared to stand up resolutely at any cost to tyranny abroad and at home.\n\nLe Pen’s France would have sought a path toward accommodation with a Russia that is a pariah to much of the free world, and looked inward, pulling back from Europe. At the same time, she would have enforced a ban on headscarves for women or yarmulkes for men and staged referendums to disempower a legislature and judiciary she has never succeeded in dominating.\n\nShe outlined at the same time a tempting prospect of lower taxes and broad social expenditures – all most appealing to many in a nation where inflation has soared to levels not seen since 1985. But as Macron pointed out repeatedly, you have to find a way to pay for all of this.\n\nOnce the victory celebrations are over, the reelected President will have a full plate – and much of the world will be looking to him to set an agenda. Macron still has two more months as the titular leader of Europe in the rotating system that allows each EU country a six-month term. Hopefully, he will use that term wisely, continuing to rally the continent to stand up to Putin.\n\nAt the same time there will be challenges and opportunities: Finland and perhaps Sweden on the verge of seeking entry into NATO, Ukraine seeking a fast track for its own entry into the EU.\n\nAnd at home, Macron will continue struggling with escalating inflation – matched across Europe – that is already requiring the continent’s leaders to find some path through the impact of any new energy sanctions that may be levied on Russia.\n\nThen, there’s the growing refugee issue, some 5 million people having fled Ukraine in two months. The flow will continue, first to front-line EU members such as Poland, which has taken in 3 million already, as well as Romania and the Czech Republic, all of whom are anxious to see other nations assume some of the burden, particularly France and Germany. So far barely 30,000 have arrived in France, which has agreed to accept just 100,000 – a trickle in the face of a tsunami for which Macron may be forced to answer.\n\nBeyond Europe, Macron will play a central role in navigating France’s widely heralded influence on the world stage. In Africa, there have been multiplying coups lately from Mali to Chad and Burkina Faso, accompanied by expanding terrorist activities in former French colonies, Macron was finally forced to withdraw military forces this year following scores of deaths in West Africa. France will continue to seek a path forward, working with like-minded African leaders to prevent Russian mercenaries from filling the vacuum.\n\nAnd in the Middle East, Macron has already sought a reset with a host of countries where France has growing commercial interests, particularly Gulf nations that have become major purchasers of French military equipment and in the former French colony of Lebanon, which is suffering through a massive political and economic crisis. Macron has sought to position France in the Middle East and broadly across the world as a staunch and reliable partner, in places where a realignment away from traditional allies, particularly the United States, is underway.\n\nIn Asia, Macron will certainly seek to play a leadership role in steadying the increasingly fraught relationship between the EU and China. Both sides’ eagerness to expand trade has fallen afoul of human rights abuses and China’s continued support of Russia during its war with Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Macron was left bruised and infuriated by a Biden administration security pact with the UK and Australia (known as AUKUS), that in turn torpedoed a major submarine contract between France and Australia. The United States saw the trilateral pact as its new bulwark against China. That’s just now come into sharp relief since China signed a mutual-security pact with the nearby Solomon Islands, fueling fears Beijing may be seeking a major naval base in the region – all met with just a dollop of schadenfreude in some quarters of the Elysée.\n\nFresh from presidential victory, Macron is still faced with his greatest challenge if he is to be able to move forward with his broad menu of initiatives – another national election in June when voters will choose a new National Assembly. Many of those arrayed against Macron in the presidential contest will be seeking to unseat the comfortable legislative majority he has enjoyed. In many respects, this vote could be of greater long-term significance for Macron, France and its place in the world than the presidential race.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFor the moment, however, the West still has a staunch and loyal ally with democratic aspirations and principles to play an anchor role in the future of Europe – one the White House will doubtless find appealing, as worried as the Biden administration was that Le Pen might find her way to the Élysée presidential palace.\n\nThe United States would do well, then, to cherish this victory.", "authors": ["David A.

They got beat. And particularly in these secretary of state races, and in some cases, governor’s races, where in the next presidential election you could have somebody who could really do some damage there,” Obama said in an interview with Trevor Noah on “The Daily Show.” “There, I think we held the line.”\n\nDespite the successes at the state-level, Noah pointed out that a number of GOP candidates who have made false claims about widespread voter fraud were elected to the US House. Before turning to Democratic wins, Obama said he doubted how many of those candidates actually believed “some of the nonsense” they peddled, suggesting most were either trying to troll Democrats or get in good with former President Donald Trump.\n\nRepublicans won back the House, though their majority is expected to be slender, while Democrats maintained control of the Senate – and could add to their advantage if Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeats Republican Herschel Walker next month in their Georgia run-off election.\n\n“The reason we did better than expected can be attributed to not me or anything I did,” Obama said. “We recruited some excellent candidates. You look at (Govs.-elect) Wes Moore in Maryland, Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania (and) Senate candidates John Fetterman and Mark Kelly. They are committed, passionate, down to earth. They connect with people.”\n\nThe former president credited young voters, whom, as they did in 2018 and 2020, turned out strongly for Democrats – a marked difference, he noted, from the shellacking taken by the Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nObama also blamed coordinated disinformation efforts online and the organic growth of partisan echo chambers – of all ideological varieties – for playing a role in creating an environment in which “we can’t have a debate based on facts.”\n\n“We start talking in slogans and nonsense, and there’s no reality check. We just make stuff up,” Obama said, before channeling Trump. “‘Ah, I didn’t lose an election. There’s something broken over there.’ And it’s impervious to facts.”\n\nOn ‘culture wars’\n\nObama, in a keynote speech focused on global politics at the Obama Foundation Democracy Forum, offered another post-election warning Thursday: “We’re going to have to figure out how to live together, or we will destroy each other.”\n\n“One of humanity’s greatest achievements in the modern era has been the recognition” that diverse sets of people need to be represented in government, Obama said, but he added that it also has led “people who are accustomed to being at the top of the pecking order … to feel their status in society threatened when the existing order goes through rapid changes.”\n\nThe former president cautioned that “escalating polarization and disinformation so evident in recent elections” occurred in the United States, as well as Brazil, the Philippines, Italy and Sweden.\n\n“Let me be clear, here – the threat to democracy doesn’t always run along a conservative/liberal, left/right axis. This has nothing to do with traditional partisan lines or policy preferences. What we are seeing, what’s being challenged, are the foundational principles of democracy itself,” Obama said. “The notion that all citizens have a right to freely participate in selecting who governs them; the notion that votes will be counted and the party that gets more votes wins; that losers concede, power is transferred peacefully, that the winners don’t abuse the machinery of government to punish the losers.”\n\nAddressing culture wars, Obama said, “those of us interested in democracy promotion have tried to wish away these so-called culture war questions. We like to focus on rules and laws … and we tend to see politics and governance as a constant negotiation between competing, rational, self-interested actors. But that’s not how most of us experience the world.”\n\n“We may operate on the basis of very concrete, material interests … but we also care deeply about having a coherent story about who we are and our place in the world. We care deeply about a sense of identity. A sense of belonging and a sense of status. A sense that our lives mean something and have a higher purpose,” Obama said.\n\nConflicts around culture are just exacerbated by media and the way people self-select the kind of media they consume, Obama argued.\n\n“Online media encourages this, since you’re more likely to click on to sites and read messages that reinforce your preconceived notions,” he said, adding that “the people who are most active on social media tend to be the most controversial and tend to emphasize their differences with other groups, that’s what gets attention.”\n\nAnd politicians, he said, know that “one of the easiest ways to win votes is to tap into people’s growing sense of anxiety and fear and vertigo, their sense of loss and resentment of change – to tell them that their tradition and their values, their very identities, are under attack by outsiders.”\n\nHe added: “Add it all up, and you’ve got a recipe for backlash, polarization, and the sorts of toxic, slash and burn, anything goes politics that we’ve seen erupt just about everywhere. And it’s dangerous.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg", "Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/politics/senate-incumbents-analysis", "title": "The most shocking Senate result: Every incumbent won | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of the most common refrains in politics is voters hate Washington and want outsiders to be elected to office. But Sen. Raphael Warnock’s victory in Georgia’s Senate runoff on Tuesday is part of a trend that suggests that, at least in 2022, that wasn’t true.\n\nEach of the 29 Senate incumbents who ran for reelection won. This year’s Senate elections marked the first time in at least a century in which no incumbent senator up for reelection lost.\n\nSo what just happened? Bad challenger quality, a map without a lot of competitive races taking place in an era of high polarization and an unusually tight national environment combined to create history.\n\nLet’s start with the fact that Republicans were not able to take advantage of the typical midterm headwinds that move against the president’s party. That happened in part because of bad candidate quality.\n\nThink about the challengers in the highest profile Senate races (Arizona, Georgia and Nevada) where Republicans hoped to knock off Democratic incumbents. All of the challengers had negative net favorability (favorable - unfavorable) ratings. All the senators up for reelection in these states had positive net favorability ratings.\n\nYou’ll also note that all of these states are ones in which President Joe Biden won in 2020. This brings up a second important point: The list of competitive races on this Senate map was quite small.\n\nMost of these same Senate seats were last up in 2016. That year, the party that won the presidential race in a state won the Senate race, too. Two of these Senate seats changed parties in special elections in 2020, but both of those changes occurred in states (Arizona and Georgia) that flipped on the presidential level that year as well.\n\nIn fact, Wisconsin was the one state on the Senate map this year where the incumbent running was not of the same party that won the state in the 2020 presidential election. Biden won that state by less than a point.\n\nIn an era in which polarization is high, and pretty much all the incumbents were from states that their party carried in the previous presidential election, one of two things needed to happen for the incumbents to lose: Either the challengers had to be much better liked than the incumbents or the national environment needed to be strongly in favor of one of the two parties.\n\nWe already mentioned that Republican challengers in the most competitive races with Democratic incumbents were not more popular than the incumbents. That was true as well in Wisconsin, where the Democratic challenger had a negative net favorability rating, too.\n\nThis meant that the national environment had to lean strongly toward one party to make it likely that an incumbent would lose. This didn’t happen. Instead, the Democratic and Republican candidates for Senate got about the same share of the vote nationwide when you tally up all of the races.\n\nIndeed, it was a historically close election nationally. The cumulative nationwide Senate vote margin will be the closest since at least 1990.\n\nInterestingly, the fact that not a single Senate incumbent lost seems to be in line with other history made in the 2022 election.\n\nLike in the Senate, incumbent governors across the board seemed to do historically well. There was just one governor who lost reelection (Steve Sisolak of Nevada). That one loss marks the fewest losses by sitting governors in cycles in which at least 10 of them ran since at least 1948.\n\nAnd as in the Senate races, the cumulative vote in gubernatorial races was closer than in any midterm or presidential year since at least 1990 as well.\n\nIt turns out that few voters seemed to want to “throw the bums out” in 2022. Voters actually seemed ready to have a steady hand in government in which incumbency and minimal change was favored. In an era dominated by the presence of former President Donald Trump, that’s certainly notable.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}]}

And other cities across the US, including New Orleans and Houston, are also sinking at an “even more alarming rate”, said the news site.\n\nIndeed, the study’s authors say New York is “emblematic” of the threat faced by coastal cities globally, which will likely worsen with increasing populations and building density. They added that the risk means there “is a shared global challenge of mitigation against a growing inundation hazard”.\n\nAccording to a report by C40 Cities, around “800 million people will live in cities where sea levels could rise by more than half a metre” by 2050.

His death happened during an intervention with officers from Operation Trident, a unit targeting gun crime in London, who were attempting to carry out an arrest, reported the BBC in 2015.\n\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), now called the Independent Office for Police Conduct, later admitted to wrongly giving journalists the impression that shots had been fired by Duggan.\n\nAt first, the shooting drew “little attention”, writes former Downing Street official Craig Oliver in a retrospective of the ensuing events in The Times. “But it turns out there was no gun (though one was found near by)” and Duggan’s relatives and friends were “distraught and incensed”.\n\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said he was “shocked and deeply worried” about the incident, and on Saturday 6 August 300 people gathered outside Tottenham police station to protest the shooting, saying they wanted “justice” for Duggan and his family.\n\nPart of the reason for their demonstration was down to the “alleged failure by the IPCC to provide Duggan’s family and the local community with reliable information in the aftermath of his death”, wrote The Guardian at the time.\n\nThe newspaper says “two different portraits were painted” of Duggan that week, a “hardened north London gangster and drug dealer” and a “loving family man who would never seek confrontation”.\n\nA 2014 inquest found the shooting to be lawful but concluded that Duggan did not have a weapon in his hands when confronted by police and had thrown it from the taxi.\n\nDoves are released outside Tottenham police station on 11 January 2014, during a vigil following a jury’s ruling that Mark Duggan was lawfully killed when he was shot dead by police (Image credit: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPeaceful protests turn violent\n\nAccording to the BBC, the protests started peacefully, with the demonstration outside Tottenham police station on 6 August, but a “confrontation between a teenage protester and a police officer” sparked violence, with bottles being thrown at two patrol cars, which were then set alight. Riot officers and police on horseback were “deployed to disperse the crowds”, but “came under attack from bottles, fireworks and other missiles”.\n\nThe peaceful gathering “culminated 12 hours later in a full-scale riot that saw brazen looting spread across north-London suburbs”, reported The Guardian at the time. The protest had been “good-natured”, added the paper, but what became clear over the next four hours was that as tensions “gradually escalated”, the “police made only limited attempts to talk to the demonstrators”.\n\nBy 11pm that evening, a double-decker bus had been set alight, reported The Guardian, and many local shops along the high road had been broken into. Haringey Council said the damage to roads and pavements in Tottenham was in the region of £227,000, according to the Daily Mail in 2011.\n\nBurnt out cars lie in the road after riots in Tottenham on 7 August 2011 (Image credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking on the morning of 7 August, Lammy described the events as a “disgrace”. “What happened here on Thursday night raised huge questions and we need answers”, he said. “The response to that is not to loot and rob… This must stop. This is an attack on Tottenham, on people, on ordinary people.”\n\nUnrest spreads across England\n\nThe day after the Tottenham riots, televisions showed “helicopter shots of rioting across London”, writes Oliver in The Times. “From Hackney to Croydon, Ealing to Bromley, shops [were] on fire or being looted.” It was agreed that Prime Minister David Cameron, who was on a summer holiday in Italy, should fly back as soon as possible. Then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson was criticised for not coming back from his holiday quickly enough.\n\n“These images of rioters driving the police from the streets quickly proved an inspiration to others”, says Matteo Tiratelli, a lecturer in political sociology at University College London, in The Conversation. Over the next five nights, roughly 15,000 people took to the streets in towns and cities across England. “Hundreds of police officers were injured and £250m worth of damage was done to shops and businesses in London alone.”\n\nRiot police walk along Clarence Road in Hackney, east London, on 8 August, 2011 (Image credit: Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nOn the evening of 8 August, the riots claimed two lives: Trevor Ellis, 26, was found with bullet wounds in a car in Croydon and Richard Bowes, 68, was critically injured trying to put out a fire. He later died from his injuries.\n\nTwo days later, on 10 August, Haroon Jahan, 21, Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, were killed when a car hit them in Winson Green, Birmingham. According to witnesses, they had been protecting their community and local businesses from looting and destruction.\n\nHours after finding his dying son in the street, Jahan’s father called for calm: “Black, white, Asians – we all live in the same community... step forward if you want to lose your son. Otherwise, calm down and go home – please”, he said.\n\nTariq Jahan, Haroon’s father, gives a statement to the media near to where his son and two other men were hit by a car and killed in Birmingham on 10 August 2011 (Image credit: CARL DE SOUZA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAn extra 1,700 police officers were deployed in London and more than 400 people were arrested. “The Met was stretched beyond belief in a way that it has never experienced before,” Stephen Kavanagh, the Met deputy assistant commissioner at the time, told BBC Breakfast. It is thought that social media networks including Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger played a key role in fuelling the unrest.\n\nAlthough protests over Duggan’s death had sparked the original Tottenham riots, many seemed to agree that the unrest was “a long time coming” and not just a reaction to the shooting, The Telegraph said. One woman told the paper: “You had a tinder box that was waiting and that was just the match… It's frustration by young people who have been pushed to the wall.”\n\nHow did the riots end?\n\nBy 11 August, the total number of arrests in London had reached 1,009 and of those, 464 people had been charged. One hundred families had been made homeless as a result of the unrest, five people had died and 26 police officers were injured. The situation was reaching a tipping point and, by the fourth night of the riots, London increased its number of police to 16,000 by pulling in officers from other forces across the country.\n\nA damaged Currys store is pictured in Brixton on 8 August, 2011 (Image credit: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThis greater police presence on the streets was the major factor in persuading people to stay at home, according to the Reading the Riots study, which interviewed 270 people involved in the events.\n\n“I think the 16,000 police was a deterrent for everyone; they thought: ‘You know what, we’ve done enough, we’ve done what we had to do… Leave it’,” said one of the people interviewed, a 23-year-old unemployed man from Newham, east London.\n\nOther explanations for the riots ending included a lack of excitement and there being nothing left to loot. Some of those involved in the report said they were impacted by Jahan’s father’s moving speech. “When I [saw his] interview I did stop like, because that did hit me quite hard”, one interviewee said.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nThe IPCC’s investigation into Duggan’s death continued, but in September 2011 Duggan’s brother Shaun Hall said he was “not confident at all” that the watchdog would successfully establish what had happened, the BBC reported.\n\nMembers of Mark Duggan’s family, including his aunt, Carol Duggan, and his half-brother, Shaun, examine a reconstruction of the scene of the shooting on 2 December 2013 (Image credit: Oli Scarff/Getty Images)\n\nThat same month, Scotland Yard apologised to Duggan’s family for failing to inform them directly of his death. A year on from Duggan’s shooting, in 2012, his mother, Pam, said she still had “no answers about why my son died”.\n\nTo this day, questions remain surrounding the events which led to the shooting. In 2015, an IPCC report “found Duggan was probably in the process of throwing away a handgun when he was shot”. However, Forensic Architecture, a human rights research organisation based at Goldsmiths, University of London, has said this conclusion is wrong, according to a detailed report in The Guardian published in 2020.\n\nThe IPCC has called “implausible” a claim that police moved the gun. “There is no sensible reason why they [the police] would have opted to plant the firearm on the grass such a distance away from Mr Duggan thereby giving rise to the various doubts which have inevitably arisen about this matter,” the police watchdog said.\n\nThe penal response to the rioters was “enormous and unprecedented”, says Tiratelli on The Conversation, with cases “pushed from the magistrates’ to the crown courts, ensuring that longer sentences were available and costing minors their right to anonymity in the press”.\n\nThe result was that more than 2,000 people faced jail sentences “which were four and a half times longer than those same offences would normally warrant”.\n\nIn 2011, Cameron agreed to establish the Riots Communities and Victims Panel to investigate the causes of the riots and consider what more could be done to build greater social and economic resilience in communities.\n\nNotes are pinned on a ‘peace wall’ on a boarded-up window of Poundland on Rye Lane, Peckham, in August 2011 (Image credit: John Phillips/UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nA decade on\n\nOnly “a handful” of the 63 recommendations in the After the riots report have been implemented, writes David Lammy in The Guardian, which included “calling on the government to provide greater support for families, address youth unemployment, improve school attainment, improve police relations and tackle reoffending by young offenders”.\n\nOver the years, “instead of acting to strengthen the fabric of society’s fire blanket to reduce the risk of riots”, Conservative prime ministers have “decimated police forces, youth services and local authority budgets”, he adds. “I say this with deep regret: by failing to implement the measures designed to tackle society’s dissatisfaction, alienation and fragmentation, Johnson risks letting a spark set fire to the fuel all over again.”\n\nBut writing in The Times, Oliver says he believes that if the country faced a similar situation again, “the police would be quicker off the mark in terms of tightening their grip and making clear actions have consequences”.\n\nHowever, the events of 2011 made it clear that “social order isn’t as stable as we thought”, he adds. “All it takes is for a few thousand people to rebel and, as Yeats famously wrote, ‘Things fall apart... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world’”.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/04"}]}

Haley responded by saying Scott was “scrapping.”\n\n— BrieAnna Frank\n\nMike Pence claim: Trump administration oversaw record-low unemployment for Blacks, Hispanics\n\n\"We saw literally the lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans, lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans.\" - Pence\n\nThe unemployment rates for Blacks and Latinos fell to new lows in 2019 – specifically, 4% for Hispanics or Latinos in September 2019 and 5.3% for Blacks in August 2019.\n\nBut this cherry-picked data ignores that these rates have fallen even lower under Trump's democratic successor.\n\nIn September 2022, the Hispanic or Latino unemployment rate hit a record low of 3.9%, and in April the Black unemployment rate hit a record low of 4.7%, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data.\n\nRead more:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nNikki Haley claim: China is ‘stealing $600 billion in intellectual property’\n\nHaley is offering a precise figure in an area experts say is difficult to quantify, and her figure is the high extreme of an estimated range.\n\nThe Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, a bipartisan and independent group, estimated in 2018 that Chinese intellectual property theft costs the U.S. between $225 billion and $600 billion annually. The FBI estimated in 2019 that the annual cost of all counterfeit goods, pirated software and theft of trade secrets is between $225 billion and $600 billion.\n\nThe report from the FBI states that China is “the world’s principal infringer of intellectual property, and it uses its laws and regulations to put foreign companies at a disadvantage and its own companies at an advantage.”\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nMike Pence claim: US became net energy exporter under Trump\n\nUnder Donald Trump, \"We became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 75 years.\" - Pence\n\nThis is accurate. The U.S. has been an \"annual net total energy exporter\" since 2019, when Donald Trump was still president, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nThis was a reversal of the prior seven decades.\n\n\"Up to the early 1950s, the United States produced most of the energy it consumed,\" the administration's website says. \"U.S. energy consumption was higher than U.S. energy production in every year from 1958 (to) 2018.\"\n\nIn 2022, the country's total energy exports were the highest on record, having increased more than 9% from 2021.\n\nRead more:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nVivek Ramaswamy claim: Ukraine banned 11 opposition parties\n\n“Just because Putin’s an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good. This is a country that has banned 11 opposition parties.” - Ramaswamy\n\nThis happened, but Ramaswamy left out key details on why.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy announced in March 2022 that Ukraine suspended 11 political parties because of their ties to Russia, as reported by The Guardian. The announcement came one month after Russia launched its invasion of the country.\n\n“Therefore, the national security and defense council decided, given the full-scale war unleashed by Russia, and the political ties that a number of political structures have with this state, to suspend any activity of a number of political parties for the period of martial law,” Zelenskyy said, according to the outlet.\n\nUkraine’s parliament voted in July to extend the country’s martial law until Nov. 15, Reuters reported.\n\n— BrieAnna Frank\n\nRon DeSantis claim: Toddler died after fentanyl exposure at Florida AirBNB\n\n“In Florida we had an infant, 18 months, parents rented an AirBNB. And apparently the people who rented it before were using drugs. The infant was crawling, the toddler was crawling on the carpet and ingested fentanyl residue and died.” – DeSantis\n\nThe Florida governor was talking about the death of 19-month-old Enora Lavenir.\n\nThe girl died in 2021 while she and her family stayed at a rental property in Wellington, Florida, while they visited from France, according to a report from the Palm Beach Post on the wrongful death lawsuit her family filed in March in Palm Beach County.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the home was not properly cleaned after a party was held there in which fentanyl and other drugs were present.\n\nBut official reports have not yet confirmed that. The county medical examiner’s office ruled her death accidental and said it was caused by acute fentanyl toxicity.\n\nIt is not clear how the child ingested the substance, and an incident report from the county sheriff’s office did not indicate how the toddler was exposed to the drug, according to the newspaper report. She was napping on the afternoon of Aug. 7, 2021, when her mother found her unresponsive. She was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nChris Christie claim: Trump built 52 miles of border wall\n\n\"(Trump) built 52 miles of wall and said Mexico would pay for it.\"\n\nThe length of border wall built by the Trump administration varies based on how it's counted. A count based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection data puts the total at 458 miles, but many of those additions replaced existing barriers.\n\nPolitiFact reported in August that a CBP report says former President Donald Trump's administration built \"52 miles of new primary wall systems and 33 miles of new secondary wall systems where there were none before.\"\n\nSome experts say Trump's replacement barriers shouldn't be set aside because they replaced inferior barriers. For example, nearly 200 miles of short fencing, around 3 to 4 feet high, that is intended to stop vehicles was replaced with 18- to 30-foot steel barriers, according to a Cato Institute report.\n\nRead more:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nNikki Haley claim: Fentanyl has killed more Americans than the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq\n\nFentanyl has killed more Americans \"than the Iraq, Vietnam or Afghanistan wars combined.\" -Haley\n\nThe number of U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq wars totals about 65,000 people.\n\nIn 2021 alone, there was a total of 106,000 drug overdose deaths reported in the U.S., including about 70,000 involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, which is primarily fentanyl, according to the National Institutes of Health. That makes Haley's claim true.\n\nRead more:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nDoug Burgum claim: 'China controls 85% of the rare earth minerals'\n\nThis claim is true.\n\nChina dominates the rare earth market. The country accounts for at least 85% of the world’s capacity to process rare earth minerals, according to the research firm Adamas Intelligence.\n\nThe research firm reported in September that China upped its mining quotas to 240,000 tons, a 14% increase from last year. Relaxed environmental laws have helped China gain an advantage over other countries in rare mineral production, according to Reuters.\n\nRare earth alloys and magnets are key components in the use of some military equipment, such as missiles, firearms, radars and stealth aircraft, according to Politico. Rare earth materials are also needed for more familiar technologies, including smartphones, electric vehicles and LED lights, according to the Science History Institute.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTim Scott claim: First bill under Biden had $86 billion for union pensions\n\n“We should look back at the first bill in Congress under Joe Biden. The first bill had $86 billion for the union pensions, because they continue to overpromise but underdeliver.” – Scott\n\nScott’s numbers were right, but he was a bit off on his timing. He was talking about the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that included $86 billion in aid for about 185 union pension plans that were near collapse, The New York Times reported at the time.\n\nBut it wasn’t the first bill during that term, according a search of the Congressional website. Dozens of other bills and procedural actions were introduced first.\n\nIt was first proposed a week before Biden’s inauguration in early January 2021, according to CNN. But it wasn’t until Feb. 24, 2021, that it was formally introduced in the House by Kentucky Democrat John Yarmuth.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTim Scott claim: 6 million illegal border crossings under Biden\n\nData from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection show its agents have had more than 6.2 million encounters at the southwest border since January 2021, when Biden took office. Encounters include both apprehensions, when a person is taken into U.S. custody under Title 8 of the U.S. code, and expulsions, when they are immediately expelled to their home countries or last country of transit without being taken into U.S. custody, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIllegal border crossings climbed to near-record levels in September, CBS News reported. December 2022 saw more than 250,000 crossings – both the highest number during Biden’s term and the highest number ever recorded.\n\nNikki Haley referenced the same statistic later in the debate.\n\n– BrieAnna Frank\n\nChris Christie claim: Donald Trump added $7 trillion to our national debt\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie touted this stat in asserting a lack of fiscal restraint by Republicans, echoing a claim Nikki Haley made in the August Republican debate. Haley said the figure was $8 billion, which is a little closer.\n\nUsing Treasury Department data, the total public debt, which includes intragovernmental holdings and public debt, increased by approximately $7.8 trillion from the start of Trump’s presidency on Jan. 20, 2017, to when he left office on Jan. 19, 2021.\n\nRead more: False claim Trump increased debt more than any president | Fact check\n\n-Eric Litke\n\nElection integrity a key issue for GOP candidates\n\nA key issue for the candidates is whether they will trust – and abide by – the elections that will decide the winners and losers.\n\nState-level reviews of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud. That’s significant because allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nSeveral candidates have championed changes to address election integrity.\n\nDeSantis created Florida’s Office of Election Crimes and Security. A year ago, his administration accused 20 felons ineligible to vote in 2020 of illegally casting ballots and charged them with third-degree felonies.\n\nHaley as governor signed a law in 2011 that requires South Carolina voters to show photo ID. Christie vetoed a bill in 2016 that would automatically register New Jerseyans to vote when they obtain or renew their driver’s license, calling it “a cocktail of fraud,” NJ.com reported.\n\nMisinformation has circulated about the integrity of the elections. Here are some that have been debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nUS aid to Ukraine divides Republican candidates\n\nMore than a year and a half after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, there remain differing views among Republican presidential candidates when it comes to continuing U.S. support for Ukraine's defense.\n\nTrump, who isn’t on the debate stage, has repeatedly suggested the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine. He has also refused to say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to prevail in the conflict.\n\nDeSantis has also been skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine, saying in a March statement that the war is a \"territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia\" and not one of the country's \"vital national interests.\"\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Ramaswamy said the U.S. has done enough to help Ukraine.\n\nPence, who visited Ukraine in June, has said he supports providing Ukraine with military aid to fight back against Russia. Christie too has said he supports continuing U.S. support for Ukraine, as does Scott.\n\nHaley, though, has said U.S. support should not come in the form of cash or troops on the ground, but through collaborating with allies to be sure Ukraine has \"the equipment and the ammunition to win.\"\n\nThe candidates' varied views seem to reflect public opinion. A poll by the Pew Research Center found 44% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say, as of June, that the U.S. is providing too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has frequently been the subject of misinformation, including:\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nPence makes Jan. 6 a key part of campaign\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots loom large during the campaign because two of that day’s central figures – Trump and Pence – are in the race.\n\nTrump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Pence had the power to overturn the 2020 election results while he presided over the ceremonial certification process. Pence has made his handling of the day’s events a central theme of his campaign, saying he chose loyalty to the Constitution over demands from Trump to give him the election.\n\nIn the worst attack on the Capitol in 200 years, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters overwhelmed police and raided the building on the day lawmakers formalized Biden’s victory. Some rioters chanted that they wanted Pence hanged.\n\nOther candidates have brought up the attacks, with DeSantis calling it not an insurrection but a “protest” that “ended up devolving, you know, in a way that was unfortunate.” Ramaswamy blamed the riots on “pervasive censorship” and called it “unproductive” to point the finger at Trump – who faces four charges and is accused of organizing a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nThree men involved in the riots are asking the Supreme Court to erase part of their indictment. If the justices hear their appeals, their decisions could affect part of the federal indictment Trump faces.\n\nThe attacks have been a consistent source of misinformation during the past 2½ years. Here are some we’ve previously debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nSupporters, foes point to DeSantis’ record in Florida\n\nWith Ron DeSantis in charge, Florida has been anything but calm.\n\nHis five-year record as governor shapes up as a focal point of the campaign – both for his supporters and his opponents.\n\nThere is the “war on wokeness.” The legal feud with Disney that started over the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law. The law he signed that led districts across the state to purge books from their shelves.\n\nAnd then there were the changes to the state’s history standards that say enslaved people “developed skills” they could use for “personal benefit.” That drew direct criticism from Scott.\n\nDeSantis recently added one more debate to his schedule after this one: He will face off against California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Nov. 30.\n\nWe’ve previously debunked numerous claims stemming from the Sunshine State:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nHunter Biden's legal troubles a target for Republicans\n\nThe ongoing legal case involving Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, has already had broad political implications, with many Republican lawmakers looking to tie his business activities to his father.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted Sept. 14 on two federal charges for allegedly lying to a gun dealer and on a federal form when buying a revolver in 2018.\n\nThe case nearly went away in July, but a federal judge refused to accept a plea deal after prosecutors and defense attorneys couldn't agree on the terms. Hunter Biden had previously agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of tax evasion and participate in a pretrial program for a firearm offense.\n\nThe Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also been investigating Biden in an effort to link actions by then-Vice President Joe Biden to his son's business dealings with the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. Republicans repeatedly alleged that Joe Biden was involved in influence peddling during his time as vice president. The White House has denied that allegation, calling it baseless innuendo.\n\nHunter Biden recently filed lawsuits against the Internal Revenue Service for allegedly releasing his confidential tax information and Rudy Giuliani for allegedly releasing personal information from his laptop.\n\nHere are a few of the Hunter Biden-related claims we’ve previously addressed:\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nTrump's absence doesn't stop talk of indictments\n\nTrump again won't be on the debate stage tonight, but the former president looms large over the Republican primary in light of both his commanding lead in the polls and his unprecedented legal troubles.\n\nMost recently, Trump and several allies were indicted Aug. 14 by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden in Georgia by about 12,000 votes.\n\nThe charges against Trump in Georgia are only the latest in a series of prosecutions against him that began in March, when he was indicted for allegedly falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women before the 2016 election. Trump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nWhile recent polls show Trump doesn't seem to have lost support among Republican primary voters as a result of his criminal charges, a general election could be a different story. A poll released Sept. 24 by NBC News found 62% of voters have either major or moderate concerns about Trump’s indictments.\n\nTrump's legal woes have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nAbortion sparks debate, misinformation after Roe. v. Wade ruling\n\nAbortion is expected to be a key issue, having sparked disagreement between parties as well as between the candidates on tonight’s stage.\n\nMore than a dozen states across the country have banned, or attempted to ban, abortion since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in June 2022. The decision eliminated the constitutional right to have an abortion.\n\nDemocrats have sought to use the issue to mobilize voters ahead of the 2024 election. Republican presidential candidates have generally been opposed to the procedure, but vary in how they would try to regulate it if elected.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who will not participate in the debate, has suggested he would work with “both sides” of the abortion issue and has denounced total restrictions on abortions. He criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signing of legislation banning abortion after six weeks in his state.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence clashed on the topic of a federal abortion ban at the first GOP presidential debate in August. Haley, the only woman on stage, called for finding “consensus” among people across the political spectrum on the issue while Pence responded by saying “consensus is the opposite of leadership.”\n\nBusinessman Vivek Ramaswamy has said he does not support a federal ban on abortion and believes the matter is a state issue, though he does support state bans of the procedure “around the six-week mark” of gestation. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina has advocated for a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks, while former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has called for leaving the matter up to individual states.\n\nAbortion has sparked a flurry of misinformation online:\n\n-BrieAnna Frank", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/12/weeding-robots-goat-lottery-liquor-shortage-news-around-states/117484386/", "title": "Weeding robots, goat lottery: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state agency said Friday that it will work with private organizations to encourage more elderly and disabled people to get vaccines for COVID-19, which is on the rise as the state’s inoculation rate trails the nation. With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/01/09/corrections-clarifications/1821023/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2020", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

On Sunday, May 18, a spokesperson for the former president, 82, has announced Biden has an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer that spread to the bone.\n\nBiden's diagnosis may have felt shocking to some, but it isn't a medical surprise, according to Jonathan Skinner, who studies the economics of health care at Dartmouth University. Skinner notes prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of the disease in men, particularly for those around Biden's age.\n\nStill, it's a story that feels somewhat familiar: A person finally retires after a life spent hard-at-work only to become sick.\n\nWhat continues to puzzle experts is understanding the complex link between retirement and mortality for many Americans. Research in this area is conflicting. Skinner says retiring doesn't absolutely cause higher mortality, and no one should worry that retiring could lead to a cancer diagnosis. But evidence suggests retirement and health are interactive. And gender, existing health conditions and other demographic factors are heavily influential on these relations.\n\n\"There is not a lot of agreement over whether retirement is good or bad for your health,\" Skinner says. \"As a consequence … if you're excited about retiring, that's probably a good sign for your health because anything that makes you happier and allows you more time to do the things you want is good for your health.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nOn the other hand, if leaving work fills you with existential dread, or there's a lack of social support to manage costs and maintain happiness without a paycheck, retirement may not be good choice for your wellness, he says.\n\nSome past research indicated retirement was linked to higher mortality rates. A 2018 working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that male mortality rates increase by about 2% at age 62, the same age U.S. citizens can begin collecting Social Security and often exit full-time work. For women, mortality increases were smaller and less statistically significant, the researchers found.\n\nBut retiring earlier doesn't have an exact connection to mortality. A 2020 study by Dutch researchers found on-time retirement was associated with a higher risk of mortality. Stepping away from work earlier, meanwhile, couldn't be associated with mortality positively or negatively.\n\nPlus, take the fact the median age of cancer diagnosis is 67 in America. A cohort of people is experiencing a higher risk of life-threatening diagnosis at the same time they're handing in resignation letters. That could be a lethal combination for many Americans.\n\nAnd we can't forget about \"involuntary retirement,\" Skinner says, when people have to leave work at a range of ages earlier than they want because of adverse health. For example, Biden was advised against running for another term because of his health.\n\n\"When people aren't feeling well … it's not the retirement that causes the bad health,\" Skinner says.\n\nMeanwhile, some may say it's better for healthy people to stop working earlier to enjoy life before getting sick. For example, @bill_retired on TikTok insists retirees have more time for exercise schedules, managing healthy diets and maintaining regular doctors' visits, let alone managing disease.\n\n\"We get to manage our sickness on a much more proactive basis,\" he says in a video posted to his 56,000 followers. \"We can manage our recovery at our own pace.\"\n\nRetirement news to your inbox Sign up for USA TODAY's Retirement newsletter\n\nAnd the relationship between retirement and mortality could also be explained by something called the \"healthy worker effect\": Those in good health tend to keep working while people with poor health conditions listen to their bodies as a sign to stop working. In effect, on-time retirements are often due to negative health issues, meaning these exits can lead to death sooner than later.\n\nThis comes into importance as Americans, especially women, are generally living longer, meaning they work into their senior years. But staying in the workforce longer may also be a matter of how our society feels, Skinner says. Some people may consider their life worthless if they're not working.\n\nThe 'magic number': The amount of money Americans think they need to retire comfortably hits record high\n\nEither way, Skinner advises trusting your gut on whether or not to cut the retirement cake: \"If you are anxious to step back and retire, and you can afford to do so you, you should probably do so.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/18/biden-diagnosed-prostate-cancer/83713295007/", "title": "Former President Joe Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive form' of ...", "text": "Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer that has spread to the bone, a spokesperson said in a statement on May 18.\n\nBiden, 82, was diagnosed on May 16 after \"experiencing urinary symptoms,\" and a \"nodule\" was discovered on his prostate, according to the statement. While the diagnosis indicates the former president has one of the worst forms of the disease, it \"appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians,\" the statement added.\n\nBiden, who served as president from 2021 to 2025, abruptly ended his reelection bid last July, weeks after a halting performance during a debate against then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump prompted panic among his fellow Democrats. Vice President Kamala Harris took over as the party's nominee but lost in November to Trump.\n\nWhat is prostate cancer? What to know after Joe Biden's diagnosis\n\nBiden's physical health and mental acuity drew intense media scrutiny even before the debate. At the time of his election, Biden was the oldest person to win the presidency — Trump, 78, broke that record when he defeated Harris in 2024.\n\nBiden previously served as vice president under former President Barack Obama and as a United States senator who was first elected to the office in 1972.\n\nBiden’s cancer diagnosis came on the same day audio was published of his interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. The former president’s halting speech and memory lapses in the interview – and new books about Biden – have renewed questions about his fitness when he ran in 2024 to serve a second term.\n\nBiden said in a May 8 interview on ABC’s \"The View\" of allegations he suffered cognitive decline: \"They are wrong.\" He maintained he would’ve won if he stayed in the race.\n\nThe Biden family has been devastated by cancer before. The former president’s son, Beau Biden, died of a brain tumor in 2015.\n\nTrump and Harris wish Biden a quick recovery\n\nSupport for Biden quickly poured in from across the political sphere after the news of his diagnosis.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a statement with his wife, Melania, that they were \"saddened\" to hear about the diagnosis.\n\n\"We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,\" Trump wrote.\n\nBiden defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential race after an acrimonious campaign.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who served under Biden and took over the Democratic nomination after he dropped out of the race last year, said in a statement with her husband that they are \"hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.\"\n\n\"Joe is a fighter - and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,\" Harris added.\n\nTrump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., shared a social media message from another account stating: \"Politics aside, we wish him a speedy recovery!\"\n\nObama on Biden: He will 'fight this challenge'\n\nIn a statement, Obama said he and his wife, Michelle Obama, are thinking of the Biden family.\n\n\"Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace,\" the former president said on X. \"We pray for a fast and full recovery.\"\n\nBill Clinton: 'My friend Joe Biden's always been a fighter'\n\nAmong those wishing Biden well was former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\"My friend Joe Biden’s always been a fighter,\" Bill Clinton posted on social media. \"Hillary and I are rooting for him and are keeping him, Jill, and the entire family in our thoughts.\"\n\nBiden received clean bill of health last year\n\nBiden had a routine physical in February 2024 during the last year of his presidency. The doctor’s report said he was “a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male.”\n\nThe doctors said he was receiving treatment for sleep apnea and that all of his other medical conditions remain “stable and well controlled.”\n\nA skin lesion was removed from Biden’s chest in 2023. Known as a basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, his doctor said then that no further treatment was required.\n\nA leading cause of death in men\n\nProstate cancer is the most common form of cancer for men, other than non-melanoma skin cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It is also one of the leading causes of cancer death among men of all races,\" the CDC says.\n\nThere were 236,659 new prostate cancer diagnoses in 2021, according to the most recent CDC data.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, said on X that she was \"sorry to see this news\" about the former president, adding that \"cancer is truly awful.\"\n\n\"My Dad passed away in 2021 with cancer,\" Greene added. \"Prays for Joe Biden and his family.\"\n\nRepublican Utah Gov. Spencer Cox also posted his support for Biden on X, adding that he and his family were joining \"Americans everywhere in praying for President Biden's continued health and recovery.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said on X she was \"saddened to hear\" about Biden's cancer diagnosis and wished him and his family well. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, said he was \"praying for his full recovery.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom expressed his support to Biden on X, and sent \"strength, healing and prayers his way.\"\n\n\"A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life,\" the California governor said on X.\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman said Biden has been a \"fighter his whole life\" and will prevail in his cancer fight.\n\nMeghan McCain: 'I don’t believe times like these are appropriate for politics'\n\nMeghan McCain called cancer the \"absolute worst\" and described the disease as \"hell.\" McCain's father, the late Republican Sen. John McCain, died of a deadly form of brain cancer in 2018.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult for any family, anywhere that has to deal with it. Wishing nothing but healing, prayers, light and strength to President Biden and his family,\" she said on X. \"I don’t believe times like these are appropriate for politics.\"\n\nHow common is prostate cancer?\n\nThe National Cancer Institute says that prostate cancer makes up about 15.4% of all cancer cases and estimates that there will be 313,780 cases in 2025.\n\n\"I find that it's something that a lot of men don't talk about,\" Dr. Samuel Haywood, a urologist specializing in prostate cancer, told USA TODAY when former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin disclosed that he underwent prostate cancer surgery in 2024. \"Men can be very stoic, and they don't like to talk about their health issues.\"\n\nAbout 12.9% of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point during their lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute. The Institute also says that there were an estimated 3,518,978 men living with prostate cancer in the United States in 2022.\n\nRegrets, precedent and legacy: 7 takeaways from Biden's exclusive interview with USA TODAY\n\nProstate cancer prognosis and treatment\n\nWhile non-metastasized prostate cancer has a 97.9% 5-year relative survival rate, according to the National Cancer Institute, prostate cancer that has metastasized and spread to other parts of the body has a survival rate of about 37%, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nManagement of the disease may include surgery, radiation therapies, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, among other treatment options, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nMen with earlier stages of prostate cancer can opt for \"active surveillance.\" A 2023 study found that people who chose watchful waiting were no more likely to die than those who opted for surgery or radiation and they suffered no side effects, other than perhaps some anxiety.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/19/vance-questions-biden-health-prostate-cancer-diagnosis/83723511007/", "title": "VP Vance questions Biden's health as president after cancer diagnosis", "text": "WASHINGTON − Vice President JD Vance questioned whether Joe Biden had been fit for duty in the White House following news the former president has an aggressive form of prostate cancer.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force Two after meeting Pope Leo XIV in Rome, Vance said he wishes the best for Biden, adding that \"hopefully he makes the right recovery.\" Vance then reflected on Biden's four years in the White House.\n\n\"Whether the right time to have this conversation is now or at some point in the future, we really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,\" Vance said. \"You can separate the desire for him to have the right health outcome with the recognition that whether it was doctors or whether there were staffers around the former president ‒ I don't think he was able to do a good job for the American people.\"\n\n\"That's not politics. That's not because I disagreed with him on policy,\" Vance said. \"That's because I don't think that he was in good enough health.\"\n\nBiden, 82, was diagnosed on May 16 with prostate cancer that had spread to the bone after a nodule was discovered on his prostate following urinary symptoms, a spokesperson said. Biden has a Gleason score of 9 and a grade group 5, which is on the higher end of the scale, meaning the cancer is more likely to grow and spread quickly.\n\nBiden's most recent annual physical as president took place in February 2024. The president's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, did not identify any signs of cancer, describing Biden as a \"healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.\" The report cited Biden's sleep apnea treatment and stiffened gait from arthritis.\n\n\"I blame him less than I blame the people around him,\" Vance said of Biden. \"Why didn't the American people have a better sense of his health picture? Why didn't the American people have more accurate information about what he was actually dealing with?\"\n\nIn February 2023, a skin lesion was removed from Biden’s chest, but his doctor said no additional treatment was needed for what is known as basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer.\n\nBiden, the oldest person ever elected as U.S. president, dropped out of the 2024 presidential election last July after he struggled to piece together coherent thoughts during a disastrous debate with President Donald Trump that exposed an aging president.\n\nMultiple books published in the months after Biden's presidency have detailed efforts by the White House to conceal Biden's decline, forcing Democrats to answer whether they believe the octogenarian president should have passed the torcher earlier.\n\n\"This is serious stuff. This is a guy who carries around the nuclear football for the world's largest nuclear arsenal,\" Vance said. \"This is not child's play, and we can pray for good health, but also recognize that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job.\"\n\nTrump, in a May 18 statement, said he and first lady Melania Trump were saddened to hear about Biden's cancer and extended their \"warmest and best wishes\" to the Biden family.\n\nThe next day, Trump questioned why the \"public wasn't notified a long time ago\" about Biden's cancer, appearing to put his weight behind an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that the Biden White House knew about the former president's cancer but withheld it from the public.\n\n\"I think it's very sad, actually,\" Trump told reporters when asked about Biden's diagnosis. \"I'm surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago because to get to stage 9 ‒ that's a long time.\"\n\nTrump misstated Biden's diagnosis. Stage 9 cancer does not exist. Biden's cancer is considered stage 4, the most severe level, which is defined by the cancer spreading to other parts of the body.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on May 19 said Trump still has faith in the quality of health care being provided to him in the wake of his predecessor's cancer diagnosis. \"He trusts his physicians,\" Leavitt said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include new information.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/05/20/why-bidens-cancer-wasnt-caught-earlier-psa/83722037007/", "title": "Biden has an aggressive form of prostate cancer. Should it have ...", "text": "Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to the bone.\n\nDoctors not involved in the former president's care said his diagnosis shows the nuance and challenges of screening for prostate cancer.\n\nSome, including President Donald Trump, have suggested that Biden likely knew about his cancer for a long time. But it's possible, several doctors said, that his tumor was missed or that he has a particularly aggressive form of cancer that was unlikely to be detected by routine testing.\n\nBecause prostate cancer is typically so slow-growing, men over 70 are not recommended for routine screening.\n\n\"He could be receiving the best medical care that we have to offer as a nation and not be screened for prostate cancer,\" said Dr. Michael Morris, a Memorial Sloan Kettering oncologist who specializes in treating men with prostate cancer. \"Excellent care means not under-testing. It also means not over-testing.\"\n\nBut someone of his stature likely would have received regular prostate-specific antigen tests, a blood test used to track prostate cancer risk, said Dr. Lee Richstone, the chair of urology at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if his PSA was not followed regularly, even at his age,\" Richstone said.\n\nThe results of annual physicals, released while Biden was president from 2021 to 2025, did not include any information about PSA screening.\n\nSome aggressive forms of prostate cancer yield normal PSA test results, Richstone said. In such cases, cancer can be diagnosed via a rectal exam or an MRI.\n\nBiden's personal staff announced on May 18 that he had been diagnosed two days earlier after experiencing urinary symptoms. A \"nodule\" was discovered on his prostate, according to his office's statement, and the cancer had spread to his bones.\n\nWhile the prognosis is more serious for a tumor that has spread, there are still treatment options available, doctors said, and his future is hard to predict, especially without knowing the details of his tumor or how he will react to treatment.\n\nWhat health and wellness means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's Keeping It Together newsletter.\n\nHow dangerous is prostate cancer?\n\nOther than skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe risk of getting prostate cancer increases with age. Black men are more likely than White men to get it and are twice as likely to die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nAn estimated 3.5 million men were living with prostate cancer in the United States in 2022, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nFor most men, prostate cancer is a slow-growing tumor and can be monitored without treatment.\n\nWhen caught early, doctors often recommend active surveillance, meaning monitoring the tumor for signs of growth but not immediately treating a cancer that might never turn dangerous.\n\nOnly about 2% of men die within five years of a prostate cancer diagnosis, according to the NCI.\n\nBut in cases such as Biden's, when the cancer is aggressive, some older patients \"have a significant risk of dying from prostate cancer,\" Richstone said.\n\nFor cancer that has metastasized, the median 5-year survival dips to nearly 38%, according to NCI.\n\nWhile those aggregate numbers represent the overall population, patients survive longer, said Dr. Atish Choudhury, an oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.\n\n\"The prognosis from this point is very much dependent on really how much cancer is actually outside of the prostate,\" Choudhury said, as well as how he responds to treatment.\n\n\"There have been tremendous advancements in the treatment of prostate cancer, even after it had spread to the bone, such that people are living for years and years with this particular diagnosis,\" he said.\n\nWhat we know about Biden's cancer\n\nOn May 18, Biden's personal office disclosed the former president had a Gleason score of 9, grade group 5. The statement also said his cancer had spread to the bone.\n\nWith a Gleason score of 8, 9, or 10 ‒ at the high end of the scale ‒ cancer cells look different from healthy cells, and Grade 5 is the most advanced stage, where the cells look very abnormal, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nBiden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his doctors, Biden's office said in a statement.\n\nBiden's cancer \"appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nWhat types of treatments could Biden get?\n\nMen with prostate cancer that has spread often can get hormone-based treatments to fight the disease, said Morris of Memorial Sloan Kettering.\n\nEven though \"everything sounds bad\" when a patient is diagnosed with an aggressive prostate cancer that has spread, combination therapies including hormone treatments \"are especially potent and durable,\" Morris said.\n\nDoctors might attempt to prescribe medicine to lower Biden's testosterone levels. Or they could prescribe newer drugs that target the \"testosterone apparatus in the cancer itself,\" Morris said.\n\n\"Frequently, we do both,\" he said.\n\nOther treatments could include radiation or chemotherapy, depending on how far the cancer has spread and Biden's overall health, several doctors said.\n\nDebate over PSA screening\n\nThe role of screening for prostate cancer has been debated for years amid changing guidelines.\n\nThe number of prostate cancers diagnosed each year declined from 2007 to 2014, which coincided with changes in screening recommendations, the American Cancer Society said. Since 2014, the rate has increased by 3% per year.\n\nThe influential U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 55 to 69 years at typical risk decide whether to screen for prostate cancer with a PSA test. Men should discuss with a doctor the potential benefits and harms of screening before taking a PSA, the task force said.\n\nChoudhury said the medical profession has attempted to balance the risks and benefits of screening.\n\nBenefits can include detecting potentially dangerous cases earlier. When the less aggressive screening guidance was implemented last decade, studies show men were being diagnosed later and at more advanced stages.\n\nBut screening also brings potential harms. Risks can include detecting cancers that aren't deadly, unnecessary biopsies, or treatments that produce side effects or anxiety, Choudhury said.\n\nOther doctors believe the task force's recommendation on PSA screening misses the mark.\n\n\"Occasionally, you see people like President Biden present with metastatic cancer, and then you say, 'What if we had been screening him? Could we have caught it early?' \" asked Dr. Edmund Folefac, a medical oncologist at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"Why didn't we screen it? Because we're considering everybody as part of a group, rather than as individuals.\"\n\nRichstone said the task force built recommendations based on \"antiquated practices.\"\n\nDoctors now usually follow elevated PSA results with an MRI, a step that has reduced the number of biopsies, Richstone said.\n\n\"Our biopsies are targeted, leading to much more accurate diagnosis, recognizing significant cancers and less likely recognizing insignificant cancers,\" Richstone said.\n\nWhen to get checked out\n\nUrinary symptoms like Biden experienced can be a common complaint among men with prostate cancer, Morris said, but trouble urinating due to an enlarged prostate can also be a normal part of aging.\n\nMorris urged any man who has trouble urinating or notices sudden changes, such as bleeding, to consult a doctor. A primary care doctor or a urologist might conduct an exam or order a PSA test to diagnose the condition, Morris said.\n\n\"If you do have symptoms and an issue that's interfering with your life, that's no longer in the realm of screening,\" and should get checked out Morris said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/19/joe-biden-exit-politics-complicated-explained/83716425007/", "title": "Joe Biden's exit from American politics just got more complicated", "text": "Joe Biden's exit from American politics was never going to be easy.\n\nAfter a lifetime in public office that ended with an unprecedented turnaround on whether to seek a second term, the former president has watched his mental acuity increasingly scrutinized and his White House legacy systematically steamrolled by his successor −all this in the four months since he moved out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nNow the announcement that Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, one that has metastasized to the bone, has prompted a surge of sympathy and compassion. But it has also underscored growing questions and, among some top Democrats, anger about his initial decision to run for reelection despite signs of physical frailty and the reality of advanced age.\n\n\"So far, so good,\" Biden told USA TODAY in January. \"But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?\"\n\nIn the Oval Office interview, he said he still believed that he could have defeated Donald Trump in 2024, as he had in 2020, if he hadn't pulled out of the contest after a wandering, faltering debate performance last June. His vice president, Kamala Harris, claimed the Democratic nomination but lost the general election.\n\nAmong many independent political analysts, though, Biden's defeat seemed all but guaranteed, given voters' alarm about inflation and immigration as well as concern about his vigor. Some speculate that an earlier decision not to run again, and the full-scale primary campaign that would have followed, would have allowed some other Democratic candidate to prevail in November.\n\nNow there's also this debate: Was there a cover-up to keep the American people from understanding the state of the president's health?\n\n'Is this yet another coverup???'\n\nMonitoring the health of presidents has long been a difficult enterprise, back to the disabling stroke that Woodrow Wilson suffered in 1919; his wife became his gatekeeper. When Ronald Reagan announced he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, some observers wondered if he had shown early signs of the disorder before he left the White House in 1989.\n\nEven Trump, 78, has faced questions about his mental acuity, though he has bragged about acing a cognitive test used to screen for dementia during his medical checkup in April.\n\n\"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis,\" he said on Truth Social Sunday. \"We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\"\n\nBut his son, Donald Trump Jr., who initially reposted a message that said, \"Politics aside, we wish him a speedy recovery,\" followed up with a message suggesting a conspiracy and mocking former first lady Jill Biden, who has a doctorate in education.\n\n\"What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???\" he wrote. He reposted a message that asserted, without providing evidence, that it was \"highly likely\" that Biden had been diagnosed with the cancer while he was president. (There are four stages of cancer.)\n\nThe younger Trump pinned the message to the top of his feed on the social media site X, giving it special prominence to his 15 million followers.\n\nAllegations of a cover-up have been fueled by an explosive book out May 20 by Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios. Titled \"Original Sin,\" it details how an innermost circle of White House aides protected Biden − limiting the hours of the day that he worked, the length of speeches he gave, even the access of members of his Cabinet.\n\nThe release last week of the audio recording of Biden's interview in 2023 with special counsel Robert Hur has ignited more controversy. In it, Biden speaks haltingly and struggles to remember names and dates.\n\nRep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, chair of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee said Friday that the panel would resume an inquiry into allegations of a cover-up. \"Clearly, from that interview, which was many, many months prior to the heavy use of the autopen, Joe Biden wasn't capable of making decisions,\" Comer said on Fox News's \"Hannity.\" \"He wasn't coherent.\"\n\nBiden's medical diagnosis isn't likely to deter the GOP investigations ahead.\n\n\"Look, I will say, whether the right time to have this conversation is now or sometime in the future, we really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,\" Vice President JD Vance told reporters aboard Air Force Two.\n\nAt a moment Biden had expected to write his memoirs and plan his presidential library, he instead will face not only cancer treatment but also congressional inquiries and an avalanche of questions.\n\nA reluctant Democratic reckoning\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic congressional leaders have been dodging discussions about whether they recognized a worrisome decline in Biden's acuity and, if so, what they did or should have done about it.\n\n\"We're looking forward,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said last week when Kasie Hunt of CNN pressed him on what he observed in private meetings with Biden. When she asked whether Biden's decision had cost Democrats the White House, he would only repeat, \"We're looking forward.\"\n\n\"That's it?\" she asked. \"That's it,\" he said.\n\nBut some Democrats believe the party has no choice but to explore Biden's complicated exit from politics.\n\n\"It was a mistake\" for Biden to remain in the race as long as he did, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier and set up a process that would have gotten us in a position where we could have been more competitive that fall.\"\n\nBy the 2028 presidential contest, economic and other issues will presumably dominate, but the residue of Biden's departure could be a factor as well.\n\nHis most fervent defenders and members of his administration, such as former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, could find themselves forced to address what they knew and what they did.\n\nAnd those who had some distance from the former president − Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, even New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez − could be boosted as the sort of fresh faces the party needs.\n\nAt the moment, Democrats could use a boost.\n\nOnly 17% of Americans have any optimism about the future of the Democratic Party, according to an Associated Press poll this month, a precipitous decline from the 31% who felt that way about a year ago. (Twenty-five percent are now optimistic about the future of the GOP.) Even among Democrats, only about a third expressed any optimism for their party.\n\nRebuilding credibility for the future, some say, may first require reckoning with the past.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/19/joe-biden-jill-biden-cancer-donald-trump-obama/83720912007/", "title": "Joe Biden posts message of thanks after prostate cancer diagnosis", "text": "Former President Joe Biden thanked supporters for lifting him and his wife \"up with love\" in his first public message since being diagnosed with an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer.\n\n\"Cancer touches us all.

The cancer is described as having a Gleason score of 9, denoting its aggressiveness, and has spread to the bone.\n\nThe former Democratic president and two-term vice president is reviewing his treatment options with family and physicians, the statement says. The cancer's Gleason score of 9, grade group 5, is described by the American Cancer Society as a type \"most likely to grow and spread quickly.\"\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, affecting 1 in 8 men in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nHere's what we know about prostate cancer, including early signs, testing, risk factors and survival rates.\n\nWhat are the signs of prostate cancer in men?\n\nThe announcement said that Biden had been experiencing \"increasing urinary symptoms,\" prior to the diagnosis, which is consistent with the symptoms the Cleveland Clinic lists for prostate cancer. Those symptoms include:\n\nFrequent, sometimes urgent, need to pee, especially at night\n\nWeak urine flow or flow that starts and stops\n\nPain or burning during urination\n\nLoss of bladder control\n\nLoss of bowel control\n\nPainful ejaculation and erectile dysfunction\n\nBlood in semen or urination\n\nPain in lower back, hip or chest\n\nHow to test for prostate cancer: Explaining the DRE, PSA, MRI methods\n\nA digital rectal exam, or DRE, is the most common screening test for prostate cancer, according to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. It involved a doctor inserting a gloved finger into the rectum to determine if the prostate is enlarged or has lumps, though it is not a definitive test.\n\nThe prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, is a blood test that measures levels of the antigen, which is produced by the prostate. Higher levels of PSA in the blood may indicate prostate cancer, according to the Harvard Medical School-affiliated institute, calling it a helpful screening tool for doctors also used in planning treatment, judging treatment effectiveness, and monitoring the prostate for growth. Levels of the antigen can fluctuate, however, and can sometimes be elevated as a result of infection, inflammation, an enlarged prostate, aging, or ejaculation. Conversely, the institute adds, certain conditions may make PSA levels low, such as certain herbal medicines, supplements or obesity.\n\nOther screening methods include an MRI, transrectal ultrasound and a transrectal or transurethral biopsy.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for prostate cancer?\n\nApproximately 12.9% of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point during their lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute. The Institute also says that there were an estimated 3,518,978 men living with prostate cancer in the United States in 2022.\n\nAll men are at at risk, according to the CDC, but the most common risk factor is age. \"The older a man is, the greater the chance of getting prostate cancer,\" the CDC says.\n\nOut of every 100 American men, about 13 will get prostate cancer during their lifetime, and about 2 to 3 men will die from prostate cancer. Men who have a family history of prostate cancer are also at increased risk, the center says, while Black or African American men are more than twice as likely to die from prostate cancer and get the disease at a younger age than other men, often diagnosed with more advanced stages of the cancer when it is found.\n\nHow quickly does prostate cancer spread?\n\nAs with all medical diagnoses, treatments and survivability can differ significantly from person to person.\n\nIf prostate cancer spreads, or metastasizes, to other parts of the body, it nearly always goes to the bones first, the American Cancer Society says, as is the case for the former president.\n\nWhile non-metastasized prostate cancer has a 97.9% 5-year relative survival rate, according to the National Cancer Institute, prostate cancer that has metastasized and spread to other parts of the body has a survival rate of about 37%, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n“Bone metastasis can be painful and can cause other problems, such as fractures (breaks), spinal cord compression (when a tumor presses on the spinal cord), or high blood calcium levels, which can be dangerous or even life threatening,” the society said in a 2023 fact sheet.\n\nWhat are prostate cancer treatments? Hormone therapy an option for some.\n\nWhile about 1 in 44 men will die of prostate cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, most men diagnosed with the illness do not die from it. More than 3.3 million men in the U.S. who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point are still alive today, according to a January 2025 fact sheet from the cancer research organization.\n\nManagement of the disease may include surgery, radiation therapies, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, among other treatment options, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson, Joey Garrison, James Powel, Thao Nguyen; USA TODAY\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

On May 16, 82-year-old Biden was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.\n\nThe statements continue by saying the diagnosis represents a “more aggressive form of the disease,” but “the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.” It concluded by sharing that Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with physicians.\n\nBiden and his wife, Jill, shared a post on social media on the morning of May 19 thanking everyone for the well wishes about the former president’s health.\n\n“Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support,” the post read.\n\nProstate cancer\n\nProstate cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the prostate, a small gland that helps make semen. It’s found just below the bladder and is part of the male reproductive system, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States, aside from non-melanoma skin cancer. It also one of the leading causes of cancer death among men of all races and Hispanic origin populations.\n\nProstate cancer is usually found early and often grows slowly. Most people with prostate cancer are cured. If the cancer grows beyond the prostate or spread, there are “many treatment options.” If a cure is not possible, treatment options to prolong life and slow the spread are available, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\nMetastatic prostate cancer\n\nWhen prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nWhat is a Gleason score?\n\n“The Gleason score is a way of describing prostate cancer based on how abnormal the cancer cells in a biopsy sample look under a microscope and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread,” according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe Gleason score usually ranges from 6 to 10. The lower a score is, the more the cancer cells look like normal cells are likely to grow and spread slowly. Biden’s score of 9 is at the highest level, in Grade Group 5, indicating that the cancer cells look different from normal cells and will grow and spread more quickly.\n\nThis category is also associated with a greater likelihood of metastasis and a “more challenging prognosis,” the National Cancer Institute reported.\n\nJoe Biden’s health\n\nDuring his last routine physical as president in February of 2024, Biden received a clean bill of health.\n\nIn February of 2023, a cancerous skin lesion was removed from Biden’s chest. The basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, required no further treatment, according to his doctor.\n\nPrior to his presidency, Biden had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed with Mohs surgery, a procedure used to treat skin cancer that involves cutting away thin layers of skin, according to ABC News.\n\nSymptoms of prostate cancer\n\nSigns and symptoms of early-stage prostate cancer, which has not metastasized, according to Mayo Clinic, are:\n\nBlood in the urine, which might make the urine look pink, red or cola-colored\n\nBlood in the semen\n\nNeeding to urinate more often\n\nWaking up to urinate more often at night\n\nTrouble getting started when trying to urinate\n\nSigns and symptoms of advanced prostate cancer include:\n\nBack and/or bone pain\n\nAccidental leaking of urine\n\nErectile dysfunction\n\nFeeling very tired\n\nWeakness in the arms or legs\n\nLosing weight without trying\n\nTornado hit Delaware: Tornado confirmed in Sussex County following Friday's severe storms\n\nProstate cancer risk factors\n\nFactors that can increase the risk of prostate cancer, according to Mayo Clinic, are:\n\nAge. Prostate cancer is most common after age 50\n\nRace and ethnicity. Black people have a greater risk of prostate cancer than people of other races and ethnicities\n\nFamily history of prostate cancer\n\nObesity\n\nSmoking tobacco\n\nHow to prevent prostate cancer\n\nThere is no “sure way” to prevent prostate cancer, but there are ways to reduce your risk of prostate cancer, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\nPreventive measures include:\n\nChoosing a healthy diet\n\nExercising most days of the week\n\nMaintaining a healthy weight\n\nRefraining from smoking\n\nTaking medicines to lower the risk of prostate cancer if you are at high risk of developing it\n\nJoe Biden's son Beau\n\nBiden, who made cancer research a focus of his president, lost his oldest child Beau Biden to brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46.\n\nDuring his two terms as Delaware attorney general, Beau Biden was beset by health problems. He suffered a minor stroke in 2010 that kept him out of office for several weeks. In 2013 he was treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Center Center in Houston after becoming weak and disoriented on a family vacation, undergoing what a member of his medical team later described as surgery to remove a \"small lesion\" in his brain.\n\nShortly after Beau Biden's death, the then vice president confirmed his son was diagnosed with brain cancer in August 2013 and underwent the surgery at MD Anderson, which was followed by a normal course of treatment of radiation and chemotherapy. His doctor gave him a clean bill of health in November 2013.\n\nBut Beau Biden suffered a recurrence in the spring of 2015 and immediately sought aggressive treatment.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Casey White and Vicky White, who were not related, may have planned his escape over the phone, but authorities must listen to each of 949 calls before making a determination. Authorities have said the two were in a romantic relationship, and Singleton said at least some of the calls were sexual in nature. The phone calls occurred after Casey White was transferred from the Lauderdale County Jail to a state prison where he was held until being returned to Lauderdale County before the escape, the sheriff said. Casey White walked out of the jail in handcuffs in April accompanied by Vicky White, the assistant corrections director, prompting an 11-day search for the pair. On the day of the escape, Vicky White, 56, told co-workers she was driving the inmate to a mental health evaluation. The two were eventually discovered in Indiana, where Casey White was captured. Vicky White shot herself in the head moments before the man was arrested, authorities said. Casey White was charged with escape and murder in her death. The defense has filed documents suggesting Vicky White was in charge of the escape.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A powerful storm sweeping north through the Bering Strait on Saturday caused widespread flooding in several western Alaska coastal communities, knocking out power and sending residents fleeing for higher ground. The force of the water moved some homes off their foundations, and one house in Nome floated down a river until it got caught at a bridge. The potent storm – what remains of Typhoon Merbok – has been influencing weather patterns as far away as California. In Alaska, no injuries or deaths were immediately reported, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Officials had warned that some places could see their worst flooding in 50 years and that the high waters could take up to 14 hours to recede. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration during the day. The nearly 1,000-mile storm front has damaged roads and potentially other infrastructure, Dunleavy said at a Saturday evening news conference. Officials will evaluate any effects on water and sewer systems, seawalls, fuel storage areas, airports, and ports. Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives were already in Alaska before the storm, and Dunleavy said they will stay to help assess damage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Republican leaders of the Arizona Legislature will not try to defend a new law limiting up-close filming of police that has been blocked by a federal judge, a decision that essentially ends the fight over the contentious proposal. Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers both said they would not intervene in the case by the Friday deadline set by the federal judge when he temporarily blocked the new law from taking effect last week on First Amendment grounds. And the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. John Kavanagh, said Friday that he has been unable to find an outside group to defend the law, which was challenged by news media organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups will now ask that the law, which was set to take effect next week, be permanently blocked. Kavanagh said he will review U.S. District Judge John J. Tuchi’s ruling and see if he can craft a law that passes constitutional muster. He said the law is needed to keep people from distracting police trying to make an arrest, but Tuchi agreed with the challengers that it runs afoul of precedents that say the public and press have a right to film police doing their jobs. Tuchi noted there are already Arizona laws barring interfering with police and said singling out people for taking videos appears to be unconstitutional on its face.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, a Republican who is running for governor, was released from a hospital Saturday after undergoing surgery for thyroid cancer. “Following successful surgery on Friday to remove her thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes and in consultation with her physician, Sarah was discharged from an Arkansas hospital cancer-free,” said Sanders spokesperson Judd Deere. “She will spend the remaining portion of her recovery at home.” Deere told the Associated Press that Sanders, 40, planned to resume campaigning “soon,” but it was not known precisely when she would return. Sanders said Friday when announcing the surgery that a biopsy earlier this month revealed she had thyroid cancer. Dr. John R. Sims, a surgeon at CARTI Cancer Center in Little Rock who is one of Sanders’ doctors, said her cancer was a stage 1 papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer, and said she has an “excellent” prognosis. Sims said Sanders will need adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine and long-term continuing care. Sanders, who served as ex-President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman until 2019, is running against Democratic nominee Chris Jones. She is the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A new state law will help military service members who were discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies because of their sexual or gender identities to reestablish their eligibility for Veterans Affairs benefits, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday. “For decades, our bravest heroes, men and women who wore the uniforms of the armed services had to hide who they really were, and many were other than honorably discharged if their sexuality was discovered,” Newsom said in a statement after announcing he had signed the bill. Gays and lesbians were banned in the military until the 1993 approval of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the policy that allowed them to serve only if they did not openly acknowledge their sexual orientation. Rather than helping, advocates say, it created more problems. Repeal of the law was approved by Congress and then-President Barack Obama in late 2010 and took effect nine months later, allowing lesbian, gay and bisexual people to serve openly. The Department of Defense subsequently created a path for veterans who had been discharged under the policy to receive the full range of veterans’ benefits. “But many veterans sadly don’t know or can’t even access this important process,” Newsom said, adding that some have had to hire expensive legal counsel to navigate the process. “We’re taking steps to fix this.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Stricter air quality regulations are coming for northern Colorado businesses after the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday downgraded the area to a category for “severe” violators of ozone standards. Drivers may have to pay higher gas prices, too, because the reclassification prohibits the sale of conventional gasoline within one year. State environmental officials, however, believe they can achieve better air quality without needing to switch to the reformulated blend of gasoline the EPA requires, Colorado Air Pollution Control Division spokesperson Leah Schleifer said in a news release. Colorado has asked the EPA to reassess that requirement and consider the state’s alternative plan. The gasoline blend would raise gas prices 20-30 cents per gallon, AAA estimates, according to the Denver Post. The area includes a large swath of northern Colorado including Denver, Boulder, Greeley, Fort Collins and Loveland. Colorado estimates it will issue more stringent permits for 600 oil and gas facilities and about 100 more industrial sites, the news release said. The Colorado area was one of six areas to get downgraded by the EPA along with the Chicago area; Texas’ Dallas-Forth Worth and Houston areas; parts of Connecticut and the New York-New Jersey-Long Island area; and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians in Southern California.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who is on trial in Connecticut for calling the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre a hoax, continued Friday to describe the proceedings as a “kangaroo court” from his Infowars studio in Texas. Jones’ commentary became a focus of testimony on the fourth day of the trial, with a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families questioning a corporate representative for Jones’ Infowars brand about how seriously the company was taking the trial. The lawyer, Christopher Mattei, showed the jury a photo he said was of an Infowars webpage, depicting the judge in the trial with lasers shooting out of her eyes. “On a scale of one to 10, how seriously is Infowars taking this trial?” Mattei asked the corporate representative, Brittany Paz. “Ten. It’s serious to me,” Paz responded. The exchange occurred as Jones prepares to attend the trial in Waterbury this week and as the judge, Barbara Bellis, considers a request by the families’ lawyers to limit what Jones and his lawyer can say and argue in court. Jones is expected to testify, but it’s not clear yet when. “They are pretending to the world that it’s an actual trial, but I’m guilty when I get there, and I can’t say I’m innocent,” Jones said on his Infowars web show Friday. “Everybody fundamentally knows that’s a fraud.”\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: In future summers, the edges of the city’s boardwalk could have a new, larger look. Multiple plans are in the works to build hotels in Rehoboth Beach, one of Delaware’s most popular destinations that keeps getting busier. In the coming years, when beachgoers look back on the avenue from the sand, there will likely be more oceanfront balconies and windows than one-story shops. Two projects could shake up the end of the boardwalk. The longtime owner of the Candy Kitchen corner wants to build a 100-plus room building there in the image of a mid-20th-century hotel. Across the avenue, Grotto Pizza is taking over the former Dolle’s with plans for a restaurant and hotel. Elsewhere on Rehoboth Avenue, a motel is being renovated into a boutique hotel. A court battle will decide whether an office strip is replaced by another hotel.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local officials will consider legislation Tuesday to support migrants bused into the district from Texas and Arizona, WUSA-TV reports. The DC Council plans to vote on an emergency bill introduced by Councilmember Brianne Nadeau at the request of Mayor Muriel Bowser. The measure calls for the establishment of welcome and reception services and the provision of food, clothing, medical services, cash assistance and other necessities for migrants. But the proposal has some residents worried about unintended consequences. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless called the legislation a “poison apple” Thursday. LegalAidDC tweeted Friday that the council should reject the bill in its current form, saying it “will weaken basic protections that all unhoused individuals & families deserve when they seek help in the District.” The group also said in a statement that it is concerned about the “unchecked” powers it would give the mayor. The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network has repeatedly taken issue with Bowser’s claims that the overwhelming majority of migrants do not want to stay in D.C. once they arrive, saying that takes focus off the need to support those migrants who do want to stay in the capital. Local nonprofits say almost all the people arriving are asylum-seekers with pending immigration cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Attorneys for school shooter Nikolas Cruz asked for the judge in his murder case to remove herself Friday, two days after she scolded them when they abruptly rested their case after calling only a fraction of their expected witnesses. The Broward Public Defender’s Office said in a motion that Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer held a long-standing animosity toward lead defense lawyer Melisa McNeill. The motion cited Florida’s Judicial Code of Conduct that states a judge shall disqualify himself or herself if the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party’s lawyer. Defense attorneys said Scherer’s repeated improper and unjustified attacks on the defense counsel undermine the public’s confidence in the judicial system and have also caused Cruz to fear that he will not receive a fair trial. Prosecutors said in a response that Scherer has been respectful to both sides. Cruz’s attorneys had told the judge and prosecutors they would be calling 80 witnesses but surprisingly rested at the start of Wednesday’s court session after calling only about 25 of them. Scherer called the decision without warning to her or the prosecution “the most uncalled for, unprofessional way to try a case.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor, is launching an intensive effort to get out the vote by urging potential supporters to cast in-person ballots the first week of early voting as she tries to navigate the state’s new election laws. The strategy, outlined to the Associated Press by Abrams’ top aides, is a shift from 2018, when she spent generously in her first gubernatorial bid to encourage voters to use mail ballots. It also moves away from Democrats’ pandemic-era emphasis on mail voting, a push that delivered Georgia’s electoral votes to President Joe Biden and helped Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff win concurrent U.S. Senate runoffs to give Democrats control of Capitol Hill. Republicans, including Abrams’ opponent, Gov. Brian Kemp, answered in 2021 with sweeping election changes that, among other provisions, dramatically curtailed drop boxes for mail ballots, added wrinkles to mail ballot applications and ballot return forms, and made it easier to challenge an individual voter’s eligibility. But it also expanded in-person voting. “It’s self-evident we have to have a big early vote in-person,” said Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo, arguing the new mail ballot procedures make it risky for Democrats to rely too heavily on that option. “What’s not self-evident,” Groh-Wargo said, “is how the hell you do that.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A business owner and a Maui County official have been charged with bribery and public corruption involving more than $2 million in cash and gifts, federal court documents unsealed Thursday showed. Milton Choy, the owner of a Honolulu company that provides wastewater services and supplies, is accused of bribing Stewart Olani Stant, who was a wastewater manager and then director of the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. Choy provided Stant with cash deposited directly to Stant’s bank accounts, plus gambling chips and trips to Las Vegas, U.S. Attorney for Hawaii Clare Connors said at a news conference. In return, prosecutors said Choy received upward of $19 million in business contracts from the county. Messages left for Stant on various social media sites were not immediately returned. Listed phone numbers had been disconnected. Choy took responsibility for his actions and admitted everything he did to federal investigators, said his attorney Michael Green. “He gave unprotected statements – that’s where you don’t ask for a lawyer, and you you sit down with the agents and tell them what you did. And he did that,” Green said. The two will be arraigned in federal court Monday.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Huckleberries are highly sought after, but the coveted mountain fruit was difficult to find across much of northern Idaho and eastern Washington this year. Pickers were able to locate some productive plants and patches, but they frequently encountered healthy bushes that had few berries or none at all, The Lewiston Tribune reports. “In general terms, this is not a very good year,” said Wayne Kasworm, a grizzly bear biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who tracks huckleberry production in the Selkirk, Cabinet and Yaak mountain ranges. With a changing climate, scientists like him increasingly are tracking huckleberries that are an important food source for grizzly bears and other wildlife and coveted by people as well. Native Americans have harvested huckleberries for thousands of years and continue to do so today. The small berries with a pleasant mix of sweet and tart are targeted by recreational and commercial pickers as well. They are used to make pies, ice cream and other desserts, as well as being added to pancakes, milkshakes and smoothies. Grizzlies depend on the berries as a key food source. “The other thing I’ve learned in the process of doing this work is just how many other species rely on huckleberries. It’s really a keystone species,” said Tabitah Graves, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Two police officers face felony charges for allegedly shooting and seriously wounding an unarmed man during a July shootout on the city’s southwest side that also wounded a second man, authorities said Friday. Sgt. Christopher Liakopoulos, 43, and Officer Ruben Reynoso, 42, of the Chicago Police Department, have been charged with one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated discharge of a firearm and official misconduct, said Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. She said the officers were relieved of their police powers Thursday before they turned themselves in to authorities. Foxx said both officers “are being charged with having fired their shots” that wounded an unarmed 23-year-old man – identified separately Friday through a civil court filing as Miguel Medina – on July 22 in the city’s Pilsen neighborhood. That man has since recovered and is cooperating with the investigation, she said. “The victim who was shot and injured in this incident was not in possession of a weapon, nor did he fire a weapon at these two officers,” Foxx said during a news conference. The officers were heading to a morning training course and were in plain clothes at the time of the shooting. They weren’t wearing their police body cameras because they were going to training, Assistant State’s Attorney Alyssa Janicki said. Prosecutors later obtained surveillance video from the area.\n\nIndiana\n\nElkhart: A staffer for U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski was trying to pass a flatbed truck on a northern Indiana highway last month when the SUV in which they were traveling crashed into an oncoming car, killing Walorski and three other people, police said Friday. A witness traveling behind the SUV told investigators it sped up, crossed the centerline of the two-lane highway as it neared the truck, and pulled into the path of the other car when the crash happened about 12:30 p.m. Aug. 3, according to the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office. Airbag control module data from the SUV driven by Zachery Potts, 27, who was Walorski’s district director, showed it was going 77 mph at the time of the crash on a rural stretch of Indiana 19 near the town of Wakarusa, the office said. “All of the evidence and information gathered is consistent with someone attempting to pass another vehicle on a two-lane roadway,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Walorski, 58, was a Republican first elected in 2012 and was seeking reelection this year to a sixth term. The sheriff’s office released statements from the county coroner ruling the deaths of Walorski and the others as accidental from injuries suffered in the crash. Investigators blamed the crash on Potts for “driving left of center with a contributing factor of excessive speed.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Iowa Confluence Water Trails project received a big boost Friday when Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will allocate $7million in federal funding for its construction. Though backers of the project aim to develop outdoor attractions across 150 miles of waterways in central Iowa, the governor allocated the latest round of funding to one of the project’s focal points: the Scott Avenue dam development at the confluence of the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers in downtown Des Moines. Developers plan to turn the low-head dam into two whitewater features for rafting, kayaking, canoeing, tubing and surfing. They also expect to add trails, a plaza and fishing areas. The latest grant represents about 13% of the $53.5 million budget for the development. The water trails comprise one of two Des Moines projects that received federal money through the state’s Destination Iowa program Friday, with the governor allocating $1 million to renovation of the Val Air Ballroom in West Des Moines. Reynolds also awarded Council Bluffs and the Southwest Iowa Nonprofit for Collaborative Impact $4.9 million for a joint plan to redevelop a stretch of that city’s Missouri River frontage.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hundreds of thousands of dollars of COVID-19 relief funds spent by state and local governments could have violated federal rules or were ill-advised, a report released Wednesday by the Legislature’s nonpartisan auditing office showed. The audit comes as state officials are still grappling with how to spend millions in federal pandemic relief, with the process to dole out the money coming under fire over transparency concerns. Of the $18 million in expenditures by county governments, nonprofits and businesses reviewed by the Division of Legislative Post Audit, officials flagged $1.1 million in spending as ill-advised, with an additional $264,000 considered wasteful or excessive. And while 85% of funding was considered to be clearly allowable under federal guidelines, it was unclear whether $2.7 million in spending was acceptable. Another $48,000 was deemed to likely not be allowed. Potentially problematic expenditures ranged from a recipient of a small-business grant who conducted a festival to the purchase of electronic signs, sports equipment and office supplies by local governments. In Bourbon County, officials gave a vendor $450,000 to start a grocery store in a part of Fort Scott considered to be a food desert – only to see the store close after a few months.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: When 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on his fellow students during a morning prayer meeting in 1997, school shootings were not yet a part of the national consciousness. The carnage that left three students dead and five more injured at Heath High School, near Paducah, ended when Carneal put down his weapon, and the principal walked him to the school office – a scene that seems unimaginable today. Also stretching today’s imagination: Carneal’s life sentence guaranteed an opportunity for parole after 25 years, the maximum sentence permissible at the time given his age. A quarter-century later, Carneal is 39 with a parole hearing this week that comes at a very different time in American life – after Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Parkland, after Uvalde. Today, police officers and metal detectors are an accepted presence in many schools, and even kindergartners are drilled to prepare for active shooters. “Twenty-five years seemed like so long, so far away,” Missy Jenkins Smith recalls thinking at the time of the sentencing. Jenkins Smith was 15 when she was shot by Carneal, someone she considered a friend. The bullet left her paralyzed, and she uses a wheelchair to get around. The shooting at Heath High School took place Dec. 1, 1997, less than four months before a shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Carneal’s parole hearing is scheduled to start Monday with testimony from those injured in the shooting and close relatives of those who were killed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families and businesses in Tangipahoa Parish are a step closer to getting paid for flood damages in 1983 caused by the construction of Interstate 12. A $95 million payment was approved Friday by the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, The Advocate reports. The committee’s action allows the money to be moved to an escrow account and eventually to the 1,246 victims, 400 families and 96 businesses harmed. “This is the single final payment that resolves the entirety of the lawsuit,” Commissioner of Administration Jay Dardenne said. When those payments will be made is unclear. The state earlier put $6 million into an account for the plaintiffs, which means the total settlement is $101 million, the newspaper reports. Dardenne said he is confident a district judge will approve the payment, which will then allow a special master to decide how much individuals and businesses are owed. Rains on April 6, 1983, flooded about 6,000 homes in the Baton Rouge area. In Tangipahoa Parish, east of Baton Rouge, the newly opened I-12 acted like a large levee and resulted in water from the Tangipahoa River being diverted into homes and businesses. In 1999, a jury decided that the I-12 bridge over the river did not change elevation crossing the river as it should have and awarded plaintiffs in $92 million. However, nothing happened for years while the state Department of Transportation and Development appealed, and the Legislature declined to approve the award.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Wild blueberries were smaller this summer in the barrens of Maine, where the sweet crop expanse dominates treeless plains of sandy soil. Some of the lowbush berries started shriveling or ripened too quickly, hitting the dry ground before harvest season began. The drought-stressed plants were speeding up their production process. Lobster and blueberries go hand-in-hand when people think of Maine. The state’s iconic wild blueberries are one of only three fruits native to North America, and they’re loaded with twice the antioxidants of their ordinary crop equivalent. There are 36,000 acres of commercial wild blueberry land in the state, and the crop’s total value reaches tens of millions of dollars each year. But climate change-induced drought is threatening the superfood fruit, particularly the native lowbush species in Maine where irrigation systems are few and far between. With climate change creating a world of extremes in New England – longer and more frequent dry spells punctuated by deluges of rain within shorter periods of time – the region’s blueberry farmers face the task of adapting. “In every season, there are all of these different weather events that can happen that can increase or decrease the crop,” said Lily Calderwood, extension wild blueberry specialist and assistant professor of horticulture at the University of Maine. “Every year is a new adventure. And because of climate change, we have seasonal droughts that occur more frequently now.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A court hearing has been set for Monday to consider a request from prosecutors to vacate the 2000 murder conviction of Adnan Syed, whose case was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.” Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn scheduled the hearing for 2 p.m., The Baltimore Sun reports. The development comes after Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion Wednesday saying a lengthy investigation conducted with the defense had uncovered new evidence that could undermine the conviction of Syed. He has served more than 20 years in prison for the strangling of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, who was 18 when she was killed in 1999. Her body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed, 42, has maintained his innocence for decades and captured the attention of millions in 2014 when the debut season of the “Serial” podcast focused on the case and raised doubts about some of the evidence, including cellphone tower data. Prosecutors said in their motion that they weren’t asserting that Syed is innocent but that they lacked confidence “in the integrity of the conviction” and recommended he be released on his own recognizance or bail. “We believe that keeping Mr. Syed detained as we continue to investigate the case with everything that we know now, when we do not have confidence in results of the first trial, would be unjust,” State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Taxpayers can look forward to seeing a return of some of their tax dollars this year, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. The announcement came after the state auditor’s office certified that tax revenues exceeded allowable revenues under a little-noticed 1986 law that kicked in due to the state’s soaring tax collections. As a result, taxpayers are on tap to claim a share of more than $2.9 billion dollars. Those eligible will receive refunds automatically as a check sent through the mail or via direct deposit. Distribution of refunds is expected to begin in November. In general, eligible taxpayers will receive a credit in the form of a refund that is approximately 13% of their Massachusetts Tax Year 2021 personal income tax liability, officials said. To be eligible, individuals must have filed a 2021 state tax return on or before Oct. 17, 2022. An individual’s credit may be reduced due to unpaid taxes, unpaid child support or certain other debts.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Friday signed off on a fund for more than 1,000 people who said they were sexually assaulted by a University of Michigan doctor – an order that allows victims to start collecting a portion of a $490 million settlement negotiated with the school. “The University of Michigan offers its heartfelt apology for the abuse perpetrated by the late Robert Anderson. We hope this settlement helps the healing process for survivors,” said Paul Brown, chairman of the school’s governing board. Anderson died in 2008 after working at the university for nearly 40 years. He was director of the campus Health Service and a physician for multiple sports teams, including football. Former athletes, students and others who had no connection to the university – mostly men – said they were molested by Anderson during routine physicals or other visits. The settlement was announced in January, but the final details took months to wrap up. The university said the deal recently got approval from 98% of claimants. “It’s been a long road,” said Richard Schulte, a lead negotiator for Anderson’s victims. “I’m very happy for the survivors and glad I could get it across the finish line.” Six percent, or $30 million, of the settlement will be set aside for people who step forward later with claims.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Democratic Gov. Tim Walz agreed Saturday to two additional debates against Scott Jensen, following complaints from the Republican challenger that Walz is ducking him. The candidates will meet for an Oct. 18 debate sponsored by a group of television stations that includes KEYC in Mankato, KTTC in Rochester, KBJR in Duluth and KXJB in Fargo, North Dakota. Another debate is scheduled for Oct. 28 on Minnesota Public Radio. Jensen called Walz’s announcement “a classic case of too little, too late” because early voting begins this week. Jensen, a former state senator, and Walz previously debated at Farmfest, a yearly agricultural expo near Redwood Falls. The Walz campaign said that holding three debates matches the number of forums “that were held in the U.S. Senate elections won by Amy Klobuchar in 2018 and Tina Smith in both 2018 and 2020.” Both debates will be streamed online, according to Walz’s campaign.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city’s water crisis isn’t over, even if its boil-water advisory was lifted Thursday. While the state stopped handing out free bottled water at sites around Jackson on Saturday night, the city said water pressure still hasn’t been fully restored, and state health officials said lead in some pipes remains so worrisome that pregnant women and young children should still use bottled water. “The water that’s coming out of my kitchen sink smells like fresh sewage … as soon as you turn it on, it hits you right in the face. It’s horrible,” resident and mother Carey Wooten said earlier this month. “I’ve tried to give one of my dogs the water, but when she smells it, she won’t even touch it. She walks away from it.” Wooten said Friday that the liquid flowing into her kitchen sink still smells like sewage, but not as bad as before, and she’s glad she won’t have to run to distribution sites before their bottled water supplies run out each day. Other residents said Friday that their water remains too discolored to count on, so now they’ll have to rely on water distribution by community-run charities or buy water again themselves, adding insult to injury. Residents, politicians, experts and activists say systemic racism is the root cause of the crisis. White flight that began accelerating around 1980, a decade after the city’s schools began integrating, left less revenue to maintain infrastructure. Middle-class Black people then moved out to escape urban decay and rising crime. State and federal spending never made up the difference.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A convicted felon accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people while dressed as Batman villain the Joker was sentenced Friday to 60 days in jail, with credit for several months served after his arrest. Jeremy Garnier, 51, of University City, was sentenced after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of making a terrorist threat. Prosecutors reduced the charge from a felony for the March 2020 incident. Garnier told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he never intended to make a threat and pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor to avoid many more months in jail. “I was talking like the Joker,” Garnier said Saturday in an interview. “I was in character. Everybody knew that it was a joke and that I had no intentions of following through with a threat.” Garnier told the Post-Dispatch he served more than 20 years in federal and state prison for robbing a credit union in the 1980s and for other felonies in order to support his crack habit. He said he is now sober and wants to use his platform to raise awareness about the opioid epidemic. He said he has learned another hard lesson. “Think before you act,” he said. “Your actions have repercussions. No matter how trivial and joking I thought it was, people took it seriously.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has determined three laws passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature to regulate activities on university campuses are unconstitutional, including one that sought to ban transgender women from participating on female collegiate sports teams. Montana’s Constitution gives the state board of regents full authority to govern public college campuses and precludes state lawmakers from imposing their own rules, District Court Judge Rienne McElyea said in a ruling issued Wednesday that was emailed to attorneys in the case Friday. Her ruling noted that the Montana Supreme Court recently affirmed the same conclusion in a challenge to a bill that sought to allow more people to carry guns on campuses. The ruling was the second judicial setback of the week on laws passed by Montana’s 2021 Legislature that affected transgender residents. A different state judge on Thursday clarified that he temporarily blocked health officials from enforcing a state rule that would prevent transgender people from changing the gender on their birth certificate. In response, the Republican-run state on Thursday said it would defy the order. The ruling comes amid a heated national debate over whether transgender women should be allowed to participate in female sports at the high school and collegiate level.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by two Omaha women who sought to have both their names listed as parents on their children’s birth certificates, saying the request conflicts with state law. Lancaster County District Judge Ryan Post said in his ruling last month dismissing the lawsuit that state law requires birth certificates to acknowledge paternity. Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services policy also requires that parents listed on birth certificates be the biological parents of the child, he said. The Nebraska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state last year on behalf of Erin Porterfield and Kristin Williams. They said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services repeatedly denied their request to amend one son’s birth certificate in their effort to get full legal recognition as parents of both their sons – one born to each woman conceived through a sperm donor. Porterfield and Williams were in a romantic partnership from 2000 to 2013 – two years before same-sex marriage was legalized in Nebraska. Porterfield gave birth to their first son in 2002, and Williams gave birth to their second son in 2005 before their romantic relationship ended in 2013. But both women continue to share parenting duties. In their lawsuit, the women said that state officials treat unmarried, same-sex couples differently than unmarried, opposite-sex couples, violating their due process and equal protection rights.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The GOP’s nominee for governor said Thursday that he would fight against a national abortion ban if Congress were to pass one. “It’s the vote of the people within the state of Nevada, and I will support that,” Joe Lombardo, who is generally anti-abortion, told reporters while campaigning. “That is an issue that doesn’t need to be in politics.” Nevada voters codified the right to abortion up to 24 weeks into pregnancy into law in a 1990 referendum. Any order to further restrict abortion would have to come from a vote of the people, not the Legislature, unlike in many other states. Last week U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., proposed a near-total abortion ban after 15 weeks. The legislation undermined many GOP candidates’ arguments this summer that the future of abortion rights in the U.S. would be decided by individual states. Lombardo, who is the Clark County sheriff, has long maintained that as governor he would respect the 1990 vote, though he is Catholic and holds anti-abortion views. Still, a nationwide abortion ban would supersede Nevada law, and it is unclear how Lombardo could fight one. Republican April Becker, a candidate in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, opposes abortion except for instances of rape and incest. But she told NBC News last week that she would vote against a nationwide abortion ban, calling it unconstitutional for Congress to regulate abortion.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legislator on Friday proposed extending the March deadline to close the state’s troubled youth detention center amid concerns that the current timeline would endanger public safety. Debate over the future of the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester began years ago but has come to a boil amid horrific sexual abuse allegations. Frustrated with spending $13 million a year to operate a 144-bed facility for about a dozen teens, lawmakers set a mandatory March 1 closing date. But the center’s fate remains unclear after lawmakers were unable to agree this year on how to replace it. Rep. Jess Edwards, R-Auburn, said Friday that he plans to introduce two bills for the legislative session that starts in January: one to extend the deadline by three months and another calling for a new 12- to 14-bed facility, with room for 18 if necessary. He told Deputy Health Commissioner Lori Weaver he is concerned about what will happen March 1 without such measures. “The Legislature let you down,” he said. “We just could not reach agreement, so we gave you nothing to go on in terms of money to plan and design it.” Weaver said she can’t predict the center’s population six months in advance, but based on the current situation, “there would be a definite impact on public safety” if the deadline arrived without further guidance.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Township: In 2020, as saxophonist Steve Barlotta was recovering from a near-fatal bout with COVID-19 that included 24 days on a ventilator, the Jackson resident made a promise to everyone who treated him at CentraState Medical Center. “He was like, ‘I’m going to play a concert out in the parking lot for everyone,” said Shannon Lenahan, a neurologic clinical specialist who helped Barlotta bounce back from near-total paralysis. “We were like, ‘OK,’ People say stuff like that all the time, and they go home and get sidetracked.” Barlotta did not get sidetracked. On Wednesday, he and his band Sensational Soul Cruisers performed a 90-minute concert on the hospital’s campus as a thank-you to the doctors, nurses and rehab therapists who saved his life and restored his health. “To see it actually happen and come to fruition was really special,” Lenahan said. “He didn’t forget. He was a little emotional, and it was a little emotional for us to be able to say, ‘This is why we did it.’ ” Barlotta, who has played alongside Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Gary U.S. Bonds and the Monkees, capped the show with two numbers that came straight from the heart: “You’re All I Need to Get By” and “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” both made famous by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s green chile season is in full swing as the aroma of fresh roasted peppers permeates the air, but growers and exporters in Mexico are just as busy, and that’s causing a crunch at the international border. Authorities said last Monday that agricultural inspectors with U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been processing dozens of chile imports daily at the port of entry in Columbus, New Mexico. They’re looking for any pests in the shipments that could affect domestic production in the state where green chile is a signature crop and a cultural icon. “Chile is a huge crop for farmers in New Mexico, so it is important that CBP agriculture specialists identify and stop any dangerous pests from making it into the state and potentially spreading,” acting Columbus Port Director Sam Jimenez said in a statement. As part of “Operation Hot Chile,” Jimenez said agricultural inspectors are being assigned to Columbus from other locations to help with the increased traffic. The inspectors will process around 100 chile shipments a day during the busiest part of the season. Imports have grown significantly each season, with inspectors seeing a nearly 25% jump since 2016. Officials are expecting continued growth this year. Despite more imports, New Mexico farmers are seeing higher yields from their crops, and the state’s reputation for growing what many have anointed as “the best green chile in the world” is expanding, said Travis Day, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Yeshiva University has abruptly suspended student club activity in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last week that ordered the school to recognize – for now – an LGBTQ student group. In an email to students, university officials said Friday that the school would “hold off on all undergraduate club activities while it immediately takes steps to follow the roadmap provided by the U.S. Supreme Court to protect YU’s religious freedom.” On Wednesday, the high court cleared the way for the LGBTQ group, YU Pride Alliance, to gain official recognition from the Jewish university in New York. The undergraduate group describes itself as “a supportive space for all students, of all sexual orientations and gender identities, to feel respected, visible, and represented.” By a 5-4 vote Wednesday, the justices lifted a temporary hold on a court order that requires Yeshiva University to recognize the group, even as a legal fight continues in New York courts. Two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, sided with the court’s three liberal justices to form a majority. The disagreement among the justices appears to be mostly about procedure, and the case is being closely watched by other faith-based institutions.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s hospitals and hospital systems on Friday unveiled an offer that could shake up stalled negotiations to pass legislation that would expand Medicaid to cover hundreds of thousands of low-income adults. The North Carolina Healthcare Association said the offer sent to Republican legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper also contained reforms to some state laws that require regulatory approval before certain medical buildings can be constructed or services offered in a region. Senate leader Phil Berger this summer accused the association of refusing to compromise on “certificate of need” rules. Changes to these rules were contained in the Senate version of an expansion measure approved in June. Berger said they were needed to increase the supply of medical services that would be needed to treat the growing Medicaid population. Cooper, a big expansion proponent, told reporters last week that it would make sense for hospitals to negotiate with Berger on those rules, which hospitals contend help community facilities that disproportionately serve the uninsured or underinsured remain open. “Our board of trustees has made the difficult decision to propose certificate of need law reforms,” board chair Dr. Roxie Wells said in a news release.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state would spend up to $80 million over the next two years to address child care under a proposal pitched Tuesday by Gov. Doug Burgum. The GOP-led Legislature meets again in January and will consider the plan that also includes a child care tax credit for low- to middle-income families, expansion of child care assistance, and matching money for businesses that offer their employees child care. The second-term Republican governor said the lack of available and affordable child care for families contributes to workforce shortages that have hamstrung the state’s economy. Adequate and affordable child care helps attract and retain companies in the state, he said. North Dakota has “tens of thousands” of unfilled jobs, and many families “have to make a choice to work and pay for child care or not work at all,” Burgum said. North Dakota has more than 64,000 children under the age of 5 in some 45,000 households across the state, Burgum said. The state’s more than 800 licensed child care providers employ more than 6,000 people, he said. “In spite of that … working families are experiencing a child care crisis,” Burgum said. “There are more children than there are slots.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s efforts to curb gerrymandering are not working, and voters must once again amend the Ohio Constitution to take politics completely out of the process, the retiring chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Thursday. The current redistricting commission, created by constitutional amendment in 2015, has had no discernible effect on gerrymandering, and as a result voters this fall will elect candidates based on unconstitutional legislative districts, Republican Maureen O’Connor said in her annual and final state of the judiciary speech. A new amendment must create a commission that restricts partisan politics by prohibiting elected officials from serving, O’Connor said. The current Ohio Redistricting Commission consists of elected lawmakers and state officeholders, including the governor, and has a 5-2 Republican majority. Instead, commission members must consist of “sensible people who are not driven by politics but rather by what’s fair,” O’Connor said. “Fair representation and justice.” O’Connor’s remarks echoed the position she took in January when the court first ruled – in a 4-3 decision with O’Connor in the majority – that initial maps drawn by the commission were unconstitutional. The court made similar rulings four more times before a federal court ordered Ohio to use the third set of Statehouse maps approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission, maps the state Supreme Court had also found unconstitutional.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An embattled jail is facing even more criticism after an inmate was able to leave the booking area unsupervised and raped a handcuffed female inmate who was awaiting release, according to charges filed Thursday. The victim “was handcuffed to a bar attached to a wall in the receiving area of the Oklahoma County jail and unable to escape” when Donta Ramone Thomas, 44, was able to remove her pants and rape her July 19, according to charging documents submitted by District Attorney David Prater. Jail surveillance video of the incident showed Thomas ignored orders to stand with his back to the wall and wait for other inmates to be processed after he was booked into jail on assault charges. “Thomas disregarded these instructions and walked away from the area,” according to an affidavit. “He walked down the hallway toward the old medical screening area, where (the victim) was sitting, handcuffed to a bar.” The incident is the latest at the jail, where a nine-member trust took over the jail from the sheriff’s office in 2020, tasked with managing its operation and finances. Oklahoma County’s Board of Commissioners unanimously approved of the trust the previous year. “This is another example of the jail trust failing to protect those who they are responsible to care for,” Prater said.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A 23-acre property near Willamette Falls has a new name, based on its old name. Formerly known as the Blue Heron Paper Mill, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde has renamed the site Tumwata Village in recognition of the native name for the falls, tumwata, and the ancestors who called the site home. “As a name, Tumwata Village represents the Grand Ronde tribe’s connection to the falls, as well as the sacred lands and practices of our ancestors,” said Cheryle A. Kennedy, chairwoman of the Grand Ronde tribe and descendant of the Clackamas people. The Grand Ronde tribe’s connection to the falls goes back to creation, Kennedy said. Pre-European contact, the land was home to her ancestors, including the village of the Clowewalla– the Willamette band of Tumwaters. It was also the Kosh-Huk-shix Village of Clackamas people. They lived and used the area to hunt and fish before the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 led to the forcible removal of the tribal populations from the falls area to the Grand Ronde reservation. Even after removal, people still went back to fish and gather at the falls. “The connection has remained,” Kennedy said. The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde began the process of acquiring the land around the falls at least two decades ago, Kennedy said. The purchase was finalized in 2019.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More than 1.7 million public and private school students in the state will be able to get breakfast for free under a plan that will begin next month and run through the school year, officials announced. The $21.5 million plan will be paid for with money from the previous year’s School Food Services General Fund appropriation. Schools that participate in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs will receive support from the program. The pandemic-era federal aid that made school meals available for free to all public school students ended this past school year, despite a push in Congress to extend it. In Pennsylvania, officials say breakfast consumption under the free meals program increased by 16%, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Nationwide, other states have adopted legislation to provide free meals regardless of income level.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Short-term rentals such as those offered through websites like Airbnb and VRBO could be severely restricted as town officials contemplate an ordinance to limit them to owner-occupied units in just a few zoning districts. The Warwick Planning Board, in front of a nearly empty meeting room Wednesday night, voted to ask the planning staff who helped draft the ordinance to make a recommendation to the City Council, with instructions to ensure that rules around accessory dwelling units conform to a new state law. Planner Tom Kravitz said he was directed to get an opinion on the ordinance from the board. However, aside from asking Kravitz to issue a recommendation and worries about the state law change to accessory dwelling units, the Planning Board members did not discuss the regulation. Kravitz said the owner-occupied regulation should reduce the chances for complaints around parking and noise, citing the example of Newport, which now requires owners to occupy the units they are renting. Making the owner live in or adjacent to the property being rented provides oversight over guests, he said. The proposed zoning change cites short-term rentals as a source of “noise, congestion, pollution and disorderly behavior” and of generally disturbing the peace.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Lawsuits filed to stop the removal of memorials to Confederate leaders and a pro-slavery congressman have been dropped. The Post and Courier reports that the American Heritage Association helped fund one of the lawsuits. It had been filed by descendants of John C. Calhoun, a former congressman and vice president who died before the Civil War, opposing the city of Charleston’s removal of Calhoun’s statue. The association also had filed a lawsuit opposing the removal of a Robert E. Lee Memorial Highway marker from the campus of a charter school in Charleston and the renaming of an auditorium that had been named after Christopher Memminger, a treasury secretary of the Confederacy. The stone-and-metal monument to Lee was removed in July 2021 and placed in storage. The city made a deal with the South Carolina State Museum to take the statue of Calhoun. Both suits had been filed in state court. The highway marker and auditorium lawsuit was dropped Sept. 13. The Calhoun lawsuit was dropped Sept. 15, the newspaper reports. AHA President Brett Barry declined to comment on the status of the Calhoun case, despite the descendants’ request for dismissal. “Charleston monuments are an integral part of the city’s historical and artistic American landscape,” Barry told The Post and Courier.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s corn harvest may not have much juice this year. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service’s latest crop production report, the state’s crop yield is estimated at 138 bushels per acre – a number nowhere near the record-breaking harvest of 2020, when farmers gathered a staggering 162 bushels per acre. In the northeastern counties, springtime floods and incessant rainfall oversaturated the region with moisture. The precipitation flooded some fields, preventing producers from being able to plant their seeds during a critical planting window. “Things did turn drier up in the northeast corner over the last two weeks, but, really, the question is whether that corn actually got planted,” said DaNita Murray, executive director of South Dakota Corn Growers Association. John Horter is one producer who received a mixed bag from the wet spring. On his farm in western Day County, he called the rains “timely” and the weather conditions “almost perfect.” The past two weeks of heat, he said, are drying out his fields just in time for the harvest. But there’s a lot of lost potential: The corn in his fields looks good, he said, but the rains flooded what’s traditionally his highest yielding areas of the farm, which kept him from being able to plant those acres.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The police officers who fatally shot a man walking on an interstate will not face criminal charges, a district attorney announced Friday. A lawsuit filed last week by the widow of Landon Eastep alleges that law enforcement used excessive force and should be liable for his death in Nashville. Chelesy Eastep argued it was unfair to expect her husband to act reasonably with multiple guns pointed at him. However, Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk said in a statement that after reviewing the case, Eastep’s actions “were designed to cause officers to perceive an immediate threat.” Eastep’s encounter with police began with a state trooper checking on him as he sat on a guardrail along Interstate 65 the afternoon of Jan. 27. After a brief interaction, Eastep pulled a box cutter, and the trooper called for backup, police said. Many other officers arrived, blocking traffic along the normally bustling travel corridor in both directions as a helicopter circle overhead. Authorities pleaded with Eastep, 37, to surrender while they kept their guns drawn. “During this encounter with law enforcement officers, Mr. Eastep became emotional, began sobbing, and reportedly started cutting his wrists a few times with a box cutter from his pocket,” Chelesy Eastep’s lawsuit says.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge on Friday expanded her order blocking the state from investigating families of transgender youth who have received gender-affirming medical care. Judge Amy Clark Meachum issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from investigating members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over the medical care. The group has more than 600 members in Texas. Meachum in July issued an order blocking the investigations against two families of transgender children who had sued the state. Meachum’s order Friday also blocked the state from investigating the family of another teen who had sued, though the family said after the lawsuit was filed that they learned the investigation against them had been dropped. Meachum wrote that without the order, the families would “suffer probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim.” The ruling was the latest against the state’s efforts to label gender-affirming care as child abuse. The Texas Supreme Court in May allowed the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse while also ruling in favor of one family who was among the first contacted by child welfare officials following the order by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Gov. Spencer Cox took to Twitter on Saturday night to call out the behavior of University of Oregon fans during a game against Brigham Young University. UO’s student section, The Pit Crew, has since issued a public apology, as have university officials. In a video posted to Twitter, Oregon fans in the school’s student section can be seen chanting “(expletive) the Mormons.” BYU is a private university sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Cox retweeted the video, calling it “religious bigotry alive and celebrated in Oregon.” Other videos and photos of attendees who also allegedly participated in the chanting were posted on Twitter. The Pit Crew on Twitter issued an apology Saturday night, saying its members “do not condone or support any hateful speech directed towards one’s religion and are ashamed of those who participated.” In contrast, BYU kicked off the game by honoring former Oregon tight end Spencer Webb before the game, running onto the field with a flag bearing Webb’s No. 18. Webb, who would’ve been a junior this season, died in July during an outing at Triangle Lake.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Labor is getting involved after finding some businesses in the state have failed to protect teenage workers. There has been a national trend of increased child-labor law violations, which had been steadily decreasing until 2015, when the numbers began to tick up again. The Department of Labor’s Northern New England office said it “has taken strong enforcement actions” including conducting investigations and engaging in outreach in order to decrease federal labor violations at businesses across the region. A news release from the labor department cited examples of violations in the food service industry this year at McDonald’s and Dunkin’ franchises. At nine New England McDonald’s locations run by Coughlin Inc., 142 workers ages 14 and 15 worked more hours than federal law permits. And an investigation found 18 workers ages 14 and 15 illegally operated an oven or a fryer without a device to automatically raise and lower the basket. Two minors were burned, and the company paid $109,125 in penalties. Vermont Donut Enterprises LLC and related companies running 12 Dunkin’ franchise locations were also cited for not adhering to restrictions on 14- and 15-year-old workers. There were 44 violations involving hours worked and 17 violations for operating high-speed ovens. A 16-year-old was illegally allowed to drive a vehicle between two locations. Six minors received burns, and the company was fined $15,737 in civil penalties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has rewritten the state’s model policies for the treatment of transgender students, issuing guidance for school divisions that would roll back some accommodations and tighten parental notification requirements. The new model policies from the Virginia Department of Education, which were posted online Friday, say students’ participation in certain school programming and use of school facilities like bathrooms or locker rooms should be based on their biological sex, with modifications offered only to the extent required under federal law. The policies also say that students who are minors must be referred to by the name and pronouns in their official records, unless a parent approves the use of something else. Regarding parental notification, the guidelines say school divisions may not encourage teachers to conceal information about a student’s gender from his or her parents. And they say parents must be given an opportunity to object before counseling services pertaining to gender are offered. The guidance is subject to a 30-day public comment period that opens later this month. Then, in accordance with a 2020 state law, local school boards must adopt policies that are “consistent with” the department’s but may be “more comprehensive,” the document says.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: After 21/ 2 years of inspection and repair work, authorities have reopened the West Seattle Bridge, the main route between the peninsula of West Seattle and the rest of the city. The Seattle Department of Transportation announced that the bridge had reopened Saturday night, even as crews continued removing some barricades and detour signs. Officials closed the span in March 2020 after cracks were found to be growing rapidly. The repair work included 60 miles of steel cables that form the new backbone of the bridge. Each of the cables was anchored into new specialized concrete blocks woven into the structure. The department said crews also installed a network of reinforced carbon fiber sheets wrapped inside and outside the bridge walls and injected 240 gallons of epoxy into cracked concrete. Authorities say the bridge is now much stronger and more resilient to seasonal temperature changes and will last for decades to come. Engineers will continue to monitor the bridge using cameras, sensors and inspections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Friday signed into law a ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, making West Virginia the second state to enact a law prohibiting the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court’s June ruling overturning its constitutional protection. The bill will go into effect immediately, except for the criminal penalties, which will go into effect in 90 days, Justice said. He described the legislation on Twitter as “a bill that protects life.” “I said from the beginning that if WV legislators brought me a bill that protected life and included reasonable and logical exceptions I would sign it, and that’s what I did today,” he said. The ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest victims until eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for those under the age of 18. Victims must report their assault to law enforcement 48 hours before the procedure. Minors can report to the police or a doctor, who then must tell police. The bill requires abortions to be performed by a physician at a hospital – a provision that at least two Republican lawmakers have said was intended to shut down abortions at the Women’s Health Center, which has provided the procedure since 1976 and was the state’s sole abortion clinic. Providers who perform illegal abortions can face up to 10 years in prison.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A local alderman whose name appears on the membership rolls of a far-right extremist group has resigned, citing safety concerns for his family. Madison Alderman Gary Halverson was among hundreds of elected officials, military members and law enforcement officers who were on a leaked list of Oath Keepers members, the group that’s accused of playing a key role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Halverson said his resignation follows some vandalism at his house, which he said has triggered symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder for his wife. “For anyone who has PTSD, or lived with someone who does, knows that when something happens that is triggering, it is absolutely terrifying, and that terror can last for days or weeks or longer,” Halverson said in a statement. He did not specify what damage was done to his property or how it might be linked to his Oath Keepers membership. Halverson was elected in April 2021 and had one year left in his term. He said he joined the Oath Keepers in mid-2020 without vetting the organization. “I thought I joined an organization that welcomed veterans who cared about our democracy,” Halverson said earlier this month. “I was misled and I terminated the membership two months later in Aug 2020.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State transportation officials have asked the Biden administration to ease proposed federal requirements to receive funding toward a network of electric vehicle chargers. EVs account for 0.1% of vehicle registrations in Wyoming, and state Department of Transportation Director Luke Reiner told federal officials that it would be “irresponsible and illogical” to spend now on requirements that include four charging ports at stations every 50 miles. It will be more than 20 years before there’s enough EV adoption in the state to worry about lines at a four-port station, Reiner said. So instead of concentrating solely on major highway corridors, Reiner said, the federal money should also be used in areas away from interstates that attract lots of tourists, such as Yellowstone National Park. “Most of our EVs will be tourist traffic,” Reiner said Wednesday. “The idea is if you’re a nice lady from Iowa with an electric car, and you want to get to Yellowstone, we want to get you there. ... We want to make sure these stations are in populated areas so there’s more chance of success.” Wyoming asked for exceptions from the mileage requirement for 11 stretches of highway. Federal officials have not yet responded, Reiner said, and the state’s plan is still pending.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/15/surfboard-proposal-duke-dorm-opossum-sky-bars-back-news-around-states/40617883/", "title": "Surfboard proposal, Duke dorm opossum: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nGadsden: Hundreds of fish have been added to a creek as part of an ongoing effort to boost tourism. The Gadsden Times reports Black Creek was restocked Tuesday with about 1,100 pounds of trout above Noccalula Falls by the Rainbow Fly Fishing Club. The group also stocked 1,000 coppernose bluegill into the watershed in late March. Republican Rep. Craig Lipscomb, of Rainbow City, is a member of the fishing club and says its members are working with the city to fill a gap for activities at the falls in the winter months. Lipscomb says trout fishing in Georgia brings in tens of millions of dollars for the state, and Gadsden would benefit even from a fraction of that.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A new FBI report says the state has the nation’s highest rate of sexual assault, and violent crime has increased. Alaska Public Media reports that the 2018 statistical analysis from the agency’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program says Alaska does not conform to a general national decline in violent crime. The annual report uses statistics from law enforcement agencies to provide an analysis of crime at the national, state and municipal levels. The report says violent crime in Alaska increased by 3% from 2017 to 2018 while falling 3% nationally. It says Alaska saw an 11% increase in the number of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement, while nationally there were 2.7% more assaults. The FBI says Alaskans reported four times more sexual assaults than the national rate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An increase of bald eagle breeding areas this year didn’t result in more nestlings in the state. Game and Fish Department officials say there were 71 eagle nestlings during the 2019 breeding season, down from 87 hatched last year. During the department’s annual bald eagle survey, raptor biologists counted a minimum of 74 occupied breeding areas statewide – up from the 69 counted last year. But the number of eggs laid dipped from 102 last year to 97 this year. The number of birds that made their first flight fell to 63 from the 70 recorded in 2018. Arizona’s bald eagle population has flourished since 1978, when 11 pairs were counted within the state and the species was listed as endangered. There currently are an estimated 74 adult breeding pairs.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Court records show a former lobbyist who pleaded guilty to bribing three former state lawmakers will be sentenced this month. Rusty Cranford could face up to 10 years in federal prison for bribing Sen. Jon Woods, Rep. Hank Wilkins and Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, the nephew of Gov. Asa Hutchinson and son of former U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchinson. Cranford had hoped to increase revenue for the Missouri-based nonprofit Preferred Family HealthCare. Cranford also confessed to embezzling from the nonprofit where he worked. His attorney declined to comment. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports court records posted Tuesday show he’ll be sentenced Nov. 25. A federal grand jury in Missouri indicted Cranford on one count of conspiracy and eight counts of accepting bribes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Rosa: A Northern California brewery owner upset with devastating fires sparked by Pacific Gas & Electric power lines is producing a beer he named “F--- PG&E,” and the brew has sparked a backlash. Steve Doty, owner of Shady Oak brewery in Santa Rosa, announced the new beer last week on a Facebook post. Doty tells SFGate he meant to draw attention to the negligence of PG&E executives and was stunned by the onslaught of critical comments by people who said they are related to utility employees. Others have attacked Shady Oak by giving it one-star reviews on Yelp and Google or calling the taproom with violent threats. Doty posted an apology to those upset by the beer name but says he is still standing by the name.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Muslim civil rights group is protesting after an arena security guard told a woman to remove her hijab before she could enter to see her 8-year-old daughter sing the national anthem with her school choir at a Denver Nuggets basketball game. Gazella Bensreiti said Wednesday that the guard told her to “take that thing off of my head” at the Pepsi Center box office Nov. 5. Bensreiti said she explained the scarf was for religious purposes. She said the guard replied that she didn’t care. After speaking with a supervisor, the guard ushered her inside. The Council on American-Islamic Relations protested the incident. Arena owner Kroenke Sports & Entertainment called the encounter a misunderstanding and said the guard didn’t recognize that Bensreiti was wearing a hijab.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Republicans in the state Senate are unveiling an alternative transportation plan they say doesn’t rely on tolls or tax increases. Thursday’s plan from the minority party in Connecticut’s Senate comes a day after Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont pitched his 10-year, $21.3 billion initiative to Senate Democrats. While the Democrats liked projects in Lamont’s proposal, they didn’t like how it includes 14 tolls on bridges across the state. It’s unclear whether the GOP’s plan will ultimately lay the groundwork for a compromise on an issue that has vexed the state for years. Like Lamont’s plan, the 10-year, nearly $18 billion Senate Republican plan also relies on low-cost borrowing from the federal government. Instead of using toll money to pay off the loans, it banks on money from the state’s dedicated transportation fund.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s birding community is mourning the loss of Wilmington resident William “Bill” Stewart Jr., who died Tuesday after battling cancer, while celebrating his legacy of conservation and determination. Stewart, 67, was a well-known birder, conservationist, educator and former gymnastics coach who helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to permanently preserve nearly 2,000 acres of land for future generations of birders and Delawareans through the Delaware Bird-A-Thon program he started in 2006. He helped put the First State on the birding map by showing visitors and locals the state’s beauty and international role in shorebird migrations. The Bird-A-Thon effort has raised more than $400,000, which has helped protect properties and start a hawk watch program in northern Delaware, as well as a science education grant for researchers. A celebration of life for Stewart will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. Friday at the Delaware Nature Society’s Ashland Nature Center in Hockessin.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A landlord in the district is being forced to pay $1.1 million in rent payments to former residents who homes were plagued by pests, mold and raw sewage and violated housing and fire codes. The Washington Post reports D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine announced Wednesday that Sanford Capital LLC will pay the settlement to 155 former residents “forced to live in squalor.” Racine’s office had sued the Bethesda, Maryland-based company for violating consumer protection laws. For years, tenants struggled with unsanitary and poor conditions that left many without heat in winter months. Prosecutors said some residents also lacked working toilets, stoves or refrigerators. They say Sanford refused to fix some broken locks and didn’t maintain fire extinguishers, a move made even more dangerous by missing or broken smoke detectors.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: It’s light and bright in all the merriest of ways at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom this holiday season. For the first time since the park opened in 1998, there’ll be holiday-themed entertainment and decor throughout the 500-acre park, with twinklers lining rooftops and other new seasonal touches at the park, now Central Florida’s second most popular theme park, behind Magic Kingdom. At DinoLand, Donald’s Dino-Bash, the dance party is complemented by holiday decorations chosen by Donald Duck’s pals, with all kinds of holiday merch available for sale at the gift shop. Diwali, India’s festival of lights, is celebrated over in Asia, while in Africa, African celebrations blend with Western traditions, making a stroll through Harame for food and shopping a colorful mix of tastes and treats.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A nonpartisan organization has placed a national debt clock downtown ahead of a Democratic presidential debate coming to the city. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports New York-based Peter G. Peterson Foundation placed the billboard on Ted Turner Drive between Walton and Marietta streets, near Centennial Olympic Park. The clock displays the nation’s nearly $23 trillion debt and pegs each American’s share of the number at about $68,000. CEO Michael A. Peterson says the debt issue affects everyone, not just lawmakers. He says he hopes the billboard sparks conversation on the enormous debt and ways to manage it. The foundation says the clock will remain in the city indefinitely. The Democratic debate will be Wednesday at Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man was surfing with his girlfriend when – instead of hanging 10 – he knelt down on one knee on his board and proposed. Hawaii News Now reports Lauren Oiye said yes just before Chris Garth dropped the ring in the ocean. Multiple photographers nearby captured the Sunday moment. Luckily, he had a spare. Garth said he knew it could go wrong, so he used a stand-in while they were out in the water. The real ring was on shore at Queen’s Beach in Waikiki, where the two met years before.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: Brigham Young University-Idaho has stopped accepting Medicaid as health insurance coverage, forcing full-time students to buy a university-backed plan. University officials say health plans could be purchased for at least $81 a month for single students and up to $678 a month for a family. Officials say a student form used to opt out of the school health plan was updated this month reflecting the change in policy. Open enrollment for Medicaid expansion began Nov. 1. State health officials say Madison County has the highest concentration of potential Medicaid expansion enrollees in the state. Students say a reason for the change has not been disclosed. Some students argue the plan is expensive and has limited coverage. The university declined multiple requests for comment.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A copy of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address that was handwritten by the 16th president himself is going on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum for two weeks. In a news release, the museum says it will display the copy – one of only five surviving copies written by Lincoln – from Thursday through Dec. 2. The display coincides with the anniversary of Lincoln’s delivery of the brief speech Nov. 19, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. The document that stays in a climate-controlled space most of the time to protect it from light and humidity will be housed in the museum’s Treasures Gallery. The address that begins famously with the words: “Four score and seven years ago … ” is handwritten on plain white paper.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb isn’t promising any quick action on the call for further boosting teacher pay that thousands of educators will be making at the Statehouse next week. Teacher unions say at least 107 school districts with more than 40% of Indiana’s students will be closed Tuesday while their teachers attend the rally. Holcomb didn’t criticize school districts for closing the day of the union-organized rally, saying it was a local decision. The Republican governor said Thursday that he applauds teachers for expressing their concerns, but he’s waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed to make recommendations by the end of next year. The rally dubbed “Red for Ed Action Day” will happen on the day legislators are gathering for organization meetings ahead of their 2020 session.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Slaughterhouse has a new home downtown. The haunted attraction, which has become a staple in Iowa, has begun moving to the old Bank of America building. To break in the new digs, set to open fully next September, Slaughterhouse will host a Krampus Krawl. The event will begin Dec. 7 with an all-age photo op before the crawl to four Full Court Press establishments. Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as “half-goat, half-demon” in Austro-Bavarian Alpine folklore. During the Christmas season, Krampus punishes children who have misbehaved, as opposed to Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas, who rewards well-behaved children with gifts. Tickets are available online. General admission tickets include a Glow Stein for one free pour at each of the four Full Court Press stops.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has approved a public financing package worth about $35.5 million to subsidize the creation of a medical school. The Wichita Eagle reports the package approved Tuesday will help create a campus for training osteopathic physicians. Called the Kansas Health Science Center, the new school will be built in the former Finney State Office Building. Once the center of state government in Wichita, the building was abandoned in favor of leasing privately owned office space across the city. Plans also call for three other buildings to be transformed – one into student housing, another into a dining hall and culinary center, and the third into a boutique hotel. The bulk of the money for the development will come from tax abatements.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A federal court is allowing a man to personalize a license plate with the phrase “IM GOD” after a three-year legal battle over the custom engraving. Court documents show Ben Hart, a self-identified atheist, set out to get the Kentucky plate in 2016. But Hart’s request was denied by the state transportation department on the basis it violated antidiscrimination guidelines. News outlets report similar plates had been approved before, including “TRYGOD” and “NOGOD.” Kentucky’s American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation got involved to help Hart challenge the decision. In an opinion Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in Frankfort, the judge ruled that “vanity plates” are private speech protected by the First Amendment and that the state had violated Hart’s rights by denying him the plate.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A legislative auditor says 18 cities, towns and villages may be close to reaching bankruptcy or may have the inability to provide basic services to residents in the future based on the municipalities’ most recent financial information. The Monroe News Star reports Legislative Auditor Daryl Purpera compiled a list of “fiscally distressed municipalities” and added it the auditor’s website. The municipalities range from small villages like Epps in northeastern Louisiana to larger towns like Winnsboro in central Louisiana. Purpera says the list is a way to alert the public and officials of the problems so they can be easily addressed. The list includes concerns for each municipality, including incomplete or inaccurate financial information, insufficient utility rates, debt and rural water infrastructure problems.\n\nMaine\n\nHarpswell: The town wants the Navy to protect the clam flats as part of its remediation plan for the former Brunswick Naval Air Station. The Harpswell Conservation Commission has argued the stormwater system that brings water from ponds at the former Navy base to Mare Brook and Harpswell Cove should be extended. The commission told the environmental coordinator for the closure process that the Navy has an obligation to investigate the impact of the stormwater system. The Times Record reports that an investigation of the pond system had found several heavy metals including lead, arsenic and cadmium that could potentially reach nearby clam flats. Paul Plummer, Harpswell’s harbormaster, says the Harpswell side of the Harpswell Cove alone holds $100,000 worth of shellfish.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has reached 300 homicides in a year for the fifth year in a row. Detective Donny Moses told WBAL-AM the total reached 300 Thursday morning with the shooting deaths of a man and a woman. The Baltimore Sun reports the city is on track to see one of its most violent years on record. The city recorded 309 homicides last year and 342 the year before. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young addressed the homicide rate at a news conference Wednesday. He said the city is working to reduce the crime rate, and leaders aren’t to blame. Young took over as mayor this spring after Democrat Catherine Pugh resigned amid investigations into her business dealings. He’s running for reelection in 2020 against a dozen challengers, some of whom criticized his comments Wednesday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSudbury: The Sky Bar, the multiflavored chocolate bar divided into four sections, is back on the market after a yearlong hiatus. The Boston Globe reports that production of the confection has resumed at a suburban gourmet shop less than a year after the owner bought rights to the brand in an online auction. The Sky Bar made its debut in 1938 but was discontinued last year when the New England Confectionery Co., also known as Necco, went out of business. Louise Mawhinney, owner of Duck Soup in Sudbury, bought the rights to the Sky Bar in January. The candy bar, divided into caramel, vanilla, peanut and fudge sections, is available in the store and online for $1.98. After the holidays, Mawhinney plans to get a wholesale license and ramp up operations.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: A museum at a former southern Michigan prison is closing at the end of December. Cell Block 7 in Jackson allows visitors to step into the cells and walk the corridors of what was once the largest walled institution in the world. The museum’s website invites people to “spend some time on the inside” during a self-guided tour. The museum opened five years ago under an agreement between the state of Michigan and the Ella Sharp Museum, also in Jackson. Ella Sharp director Diane Gutenkauf says the costs are too high. Gutenkauf says some artifacts from the prison museum will be available at the Sharp museum, including oral histories of people who worked there or were inmates. The last day at the prison museum will be Dec. 29.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The battle over the name of a popular Minneapolis lake has landed before the Minnesota Supreme Court. Justices heard arguments Wednesday on whether the state Department of Natural Resources has the authority to change the name of Lake Calhoun to its original Dakota name, Bde Maka Ska. The state Court of Appeals ruled in April that the agency overstepped its authority in January 2018 when it changed the name. It said authority to change the name rested with the Legislature under statutes governing lake and other place names. KARE-TV reports Save Lake Calhoun attorney Erick Kaardal argued the legislature enacted a policy that says lake names that have been used more than 40 years cannot be changed without lawmakers granting additional authority. It could take the court months to make a decision.\n\nMississippi\n\nRolling Fork: The state is naming a stretch of land in the south Delta in honor of the two-term governor who is leaving office in January. Officials gathered Wednesday to dedicate the Phil Bryant Wildlife Management Area. The 18,000-acre site in Warren and Issaquena counties is made up of bayous, cypress sloughs and bottomland hardwoods. Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks Director Sam Polles says the area is divided into four tracts that will offer different types of hunting, including group hunts in a primitive setting. The department worked with the Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to buy the land in 2018 from Anderson-Tully Company. Republican Bryant said during the dedication ceremony that he looks forward to bringing his grandchildren hunting on the land.\n\nMissouri\n\nJackson: A rescued puppy is attracting a lot of attention because of his resemblance to a unicorn. The nearly 10-week-old puppy, named Narwhal, has a tail-like appendage growing from his forehead. Narwhal was rescued over the weekend and sent to Mac’s Mission in Jackson, which specializes in fostering animals with special needs. Mac’s Mission founder Rochelle Steffen says Narwhal doesn’t notice the extra tail and is otherwise a happy, healthy puppy. Although it looks like a tail, Narwhal cannot wag it. Steffen says the rescue group has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt Narwhal since his picture hit social media. But he’ll remain at Mac’s Mission so his caretakers can be sure the tail doesn’t grow out of proportion to his face and cause him problems.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: A fish hatchery will be locked at night and begin using security cameras after vandals mutilated several fish. The Montana Standard reports the perpetrators killed about 20 rainbow trout, broke windows and tossed items into water channels at the Ennis National Fish Hatchery. The Madison County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the Oct. 27 vandalism at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service facility about 88 miles southeast of Butte. Sheriff Phil Fortner says a witness saw a yellow ATV near the hatchery, but no suspects have been identified. Hatchery Manager Ron Hopper says the fish were cut with garden hoes, ice choppers or other tools. Hopper says that for the previous 80 years, the hatchery was left unlocked for after-hours visitors.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state Transportation Department is offering to produce and emplace roadside memorials as a way to keep highways free of roadside safety hazards. The new departmental policy announced Wednesday says each sign will display the name of the person being memorialized and include one of five safety messages: “Please Drive Safely,” “Seat Belts Save Lives,” “Don’t Drink and Drive,” “Don’t Text and Drive” or “Don’t Drive Impaired.” The sign will be placed as near to the accident site as possible. Family members who have placed private memorials alongside state highways are encouraged to contact their local department offices to discuss disposition of the memorials and get information on the state installing new signs. The department’s Jeni Campana says the state-produced signs would be of a familiar design and would pose less of a safety hazard than the irregular appearance of private memorials.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Elon Musk’s Boring Co. will begin drilling an underground tunnel Friday for the Las Vegas Convention Center’s forthcoming people mover. To officially kick off the tunneling phase of the company’s first commercial project, the boring machine will be turned on 40 feet below ground. The $52.5 million underground people mover will allow convention attendees to travel the expanse of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s 200-acre campus in approximately one minute, according to officials. The transportation system will include three passenger stations that connect the convention center’s 3.2 million-square-foot space with the 1.4 million-square-foot West hall that is now under construction. Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority officials say plans call for the expansion project to be completed by January 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: After facing criticism over its prior annual holiday celebrations, the town is making some tweaks, planning a “Frost Fest” without a tree-lighting ceremony or grand entrance from Santa. WMUR-TV reports in past years Durham’s held a tree-lighting ceremony. But after some concerns that the event was too focused on Christmas, a working group was formed to make changes, such as not hanging wreaths on light posts. The Frost Fest is billed as a “winter celebration” with a bonfire, cookie decorating, ice sculpting, crafts and activities. Last year, town officials were under fire for denying a menorah to be displayed next to the tree decorated annually at a local park. The officials cited vandalism concerns.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The state has drumsticked up a plan to deal with flocks of wild turkeys that are ruffling some feathers in a Jersey Shore neighborhood. And it doesn’t involve them winding up on dinner plates in two weeks. The state Department of Environmental Protection will trap scores of turkeys that have descended on a retirement community in Toms River and relocate them. The move comes as some residents say large flocks of turkeys have invaded the area, pecking at cars – and at some people who venture too close. Others say they give the birds a wide berth and haven’t experienced any problems. Toms River residents who have run a-fowl of the birds include former New York Yankees and Mets baseball player Todd Frazier, whose SUV was covered by turkeys recently.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal and state officials have reached an agreement they say will strengthen their relationship as they work to improve forest conditions in the state. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen signed the so-called shared stewardship agreement during a gathering Thursday in Santa Fe. The agreement has been a work in progress over years and will address issues such as wildfires, drought and invasive species. Officials say the challenges faced by land managers transcend boundaries and affect people beyond the jurisdiction of any single organization, so they have to find new ways of working together and doing business at a greater pace and scale. Under the agreement, the state and national forests plan to evaluate opportunities, threats and alternatives for risk management.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Until recently, New York City police secretly kept fingerprints of children arrested as juveniles on file permanently in a department database. It’s an illegal practice that raised alarms about the lengths the nation’s largest police force has taken to keep tabs on the city’s youth. The Legal Aid Society uncovered the years­long practice. The public defender organization pressured the police department to acknowledge it and threatened legal action to make it stop, citing a state law barring local police from stockpiling juveniles’ fingerprints. Now, after years of wrangling and resistance, the NYPD said Wednesday that it has purged all juvenile fingerprints records from the database and will no longer keep them indefinitely. The Legal Aid Society said the database contained the fingerprints of tens of thousands of New York City youths.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: An opossum has illegally taken up residence in the ceiling of a Duke University dorm, where students have been complaining about being bitten by fleas. The school’s assistant vice president of student affairs, Joe Gonzalez, told reporters Wednesday that the school has yet to catch the elusive opossum about which students first complained in October. He says the creature has escaped custody partly because it appears to be splitting its time between the Few Quad dorm and somewhere else. Reports of fleas also began to surface last month, prompting the school to put students up in another dorm while they fumigated the place. Gonzalez says the opossum may have brought the fleas, but that’s unconfirmed. Irritated students are questioning why they’re dealing with such conditions at a $78,608-per-year school.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials have given an estimate on how much oil was spilled from a pipeline leak in Williams County last month. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality says an estimated 12,432 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline operated by Hiland Crude about a mile northeast of McGregor on Oct. 17. The department says the oil leaked onto cropland. Department staff have inspected the site and say they will continue to monitor remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A traveling exhibit celebrating the service and heroism of military working dogs and the sacrifices they make during battle is being displayed at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The exhibit titled “Canine Warriors – Courage and Sacrifice, Always Beside You” features wooden sculptures of eight Wounded Warrior Dogs and four Canine War Dogs and is now on display at the museum in Dayton. Ohio craftsman James Mellick designed the exhibit to be symbolic of the wounds suffered by military dogs in battle and to raise awareness of their needs. The exhibit also features art depicting working military dogs from the Air Force Art Program. It will remain at the museum through Jan. 31.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: District attorneys are raising concerns about a proposed new ballot measure aimed at further reducing the state’s prison population. In a statement late Tuesday, Oklahoma District Attorneys Association President Jason Hicks says one problem is that crimes like child trafficking, aggravated assault and battery, and domestic abuse aren’t technically violent crimes under state law. The proposed state question filed Tuesday would prohibit prosecutors from using previous nonviolent felony convictions to enhance prison sentences. Hicks says state prosecutors are still examining the proposal, but there are already elements that would be “detrimental, if not catastrophic, for public safety.” District Attorney Angela Marsee says ignoring past convictions of repeat offenders is “detrimental to our mission.”\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Traditional Christmas feasts featuring Dungeness crab may not be in the cards this year, as officials have delayed the commercial crabbing season due to the small size of the crustaceans. The Mail Tribune reports the season had been set to start Dec. 1 for Oregon’s most lucrative commercial fishery, but now crabbing has been postponed until at least Dec. 16. It’s the sixth straight year the season has been delayed to allow the crabs a chance to fatten up to meet industry standards. Dungeness crabs off the coasts of Washington and California also have low meat levels in their shells, prompting similar delays in those states. Tests planned for late November or early December will determine whether commercial crabbers can start plying the Pacific beginning Dec. 16.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The FBI has begun a corruption investigation into how Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration came to issue permits for construction on a multibillion-dollar pipeline project to carry highly volatile natural gas liquids across the state. FBI agents have interviewed current or former state employees in recent weeks about the Mariner East project and the construction permits, according to three people who have direct knowledge of the agents’ line of questioning. All three spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus of the agents’ questions involves the permitting of the pipeline, whether Wolf and his administration forced environmental protection staff to approve construction permits, and whether Wolf or his administration received anything in return, those people say.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal judge has sided with the cities of Providence and Central Falls after they challenged the conditions of U.S. Department of Justice public safety grants they said in a lawsuit would turn local police into federal immigration agents. District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. said in a ruling Thursday that “Congress has not granted the power to impose the conditions the DOJ imposed.” The federal government, among other things, wanted cities receiving public safety grants to notify federal agents when immigrants in the country illegally are about to be released. Attorneys for the cities said in a statement that they are pleased the court “found DOJ’s attempts requiring our police departments to be agents of a federal immigration system to be unlawful.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Bars throughout downtown in this college town are now signed on to the Angel Shot program, offering patrons a way to request help when they don’t feel safe. The simple order – “one Angel Shot, please” – is meant to be a simple solution to combat sexual violence and assault in the university’s entertainment district. An “Angel Shot” is not an actual drink. It is a code word that signals to a bartender or barback that a customer feels unsafe, typically from a potential perpetrator of sexual violence. From there, the bar’s staff will find that customer safe passage out of the bar and home. The Angel Shot program was implemented in every bar downtown this fall semester by Clemson University Student Government, which partnered with Pickens County Advocacy Center, Clemson City Police Department and Clemson’s Healthy Campus for the initiative.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A man sentenced to 90 years in prison for killing his stepfather has petitioned the court in Minnehaha County to change his name because he wants a fresh start. Thirty-five-year-old Daniel Charles was 14 when he was sent to prison in 2000 for first-degree murder in Meade County. He was accused of putting a rifle to his stepfather’s head and pulling the trigger at a ranch near Opal. He told law enforcement at the time that he didn’t know the gun was loaded. Charles’ petition says he wants to change his name to Rameus Tiberius Aryada to start a new life with an adult identity. The South Dakota Department of Corrections lists Charles’ earliest parole eligibility as March 2045.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee State Museum is collecting stories of cultural identity, immigration and migration from the public. The project called Your Story, Our Story uses everyday objects as an entry point for these personal stories. Members of the public can add their own stories and read the stories of others on the Tennessee State Museum’s website. Because the museum is currently showcasing an exhibit on Tennessee food, it is especially encouraging visitors to add images and stories of recipes, cookware, dinnerware and ingredients that carry meaning in their families. Your Story, Our Story is an initiative of the Tenement Museum in New York City and partners across the U.S. that include museums, colleges, schools, libraries and community groups.\n\nTexas\n\nRobstown: With help from Nueces County Public Libraries, county Judge Barbara Canales led local students on a “bear hunt” at Oscar O. Ortiz Park on Wednesday evening. Despite the biting cold, Canales gamely led the students down a path to read from “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt” by Michael Rosen. The county unveiled StoryWalk, a new feature at the park in which pages of picture books are displayed in wooden stands along paths so residents can read while they walk. It’s an effort to promote literacy and physical activity, and the county plans to implement StoryWalk at more parks. Canales and the kids read aloud together as the characters braved tall grass, a deep river, a forest and mud along their search for a bear. Canales called out to the students to stomp in big strides, run and tip-toe like the characters to bring the story to life.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. on Thursday announced his 2020 candidacy for the Republican nomination for the office that he held from 2005 to 2009 before leaving to serve as a U.S. ambassador. Huntsman announced his candidacy in a statement before a scheduled kickoff swing Thursday and Friday to Cedar City and St. George in southern Utah. Incumbent Republican Gov. Gary Herbert is not running for reelection, and Huntsman has said he was considering a run for governor. Huntsman served as U.S. ambassador to China in the Obama administration and as U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Trump administration. Other Republicans in the 2020 race include Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, Utah County businessman Jeff Burningham and Salt Lake County Councilwoman Aimee Winder Newton.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Five groups are sharing more than $1 million to use phosphorus recovery technologies as the state works to reduce algae-causing phosphorus runoff into Lake Champlain and other waterways. It’s part of the Vermont Phosphorus Innovation Challenge announced last year to generate creative solutions to the phosphorus pollution in the state. Officials estimate about 38% of the phosphorus load in the lake comes from agricultural land. Gov. Phil Scott said Thursday that the state received 21 applicants for the funds. The finalists include Agrilab Technologies of Enosburg Falls. The governor’s office says the group will use existing phosphorus recovery technologies, composting and drying equipment to create a series of sites for phosphorus processing in Franklin, Addison, Lamoille and Caledonia counties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A task force has been created to come up with ways to help mitigate and prevent evictions in the city. The group will include affordable housing and social justice advocates, youth and family homelessness specialists, public housing residents and property management professionals. Mayor Levar Stoney said in a news release that the group will work with the city’s Eviction Diversion Program, which began last month to provide rental assistance, free legal help, financial counseling and supportive service referrals to residents who are facing eviction. Stoney said the task force will explore steps the city can take to better understand the root causes of evictions. A research group at Princeton University found that Richmond and four other Virginia cities have some of the highest eviction rates in the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A weeklong hearing will help determine whether a small American Indian tribe from the northwest corner of Washington state can once again hunt whales. The Makah Tribe conducted its last legal hunt in 1999, when its crew harpooned a gray whale from a cedar canoe. A U.S. appeals court later revoked permission for the hunts, saying the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The tribe has been trying to obtain the waiver since 2005, a process that has been repeatedly stalled by scientific reviews. The hearing beginning Thursday will focus on whether the tribe meets the requirements for the waiver. Animal rights groups oppose the effort. Whatever the outcome, the matter is likely to end up in federal court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia Board of Education will give the public 60 days to comment on a proposal on charter schools, double the normal allotted time. The board put the policy proposal up for comment Thursday. Legislation signed by Gov. Jim Justice authorizes a staggered implementation of public charter schools, limiting the state to three charters until 2023, then three more every three years after that. The legislation was part of a broader education bill that included teacher pay raises. The West Virginia Education Association and the West Virginia chapter of the American Federation of Teachers have lambasted the bill, saying it shut out teachers’ voices and violates the state Constitution.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is asking the Republican leaders of the Legislature’s budget committee to release $3.7 million a year in funding to pay for programs designed to help homeless people. Evers sent a letter Thursday to the committee cochairs, urging them to make available the funding that has been pending for four months. Evers is seeking action now before winter sets in. He says with cold temperatures and snow across the state already, “my concern has only grown.” The funding would go toward such things as grants to help low-income people with housing costs, help fund emergency shelters and pay for support to help homeless people get into permanent housing. The Assembly passed bills to approve the funding, but they’ve stalled in the Senate.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The National Park Service says snowy weather last month likely cut down on visitors to Yellowstone during October. The agency recorded just over 170,000 visitors during the month, a 22% decrease from October 2018. So far in 2019, the park has hosted over 3.9 million visitors, which is down 2.5% from the same period last year. Yellowstone is entering its winter season, when visits to the park are typically the lowest of the year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/15"}]}

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nLeveling the playing field, providing positive representation\n\n\"Sesame Street,\" which debuted in 1969, was born out of the intersection of the civil rights movement, President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty and subsequent Head Start program, which was meant to provide early childhood education and other necessities to low-income families.\n\nFounders Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrissett based the concept for the show around one question, says Akimi Gibson, vice president of formal learning and racial justice content at Sesame Workshop: \"Can television be used to teach children and level the playing field for children most disenfranchised by societal conditions?\"\n\nThe \"Sesame Street\" neighborhood, designed to resemble the historically Black community of Harlem, was another way of providing positive representation for communities that were often underrepresented in entertainment.\n\nBacked by educational research, Sesame understood that characters, whether they're creatures, human-like Muppets or actual humans, can help reaffirm children's identities by reflecting their own skin tones, hair textures, cultures and languages through the TV screen, Gibson added.\n\nAnd it resonated heavily with audiences.\n\nMegan Piphus makes show history as first Black woman puppeteer\n\n\"'Sesame Street' was a real community that I could be part of, but I don't think I understood the depth of that relationship as a kid watching the show,\" says Megan Piphus, who in 2020 became the show's first Black woman puppeteer. \"But they were part of the community that that raised me, and it's so beautiful now to be part of a show that has such a great responsibility for educating our children and raising our children.\"\n\nPiphus' journey to \"Sesame Street\" began with an Instagram message in 2018 to Leslie Carrara-Rudolph, puppeteer for Abby Cadabby, the bright pink fairy-in-training Muppet, who shared her work with \"Sesame Street\" producers. It wasn't until March 2020, when production had come to a halt and gave the team time to look through old submissions, that she was invited to join the show.\n\n\"I immediately saw myself represented through her,\" Piphus says of her muppet, Gabrielle, who wears her curly hair up in two Afro puffs.\n\n'It's a superpower': CNN town hall on racism let 'Sesame Street' comfort kids amid turmoil\n\nAmid worldwide protests over the police killing of George Floyd in summer 2020, \"Sesame Street\" partnered with CNN for a virtual town hall about racism, inviting children and families to ask experts, activists, educators and familiar \"Sesame Street\" characters about what was going on in the world.\n\n\"It's a superpower to be able to take those big issues and explain them so a 2- or 3-year-old can understand and that's one of the reasons I think 'Sesame Street' has been around for over 50 years,\" Piphus says.\n\n\"It may have been Mister Rogers who said that play is the love language of children. And when we do puppetry, we're speaking their language. … That's what keeps their attention. We're living inside of their imagination.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, the larger Sesame Workshop team knew it was important to meet families, whether they were facing challenges directly or from a distance, Gibson says.\n\n\"We help parents understand from a child development point of view how best to talk about these things, how best to name (them) in ways (that) build reassurance that they have a family structure, as well as to help children make sense of what they may be observing,\" Gibson adds.\n\nCreating positive memories for the next generation\n\nGabrielle has also been joined in recent years by new Muppets Tamir, her energetic 8-year-old cousin who loves comic books and is a vegetarian, and 5-year-old Wes and his dad, Elijah, who helped teach Elmo about racial literacy.\n\nLast fall, the \"Sesame Street\" team visited communities in Long Island, Queens, Brooklyn and Harlem to connect with viewers face-to-muppety-face.\n\n\"I felt like it was the real 'Who are the people in your neighborhood?'\" Piphus says. \"Gabrielle got to play with real kids. That was a special moment to be able to really bring the characters to life in person.\"\n\nAs season 53 streams on HBO Max through this summer, and later airs on PBS, the season's core curriculum will continue to spread messages about \"positive identity and sense of belonging,\" Gibson says.\n\n\"I hope that I can create this wonderful positive memory for the next generation,\" Piphus says. \"When I look back on my experience watching 'Sesame Street,' I remember very specific, beautiful moments. ...

He said it provides his organization with “critical funding” to continue producing the show and airing it on PBS, its home for 45 years.\n\nBesides “Sesame Street,” the workshop will make a Muppets spinoff series and a new original educational series for children. HBO said it also has licensed more than 150 past episodes of “Sesame Street.”\n\nJoan Ganz Cooney, co-founder of the series, said she has “long admired the creative work of HBO and can’t think of a better partner to continue the quality of ‘Sesame Street’s’ programming.” She noted there have been dramatic changes in the way children consume video and the economics of the kids’ TV business, and said Sesame Workshop must “adapt to the times.”\n\nThe move by HBO reflects another reality: fledgling TV competitors such as Amazon and Netflix are making their own forays into children’s programming as part of their streaming services.\n\nThe new episodes will begin airing as early as fall 2015, with HBO the exclusive, first-run subscription TV distribution partner for “Sesame Street” and the new series, in both English and Spanish. The new series will be available for PBS after the HBO window, with no interruption in the airing of “Sesame Street” as part of PBS Kids service on public television’s member stations, the partners said.\n\nIn addition to Sesame Street, HBO will also license approximately 50 past episodes of “Pinky Dinky Doo,” an animated series for preschoolers with a focus on early literacy, and “The Electric Company,” which relaunched in 2009, from Sesame Workshop.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/11/06/sesame-street-50-big-bird-childrens-tv-legacy/4168350002/", "title": "'Sesame Street' at 50: How Big Bird and friends shaped children's TV", "text": "NEW YORK – TV's most famous block is turning the big 5-0.\n\nThis Sunday marks half a century since \"Sesame Street\" aired its first episode on public television on November 10, 1969.

Hosted by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the celebrity- and music-filled event features appearances by Whoopi Goldberg, Sterling K.

Shot last winter on the series' homey soundstage in Queens, \"The Treasure of Yucky Mama\" follows cuddly red monster Elmo and his fairy companion Abby Cadabby as they team up with the garbage can-dwelling Oscar, who searches for decades-old relics belonging to his great grandma, the similarly grouchy Yucky Mama.\n\n\"Fifty? That is so old,\" Elmo exclaims, letting out his signature laugh before huddling over a weathered map of Sesame Street, dated 1969. Following clues as they hunt for treasure, the furry trio visits sites of former neighborhood haunts such as the Fix-It Shop, which was replaced by the Laundromat in 2008.\n\n\"Boy, I remember how Yucky Mama used to love to come here to stare at all the busted junk in the window,\" Oscar bemoans. \"Now look at it: People come here to make dirty clothes clean!\"\n\nAs the characters scurry from location to location, puppeteers glide below them on small rolling platforms just out of camera's view: hoisting the puppets high above their heads, and trying not to bump into each other as they excitedly speak in the Muppets' high-pitched voices.\n\nEven when they're not filming, the puppeteers stay in character. Abby, performed by Leslie Carrara-Rudolph, \"walks\" over to two young visitors between takes and greets them with hugs, cheerfully asking their names and ages. Elmo, played by Ryan Dillon since 2013, mimes lifting weights as he waits for cameras to roll, quipping, \"We're working on our core today.\"\n\n\"It looks deceptively easy to do what we do, but we're really doing half a dozen things at once,\" says longtime puppeteer Matt Vogel, who plays both Big Bird and Count von Count. \"We have to make that puppet look and feel real to the audience, whether they are adults or children. And that means that we are actors from the elbow up. We embody these little pieces of foam and felt with real human characteristics.\"\n\nThe characters' zany personalities and lovability are part of why Vogel believes the series has endured.\n\n\"It's this unique blend of characters, sensibility, music, humor and humanity,\" Vogel says. \"All of those things rolled up together in this little package – this little street, this community – is what is so important about 'Sesame Street' and keeps viewers connected with the show.\"\n\nThe series, which moves to WarnerMedia's HBO Max streaming service next year (episodes will continue to air later on PBS) has also broken new ground for kids' TV. In recent years, it's introduced human and puppet characters dealing with homelessness, foster care and autism. It furthers a mission of inclusiveness started by producers Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett, who created the program with the help of Muppets visionary Jim Henson.\n\n\" 'Sesame Street' (premiered) in '69, the year of both Woodstock and the moon landing, and carried on the optimism of the '60s,\" says Ron Simon, curator of television and radio at the Paley Center for Media. \"It was certainly an offshoot of the civil rights movement, and brought together a multicultural cast and creative team.\"\n\nSonia Manzano, who retired in 2015 after playing Fix-It Shop owner Maria for 44 years, says she rarely saw people of color on TV before the show premiered in 1969.\n\n\"At that time, when you saw a Latin person on television, you always waited for the taco joke,\" Manzano says. \"But not on 'Sesame Street': We were worried about child care and education, just like any other American family.\"\n\n\"We still teach numbers and letters, but our primary focus is on the emotional and social development of the child,\" Vogel adds. \"The audience sees themselves in these characters, and 'Sesame Street' can address these really important issues.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/06/04/public-broadcasting-superfluous-yet-seemingly-immortal/364432001/", "title": "Public broadcasting: superfluous yet seemingly immortal", "text": "George Will\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nWASHINGTON — As changing technologies and preferences make government-funded broadcasting increasingly preposterous, such broadcasting actually becomes useful by illustrating two dismal facts. One is the immortality of entitlements that especially benefit those among society's articulate upper reaches who feel entitled. The other fact is how impervious government programs are to evidence incompatible with their premises.\n\nFifty years and about 500 channels ago, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created to nudge Lyndon Johnson's Great Society — it aimed to make America great for the first time — the final inches toward perfection. Today, the CPB, which has received about $12 billion over the years, disperses the government's 15 percent of public television's budget and 10 percent of public radio's. Originally, public television increased many viewers' choices by 33 percent -- from three (CBS, NBC, ABC) to four.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, Sen. Al Gore, defending another appropriation increase for the CPB, asked what he considered a dispositive question: \"How many senators here have children who have watched 'Sesame Street' and 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'? ... This is one thing that works in this country.\" So, senators, mostly affluent, should compel taxpayers, mostly much less affluent, to subsidize the senators' children's viewing because it \"works,\" as measured by means that Gore neglected to reveal.\n\nEighteen years ago, some public broadcasting officials, who understood the importance of being earnest — and imaginative — testified to Congress that public television's educational effects on the workforce give the economy a $12 billion boost. Fifteen years ago, however, the then-president of public television said, \"We are dangerously close in our overall prime-time numbers to falling below the relevance quotient.\" Relevance? To what?\n\nToday, Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, thinks we can risk terminating the CPB. This would reduce viewers' approximately 500 choices to approximately 499. Listeners to public radio might have to make do with America's 4,666 AM and 6,754 FM commercial stations, 437 satellite radio channels, perhaps 70,000 podcasts, and other internet and streaming services.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAmerica, which is entertaining itself to inanition, has never experienced a scarcity of entertainment. Or a need for government-subsidized journalism that reports on the government. Before newspaper editorial writers inveigh against Mulvaney and in support of government subsidies for television and radio, they should answer this question: Should there be a CPN — a Corporation for Public Newspapers?\n\nThe CPB was created \"to encourage public telecommunications services which will be responsive to the interests of people.\" Of course: People's interests, not people's desires. The market efficiently responds to the latter. Public broadcasting began as a response to what progressives nowadays call \"market failure.\" This usually means the market's failure to supply what the public has not demanded but surely would demand if it understood its real \"interest.\"\n\nOne reason many Americans are becoming \"cord cutters,\" abandoning cable and satellite television, is that they want an a la carte world. One reason ESPN has lost 12 million subscribers in six years is that it is an expensive component of cable and satellite packages and many of those paying for the packages rarely watch ESPN.\n\nCompelling taxpayers to finance government-subsidized broadcasting is discordant with today's a la carte impulse and raises a question: If it has a loyal constituency, those viewers and listeners, who are disproportionately financially upscale, can afford voluntary contributions to replace the government money. And advertisers would pay handsomely to address this constituency.\n\nOften the last, and sometimes the first, recourse of constituencies whose subsidies are in jeopardy is: \"It's for the children.\" Big Bird, however, is more a corporate conglomerate than an endangered species. If \"Sesame Street\" programming were put up for auction, the danger would be of getting trampled by the stampede of potential bidders.\n\nThe argument for government-subsidized broadcasting is perversely circular: If the public were enlightened, there would be no need for government subsidies. But, by definition, an enlightened public would understand the inherent merits of subsidies by which the government picks more deserving winners than the market does.\n\nHowever, since government-subsidized broadcasting exists, any argument for it would be superfluous, given what governmental inertia usually accomplishes for government enterprises. Long ago — in January — there was bold Republican talk about Congress restoring \"regular order\": There would be 12 appropriations bills and they would be enacted before the 2018 fiscal year begins Oct. 1. Instead, there probably will be another \"swallow this or shutter the government\" omnibus bill in which almost everything survives by sparing almost everyone the torture of choices. This is, of course, a choice.\n\nContact George Will at georgewill@washpost.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/07/03/screen-time-toddlers-preschoolers-tv-recommendations/74271455007/", "title": "How much TV is OK for little kids? A judgment-free guide for families", "text": "It’s 5:30 p.m. on a Wednesday. Dinner isn’t ready, your partner isn’t home yet and two needy little kids won’t let you chop an onion. What’s a parent to do?\n\nConsider the TV, potentially the most helpful (and most controversial) parenting tool available in 2024. When it comes to screens, a hundred different opinions are competing for space in stressed-out-parents' minds. The pediatrician says one thing, Grandma says another, and social media makes you feel as if you’re a bad parent no matter what choice you make.\n\nMeanwhile, kids' TV shows have never had a higher profile. Disney+'s \"Bluey,\" which returns with three-minute \"minisodes\" this month, has taken over the zeitgeist.\n\nAs summer gets hotter and child care is more out of reach financially and logistically for many families, TV can be a big help. Debates about kids' screen time are nothing new. But after a few years of pandemic-related quiet, the conversation is reaching a fever pitch again, particularly on social media. \"As a working mom. I think that a lot of people are super-judgmental about screen time,\" says Dr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. \"So many people are giving parenting advice − they're not qualified to do it − and making people really second-guess themselves as parents.\"\n\nParents want to know the right answer. The problem is there's no right answer for every family. But here's what experts say about how much and what screen time is good for kids; what parents say about how screen time affects their lives; and what the people who make the shows that entertain your kids say, too. There's far more nuance here than one-minute TikToks insisting TV will melt kids' brains would indicate.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIs screen time bad for kids? How much screen time is OK for toddlers and preschoolers?\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics discourages kids from using any screen time − TV, computers or otherwise − under 18 months old, except for FaceTime or other video chatting. For those 18 to 24 months, they recommend a limited number of “high quality” programs watched alongside a parent or caregiver. And for ages 2 to 5, they advise limiting screen time to one hour a day, avoiding mealtimes and the hour before bedtime.\n\nThat seems simple and clear cut, right? Well, not always.\n\n“One hour is probably achievable for some families and probably impossible for others,” says Ash Brandin, a veteran teacher who posts realistic advice about screen time on Instagram as thegamereducator. “I would encourage families to ask themselves, ‘Is this screen time benefiting everyone in my family?’ If you are allowing 45 minutes of TV but it routinely ends in meltdowns, then that might not be sustainable. Another family may have 90 minutes a day but they break it up, mix in opportunities for physical movement and independent play, and find that the screen time allows adults to meet their family's needs.”\n\nRecommendations from experts, like those from the AAP, are often presented without a “why” attached to them. For babies under 18 months, the concern is that time in front of a screen can supplant time moving and interacting with the real world, thus limiting opportunities for the child to develop cognitive and motor skills. For older toddlers and preschoolers, the AAP says studies show “associations between excessive television viewing in early childhood and cognitive language and social/emotional delays.” But a big caveat is that better content leads to better outcomes.\n\nDr. Kathryn Hecht, a child psychologist and the mother of a toddler and infant in Minneapolis, worries about the “opportunity cost” of TV time. “If you’re watching TV, you’re not interacting with others. You’re not moving your body,” she says. “You’re not exercising your own imagination or creativity, because the story is being fed to you, plot twists and all.”\n\nBut for her, like so many parents, real life has real needs. “That said, all bets are off if a kid is sick,” Hecht adds, noting that her daughter recently had a stomach bug and is enjoying her saltines with an episode of “Dora the Explorer.”\n\nJennifer Cross, a pediatric behavior and development specialist at New York Presbyterian Hospital, says the one-hour-a-day rule is “certainly aspirational, and some people keep it. Four hours is too much, right? But if (kids) watch an hour in the morning while the parents are getting ready for work and in the evening they watch another half-hour show with their parents, I think that's certainly OK, too.”\n\nAre some TV shows better for little kids than others?\n\n“There's just so much to choose from that it's so difficult to find what's really beneficial,” Sara DeWitt, senior VP and general manager of PBS Kids, says of today's children’s entertainment landscape. At PBS, \"we're looking for things that are going to get kids passionate about learning.\"\n\nBut not every show has the educational mandate of public television. Hundreds of shows on dozens of platforms compete for kids' short attention spans. Among traditional offerings are shows airing on PBS, Disney Junior and Nickelodeon, streaming on Netflix, Disney+, Amazon and Apple TV+, and the unchecked and daunting world of YouTube and other creator-uploaded content.\n\nResearch tells us that kids under 2 can’t learn from a screen, but older kids can. And “educational content” isn’t limited to learning your letters on “Sesame Street\" (although that classic still is a great boon to kids half a century into its run). Children can learn social and emotional lessons from stories too. PBS' “Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,\" based on a \"Mister Rogers Neighborhood\" character, can help kids get over the fear of change or remember their potty training. Each episode has \"little songs about the social or emotional learning skills,\" says Chris Loggins, a supervising producer. Pediatric experts work with writers to create teaching concepts. \"Our ideas are a collaborative effort between our writing team, Fred Rogers Productions and our child development advisers.\"\n\nJoin our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\nNetflix’s rocking and pink “Gabby’s Dollhouse” is built around the psychological framework of “growth mindset,” which is about learning from our mistakes.\n\n“We love the idea that you can teach preschoolers to have a growth mindset,” says Traci Paige Johnson, co-creator of “Gabby’s.” She says the series bases its “DNA” on a book about the concept by Dr. Carol Dweck, and a researcher helps with scripts and stories. On Gabby’s it’s OK if kids “don't know something yet. We celebrate mistakes and failing fantastically.”\n\nEven teaching “prosocial” behavior is helpful to show “kids being nice to each other as opposed to fighting each other,” says Cross, the pediatrician. Series should show the characters being kind and compassionate all the time (\"Caillou,\" the Canadian preschool show every parent loves to hate, is often criticized for showing its lead character perform the opposite of this behavior.)\n\n\"I love the shows that teach good lessons about socio-emotional learning or that have an educational message,\" says Angela Narayan, who has a 5- and 3-year-old in Denver. \"All shows teach the viewers something, but it might not be something that parents really want children to learn.\"\n\nDoes pacing, animation style or color make a difference?\n\nOn social media, self-proclaimed experts in screen time point to 3D animation, fast scene transitions, neon colors or blaring soundtracks as “bad” for kids, but those opinions aren’t based in research. For some kids, those elements can be overstimulating, but not for others.\n\n“It's all moderation,” says Dr. Alison Yeung, a family doctor in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, who advises families on screen time use. She says some screen time with bright, 3D and loud content is fine, depending on your kid's temperament. “You have to know your child. Some kids will be just fine with that and they'll transition easily. If certain types of content are too overstimulating and there's a huge fight every time you try to transition to something else, then you may have to pull back.”\n\nPBS' DeWitt echoes those suggestions. “What is the moment that you're going to be using screen time, and how do you want your child to be interacting with that screen time?” While putting a baby down for a nap, “is it super-wise (to put on) a show where kids are going to yell back to the TV?”\n\nWhat your kids watch matters, and can even be helpful\n\nJust like adults, stories about people and places beyond children's experiences can open their eyes. Brittany Hinds, who has two children in Jackson, Tennessee, worries about the diversity of characters in the shows her kids watch. \"As (my daughter) got older and was exposed to more TV shows through family and friends, I became more concerned with content and messaging.\"\n\nMallory Mbalia, a former early-childhood educator who's now director of learning and education at Fred Rogers Productions, says watching your kids’ favorite shows with them can create a “common language.\"\n\n\"If kids connect with the content, it creates opportunities for learning connections and extensions,” she says. Mbalia once sang a song from “Daniel Tiger” when her daughter, then 4, struggled with anxiety at school drop-off. “She hugged me, smiled and skipped into the room. She had this connection with Daniel. Daniel had this problem. Daniel solved it this way. Daniel was able to handle that situation. She connected it to herself and she applied it in her context.”\n\nTV can be a happy part of family life, not just a stressful one, DeWitt says.\n\n\"There is a lot of value in parents and kids sitting down and watching something together,\" she says. \"That is a family experience. So think about how you make media a positive thing, instead of being something that you're always trying to manage or worry about.\"\n\n\"What are the things that make us all laugh? What are the things that help my kids calm down? How do you (make it) really joyful?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/03"}]}

Uda, 27, also is charged with attempted rape, three counts of burglary, aggravated criminal surveillance and two counts of illegal possession of a credit card. Police are trying to figure out how many of those 400 paris of women’s underwear, which had been worn, might have been stolen. Investigators said worn panties can also be bought on the internet.

The man, who was not identified by the Coast Guard in a statement, was taken to waiting rescue personnel in Nome. The helicopter crew was flying from Kotzebue to Kodiak on July 16 when it saw the SOS on top of the building. The crew circled back over the mining camp and saw a man waving his arms, another recognized sign of distress, the Coast Guard statement said. The man requested medical assistance after the helicopter landed, saying he had been attacked by a bear a few days earlier. The man appeared to have a leg injury and bruising on his torso, the Coast Guard said. The man said the bear had returned to his camp and harassed him every night for the previous week, according to the statement. Friends the same day the man was found had reported him overdue when he hadn’t returned to Nome. The Coast Guard statement didn’t specify what type of bear was involved.\n\nArizona\n\nPage:Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir on the Colorado River, is about to hit the lowest water level since it was filled in 1963, the Bureau of Reclamation said. As of Friday afternoon, agency data showed the elevation at 3,555.35 feet above sea level. Despite the recent rain, officials anticipated the levels to decline to 3,555.1 feet by last weekend. The last time the reservoir dropped that low was in 2005, during the early days of a prolonged drought that continues to linger to this day. Once it falls below that level, it will mark a new low in the reservoir’s history. “The fact that we’ve reached this new record underscores the difficult situation that we’re in,” said Wayne Pullan, regional director for the Upper Colorado Basin at the Bureau of Reclamation, which manages Glen Canyon Dam, during a press call to discuss the milestone. Because of the low water levels, the bureau plans to release water from three upper basin reservoirs downstream into Lake Powell ahead of schedule. The emergency measure is intended to help ensure the water level remains high enough to keep the hydropower turbines spinning and generating electricity.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas’ coronavirus cases rose by nearly 2,000 on Friday as the state’s COVID-19 surge prompted the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to scale back its hospital visitor policy. The Department of Health said the state’s virus cases rose by 1,987 to 372,313 total since the pandemic began. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by 22 to 871, with 328 in intensive care and 159 on ventilators. UAMS announced that beginning Monday it will change its visitation policy to limit patients to one visitor per day. Previously, patients could have multiple visitors a day as long as only one visitor was in the patient’s room at a time. UAMS said it will continue to allow additional visitors for end-of-life situations. UAMS will continue to require visitors to pass a daily health screening and wear a photo ID badge and a face mask. Hospital visitors will also be required to stay in the patient’s room at all times.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: An unvaccinated snow leopard at the San Diego Zoo has contracted COVID-19. Caretakers noticed that Ramil, a 9-year-old male snow leopard, had a cough and runny nose on Thursday. Later, two separate tests of his stool confirmed the presence of the coronavirus, the zoo said in a statement Friday. Ramil is not showing additional symptoms, the zoo said, but because he shares an enclosure with a female snow leopard and two Amur leopards, the staff assumes they have been exposed. As a result, the animals were quarantined and their exhibit was closed. It’s unknown how Ramil got infected. In January, a troop of eight gorillas at the zoo’s sister facility, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, contracted COVID-19 from a keeper who had the virus but showed no symptoms. The gorilla troop, which has since recovered, became the first known example of the virus infecting apes. The case prompted the zoo to request an experimental COVID-19 vaccine for animals for emergency use. The vaccine from Zoetis, animal health company that was once part of Pfizer, was administered to species most at risk of contracting COVID-19, including several primates and big cats.\n\nColorado\n\nWindsor:The city closed Windsor Lake on Friday afternoon and shifted planned activities this week because of the detection of blue-green algae in the water. The lake, swim beach and dog park are closed to the public until further notice while the city works with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to monitor bacteria levels. Permitted boats are allowed on the lake “to assist in agitating the water,” but tubing, water skiing and other water activities are not allowed. The algae was detected in a precautionary water test July 19. On July 20, the town put out an algae advisory and put signs around the lake, but staff had not yet identified any toxins. Blue-green algae are known to spread rapidly and can be a result of hot weather, stagnant water and stormwater runoff. CDPHE said that the algae, while common in Colorado, can sometimes produce toxins that can harm people and be fatal to dogs and other animals.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: After nearly eight years of discussion and planning, a memorial to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is nearing construction with the goal of offering a peaceful place for reflection. A groundbreaking ceremony is planned next month at the site down the street where the shooting occurred that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown on Dec. 14, 2012. Construction will be finished before the 10th anniversary next year, officials said. The State Bond Commission approved $2.5 million for the project on Friday, which the town will use to defray much of the $3.7 million local voters approved in April for the total cost of the memorial. The key area of the memorial will be a water feature with a sycamore tree in the middle and the victims’ names engraved on the top of the surrounding supporting wall. The water flow has been designed so floatable candles, flowers and other objects will move toward the tree and circle around it. Pathways will take visitors through a variety of plantings, including flower gardens.\n\nDelaware\n\nDagsboro: A historic chapel that predates the Revolutionary War has reopened to the public following a 16-month closure because of the pandemic. Prince George’s Chapel in Dagsboro welcomed the public for monthly tours Sunday, the Delaware State News reported. “It wasn’t worth even trying to open it up with all the restrictions and everything. So we’ve had it shut down,” Brian Baull, president of the nonprofit organization that serves as caretaker for the chapel, told the newspaper. Tours, which will take place the fourth Sunday of each month, are free. Construction on the chapel began in 1755 and was completed two years later. It was deeded to the state of Delaware in 1967, restored and reopened as a museum. In 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Its most prominent feature is a vaulted ceiling made of heart-of-pine planks, the newspaper reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser has activated the District's Heat Emergency Plan for the first half of this week, WUSA-TV reported. The plan goes into effect when the forecast of the temperature or heat index in the District is 95 degrees or higher. That causes the city to open cooling centers for residents seeking relief from the heat. A list of District cooling centers can be found here. In addition, the city recommends that residents stay indoors, find places in the shade or with air conditioning to seek relief from the heat; check on neighbors – children, the elderly and those with access and functional needs are the most vulnerable in the community; dink plenty of water and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing; do not leave children or pets in vehicles; pet owners should keep pets indoors, walk pets early in the morning and give pets plenty of water.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A juvenile green sea turtle rehabilitated at the Keys-based Turtle Hospital has been fitted with a satellite-tracking transmitter and released from a Keys beach to join the 14th Tour de Turtles, a marathon-like race that follows long-distance migration of sea turtles over three months. The educational outreach program organized by the Sea Turtle Conservancy raises awareness about sea turtles and threats to their survival. “The Tour de Turtles is an online educational program where, starting August 1, we’re tracking 19 turtles from Florida, Panama, Costa Rica and Nevis,” said Dan Evans, a senior research biologist with the Sea Turtle Conservancy. “It’s the idea that we’re tracking which turtle swims the furthest distance over three months.” Dubbed “Lucky Pulse” by her rescuers for a pulse-like marking on her head, the Keys turtle was released Friday to raise awareness about her own affliction. She was found off the Keys on March 17, entangled in fishing trap line and covered with fibropapilloma, debilitating tumors that develop from a herpes-like virus that affects sea turtles around the world. After the tumors’ removal, Lucky Pulse’s recovery included blood transfusions, breathing treatments, a broad spectrum of antibiotics, fluids, vitamins and a diet of seafood and greens.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: Residents at a mobile home park said they have had almost no water service for the past three weeks. So little water comes out of the pipes that it is almost impossible to flush toilets, wash dishes or take a bath at the Sea Breeze Mobile Home Park in Columbus, WRBL-TV reported. The water also isn’t safe to drink. “I had to spend three days in the hotel, me and my 8-year-old and my wife. That was money coming out of our pocket,” resident Jeffery Williams said. Water has been restored to some areas of the mobile home park and a citation has been issued to owner Fountain Bleau Capital LLC, said Columbus Inspection and Code Enforcement Director Ryan Pruett. The Massachusetts owner of the park said the maintenance staff was infected with COVID-19 and that delayed fixing the water problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A lawsuit challenging using police forces from other islands to respond to protests over a giant telescope planned for Hawaii’s tallest mountain is headed to the state Supreme Court. Police officers from Oahu and Maui flew to the Big Island in 2019 to help control protesters who blocked the mountain’s access road. Opponents of the Thirty Meter Telescope said it will desecrate land held sacred by Native Hawaiians. Big Island resident E. Kalani Flores’ lawsuit against police chiefs of the Hawaii County, Maui County and Honolulu forces argued his rights to observe Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea were violated by the police presence. The state Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case next month, Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported. The lawsuit said police violated a state statute that a police chief can operate on a neighboring island if doing so is required in the pursuit of an investigation that started in that chief’s jurisdiction. The lawsuit was initially dismissed because of a technicality and later went before the state Intermediate Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the police chiefs.\n\nIdaho\n\nKetchum: A multiyear project to improve forest health in and around one of the nation’s top ski destinations has begun in central Idaho. The 10-year Bald Mountain Stewardship Project is intended in part to reduce the chances of a wildfire at Sun Valley Resort’s Bald Mountain ski area that operates on U.S. Forest Service land. The Idaho Mountain Express reported that work has started on the Forest Service’s plan to reduce fuel, restore forest health and enhance recreation opportunities. The ski area is a huge economic driver. But pine beetles, dwarf mistletoe and white pine blister rust are killing trees on the ski-run-carved mountain that forms a scenic and much-photographed backdrop for the resort towns of Ketchum and Sun Valley. Experts said the aging forest long protected from wildfires is at risk, leading to the project that also will clear debris within the ski area. The 9-square-mile project includes Sun Valley Resort’s nearly 5-square-mile ski area, of which about 4 square miles is skiable terrain. Officials said wildfires in 2007 and 2013 surrounded 9,150-foot Bald Mountain with burned forest, creating an island of green trees and increasing bark beetle attacks.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockton:Officials have found elevated levels of harmful metals in groundwater monitoring wells at a Rockton Superfund toxic waste site. But the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency noted that the substances were not found in the municipal water system for the Village of Rockton. Its water was tested June 21. Testing of private wells near the site will begin soon. The metals discovered include antimony, cadmium, chromium and nickel. Some metals are essential nutrients, but others can cause health problems. The results came from wells that check groundwater on the site of the former Beloit Corp. toxic waste investigations at the former manufacturer of paper-making products have been underway since 1992. Elevated metal levels were found in 16 of 20 monitoring wells. All are contained on the Superfund site. The samples were collected following the June 14 explosion and devastating fire at Chemtool Inc., located on the Superfund site. Metals were not previously a concern on the Beloit Corp. property. State officials are investigating their source. Officials said that until testing is completed, those with private wells living in the Blackhawk neighborhood adjacent to Chemtool should use bottled water for drinking and cooking.\n\nIndiana\n\nBurns Harbor: Indiana’s Lake Michigan port has seen a big increase in shipments this year as the global economy rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic. In June, the port handled a 52% spike in cargo. So far this year, the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor has had more than a 36% increase in maritime tonnage compared with the same period last year, said Vanta E. Coda II, chief executive of the Indianapolis-based Ports of Indiana port authority. “Steel is up more than 100% and limestone has climbed nearly 90%, too. We look forward to additional growth in the second half of the year,” Coda said. Through the end of June, international cargos shipped through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Great Lakes ports are up by 8.37% to 12.9 million tons, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. Great Lakes shipping officials attributed the boost to increased domestic construction, manufacturing activity and global export demand. Shipments of cement are up 36%, gypsum 79% and general cargo 61%. Iron ore volumes are up 14%, partly because of exports to Asia and Europe. Coke, another steelmaking input, is up 125%, partly because of exports to France, the Netherlands and other European countries.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Forty Iowans, including some from the Cedar Rapids area, had to undergo treatment for rabies after they were potentially in contact with a rabid bat at the zoo in Omaha, Nebraska. More than 180 individuals were advised to receive the rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, which contains the rabies vaccine, after a wild bat was found near a person attending one of the Henry Doorly Zoo’s multiple overnight campouts at the aquarium earlier this month. A total of 186 overnight campers, including youth and adult groups, were contacted by the Nebraska public health department, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Among those were dozens of Iowans, mostly adolescents and their parents, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Linn County Public Health said anyone locally who has been impacted has been contacted and the appropriate follow-up has been conducted. Public health officials in Nebraska recommended all campers who stayed at the zoo overnight June 29, June 30, July 2 and July 3 receive prophylaxis. The recommendation came after a camper staying in the aquarium the night of July 3 woke up to a wild bat near her head. A team found seven bats in the building, one of which tested positive for rabies, a news release from the zoo stated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Union members at the Frito-Lay plant in Topeka have approved a new contract and will return to work Monday, ending a nearly three-week strike at the plant, union officials said. Members of Local 218 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union approved the contract Friday. It gives all union members a 4% pay raise over two years and guarantees workers at least one day off each week, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. More than 500 of the 850 employees represented by the union went on strike on July 5, complaining of a toxic work environment, forced overtime and a lack of pay raises. Workers said the shifts were caused by a severe staffing shortage at the plant. Carolyn Fisher, spokeswoman for PepsiCo., Frito-Lay’s parent company, said the contract allows the company to rebid its entire facility, or parts of it, once during the two-year contract. Labor-management committees will be formed to make recommendations on staffing and overtime and shape the rebid process.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Two members of Kentucky State University’s governing board resigned days before the abrupt departure of the campus president, adding to the upheaval in the highest ranks of the school as it faces an independent investigation into its finances. Soon after M. Christopher Brown II’s resignation as school president last week, Gov. Andy Beshear called for an independent accounting of KSU’s finances and signed an order empowering the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education to provide guidance and oversight during the review. The development came as Kentucky’s sole public historically Black university contended with concerns about its financial health and lawsuits alleging misconduct by campus officials. In the days before Brown’s departure, Candace McGraw submitted her resignation from the school’s Board of Regents. In her resignation letter, McGraw said she was “not fully aware of the time needed to engage fully in order to ensure the ongoing success of the university.” McGraw, a recent board appointee, is CEO of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Paul Harnice also resigned from the school’s board before Brown left, The State Journal reported. Harnice’s resignation letter did not provide an apparent reason for his resignation, The State Journal reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With more than 1,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 across Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards encouraged everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to wear masks indoors if they can’t stay distanced from others. But the Democratic governor stopped short of issuing a statewide face covering mandate or new restrictions on activities and businesses amid the state’s fourth spike of COVID-19, driven by the highly contagious delta variant. Louisiana – which has among the nation’s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates – is seeing thousands of new confirmed cases of the coronavirus illness each day, and its hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks. Edwards said Louisiana has the highest rate of new COVID-19 cases per capita in the nation and has been labeled a “state of concern” by the White House. Edwards placed the blame squarely on people refusing to get immunized against the coronavirus in a state where only about 48% of those eligible for the vaccines have gotten at least one shot.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine is home to the last wild Atlantic salmon populations in the U.S., but a new push to protect the fish at the state level is unlikely to land them on the endangered list. Atlantic salmon once teemed in U.S. rivers, but now return from the sea to only a handful of rivers in eastern and central Maine. The fish are protected at the federal level under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but a coalition of environmental groups and scientists said the fish could be afforded more protections if they were added to Maine’s own list of endangered and threatened species. State law allows Maine Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher to make that recommendation, but his office told the Associated Press he does not intend to do it. The department has done extensive work to conserve and restore the fish, and Keliher “does not believe a listing at the state level would afford additional conservation benefits or protections,” said Jeff Nichols, a department spokesperson. The environmentalists who want to see the fish on the state list said they’re going to keep pushing for it and other protections. Adding the fish to the state endangered list would mean conservation of salmon would be treated as a bigger concern in state permitting processes, said John Burrows, executive director for U.S. operations for the Atlantic Salmon Federation.\n\nMaryland\n\nOakland: A state police helicopter hoisted an injured swimmer to safety in western Maryland. The helicopter was dispatched shortly after 5 p.m. Friday to rescue a swimmer who sustained a head injury after slipping on a rock at Swallow Falls along the Youghiogheny River in Garrett County, state police said in a news release Saturday. The helicopter was requested partly because of the steep terrain and nature of the victim’s injuries, police said. The helicopter hovered 275 feet above the river as a trooper with medical equipment was lowered to the scene to prepare the patient for an aerial extraction, the news release said. Once the patient was secured inside the AW-139 helicopter, the crew provided medical care during the trip to a hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia. The patient wasn’t identified, and the person’s condition wasn’t immediately known.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A rare first-place medal from the first modern Olympic Games has sold for more than $180,000. Boston-based RR Auction said Friday that the winning bidder for the silver medal from the 1896 games in Athens, Greece, was a collector based on the East Coast. The company estimated before the auction that the first place medal could fetch about $75,000. At the inaugural Olympiad, first-place winners were awarded silver medals and second-place finishers earned bronze, the auction house said. There was no award for placing third. Unlike today’s games where thousands of athletes compete, just 250 were featured at the first modern games, the company said. Other notable items sold include a gold medal bestowed on the Argentine men’s soccer team during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics that went for more than $97,000. A gold medal for the U.S. men’s basketball team during the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics also sold for more than $83,000 and a gold medal awarded to Swedish wrestler Ivar Johansson during the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympics sold for more than $45,000.\n\nMichigan\n\nCorunna: Elected officials in Shiawassee County who gave themselves bonuses of $65,000 with federal COVID-19 relief aid said they will return the money following days of criticism. County commissioners acted after the county prosecutor said the payments were illegal, The Argus-Press reported. The Michigan Constitution bars additional compensation for elected officials “after services had already been rendered,” prosecutor Scott Koerner said Friday. The commissioners, all Republicans, voted on July 15 to award themselves $65,000 as part of a plan to give $557,000 to 250 county employees as “hazard pay” for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. The smallest amounts for recipients were $1,000 to $2,000. But County Board Chairman Jeremy Root got $25,000. Two more commissioners received $10,000 each, and four others received $5,000 each. The commissioners awarded money to other elected officials, including the prosecutor, the sheriff and the county clerk, all Republicans. They, too, said they would give it back. Two Michigan congressmen, a Democrat and a Republican, said federal virus aid wasn’t intended to reward elected officials.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBlaine: A crane fell over at a construction site in the Minneapolis suburb of Lexington on Friday, causing a power outage for nearly 900 customers in the area as temperatures climbed into the mid-90s. There were no injuries reported. A dispatch supervisor with the Centennial Lakes Police Department said the call came in shortly before 12:30 p.m. The crane fell into power lines and onto the partially constructed building. Dispatch supervisor Donnelle Lawrence said the building was evacuated. The collapse also caused a small grass fire, which was quickly extinguished, Lawrence said. Xcel Energy reported reported nearly 900 customers in the areas of Blaine, Circle Pines and Lexington were without power after the collapse according to its online outage map. Temperatures were in the mid-90s on Friday afternoon and the area was under a heat advisory, as forecasters said the combination of heat and humidity made the temperature feel like it was 100 degrees.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Even as COVID-19 cases have increased rapidly in Mississippi in recent days, some school districts are saying masks will be optional for students, teachers and staff. Among the districts taking that approach is the state’s largest one, DeSoto County School District. “Right now, there are no state mandates or local mandates requiring masks,” Superintendent Cory Uselton told WMC-TV. “Last year, we were under a mask mandate because of the governor’s executive order. There’s no executive order in place right now, so that will be a parental decision.” As part of its guidance for K-12 school settings, the State Department of Health recommends masks for anyone not fully vaccinated. It also recommends people 12 and older get vaccinated. Instead of encouraging either of those things, the DeSoto District will give families information from the health department, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics, Uselton said.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: St. Louis city and county officials said they will require masks in some public places starting Monday, citing a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases spurred by the delta variant. Masks will be mandatory in indoor public places and on public transportation for everyone age 5 or older, even for those who are vaccinated, officials said in a news release Friday. Masking outdoors “will be strongly encouraged,” especially in group settings. The decision comes as both of Missouri’s urban areas are seeing a big uptick in cases in hospitalizations that began in rural areas of the state, especially in southwestern Missouri. The Kansas City Star reported Friday that medical leaders in that region appear to be on the verge of calling for a new mask mandate there, as well.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Five firefighters were injured when a thunderstorm and swirling winds in central Montana blew a lightning-caused wildfire back on them, federal officials said. All five remained in medical facilities and were still being evaluated and treated Saturday, a day after they were injured, Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Mark Jacobsen said. He declined to release the extent of the firefighters’ injuries or specify where they were being treated. They had joined other crews working on the 1,300-acre fire burning in rough, steep terrain about 36 miles northwest of the town of Jordan. They were building a defensive fire line Thursday when the weather shifted, Jacobsen said. “Numerous wind shifts and rapid rates of spread resulted in erratic fire behavior as thunderstorms and associated cells were passing over the area when the incident occurred,” he said. Other firefighters in the area were able to call for help and the injured firefighters – three U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service crew members from North Dakota and two USDA Forest Service firefighters from New Mexico – were evacuated, Jacobsen said. Meanwhile, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Friday that crews from Utah and California were coming to Montana on Saturday to help fight fires. Utah will send two task forces with a total of seven engines and 25 personnel, and California is sending a strike team with five engines and 20 personnel, Gianforte said. The teams will be in Montana for two weeks, and Montana will pay their costs, the governor said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nearly 50 Nebraska school boards have objected to proposed state health education standards that include lessons for young children on gender identity and gender expression. State Sen. Joni Albrecht said 47 school boards across the state have either adopted resolutions or sent letters opposing the first draft of the standards that the Nebraska Department of Education is considering. Albrecht was part of a group of 30 state senators who signed a statement urging school districts to object to the standards. The standards would be optional if they’re approved, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Under the proposed standards, kindergartners would learn about different kinds of family structures, including same-gender families. First-graders would be taught about gender identity and gender stereotypes. Sixth-graders would learn about a range of identities related to sexual orientation, including heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, two-spirit, asexual and pansexual. They would be taught the differences between cisgender, transgender, gender nonbinary, gender expansive and gender identity. The proposal has faced strong opposition from Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, who has no direct influence over the state board, and large crowds have attended state education board meetings. State Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt told school districts in a letter earlier this month that there would be changes in the second draft of the standards. He said that next draft will remove many of the explicit examples and make clear that discussions of sensitive health-related topics should be “thoughtfully conducted with parental input at a local level.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Coronavirus numbers remained high in Nevada as the state reported more than 1,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, at least 20 deaths and hospitalizations climbing past the 1,000 plateau for the first time in more than five months, state health officials said. The 1,003 new cases reported by the state Department of Health and Human Services nearly matched the 1,004 new cases reported on Tuesday. It was the highest since 1,070 cases were recorded Jan. 30, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The updated figures pushed totals to 349,043 COVID-19 cases and 5,817 deaths statewide since the pandemic began in March 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New Hampshire residents can’t be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to access public facilities, benefits or services under a bill signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu. Supporters said the bill signed this week establishes “medical freedom” by specifying that all residents have the “natural, essential and inherent right to bodily integrity, free from any threat or compulsion by government to accept an immunization.” It does not, however, supersede the state law regarding vaccinations as a prerequisite for admission to school. That law lists seven required vaccinations but does not include the COVID-19 vaccine. The new law also does not apply to county nursing homes, the state psychiatric hospital or other medical facilities operated by the state or other governmental bodies. And it allows mandatory immunizations in prisons and jails when there is a significant health threat.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: New Jersey on Friday took the first step to rid the lower Hackensack River of heavily contaminated sediment dating from the state’s industrial past. State Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette announced the commitment of Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration to seek placement of the 23-mile stretch of river on the federal government’s list of Superfund toxic sites. Approval would mean access to federal funding and would enable the Environmental Protection Agency to seek the parties responsible for polluting the waters to help fund the remediation, once identified. “Designating the lower Hackensack River as a federal Superfund site will provide the tools we need to remove decades of contamination that have polluted river sediments and restore the natural resources that have been impaired for far too long,” LaTourette said. A previous EPA study found elevated levels of cancer-causing dioxin, cadmium, lead, mercury and PCBs in sediment sampled from the river’s mouth at Newark Bay to the Oradell Reservoir. Achieving Superfund status could take years to complete. “I realize that this is one step in the process and that cleanup will take time,” said Hackensack Riverkeeper Bill Sheehan. He said he has been working to get the designation since 2015.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico schools plan to spend the bulk of the federal coronavirus relief money they have received on technology and building upgrades rather than student learning loss. A report this week before the New Mexico Legislature’s budget committee showed school districts and charters plan to spend 38% of the $490 million they received thus far on technology and HVAC systems. T he Santa Fe New Mexican reported that schools plan to spend 9% of the funds on learning loss programs and 8% on interventions for at-risk students. The budget committee’s program evaluation manager Micaela Fischer told lawmakers those numbers were surprising because students likely missed out on learning because of the shift to remote classrooms during the pandemic. Los Alamos Public Schools is an exception to the trend and plans to spend all of the money it received from a December coronavirus relief package to address learning loss with summer and after-school programs.\n\nNew York\n\nYonkers: Police and bystanders lifted a car to free a trapped baby after a suspected drunken driver struck the girl and her mother and then plowed through a storefront with the pair on the hood. The crash and rescue were recorded on video released by Yonkers Police. It showed a Hyundai Elantra striking a curb and parked car Friday before driving into a woman as she crossed the street with a child in her arms. With the woman and child on the hood of the car, it accelerates through the storefront of a barber shop. Police body camera footage from inside the building showed Yonkers Officers Rocco Fusco and Paul Samoyedny, who had been having breakfast nearby, frantically working with bystanders to lift the heavily damaged car and pull the crying 8-month-old girl from beneath it. “Luckily, two veteran officers of Yonkers’ finest just happened to be getting breakfast next door and quickly took action along with members of the community to rescue a child trapped under the vehicle and render aid to her mother,” Police Commissioner John Mueller said in a news release. “The actions taken are nothing short of heroic.” The baby sustained a skull fracture and burns to her back and foot. Her 36-year-old mother broke a leg, the news release said. The 43-year-old male driver and a female passenger were not injured. The driver, from Yonkers, was charged with driving while intoxicated, vehicular assault and aggravated unlicensed operation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Transportation officials said successful drone flights this week to Ocracoke have them hopeful that it might soon get easier to deliver vital supplies to the remote Outer Banks island amid bad weather. The Department of Transportation’s Division of Aviation and U.S.-based drone logistics company Volansi completed two successful trial flights of a delivery drone from a ferry dock in Hatteras to Ocracoke Island, the department said in a news release. “This is a tremendous first step in better connecting Ocracoke Island to potentially life-saving supplies and equipment,” Secretary of Transportation Eric Boyette said in a statement. “Today, Ocracoke Island is accessible only by plane or by boat. What we’re working on here is an entirely new, third method of serving the needs of Ocracoke’s people.” The tests involved an 8-mile round-trip flight averaging 18 minutes in flight time. The first delivered a small survival kit, space blankets and a chocolate muffin to Ocracoke, and the second delivered bottles of water, according to the news release. The next test, at a time to be determined, will involve a longer flight, the department said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The federal government has denied a request by North Dakota leaders to allow ranchers struggling with drought to hay idled grassland while it’s still of good quality. The Bismarck Tribune reported the state Agriculture Department is looking into the reasons why the request was denied. The federal government is allowing limited emergency grazing of Conservation Reserve Program land, which typically is idled under a government program that pays farmers to protect erodible land and create wildlife habitat. North Dakota ranchers all summer have been seeking federal government permission to also hay that land. The CRP typically doesn’t open until after nesting season ends, to protect wildlife populations. The season in North Dakota ends Aug. 1. Ranchers said that after that day, grass might not be of good enough quality to make it worthwhile to hay. State officials and members of North Dakota’s congressional delegation this summer have pushed the U.S. Department of Agriculture for earlier CRP haying. State Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring earlier this week made another plea. His department has received hundreds of calls from ranchers in recent weeks about the issue.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:The Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame is officially scheduled to open next summer. Plans for the interactive park and star-studded path were unveiled Saturday during an induction ceremony. The crowd was lively while the P. Ann Everson-Price & The All-Star Band played tributes to the walk's first inductees as well as other famous Black musicians and funk artists. The first four inductees to receive stars on the Walk of Fame will be Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Bootsy Collins, King Records icon Otis Williams, and Grammy Winners The Isley Brothers and the late Gospel great Dr. Charles Fold. The Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame is intended to stand toe-to-toe with The National Museum of African American Music in Nashville, Tennessee; Atlanta’s Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame; and Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Like the Hollywood Walk of Fame, each inductee will have their name placed on a star on the walkway. The funding for the park and walkway will come from the $159 million stimulus fund that was awarded to the county. The Hamilton County Commission unanimously voted in favor of the park while deciding on how to spend the county's stimulus money. The park was awarded $9 million. Procter and Gamble has also partnered with the project and will pay for the new inductee stars for the next several years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The owner of a dilapidated Oklahoma Panhandle wind farm has presented plans to clean up the most dangerous of the wind turbine towers. The plans are to address dangerously broken-down towers and turbines of the 60-tower KODE Novus I and II wind farm near Guymon, The Oklahoman reported. Owner Olympia Renewable Platform LLC has hired a contractor to remove broken blades from seven towers and topple a couple of others topped with burned-out generator nacelles. The company assured the repair work could begin next month and take 20 to 30 days to complete, depending on wind conditions. Dozens of wind turbines in the complex have been locked down and aren’t part of the cleanup plan. Oklahoma Corporation Commission officials have determined that the dilapidated wind towers are dangerous to the public, which had easy access to the scene until Olympia erected temporary fencing around it. The complex was developed and owned by a subsidiary of a South Korean company until it went bankrupt.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Low oxygen levels measured off the coast of Oregon and Washington are raising concerns of large “dead zones” that could decimate crabs and bottom-dwelling fish within them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said this week that researchers have detected unseasonably low oxygen levels in a large area off the Pacific coast, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Year after year of low oxygen levels beginning in the early 2000s led researchers to determine Oregon now has a “hypoxia season” – just as it has a fire season – and this year’s hypoxia season has arrived far earlier than usual. The start of the hypoxia season is marked by the upwelling of cold bottom water. Winds initiated that upwelling this year around March. Chan said that’s the earliest Oregon ocean-watchers have seen in 35 years. That could have major implications for coastal economies, particularly related to the Dungeness crab. Dead zones happen as winds pick up, driving cold water from the bottom of the ocean toward the surface, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That contributes to blooms of phytoplankton, which once they die, sink to the ocean floor. Bacteria consume oxygen while decomposing the plankton.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: President Joe Biden will head to the Allentown area Wednesday as he fights for passage in the Senate of a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure measure that a bipartisan group of senators brokered with him. The White House is billing Biden’s visit to Macungie as a stop to “emphasize the importance of American manufacturing, buying products made in America, and supporting good-paying jobs for American workers.” It gave no other details of the visit – Biden’s second to Pennsylvania so far this month after he went to Philadelphia last week to speak on voting rights. In the Senate, Republicans rejected an effort this week to begin debate on the infrastructure deal. Supporters said they need more time before another vote, possibly next week. Macungie is near the home of Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, who voted against opening debate. In a statement after the vote, Toomey echoed other Republicans in pointing out that crucial details about the deal are not completed. Should an agreement be reached on those, Toomey said he will consider the measure “based on its substance.” Pennsylvania’s other U.S. senator, Democrat Bob Casey, voted with other Democrats to start debate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Environmental officials in Rhode Island have extended their ban on shellfish harvesting in certain areas of the state. The state Department of Environmental Management said a ban that was set to expire Sunday will be extended until further notice. The announcement covers what it refers to as the “Lower Providence River Conditional Area E” and “Upper Bay Conditional Area A.” The closures were enacted after recent heavy rainfall and are being extended because test samples showed continued high bacteria levels in the water. At least one other shellfish area in Greenwich Bay reopened to harvesting Sunday, and two others in Mt. Hope Bay and the Kickemuit River are open, the agency said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nNichols: A utility is building walls around an electric substation to prevent it from being overrun by floodwaters in the first-of-its-kind project in South Carolina. Duke Energy is spending $1.6 million on the Nichols project to protect a substation that has flooded twice in the past five years, utility spokesperson Ryan Mosier told the Morning News of Florence. The substation was flooded in 2016 in Hurricane Matthew and 2018 in Hurricane Florence. In 2018, the substation, which takes high voltage power from plants and converts it to lower voltage electricity for homes, was out for five weeks, Mosier said. The substation is surrounded by reinforced fiberglass walls. Crews put up aluminum gates when flooding is threatened, which keep water out but allow crews access inside. The walls are 6-to-8 feet tall with access gates. The gates are installed when the company forecasts potential flooding. Crews can also quickly access the substation for maintenance. Duke Energy has already installed the walls at facilities in Lumberton and Wallace in North Carolina and plans four more projects, Mosier said, Other nearby substations to Nichols are on higher ground and didn’t need the walls, said Davy Gregg, a Duke Energy supervisor for the Marion County area.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A replica of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier came to Sioux Falls over the weekend as part of a honorary tour to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the monument. The half-scale replica was at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance and crowds came to view it and learn more about its history. The original Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is in Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, across the Delaware River from the nation’s capital.. The replica is part of a traveling exhibition called A Call to Honor: Tomb of The Unknown Soldier. The Americanism Committee of the Exchange Club in Rome, Georgia, is responsible for the exhibition and brings the replica to all parts of the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The bust of Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest that had been prominently displayed inside the state Capitol for decades – over objections from Black lawmakers and activists – was removed from its pedestal Friday. The image of Forrest has sparked protests since its installation in 1978 as defenders sought to tout his legacy while critics objected to honoring a historical figure who supported the South’s secession. Over the years, some suggested adding historical context next to the bust. Yet many others, including Republican Gov. Bill Lee, successfully argued for moving it to the Tennessee State Museum, just north of the Capitol. Forrest was a Confederate cavalry general who amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a Memphis slave trader and plantation owner. Later, he was a leader of the Klan as it terrorized Black people. The busts of Union Navy Adm. David Farragut and U.S. Navy Adm. Albert Gleaves also were moved to the museum on Friday, part of an agreement used to win over the votes needed on key panels that military leaders shouldn’t be displayed in the Capitol.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The Dallas area was the country’s top market for commercial property investments in the first half of 2021. Dallas retained the top real estate spot it gained last year during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report by Real Capital Analytics. Through the first six months of this year, Dallas saw almost $13.4 billion in commercial property deals – 43% more than in the same period a year ago. Last year, more than $19.7 billion in commercial real estate deals were recorded in the local market. Sales of dozens of local apartment communities and warehouses, plus the $700 million purchase of Uptown Dallas’ Crescent complex, all contributed to the huge volume of property investments in the area this year. The Crescent was ranked as the second-largest commercial property deal in the country in the first six months of 2021.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City:People in Utah gathered to celebrate the state’s history and recognize early Mormon pioneers who trekked west in search of religious freedom. Pioneer Day is a beloved only-in-Utah holiday every July 24 that features parades, rodeos, fireworks and more. The festivities were canceled last year because of the pandemic. Hundreds of people on Friday camped and staked out spots along the parade route in downtown Salt Lake City. Pioneer Day marks the date in 1847 when Brigham Young and other Mormon pioneers, many pulling handcarts, ended their treacherous journey across the country from Illinois to the Salt Lake Valley. Many businesses and government offices close for the state holiday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Signs will be posted near eight Vermont ponds where the use of baitfish is prohibited to protect native brook trout, the Fish and Wildlife Department said. 1/ 2 “Wild native brook trout thrive in ponds where there are simple fish communities with no or few other fish species,” department fisheries biologist Jud Kratzer said in a statement earlier this week. “Adding new fish species, even minnows, disrupts a long-established food chain. Trout populations suffer as a result.” Brook trout are native to the eastern United States but no longer exist in much of their original range, the department said. Signs will be posted at public access points near Beaver Pond in Holland; Blake Pond in Sutton; Cow Mountain Pond in Granby; Jobs Pond in Westmore; Lewis Pond in Lewis; North Pond in Chittenden; Unknown Pond in Avery’s Gore; and Noyes Pond in Groton.\n\nVirginia\n\nCulpeper: Virginia’s government watchdog said the commonwealth’s land conservation easement program that offers participants tax breaks needs improvement. Auditors with the Office of the State Inspector General found items such as trash, old tires, inoperable vehicles and a manure storage area containing dead cattle parts on properties with easements it inspected, the Culpeper Star-Exponent reported. “Virginia provides tax credits up to $75 million per year for conservation easements and land donations,” Inspector General Michael Westfall said in a statement. “In effect, Virginia is paying for natural resource preservation through these tax credits.” There’s a $1 million tax credit value threshold for a Department of Conservation and Recreation quality review of an easement. Among the watchdog’s recommendations was lowering that threshold. But Dan Holmes, director of state policy for the Piedmont Environmental Council, told the newspaper the tax credit was a valuable tool and questioned the audit’s conclusions and methodology.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan and other city officials plan to add a response unit for 911 calls that don’t require typical, armed police officers. Officials said they are still working out details, and it won’t launch until at least next year, The Seattle Times reported. Durkan said the idea is to provide 911 dispatchers with a new option for certain calls, such as wellness checks, that are associated with neither criminal nor medical emergencies. The mayor said it could be similar to the city’s Health One program, which sends firefighters and social workers to nonemergency medical calls. It will likely be staffed by civilian city employees, possibly partnered with certain officers, she said. The responders will know deescalation techniques and how to guide people to social services, she said, adding that it might be called “Triage One.” Durkan said she intends to include funding for the new option in her 2022 budget proposal, which is due in September. She hasn’t said what it might cost but said it would start as a pilot program, with limited capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state treasurer’s office raised nearly $140,000 for law enforcement agencies through its unclaimed property firearms auction. This year’s event had record inventory – more than 500 firearms lots – because the pandemic prevented the treasurer’s office from holding an auction last year, Treasurer Riley Moore’s office said in a news release. The treasurer’s office raised $139,790 during the auction. Under state law, state and local law enforcement agencies can turn over unclaimed, seized or outdated firearms in their possession to the treasurer’s office for auction, and the proceeds can be returned to the law enforcement agency. This year’s auction attracted more than 60 federally licensed firearms dealers. Bidders must be a valid, licensed federal firearms dealer. The event isn’t open to the general public.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System plans to offer nearly $500,000 in scholarships this fall to students who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus. System President Tommy Thompson said all vaccinated students at regional four- and two-year campuses that get at least 70% of their students vaccinated by Oct. 15 will be eligible for a drawing for a $7,000 scholarship. Seventy students will win, with more winners coming from campuses with larger enrollments. UW-Madison students won’t be eligible, Thompson said, because Chancellor Rebecca Blank is working on her own vaccination incentive programs. Asked for details on Blank’s plans, UW-Madison spokesman John Lucas said the flagship university is “on a path” to reach 80% vaccination among students and is “considering incentives” but had nothing to announce. Thompson has called for campuses to offer at least three-quarters of their courses in-person this fall. He said he set the vaccination threshold at 70% for the scholarship drawing because that’s generally considered the minimum for herd immunity.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Officials expect moderate to extreme drought to persist and spread throughout Wyoming. The multiyear drought is the state’s worst since 2013. Last year was Wyoming’s fifth-driest and 16th-warmest since 1895, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Even parts of the state with average or above-average precipitation got it earlier in the year than usual, leaving those areas just as susceptible to drought now, Wyoming Game and Fish Department terrestrial habitat supervisor Ian Tator told the state Game and Fish Commission last week. “On a statewide basis, there’s nowhere that’s doing fantastic,” Tator said. Fishing spots also face strain as water levels fall and temperatures rise, state fisheries management coordinator Dave Zafft told the commission.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2024/05/23/100-milwaukee-objects-for-culture-history-sports-food-drink-more/73307718007/", "title": "100 Milwaukee objects for culture, history, sports, food & drink, more", "text": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nSome of us used to say we were from Milwaukee with a hint of shame.\n\nBut there are signs everywhere we look that Cream City is rising. Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}]}

LaMonica McIver with assault over ICE facility visit", "text": "The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey announced charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver on May 19 for assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement related to an altercation at a Newark immigration facility.\n\nThree Democratic lawmakers from New Jersey − Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez, and McIver − faced off against DHS guards on May 9 outside the Delaney Hall detention center shortly after officers arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Members of Congress, by law, can visit immigrant detention facilities unannounced.\n\nInterim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, formerly a lawyer for President Donald Trump, said in a statement that \"I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined.\"\n\nIn a statement, McIver called the charges political. The other two lawmakers have not been charged.\n\n“We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times before, and our visit should have been peaceful and short. Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka,” she said. “The charges against me are purely political – they mischaracterize and distort my actions and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin initially told CNN that multiple members of Congress had assaulted officers and that arrests were possible.\n\n“We actually have body camera footage of these members of Congress assaulting these ICE enforcement officers, including body slamming a female ICE officer,\" she said.\n\nThe members of Congress have pushed back on the government's narrative that they assaulted officers. Body camera footage shows the representatives objecting to Baraka's arrest and to officers touching the members of Congress as a small, tightly packed group moves along a fence.\n\nAfter the incident, the members of Congress took an hour-long tour of the facility.\n\n\"They didn’t assault anyone, but were themselves aggressively mistreated by illegally masked individuals,\" House Democratic leaders said in a joint statement. \"There is no credible evidence that Rep. McIver engaged in any criminal activity, and she would not have been permitted to tour the facility had she done anything wrong.\"\n\nIn the statement, the leaders called the charges an attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate Congress.\n\n\"Everyone responsible for this illegitimate abuse of power is going to be held accountable for their actions. An attack on one of us is an attack on the American people. House Democrats will respond vigorously in the days to come at a time, place and manner of our choosing,\" the statement said.\n\nSenior Justice Department officials voiced support for the highly unusual decision to charge a sitting member of Congress with assaulting an officer.\n\n“I echo what [Habba] has made clear: assaults on federal law enforcement will not be tolerated,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, another former Trump attorney, wrote on X. “This Administration will always protect those who work tirelessly to keep America safe.”\n\nIn the same May 19 statement, Habba said the misdemeanor trespassing charge against Baraka, a candidate for governor, has been dropped \"for the sake of moving forward.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey on Monday lambasted the charges.\n\n“The Trump administration’s political charges against Congresswoman McIver is a method more suited for authoritarianism than American democracy,\" Mike Zamore, national director of policy and government affairs at the ACLU, and Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU-NJ, said in a statement.\n\n“If the Trump administration can target elected officials who oppose its extreme agenda, it can happen to any one of us. We demand that they drop the charges against Rep. McIver, and we implore her fellow members of Congress to call for the same.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/19"}]}

Recorded 25 years ago in New York City on Nov. 18, 1993, Nirvana’s \"MTV Unplugged In New York\" album holds a different place in the band’s short-but-legendary discography, an album of transcendent folk rock that glimpsed what could’ve been the band’s next post-grunge era, had frontman Kurt Cobain survived long enough to see its musical leanings through.\n\nSadly, \"MTV Unplugged\" would not be the beginning of a new chapter for Nirvana but the end of one. Cobain died of suicide in April 1994, and the album would be the band’s first release since his passing, released in December to a rapturous critical response, beckoning Grammy awards and millions of copies in sales.\n\nYet 25 years later, Nirvana’s \"MTV Unplugged\" album isn’t just remarkable for its mythology. It is a genius recording, in so many ways, the first being the way the band adapted to the acoustic format of the \"MTV Unplugged\" series, which presented an immediate challenge for a set of musicians best known for their blistering noise. Instead of just making an album of de rigueur “Nirvana goes acoustic” tracks, the band reconfigured their sound to adapt to the setting, becoming a new band for the night, with the stripped-down instrumentals laying bare the material’s naked emotion.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nEqually brilliant was the band’s choice to forego their biggest hits, instead choosing a divinely inspired mix of eight Nirvana songs and six covers, including the Vaselines’ “Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam,\" the traditional folk song \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\" and, most memorably, David Bowie’s “The Man Who Sold the World,” which is now as classic as the original.\n\nIt’s a testament to how deeply and intimately Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl understood their material as a band that they were able to filter through their catalog of popular hits and fan favorites, cut the songs that didn’t fit the format and emerge with a track list of songs that would be transformed in the \"Unplugged\" setting. As a result, we have the acoustic versions of songs such as “All Apologies,\" \"Pennyroyal Tea\" and “Come As You Are,” which arguably have survived as the more enduring versions.\n\nBut the true gift of Nirvana’s \"MTV Unplugged\" album is its presentation of Cobain at his peak, a showcase of his artistry that’d never been seen before, and due to his untimely death, would never be seen again. Cobain’s presence is never more painfully beautiful than he is on \"Unplugged,\" his vocals achingly perfect, surrounded by black candles and white lilies in a funeral-like setting that was famously his vision. On their other recordings, Novoselic and Grohl are Cobain’s furiously powerful equals, but acoustically, Cobain is a singular force.\n\nAnd while nobody in the audience on Nov. 18, 1993, knew that Cobain would be dead less than a half-year later, it’s impossible to listen to Nirvana’s \"MTV Unplugged\" album and not hear the demons in his head, so present it’s as if they’re singing backup onstage. The album is equal parts tragedy and triumph, almost certainly the best live album of a generation from a band who made nearly every correct creative choice in its recording, which nevertheless endures as Cobain’s personal, pre-emptive funeral mass.\n\nHad he stayed alive, Nirvana’s \"MTV Unplugged\" would still be a classic; after his death, it became immortal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2017/02/13/why-beyonce-lemonade-lost-the-grammys-why-she-should-have-won/97847070/", "title": "Why Beyoncé's 'Lemonade' lost the Grammys - and why she should ...", "text": "Maeve McDermott\n\nUSATODAY\n\n“What the (expletive) does (Beyoncé) have to do to win album of the year?”\n\nThat's a very good question, one posed by Adele backstage at the Grammys on Sunday night, minutes after 25 beat Beyoncé’s Lemonade for album of the year.\n\nThe answer? Short of going more pop, or magically becoming a white artist, it's unclear. Beyoncé’s loss is emblematic of the Grammys' most glaring problems, confirming that \"music's biggest night\" is just as out-of-touch and racially fraught as critics claim.\n\nHere's why Beyoncé didn't win, and why she should have.\n\nWHY SHE LOST\n\nThe Grammys love Adele — and her sales numbers\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhile Beyoncé’s loss dismayed many fans, it wasn’t a surprise to some Grammys-watchers. Adele is a perennial favorite at the awards, sweeping the 2012 Grammys with six trophies for 21. Thanks to its earlier release date, her album 25 dwarfed Lemonade in sales. While the two albums posted similar numbers in 2016 (2.4 million and 2.2 million total units, respectively), Adele had already also sold 8.01 million units in 2015 before Lemonade arrived in April 2016.\n\nBlack artists have struggled to win album of the year\n\nThe Grammys’ album of the year preferences extend beyond just stats. Last year, Frank Ocean told the New York Times that he was skipping the Grammys because of the voters' weak track record in recognizing black artists, particularly when it comes to album of the year. “1989 getting album of the year over To Pimp A Butterfly. Hands down one of the most 'faulty’ TV moments I’ve seen,” Ocean wrote in a subsequent Tumblr post, pointing out how Taylor Swift’s album beat out the Kendrick Lamar favorite last year.\n\nAnd as one viral tweet illustrated, the Grammys’ track record of awarding album of the year to a pop album, rather than a rap or R&B favorite, just extended into its fifth straight year.\n\nThe Grammys have an 'urban contemporary' problem\n\nIn one of the modern Grammys’ most worrisome trends, critically-favored rap and R&B artists are rewarded in their respective genre categories, while rarely taking home the night’s biggest award. It’s a struggle that Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Kendrick Lamar all know well. Bey’s Lemonade took home best urban contemporary album last night, the category that Ocean’s Channel Orange won in 2013, while Lamar’s To Pimp A Butterfly was awarded best rap album in 2016.\n\nNone of the three artists have won album of the year, with Beyoncé nominated in the category three times. Yet, Bey fans hoped that the 2017 awards would be different, with her visually-sumptuous and critically-acclaimed Lemonade a big enough achievement to overcome the Grammys’ questionable history of racial inequity.\n\nWHY BEYONCÉ SHOULD HAVE WON\n\nThe album was culturally significant and unparalleled in its impact\n\nAdele’s album of the year win wasn't exactly as an upset; the record-breaking sales and positive reviews of the worldwide-beloved album speak for itself. But as Adele alluded to backstage, Beyoncé winning an album of the year for Lemonade would’ve recognized not just her music, but the vital cultural role the singer occupied in 2016, a pop mega-star whose work still spoke powerfully to members of her race and gender. “I felt like it was her time to win,” Adele said.\n\nShe was right. 25 and Lemonade both explored the struggles of being a wife and/or mother, and while Adele's album was just as swooping and cinematic as her fans hoped, it didn't take the same risks with genre, or attempt an evocative narrative arc, like Lemonade did. Add on the fiery political edits of Formation, and the album's accompanying short film, and you get a work that's so much more substantial than the tidy adult-contemporary collection that took home album of the year.\n\nBeyoncé will get more chances at the top prizes, even if she has to record an album of jazz standards or pop covers to finally claim album of the year. And yet, Lemonade will never have another chance to win, and another contemporary masterpiece from a black artist is overlooked.\n\nBrutally honest rankings of every Grammy performance\n\n5 things you should know happened at the Grammys", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/01/mariah-carey-looks-back-all-want-christmas-you-25/4079789002/", "title": "Mariah Carey on 'All I Want For Christmas is You' turning 25: 'I don't ...", "text": "On Friday, \"All I Want For Christmas is You\" celebrates its 25th anniversary, marking a quarter century since Mariah Carey gifted us what's inarguably one of the best Christmas songs ever written.\n\nBut according to the pop legend, it's as if no time has passed at all.\n\n\"It's so funny, somebody was just asking me, 'What were you doing 25 Christmases ago?' \" says Carey, 49. \"I would probably say somebody was giving me a bottle and they were singing me a sweet lullaby Christmas tune.

Last Christmas Eve, it broke Spotify's then-record for the most-played song in 24 hours with 10.8 million streams.\n\nOn the singles charts, \"All I Want\" only continues to grow: Early this year, it reached a new peak of No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first holiday song in nearly 60 years to crack the Top 5, according to Billboard.\n\n\"The song is already beloved for how fun it is, but I think the internet has lifted it to cult status in a way that no other Christmas song could ever touch, past or present,\" says Abby Hamblin, an engagement editor at the San Diego Union-Tribune, where the song dominated a recent holiday music poll. \"It helps that Mariah Carey completely owns the song and doesn't shy away from all the enthusiasm around it,\" sharing throwback posts from its video and joking about her Christmas obsession on Twitter.\n\nShould it finally hit No. 1 this holiday season, \"I would be thrilled,\" Carey says. \"I wanted it to feel like a classic, but I didn't know that it was going to actually become a classic. I say that humbly because Christmas music is something that's really special to me, so to see the song's popularity grow over the years has been something that's been kind of amazing. I couldn't have expected it.\"\n\nShe was inspired by her \"dysfunctional\" childhood and love of all things Christmas\n\nComing off the success of her 1993 third album \"Music Box,\" which was No. 1 for eight non-consecutive weeks, Carey's team came to her with the idea of recording a holiday album.\n\n\"Originally, I was like, 'This is a little bit too early in my career to do a Christmas album,' \" Carey says. \"I didn't understand why it was being suggested to me.\"\n\nBut she decided to give it a shot anyway. Sharing a home with then-husband Tommy Mottola in upstate New York at the time, she recalls sitting alone at a keyboard one day and starting to play what would soon become \"All I Want.\"\n\n\"I really started with thinking, 'What are all the things I think about at Christmas?' Lights, presents, stockings, fireplaces,\" Carey says. \"I've always loved Christmas so much my entire life, but I grew up not having a lot of money and not being able to experience it like the other kids did. I wanted Christmas to be perfect, but for a lot of different reasons, it didn't always end up working out well, coming from such a dysfunctional family. So I think when I wrote it, I just put every ounce of longing for that perfect moment in it.\"\n\nBy the time she went into the studio with co-writer and producer Walter Afanasieff, she had laid out everything but the song's bridge.\n\n\"I wrote the melody and lyrics; he played and did additional writing, which is great, but it's my baby. It was my thing,\" Carey says. \"When we got together, I was like, 'You know, I think it should start out slow, and then the music should come in and sort of have a Jackson 5, Phil Spector-type moment,' if that makes sense. It was inspired by those songs from the '50s and '60s.\"\n\n\"(It's) a genius piece of music, especially from an arrangement standpoint,\" says entertainment journalist Annie Zaleski, who wrote about the song's lasting appeal for the AV Club. \"The slow tempo in the beginning creates drama and suspense, especially when paired with the festive percussion, church bells and Mariah's precise, drawn-out singing. Then when the song picks up speed, it continually layers on catchy musical elements – the backing harmonies, sleigh bells and jaunty piano – so there's always something different to latch onto via repeated listens.\"\n\nThose backup vocals are key to the song's success, Carey says.\n\n\"When I did the background vocals, that's when I had the most fun in the studio – it's the most festive part of the song,\" Carey says. \"A lot of people who have remade it don't realize how important those parts were, in the way they were sung and how I arranged them. They added more flavor and made it a complete record.\" (Although she won't name least favorite covers, she does enjoy Cee Lo Green's 2012 rendition.)\n\nShe's ringing in the holidays with 10 Christmas concerts and a family vacation\n\nCarey will commemorate the anniversary with five holiday shows at Las Vegas' Colosseum at Caesars Palace starting Nov. 22. She will then play a series of East Coast concerts beginning Dec. 7 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, continuing on in Washington, D.C., Uncasville, Connecticut, Boston, and New York.\n\n\"The Christmas shows are super festive,\" Carey says. \"I make it snow on stage – it's an extravaganza.\"\n\nAfterward, she'll head to Aspen, Colorado, with son Moroccan and daughter Monroe, 8, her twin children with ex-husband Nick Cannon. There, they typically enjoy skiing, sleigh rides, decorating ornaments and watching some of Carey's favorite holiday movies, which include classics such as \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" as well as newer fare like Netflix's \"The Christmas Chronicles\" starring Kurt Russell.\n\nThe undisputed Queen of Christmas goes to great lengths to make the holidays special for her kids, even arranging face-to-face time with Santa Claus to deliver their presents.\n\n\"Listen, Santa comes and visits us every year in a sleigh with real reindeer,\" Carey says with a laugh. \"If you don't think I of all people know Santa, then I don't know who does.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/12/18/brian-mansfield-top-five-albums-2014-taylor-swift-eric-church-miranda-lambert/20313895/", "title": "Brian Mansfield's top 5 albums of 2014", "text": "Brian Mansfield\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY's senior music writer Brian Mansfield picks his five favorites of the year.\n\n1.

She uses it often to download songs, but not as much as she used to.\n\nThere are more options now, says Maisonet, of Hoboken, N.J., such as free online radio services Pandora and iHeartRadio, music-listening on YouTube and on-demand services including Spotify and Rhapsody that let you listen to millions of complete songs for a monthly fee.\n\nMaisonet had once used iTunes as her primary source for listening to and acquiring new music. But as Apple prepares to mark the 10th anniversary of the iTunes Music Store on Sunday, it sees a radically different music landscape not as predicated on downloads.\n\nTen years ago, record stores were in full force (although hurting) and music downloading was something young folks did at pirate websites. The introduction of iTunes, where all songs were 99 cents and could be easily transferred to an iPod, made downloading mainstream.\n\n\"We thought if consumers had a great, legal way to download music, they would embrace it,\" says Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue. \"Apple was floored, as were the labels, when customers bought over 1 million songs during the first week.\"\n\nThe iTunes Store launched with 200,000 songs and now has 26 million. Within 10 years, it would become the top retailer of music, selling more music than Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy. Record store chains Tower and Sam Goody are out of business.\n\nWhen Apple reported its quarterly financial results this week, it said it sold a record $4.1 billion worth of media on iTunes, but that includes music, movies and TV shows, books and apps. In 10 years, some 25 billion songs have been sold on iTunes. Less clear is how long the music download party will continue.\n\n\"There is a major shift to how consumers consume music, and it's driven by the smartphone,\" says Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray.\n\nThe always-at-our-side smartphone — whether it be the iPhone, an Android model, or a recent BlackBerry or Windows phone — has storage for our contacts, a Web browser and the ability to listen to multitudes of songs over the air.\n\nThe iTunes store dominated by downloads \"is on its last gasp,\" says Bob Lefsetz, a former music industry lawyer and blogger at the Lefsetz Letter. \"YouTube is where most young people listen to music now.\" (More than 1 billion people visit the site each month.)\n\n\"When iTunes turns 15 years old, we won't be talking about downloads, because Apple won't be selling them,\" he says.\n\nApple until now has resisted expanding beyond downloads, saying consumers wanted to own songs, not \"rent\" them. But this year, perhaps as early as June, it is expected to unveil a personalized radio service similar to the popular Pandora (which has 200 million registered users) that would get prominent display on Apple devices.\n\nWhen the service analysts have called \"iRadio\" launches, downloads will no longer be as dominant, says Ted Cohen, a former executive with record label EMI who runs the Tag Strategic consulting firm. \"People will say, `Why didn't anyone think of this before?' Apple wasn't the first to have music downloads. But when iTunes Store launched, people acted like it hadn't been done before, because Apple did it so well.\"\n\nIn a sign of the times, Apple appears to be testing the waters for online streaming. In iTunes now, a preview of country singer Kenny Chesney's new Life on a Rock album can be listened to in its entirety online — several days before the album is available as a download sale. Earlier this year, Apple streamed new albums from Justin Timberlake and Depeche Mode.\n\nYet despite the acclaim for music services such as Spotify and Pandora, downloads still dominate how consumers obtain digital music, says Russ Crupnick, an analyst at researcher NPD Group.\n\nAccording to the worldwide music trade group, the IFPI, some $5.6 billion was spent on digital music in 2012, with downloads accounting for 80%. Revenue from music services grew from 14% in 2011 to 20% in 2012.\n\nCustomers of services such as Rhapsody (with over 1 million subscribers) and Spotify (5 million) are in major population centers, NPD's Crupnick says, and they don't care as much about owning music. Elsewhere, though, \"there are tens of millions of people who still, even if it's on a phone, still want their iTunes collection,\" he adds.\n\nNPD gives Apple a 63% market share for music download sales in the most recent fourth quarter, compared with its closest competitor, Amazon, at 22%. Last year 44 million Americans bought at least one song track or album download, a statistic that has remained stable over the last three years, Crupnick says.\n\nIn interviews along Hollywood Boulevard, music fans described a wide range of listening habits:\n\n• Allie Summerhays, a 15-year-old student from Sydney, Australia, says she buys at least one song per week from iTunes. \"I love music,\" she says. Summerhays buys more often now than she did a year ago when she didn't have an iPhone.\n\n• Nicole Miller of Los Angeles said she hasn't bought a song on iTunes for eight months, since she downloaded the Spotify app. On Spotify, \"I can pick an artist or an album, hit play and it will play all day without commercials.\"\n\n• Noni Sabriya of Long Beach, Calif., is a subscriber to Rhapsody. \"I can have anything I want at any time,\" Sabriya says.\n\n• Paula Robinson of Narragansett, R.I., says she uses iTunes as much as ever, buying at least one song every other day primarily for her two young daughters.\n\nTen years ago, Apple's most popular iPod was the largest-capacity model with 80 gigabytes of storage. Now the top seller is the 32 GB iPod Touch starting at $299. The entry-level iPhone comes with 16 GB of storage.\n\n\"If downloads were still important, we'd all need more storage,\" Lefsetz says. \"Apple knows which direction this is going.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/08/22/the-miseducation-of-lauryn-hill-anniversary-tour-tickets/70649221007/", "title": "Lauryn Hill tour will have Fugees, celebrate 'Miseducation' turning 25", "text": "Ready or not, Lauryn Hill is going back on tour!\n\nHill announced Tuesday that she will be going on a 25-year anniversary tour to celebrate her highly-acclaimed debut album \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\" which features hits such as \"Doo Wop (That Thing),\" \"Ex-Factor\" and \"Lost Ones.\"\n\nThe Fugees are co-headlining the special tour.\n\n\"'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' is and was a love song to my parents, my family, my people, my musical and cultural forebears, my teachers, my loves, my Creator.

Recently, while driving in the car with my boys, \"Down By the Water\" by PJ Harvey came on the radio. My oldest immediately began singing along. The two of them have been singing it ever since. Not only does it make me feel I am doing something right as a parent, it was a reminder of who my favorite artist of the modern era is.\n\nI clearly remember 1992 when a good friend of mine suggested I buy this new, up-and-coming artist's album \"Dry.\" I was immediately blown away after one listen. I had not heard something so original and outside the box of mainstream alternative music. The song that sold me on PJ was \"Dress.\" The composition of the song is dense and complicated, especially the drum track. However, when it all comes together, it is one of the most eery, creepy beautiful songs ever written.\n\nSo after an album that I consider to be in my top five of all time, I was nervous about the release of PJ's second album, \"Rid of Me.\" I feared the sophomore slump. What was delivered was an album even more unconventional than her debut. Through my first listen, I was a little confused at her lo-fi approach to the album's recording. It seemed I needed to turn my receiver to maximum volume just to hear the first few tracks. However, when you have Steve Albini as your producer, you never know what to expect.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nThen about halfway through the album, I hit the tracks \"50 ft Queenie\" and \"Man-Size,\" and I was almost blown out of my room. It is hard to label the album as experimental, but the differences in tone and production level are definitely there, so I will leave it up to the individual on how to label it.\n\n\"To Bring You My Love\" was her next release, and it proved to be quite commercially successful. Singles off the 1995 album included \"Down By the Water\" and \"C'mon Billy,\" arguably her two most successful singles. The rest of the album seemed fairly safe compared with the first two releases, but it was still better than most of what was being released at that time. I think this was an attempt to make a huge star out of someone who was a little reluctant.\n\nSince that release, the closest PJ Harvey has come to a big hit was \"Good Fortune\" off the \"Stories from the City, Stories From the Sea\" release in 2000. In between these two releases was an album called \"Is This Desire?\", which I happen to think is her best. Two of my favorite tracks by PJ appear on this album; \"The Sky Lit Up\" and \"A Perfect Day Elise\" show her talents as a great songwriter. The songs were too unconventional to be radio friendly, and I like how she always seemed to walk the thin line between superstardom and cult popularity.\n\nPJ Harvey has released three additional albums, all pretty unconventional. I like all of them, and I feel after all that she has done for alternative music during the past 25 years or so, she can do whatever she wants. Her last album, \"Let England Shake,\" seemed to be received with mixed reviews, but I think it was a great example of what makes PJ, PJ.\n\nOver the years, PJ has done collaborations with heavy hitters like Nick Cave and a wonderful live duet with Bjork covering \"Satisfaction\" by the Rolling Stones. She also has released two full length albums with John Parish. \"Dance Hall at Louse Point\" and \"A Woman a Man Walked By\" are maybe two of the most underrated and unheard albums in the indie world.\n\nPJ Harvey has been working on a new publicly recorded album titled \"Recording in Progress.\" The album is being performed as an art project of installation at Somerset House in London. I am dying to hear the final result, and if anyone has an extra ticket and wants to fly me to London, I would gladly accept the offer.\n\nI am happy that someone with so much talent has continued to make such a great contribution to the music world, and I hope PJ can continue to do so far into the future.\n\nThis is the opinion of columnist Jeffrey Pederson, who writes about music for Up Next.

In sheer numbers alone, the album was a phenomenon: winning one Grammy Award, spawning three top-40 singles and peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, where it spent eight months in the chart's top 10.\n\nSince then, its imprint on modern MCs has become undeniable: Kanye West himself said in Rolling Stone that it's \"the hip-hop equivalent to Stevie Wonder’s Songs in the Key of Life. It’s the benchmark you measure your album against if you’re serious.” Kendrick Lamar, too, told Complex it was the first rap album growing up he remembers \"playing in the house from top to bottom,\" and later gushed to Variety that lead single Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang contains the greatest single verse of all time.\n\n(Warning: The video below contains graphic language and content)\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSo why have fans and artists alike continued coming back to The Chronic? In short, it's an album that solidified Dre's place as one of rap's master storytellers, while also moving the needle forward for West Coast hip-hop.\n\nMuch of gangsta rap until that time was characterized by abrasive, rock-inspired beats, echoing the frequently violent lyrics they accompanied. But with The Chronic, Dr. Dre helped popularize the subgenre known as G-funk — rapping over slower, bass- and synth-laden grooves, and favoring live instruments over samples. And the samples he did use reflected a more soulful sensibility: incorporating the bluesy opening drums of Led Zeppelin's When the Levee Breaks into Lyrical Gangbang, and James Brown's Funky Drummer in Let Me Ride.\n\nWith that, verses also took on a more laid-back, lyrical cadence that came to define commercial West Coast hip-hop. That's no more evident than on hypnotic party anthem Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang featuring Snoop Dogg, who appeared on 11 of the album's 16 tracks, and quickly established himself as rap's weed-smoking poster child. (The Chronic, after all, is named for high-grade marijuana and pays homage to Zig Zag rolling papers with its cover.)\n\n(Warning: The video below contains graphic language)\n\nIn addition to Snoop, the album introduced hip-hop fans to Dre's deep bench of collaborators including Nate Dogg, Warren G, RBX and Lady of Rage — the latter of whom appeared on the record's most admittedly tasteless skit, The Doctor's Office, in which Dre feigns having sex with a \"patient.\" The misogyny of this and B****** Ain't S*** are particularly uncomfortable to revisit in 2017, given the current outcry against sexual harassment and the rapper's public admission of beating women as a young man.\n\nBut other The Chronic cuts like Little Ghetto Boy and The Day the N***** Took Over should be applauded for their searing commentary on poverty, police brutality and being black in America — a torch he carried from his F*** Tha Police days with N.W.A, and no doubt helped to inspire the scores of socially conscious rappers in present-day hip-hop.\n\nDre went on to release two more albums — 1999's 2001 and 2015's Compton — and exert his influence behind the scenes. As a formidable producer and label head of both Death Row Records and Aftermath Entertainment he's groomed talent such as Eminem, Tupac Shakur and 50 Cent. And more recently, he co-founded headphone giant Beats Electronics with Jimmy Iovine and struck a multi-billion dollar deal to sell it to Apple in 2014.\n\nBut his greatest contribution to music will always be The Chronic, which still feels as vital and revolutionary as it did 25 years ago.\n\n(Warning: The video below contains graphic language and content)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/15"}]}

And some new. Some borrowed. And some, well, red.\n\nRed\n\nBoth red and infrared, to be exact. As opposed to flashing green LEDs on the underside of the Apple Watch, the new Fitbit Ionic and most other heart-rate-monitoring wearables today, these medically-oriented fitness trackers use red light.\n\nThe LEDs flash the light into the skin, while companion sensors use changes in light reflecting back to calculate pulse rate and other metrics. Like green, red has its own set of benefits and shortcomings. But its key advantage is it penetrates much deeper into the body than green, so it can be used to derive a much richer set of vitals.\n\nSensoGram is using red and infrared light to build a compact, wireless vital-signs monitor that perches on your finger. The Plano, Texas, startup turned heads at the Connected Health Conference in Boston in late October with its new SensoScan, which measures blood pressure continuously, as well as heart rate, oxygenation and respiration.\n\nThe SensoScan looks like the pulse oximeter they clip to your finger at the doctor’s office, only without the cable and cart attached. It’s now under review by the FDA.\n\nI’ve been evaluating SensoScan for more than a month now. There are a few kinks to be worked out in the software and user interface, as with any new product. But it works. I got sick at the digital health show, of all places, and brought the SensoScan with me when I went to the doctor. We compared it to the office's big, wall-mounted equipment as well as to the gold standard: the old-school kind, which measures with a stethoscope. It passed!\n\nSensoGram is building a follow-on product that shrinks the same vitals into a ring. That’s scheduled to roll out midyear, though blood pressure may not be available at introduction.\n\nBorrowed\n\nLike startup Sensogram, Omron – a household name in blood pressure measurement – is also navigating a new line of wearable blood pressure monitors through the FDA approval process. But Omron is taking a different approach. Omron borrowed the tried-and-true pressure cuff, and miniaturized it to fit on your wrist like a smartwatch. Impressive. You should be able to buy Omron’s Project Zero 2.0 blood-pressure watch late next year, FDA willing.\n\nNew\n\nOn the heart monitoring front, startups like AliveCor are focusing on detecting irregular heartbeats, or arrhythmia, like atrial fibrillation, which can lead to stroke. AliveCor’s KardiaBand features an embedded electrocardiogram, or ECG, which is what doctors use to monitor heart activity. Kardia’s SmartRhythm software leans on the Apple Watch’s heart monitor as a first line of defense. If the app sees something suspicious, it sends an alert, telling you to record an ECG rhythm for the doc.\n\nI’ve been testing the KardiaBand for more than a week, and guess what? I got an alert. My pesky cold may also have helped me put the KardiaBand through its paces. The day after Thanksgiving, the Kardia app blinked and beeped, with a message to record an ECG, like right away. The resulting test called out possible atrial fibrillation.\n\nIf you have physicians as relatives, then you know how they hate being asked to examine you during the holidays. So you can appreciate why I held off asking my uncle, a retired cardiologist, to check out the rhythm strip printout.\n\nOf course, I eventually did ask him. He looked at the file, and said the underlying sinus rhythm looked normal. He said the symptoms likely were the result of all the cold medication I’d been swilling to chase my bug. But go see my cardiologist anyway, he said. Which, I will. I will!\n\nOld\n\nAnother startup, CardiacSense, is also tackling heart arrhythmia with its own wrist-worn device. The Israeli company says it’s found a way to produce heart data from the green LEDs and optical sensors on today’s smartwatches that’s as accurate as old-school ECG. To make its case, the company is now presenting clinical trial data to the FDA.\n\nEven so, the CardiacSense watch includes built-in ECG for reporting to physicians, because it’s what doctors are used to evaluating. So like the KardiaBand, the CardiacSense device alerts you to record an ECG rhythm at the first sign of trouble. Over time, CardiacSense founders are hopeful they can build up caregiver trust and shed the old altogether.\n\nIn the meantime, I expect 2018 to be a watershed year for tackling heart conditions and other chronic diseases with continual monitoring - during the more-than-99% of the time we’re not at the doctor’s office. That’s exciting to me. It should be for you, too.\n\nMike Feibus is principal analyst at FeibusTech, a Scottsdale, Ariz., market strategy and analysis firm focusing on mobile and IoT ecosystems for healthcare and other industries.

And in each case, the hospital relied on an automated endoscope reprocessor, or AER, to disinfect the scopes between uses, an ongoing USA TODAY investigation finds.\n\nMany of the AERs were cleared a decade ago by the Food and Drug Administration as meeting requirements that they remove 99.9999% of the bacteria the scopes might retain after being snaked down a patient's throat. Yet the FDA, which has been reviewing the scopes' infection risks for more than a year, did not approach manufacturers of the reprocessors until the past few weeks to ask for updated test data validating that the machines perform as required.\n\n\"If it turns out that hospitals are following manufacturers' instructions and (the AER) doesn't work, then shame on the manufacturers and shame on the FDA,\" says Mark Duro, who heads sterile processing operations at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston and lectures nationwide on proper reprocessing techniques.\n\nThe regulatory system must ensure that both the scopes, known as duodenoscopes, and the reprocessors are effective and compatible because they have to work in tandem to meet the FDA's safety requirements, Duro adds. \"These (scopes) are a nightmare to clean, so somebody needs to be checking that data.\"\n\nSo far, the FDA has focused its investigation mainly on the duodenoscopes themselves, aiming to determine whether the instruments' crevices trap bacteria that are passed from patient to patient.\n\nLike the AER manufacturers, the companies that make the scopes — Olympus, FUJIFILM and Pentax — also must run validation tests on their devices to ensure they are free of bacteria when cleaned according to manufacturer guidelines. The FDA requested the test results last April, and all three companies' data were found to be inadequate, FDA Chief Scientist Stephen Ostroff said in an interview. The companies were asked to try again, he said, but still have not provided acceptable results.\n\nThe FDA's examination of test data for the automatic reprocessing machines is another step in the agency's review, adds William Maisel, deputy director at the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDA has old data from testing done at the time each reprocessor was cleared for use, he adds, \"and we have requested additional validation data\" from more recent tests.\n\nWIDENING THE INVESTIGATION\n\nManufacturers of the reprocessors say their data will show that the machines are tested thoroughly — and proven effective if used precisely as directed.\n\n\"Our validations with these particular (scopes) look very strong,\" says Craig Smith, senior vice president of regulatory affairs and quality assurance at Medivators, a leading AER manufacturer. \"If you follow the instructions and do all the necessary pre-cleaning and put a scope in a Medivators AER, it's going to achieve high-level disinfection.\"\n\nThe FDA's position is less certain.\n\nIn a safety alert last month, the agency confirmed that duodenoscopes have caused infections in hospital patients \"even when manufacturer reprocessing instructions are followed correctly\" and that \"effective cleaning of all areas of the duodenoscope may not be possible.\"\n\nThe alert underscored the increasingly urgent questions about the validity of the agency's safety clearances for both the scopes and the automated reprocessors used to clean them.\n\n\"You either need a new design for the scope, which is known for being difficult to clean, or you need a better way to clean the instrument,\" says Andrew Ross, head of gastroenterology at Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle, where more than 30 patients were infected in 2013 with a CRE-related bacteria linked to contaminated duodenoscopes. Seven died within weeks of being diagnosed, followed by four more, but all had underlying illnesses that also may have contributed to their deaths.\n\nIn that case, investigators confirmed that the scopes were being brushed and cleaned properly before disinfection in a Medivators AER.\n\n\"We use equipment sold to us by device manufacturers that have been approved and evaluated by the FDA, and we have to rely on those providing oversight to make sure we have instruments that are actually safe to use on patients,\" Ross says. \"It's very clear that the current (methods) for reprocessing are not having the desired outcome.\"\n\nTHE CLEANING CHALLENGE\n\nDuodenoscopes are especially complex devices, typically used to treat blockages of the bile and pancreatic ducts in a procedure called ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which is performed about 500,000 times a year. The flexible tubes have an \"elevator\" at their tip, which controls tiny tools that can insert stents or cut away tissue, gallstones and other obstructions.\n\nThe AERs are a sort of specialized, high-tech dishwasher, pumping disinfectant through and around the scopes, and the machines are far more effective if material caked inside of the instruments is removed beforehand. AERs typically are cleared for all sorts of endoscopes — not just duodenoscopes — so there are various sets of specific guidelines for how technicians should use custom brushes to clean different models of scopes so they're free of biological debris ahead of reprocessing.\n\nBut a USA TODAY investigation revealed in January that CRE outbreaks in at least three hospitals — Virginia Mason, Advocate Lutheran in Chicago, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center — had been tied to scopes that reportedly were brushed and reprocessed as directed. Reports of more scope-related CRE cases followed, at UCLA and Cedars-Sinai medical centers in Los Angeles, the Medical College of Wisconsin and other hospitals. At each, investigations found that reprocessing was done properly.\n\nDespite the FDA's subsequent safety advisory, the agency has not sought to have the scopes pulled from use, citing the low infection threat and the scopes' importance as the safest option for treating certain digestive disorders. Since 2013, roughly 1 million people have had ERCP procedures, and the FDA has received reports of 135 related infections. (The agency acknowledges that many cases may go unreported.)\n\nBut the FDA did finalize new guidance — waiting in draft form since 2011 — that gives manufacturers more detailed instructions for how to test and validate the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection procedures for both the scopes and the AERs used to reprocess them. Agency officials also adopted a new policy that no new duodenoscopes will be cleared for use until data from those tests are submitted, reviewed and approved by the FDA.\n\nNEW DESIGNS, NEW CONCERNS\n\nThe policy changes follow a period in which increasingly complex duodenoscope designs have come into use with no FDA review of manufacturers' data to validate that they could be cleaned. One revised Olympus model was introduced in 2010 with no new FDA clearance, agency officials say, because Olympus believed the changes were too minor. The scope was sold for years before the FDA demanded a new clearance application, which remains under review while the scope still is in use.\n\n\"The (changing) endoscope designs have complicated the cleaning and disinfection process both for the user and the AER manufacturer,\" says Alicia Nakonetschny, president of Custom Ultrasonics, a leading maker of reprocessors. The more complex designs \"may allow organic debris and microorganisms to accumulate,\" she adds, so scope manufacturers must provide updated guidance on the need for additional manual brushing to ensure the devices can be reprocessed effectively.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian Hospital was using Custom Ultrasonics reprocessors when CRE cases started cropping up among patients treated with duodenoscopes in 2012. The hospital's investigators tried a different reprocessing machine, says Carlene Muto, the hospital's director of infection control, but they ultimately concluded the problem was that disinfectant from the washer was not reaching isolated crevices in the redesigned Olympus scope's elevator mechanism.\n\n\"These (AERs) probably were certified before the new scope design and I don't know that anyone would necessarily say, 'Oh, 10 years have gone by, let's recertify those washers for the scopes that are available today,' \" says Muto. \"It does seem reasonable that when there's a major change in the scope design, if you're saying the washer can clean the scope, it is important to prove that it can.\"\n\nAnd those questions don't just apply to older reprocessors.\n\nA handful of newer AER models have been cleared for cleaning scopes with far less pre-treatment and manual brushing than conventional reprocessors, but those clearances also are raising questions. When asked whether hospitals should expect the new, \"brushless\" AERs to work on duodenoscopes, the FDA's Maisel said the agency now is recommending that those scopes still should get the same rigorous brushing that would be done if they were being run through a conventional reprocessor.\n\nThe problem is that most AERs are designed to work with all sorts of endoscopes — from relatively simple devices that just guide a camera through someone's body to far more advanced instruments, such as duodenoscopes, that require much more intricate cleaning. And manufacturers are not expected to validate their reprocessors on every model of every type of scope on the market — rather, they are required to demonstrate that their devices work on a representative sample.\n\n\"I have to question whether that (generalized) testing is sufficient for something like a duodenoscope,\" says Chris Lavanchy, engineering director at the ECRI Institute, a non-profit research organization that seeks to bring sound, scientific scrutiny to medical issues. \"I think it's reasonable to assume that going forward FDA would, for example, require the (AER) validation process to specifically include testing on a duodenoscope, just because it's one of the most difficult scopes to clean.\"\n\nFollow investigative reporter Peter Eisler on Twitter @bypetereisler", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/health/lecanemab-alzheimers-drug-study", "title": "Alzheimer's disease: Experimental drug Lecanemab appears to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe experimental drug lecanemab shows “potential” as an Alzheimer’s disease treatment, according to new Phase 3 trial results, but the findings raise some safety concerns because of its association with certain serious adverse events.\n\nLecanemab has become one of the first experimental dementia drugs to appear to slow the progression of cognitive decline.\n\nThe long-awaited trial data, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, comes about two months after drugmakers Biogen and Eisai announced that lecanemab had been found to reduce cognitive and functional decline by 27% in their Phase 3 trial.\n\nA Phase 2 trial did not show a significant difference between lecanemab and a placebo in Alzheimer’s disease patients in 12 months – but the Phase 3 trial data suggests that at 18 months, lecanameb was associated with more clearance of amyloid and less cognitive decline.\n\n“In persons with early Alzheimer’s disease, lecanemab reduced brain amyloid levels and was associated with less decline on clinical measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events,” the researchers wrote. “Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Association said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomes and is further encouraged by the full Phase 3 data.\n\n“These peer-reviewed, published results show lecanemab will provide patients more time to participate in daily life and live independently. It could mean many months more of recognizing their spouse, children and grandchildren. Treatments that deliver tangible benefits to those living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s and early Alzheimer’s dementia are as valuable as treatments that extend the lives of those with other terminal diseases,” it says.\n\nClearing the amyloid\n\nThe Phase 3 trial was conducted at 235 sites in North America, Europe and Asia from March 2019 through March 2021. It involved 1,795 adults, ages 50 to 90, with mild cognitive impairment due to early Alzheimer’s disease or mild Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia.\n\nAbout half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive lecanemab, given intravenously every two weeks, and the others received a placebo.\n\nThe researchers found that participants in both groups had a “clinical dementia rating” or CDR-SB score of about 3.2 at the start of the trial. Such a score is consistent with early Alzheimer’s disease, with a higher number associated with more cognitive impairment. By 18 months, the CDR-SB score went up 1.21 points in the lecanemab group, compared with 1.66 in the placebo group.\n\n“Significant differences emerge as early as the six-month timepoint,” Dr. Christopher van Dyck, an author of the study and director of the Yale Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, said Tuesday during a presentation at the Clinical Trials On Alzheimer’s Disease Conference in San Francisco.\n\n“The lecanemab treatment met the primary and secondary endpoints,” he said.\n\nLecanemab, a monoclonal antibody, works by binding to amyloid beta, a hallmark of the degenerative brain disorder. At the start of the study, the participants’ average amyloid level was 77.92 centiloids in the lecanemab group and 75.03 centiloids in the placebo group.\n\nBy 18 months, the average amyloid level dropped 55.48 centiloids in the lecanemab group and went up 3.64 centiloids in the placebo group, the researchers found.\n\nBased on these results, “lecanemab has the potential to make a clinically meaningful difference for people living with the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and their families by slowing cognitive and functional decline,” Dr. Lynn Kramer, chief clinical officer of Alzheimer’s disease and brain health at Eisai, said in a news release.\n\nEvaluating the safety\n\nAbout 6.9% of the trial participants in the lecanemab group discontinued the trial due to adverse events, compared with 2.9% of those in the placebo group. Overall, there were serious adverse events in 14% of the lecanemab group and 11.3% of the placebo group.\n\nThe most common adverse events in the drug group were reactions to the intravenous infusions and abnormalities on their MRIs, such as brain swelling and brain bleeding called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA.\n\n“Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated. Most adverse events were infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H and ARIA-E and headache,” Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, an author of the study and professor at the Barrow Neurological Institute, said during Tuesday’s conference. He added that such events resolved within months.\n\nARIA brain bleeding was seen among 17.3% of those who received lecanemab and 9% of those in the placebo group; ARIA brain swelling was documented in 12.6% with lecanemab and 1.7% with placebo, according to the trial data.\n\nSome people who get ARIA may not have symptoms, but it can occasionally lead to hospitalization or lasting impairment. And the frequency of ARIA appeared to be higher in people who had a gene called APOE4, which can increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. ARIA “were numerically less common” among APOE4 noncarriers, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers also wrote that about 0.7% of participants in the lecanemab group and 0.8% of those in the placebo group died, corresponding to six deaths documented in the lecanemab group and seven in the placebo group. “No deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to lecanemab or occurred with ARIA,” they wrote.\n\nThe company aims to file for approval of the drug in the United States by the end of March, according to its news release. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted lecanemab “priority review.”\n\nIn July, the FDA accepted Eisai’s Biologics License Application for lecanemab under the accelerated approval pathway, according to the company. The program allows for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and “fill an unmet medical need” while the drugs are being studied in larger and longer trials.\n\nIf the trials confirm that the drug provides a clinical benefit, the FDA grants traditional approval. But if the confirmatory trial does not show benefit, the FDA has regulatory procedures that could lead to taking the drug off the market.\n\n“The FDA is expected to decide whether to grant accelerated approval to lecanemab by January 6, 2023,” the Alzheimer’s Association statement says. “Should the FDA do so, the current [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services] policy will prevent thousands and thousands of Medicare beneficiaries with a terminal, progressive disease from accessing this treatment within the limited span of time they will have to access it. If a patient decides with their health care provider that a treatment is right for them, Medicare must stand behind them as it does for beneficiaries with every other disease.”\n\n‘This is just the first chapter’\n\n“If and when this drug is approved by the FDA, it will take clinicians some time to be able to parse out how this drug may or may not be effective in their own individual patients,” especially since carriers of the APOE4 gene could be at higher risk of side effects, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, adjunct associate professor of neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine, who is not involved in studying lecanemab or its development.\n\n“While this study is certainly encouraging, how this translates to clinical practice, real-world clinical practice, remains to be seen,” he said of the Phase 3 trial data.\n\nOverall, “physicians are starving for any possible therapy out there that can help our patients. I have four family members with Alzheimer’s disease. If I have a family member that comes to me and says, ‘Should I be on this drug?’ In the right patient, at the right dose, for the right duration, with adequate and careful monitoring for side effects, yes, I would suggest that this drug is a viable option,” Isaacson said. “I would say even an important option.”\n\nHe added that the experimental drug serves as an example of the important need for personalized medicine in the United States, especially when it comes to Alzheimer’s disease, such as using genetic testing in clinical practice to identify the APOE gene to better individualize the approach to a patient’s care.\n\n“This is just the first chapter in what I hope to become a really long book in disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.\n\nMore than 300 Alzheimer’s treatments are in clinical trials, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease was first documented in 1906, when Dr. Alois Alzheimer discovered changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had memory loss, language problems and unpredictable behaviors. The debilitating disease now affects more than 6 million adults in the United States.\n\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, but there are several prescription drugs available to help manage symptoms. Last year, the FDA approved Aduhelm for early phases of Alzheimer’s disease. Before that, the FDA had not approved a novel therapy for the condition since 2003.\n\nAlthough lecanemab is being tested as an Alzheimer’s drug, it is not a cure, said Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the trial.\n\n“Both groups in the trial had worsening symptoms, but people taking the drug did not decline as much in their cognitive skills,” Spires-Jones said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre. “Longer trials will be needed to be sure that the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks.”\n\nIn general, Alzheimer’s continues to be a “complex” disease, Bart De Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute, said in a statement distributed by the Science Media Centre.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We still have a lot to learn about the underlying causes. It is therefore imperative that we continue to invest in discovery research, and through doing so, we may also identify new targets for which we can develop therapies we could use in combination with anti-amyloid drugs like lecanemab,” said De Strooper, who is a consultant for a series of pharmaceutical companies, including Eisai, but has not consulted on lecanemab.\n\n“This trial proves that Alzheimer’s disease can be treated,” he said. “I hope we will start to see a reversal in the chronic underfunding of dementia research. I look forward to a future where we treat this and other neurodegenerative diseases with a battery of medications adapted to the individual needs of our patients.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/16/fda-allows-retail-sales-hearing-aids-lower-cost-broaden-access/10336389002/", "title": "Hearing aids to be available over the counter under new FDA rule", "text": "Millions of Americans could have access this fall to less expensive hearing aids sold over the counter without a required doctor's exam and prescription.\n\nA Food and Drug Administration rule unveiled Tuesday allows retail sales of hearing aids by mid-October for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Regulators said the new rule should give millions of adults less expensive options and broaden access for those who can't afford hearing aids.\n\n\"Today, the FDA opens the door to quality, affordable hearing aids to consumers over the counter,\" Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said on a call with reporters Tuesday. \"For many Americans who suffer from hearing loss, safe and effective and high-quality hearing aids have been unaffordable.\"\n\nNearly 30 million adults have trouble hearing, but only about 1 in 5 people with hearing loss use a hearing aid. Aging, exposure to loud noises, medical conditions and other factors contribute to hearing loss. Hearing aids can help make speech and sounds louder and allow people to better communicate.\n\nThe agency estimates the new class of devices would save consumers about $2,800 for a pair of hearing aids, officials said. Some hearing aids cost more than $5,000 between the price of the device and a professional fitting. Medicare covers a diagnostic test but does not pay for the device.\n\nThe rule does not extend to children or adults with more severe types of hearing loss. People should seek medical care if they have more complex hearing loss or symptoms such as discomfort or bleeding, officials said.\n\n“Hearing loss is a critical public health issue that affects the ability of millions of Americans to effectively communicate in their daily social interactions,” said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf. “Establishing this new regulatory category will allow people with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss to have convenient access to an array of safe, effective and affordable hearing aids from their neighborhood store or online.”\n\nThe agency made changes to a proposed rule last October based on public comments from consumers, stakeholders and experts. The final rule requires retail hearing aids to lower maximum sound and to include user-adjustable volume control. The final rule also limits how deep the devices can be placed in the ear canal. Manufacturers must meet performance and device design requirements in order to sell the devices directly to consumers.\n\nCaliff said the agency evaluated safety concerns about sound output limits for the new class of hearing aids. Devices with high sound output levels could potentially jeopardize long-term hearing while devices without enough sound could be ineffective.\n\n\"We thought we hit the sweet spot on the output limit,\" Califf said.\n\nThe rule comes five years after Congress passed the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, directing the FDA to authorize the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids.\n\nNancy LeaMond, AARP executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said expanding access to affordable aids could improve overall health and quality of life for those with hearing loss.\n\n“For many Americans, the high cost of prescription hearing aids puts them out of reach, increasing their risk of isolation, depression and other health issues,\" LeaMond said.\n\nWhile the new rule could provide affordable options for millions of people with hearing loss, some urged consumers to be careful.\n\nThe Hearing Industries Association, which represents major hearing aid manufacturers, suppliers and hearing health professionals, said hearing loss is unique for each person. Most people do not know if their condition is mild, moderate, or greater, caused by another medical issue or something as simple as ear wax, the group said.\n\n\"Our suggestion is really to first see a hearing professional and have a hearing test and have some solid information about the degree of hearing loss,\" said Kate Carr, president of the Hearing Industries Association.\n\nA limited number of hearing aids are being sold directly to consumers now. Bose received FDA clearance in 2018 to sell hearing aids directly to consumers. The company discontinued its hearing aids this year and now partners with Lexie Hearing, which sells a device incorporating Bose's technology for $899.\n\nCarr said consumers must understand a hearing aid's return policies and warranties when they purchase a product. Because over-the-counter hearing aids are not sold through a licensed medical professional, any consumer protections must be enforced under state and local laws.\n\nIn January, the National Association of Attorneys General urged the FDA to ensure states' authority to enforce their consumer protection laws for the sale of consumer hearing aids. A bipartisan coalition of 43 attorneys general noted the FDA's preliminary rule included language that \"may unintentionally hinder or repeal\" state consumer protection laws.\n\nBut FDA officials said states will have full authority to enforce consumer protection laws as long as such laws don't restrict or interfere with consumers' access to the new class of devices.\n\nStates can \"enforce consumer protections for over-the-counter hearing aids,\" including laws that ensure reasonable warranty and return policies, said Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.\n\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter as @kalltucker or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/01/21/fact-check-covid-19-vaccine-nearly-20-years-making/3873247001/", "title": "Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine has been nearly 20 years in the making", "text": "The claim: The COVID-19 vaccine was developed in less than a year, but there are no vaccines against viruses and diseases that have existed for far longer\n\nIt is approaching a year since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on Dec. 8, Britain was the first Western country to begin vaccination against the virus. The rollout was followed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's emergency authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 11 and Moderna's on Dec. 18.\n\nGiven the quick scientific response to the newly emerging virus, one Instagram post is calling foul, questioning why vaccines for equally debilitating diseases, predating the pandemic, have not yet been developed.\n\nThe Nov. 30 Instagram post from author Boyce Watkins shares a screenshot of a Facebook comment alleging countless years of research effort have yielded no vaccine.\n\n\"40 years worth of research...no vaccine for HIV (sic) At least 100 years research...no vaccine for cancer (sic) Ongoing research...no vaccine for the common cold (sic) Less than a year for a covid (sic) vaccine?

Unsure of what exactly this illness was, veterinarians Arthur Schalk and Merle Hawn of North Dakota Agricultural College, now North Dakota State University, called it \"infectious bronchitis of baby chicks,\" the viral agent later named infectious bronchitis virus.\n\nFurther scientific research into IBV and recognition that it was not like influenza A, a flu virus known to cause bronchitis, would transpire over the next 30 years. In November 1968, a group of scientists wrote to the journal Nature asking for IBV, and viruses resembling it like mouse hepatitis virus discovered in 1947, to be classified as coronaviruses, a name derived from its appearance – the spike proteins casting a halo around the surface, much like the sun's corona – on electron microscope imaging.\n\nSARS was the first attempt at a human coronavirus vaccine\n\nWhile coronaviruses could cause a variety of fatal diseases in animals, the two known to infect humans were not a grave concern, as they only caused the common cold. This belief was challenged in November 2002 with the emergence of a new respiratory illness in Guandong Province, China, that would infect over 8,000 people worldwide and claim 774 lives.\n\nIn less than a month, researchers decoded the enormous genome of the new virus, which caused a disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome. Researchers concluded it was a coronavirus, likely to have jumped from animals to humans because it was only somewhat related to other known coronaviruses. (It took over 15 years of search to identify bats as the potential animal source.) By July 2003, thanks to isolating and quarantining patients, the World Health Organization declared SARS officially contained.\n\nNevertheless, fears of future seasonal SARS outbreaks called for a vaccine. SARS-CoV's spike protein was an obvious choice for a target. Prior research found the spike protein was critical in determining which species a coronavirus infected, where it preferred to hunker down – called organ or cell tropism – and disease severity. The spike protein had even been proposed as a vaccine target for canine coronavirus in 1991.\n\nA number of vaccines targeting the spike protein were designed, tested in animal models and found to be quite promising against SARS and other coronavirus illnesses like Middle East respiratory syndrome, which appeared in 2012. But further testing reached an impasse when funding declined steadily in the years following the 2003 outbreak, said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, whose team collaborated with Galveston National Laboratory to create a SARS vaccine in 2016.\n\n\"We manufactured a really great SARS 1 vaccine in the lab. We actually had a manufacturer at Walter Reed, but then we couldn't raise the money to do all the clinical testing,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nFunding was not the only issue. Testing whether a vaccine can prevent disease requires the disease to still be around. Since there have been no major outbreaks of SARS since 2003, testing vaccine efficacy was difficult. But more instrumental is interest: Few SARS or MERS cases meant pharmaceutical companies were less inclined to invest in a likely rarely used vaccine.\n\nLaying the groundwork\n\nTypically, the road to creating new vaccines is long, with many steps: Finding and developing a vaccine target (exploratory), testing it in tissue or cell cultures and animal models (preclinical) followed by three phases of clinical trials with human volunteers.\n\nIf a vaccine proves its mettle, its developers have to seek and gain approval from the FDA before manufacturing. Lastly, in phase four, quality control monitors for any possible vaccine side effects.\n\nFor vaccines to be effective, a specific target is needed. This vaccine target, also called an antigen, is typically a fragment of the disease-causing agent that instructs the immune system on how to recognize and destroy it upon contact. Searching for a suitable antigen can be an arduous process but prior coronavirus research made it all easier.\n\n\"When the Chinese put up the COVID-19 sequence on bioRxiv in January, our community of scientists looked at it and said, 'Yeah, we got this because we know how to do it.' It was all about plug and play based on all that experience,\" said Hotez.\n\nHaving a running start does not mean the testing process was accelerated, however. Hotez, whose recombinant protein subunit COVID-19 vaccine is undergoing clinical trials in India, stated the vaccine still underwent testing among a large group of human volunteers, even more than a typical trial with over 30,000 to 60,000 people.\n\nWhat accelerated the vaccine process was manufacturing.\n\n\"The two accelerants are doing the manufacturing of risk (scaling up manufacturing based on the assumption the vaccine will work, also called at-risk manufacturing) and manufacturing the vaccine in parallel with clinical trials. That's new because we usually wait for the phase three results,\" he said.\n\nSo why is there no vaccine for HIV, cancer, or the common cold?\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus, the culprit behind acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, commonly known as AIDS, is a tricky virus. Much like the novel coronavirus, HIV binds to a protein on the surface of T cells, a type of white blood cell, to enter. Once inside, HIV integrates its genetic material with its host cell's DNA, using the host's DNA replication machinery to create new viruses, which blast off to infect and kill other T cells.\n\nFinding a specific and effective vaccine target is therefore difficult, especially since HIV mutates frequently in order to mask itself from the immune system. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, common vaccine approaches using inactivated or live HIV forms have either not been \"effective in eliciting immune responses in clinical trials\" or are too dangerous to use.\n\nThe same goes for the common cold, which is caused by a smorgasbord of viruses including over 150 different types of rhinovirus, a common troublemaker.\n\n\"It's hard to create a vaccine when you have so many different viruses causing similar symptoms. To make a universal vaccine against all of them is probably pretty daunting, it might be doable, but it's daunting,\" explained Hotez.\n\nCancer, abnormal growth of the body's own cells due to unchecked genetic mutations, is no virus, but the struggle in finding a suitable vaccine target is not any easier.\n\n\"The challenge is getting antigen targets and also access because a lot of the antigens, or cancer proteins, are first inside the cell. They may not be presented to the immune system so these are much more complicated targets,\" said Hotez.\n\nAdvances in messenger RNA-based vaccine technology in recent years may help fast-track some cancer vaccines, he acknowledged. The platform, which provides the body the equivalent of a genetic assembly instruction booklet for manufacturing target-specific antibodies, has been used for rabies, influenza and Zika and is considered an attractive approach for its low cost, speed of manufacturing, potency and versatility, Nature reported.\n\nMany cancer vaccines using mRNA are in the works, like Moderna's personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, which is being tested in patients with metastatic common epithelial cancer. The Boston-based pharmaceutical company also announced on Jan. 11 it was working on an mRNA HIV vaccine with phase I clinical trials expected sometime in 2021.\n\nOur ruling: Missing context\n\nWe rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT because without additional context it might be misleading. Vaccines require specific targets against which they train the immune system. COVID-19's spike protein was identified nearly 20 years ago as a potential vaccine target during the development of the SARS vaccine, following the 2003 SARS outbreak. This has helped expedite the vaccine process, given that vaccine platform technologies have advanced in recent years, as well. Another accelerant was the commercial-scale production of COVID-19 vaccine doses prior to FDA clearance, called at-risk manufacturing, when early results appeared promising. Finding suitable vaccine targets for HIV, cancer and the common cold has been more difficult in comparison as these diseases have either elusive or highly variable targets.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The global totals: Nearly 74 million cases and 1.64 million deaths.\n\n📰 Where’s the COVID-19 vaccine? Who’s been vaccinated? Data on patients and vaccine shipments will flow through a complex network of state and federal data systems. We visualize the process here.\n\nHere's a closer look at today's top stories:\n\nAlaska health worker has strong allergic reaction to vaccine\n\nAn Alaska health care worker had a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine within 10 minutes of receiving a shot, state health officials said. As opposed to the few vaccine recipients in England who had a similar experience, the female worker in the capital city of Juneau did not have a history of allergic reactions.\n\nThe woman started feeling shortness of breath and was treated with epinephrine and other medicines for what officials determined was anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. She was kept overnight but has recovered. U.S. health authorities have warned about rare allergic reactions during the vaccine rollout.\n\nBaby bust: Pandemic may result in 500,000 fewer US births\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has not only claimed the lives of more than 300,000 Americans, but it may result in at least that many fewer babies being born. Experts say the economic and societal upheaval caused by the pandemic has led to a decline in both planned and unplanned pregnancies.\n\nThough some expected the widespread stay-at-home orders issued to control the virus would usher in a baby boom, a Brookings Institute report projects 300,000 to 500,000 fewer U.S. births in 2021.\n\nThe upcoming baby bust could have \"lasting implications for society,\" said Phillip Levine, an economics professor at Wellesley College and co-author of the Brookings report.\n\n– Wyatte Grantham-Philips\n\nPandemic taking heavy toll on LGBTQ community\n\nThe disproportionate impact of the pandemic on U.S. Black and Latino populations is commonly known. The extensive harm caused by the coronavirus on members of the LGBTQ community has garnered less attention. A report Wednesday underscores the extent of the damage:\n\n64% of LGBTQ households have experienced job losses vs. 45% of non-LGBTQ households.\n\n38% of LGBTQ households have been unable to get medical care or delayed going to a doctor for a serious problem vs. 19% of non-LGBTQ households.\n\n“What you are seeing is a reflection of disparities that existed prior to COVID being exacerbated by the pandemic,” said Logan Casey, policy researcher for the Movement Advancement Project, which produced the report based on a national poll from July and August.\n\n– Susan Miller\n\nPfizer facing vaccine manufacturing problems; Feds defend not contracting earlier for more\n\nThe leaders of Operation Warp Speed on Wednesday addressed a report in the New York Times that the Trump administration didn't secure more doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine when the option was available.\n\n\"It wouldn't make sense whatsoever to preorder more from one vaccine manufacturer than any other one before we knew a vaccine works,\" said Moncef Slaoui, who leads Operation Warp Speed.\n\nMeanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Pfizer has come up about half short of what the company expected to produce this year. Azar said Pfizer is working at \"maximum capacity\" to deliver the 100 million doses it is contracted to supply to the U.S., and that the government is looking to expand the contract in the second quarter.\n\nThe government's relationship with Pfizer is contractually different than to the ones with the other vaccine makers, Azar said.\n\n\"On the other five (vaccine makers), we are more intimately engaged in the support of the development and manufacturing of their product on an ongoing basis, whereas the relationship Pfizer wanted with Operation Warp Speed was the guaranteed purchase of vaccine if approved by the FDA,\" Azar said.\n\n886 more vaccine deliveries Thursday with 2M doses next week, officials say\n\nThe rollout of the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine has gone smoothly and 2 million more are set to be delivered next week, the leaders of the government’s Operation Warp Speed said in an update Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, 886 more deliveries will be made to locations across the United States as the country continues \"a steady drumbeat cadence of deliveries of vaccine out to the American people,\" said Gen. Gus Perna, who is heading the logistics of the vaccine distribution efforts.\n\nStarting as soon as Friday in Ohio and Connecticut, residents of long-term care facilities will begin to get vaccinated, Perna said. The efforts in long-term care centers, which house some of the most vulnerable Americans, will expand to more than 1,100 facilities by Monday and then increase by thousands a day from there, he added.\n\nPerna also described the efforts to increase distribution of the vaccine at pharmacies around the country, with 19 chains partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Through those partnerships, Perna said he expects a gradual rollout starting in mid-January that will cover 37,000 facilities.\n\nPerna said there were four trays of vaccine, two in California and two in Alabama, that dropped below the required storage temperatures when being transported. Perna said officials at the command center identified those trays and they never left the trucks. The doses were sent back to Pfizer, which along with the FDA will determine whether they are still safe and effective.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/09/19/truth-covid-19-vaccines-everything-you-need-know/8307845002/", "title": "The truth about COVID-19 vaccines. Everything you need to know.", "text": "Despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and easy access, the U.S. has fallen behind 40 other countries in getting its people fully vaccinated in a pandemic that is still raging.\n\nAbout 55% of Americans have gotten at least two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or a single shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, according to Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center. That compares with top-ranked Malta, which has fully vaccinated 83% of its population. Our Canadian neighbors have a 70% vaccination rate. China is at 72%. The UK is at 66%.\n\nAnd though the pace of vaccinations rose slightly in August, it has trended downward the last two weeks.\n\nEditorial: An appeal to vaccinated Free Press readers\n\nAt this rate, \"by the end of September, the U.S. will have the lowest vaccination level of all prosperous democracies, With the largest supply & the biggest head start,\" Andy Slavitt, who stepped down in June as senior adviser to the White House pandemic response team, said in a tweet last week.\n\nMichigan's vaccination rate lags behind the national average, with 51.4% of its population now fully vaccinated,CDC data shows.\n\nAnd that's despite a supply of coronavirus vaccines that is now abundant. Anyone 12 and older who wants a shot can get a shot. All they have to do is go to a local pharmacy, or text their ZIP code to 438829 or call 800-232-0233.\n\nDon't have a ride? The government will pay an Uber or Lyft driver to take you there. And in some communities, including Detroit, health care workers will even make a house call to bring the vaccine to you.\n\nWhat types of COVID-19 vaccines are available in the U.S.?\n\nThere are three different coronavirus vaccines widely available today:\n\nPfizer: Made in partnership with the German-based biotechnology firm BioNTech, this coronavirus vaccine is fully authorized by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for use in Americans ages 16 and older. Adolescents ages 12-15 also are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine under an FDA emergency use authorization. It is given in a series of two doses, spread three weeks apart. It is being marketed now under the brand name Comirnaty.\n\nFederal regulators have recommended a third dose for people with immune-suppressing conditions. A decision is expected next week on whether Americans ages 65 and older, along with people who are at high risk of severe disease, should also take a third dose.\n\nModerna: Available under an emergency use authorization for Americans 18 and older, the Massachusetts-based company has applied for full approval from the FDA for its coronavirus vaccine. It is given in a series of two doses, spaced four weeks apart. Federal regulators have recommended a third dose for people with compromised immune systems.\n\nJohnson & Johnson: Available through an FDA emergency use authorization for Americans ages 18 and older, the J&J vaccine, made by its Belgian-based pharmaceutical branch, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is given in a single dose.\n\nThe CDC published a study Friday analyzing the effectiveness of all three vaccines in use in the U.S. from March to August, when the more contagious delta variant was circulating.\n\nIt found the Moderna vaccine was 93% effective at preventing hospitalization and death among U.S. adults who were not immunocompromised. Pfizer's vaccine was 88% effective and J&J's was 71% effective.\n\nHow do the COVID-19 vaccines work?\n\nBoth Moderna's and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines are made with messenger RNA technology. They use a protein that mimics the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It tricks the body into mounting an immune response that will protect a person from the virus.\n\nThey do not use the live virus and cannot give a person COVID-19.\n\nThe mRNA used to make these vaccines does not affect or interact with a person's DNA or genetic material. It is quickly broken down by the body and eliminated.\n\nThe J&J vaccine is different. It is an adenovirus vector vaccine. It uses a modified cold virus that has been stripped of several of its genes. Those genes are replaced with genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which then triggers an immune response to protect a person from the virus.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine cannot multiply in the body, and it cannot give a person COVID-19. It also does not alter a person's DNA.\n\nIs the technology used to develop the mRNA vaccines brand new?\n\nNo, it's not new.\n\nThe technology has been studied and tested for decades, including in the development of vaccines for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus. It's just that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines created by Pfizer and Moderna were the first to complete the federal regulatory process and bring an mRNA vaccine to market.\n\nIn addition to using mRNA in the production of vaccines, the technology also has been used in cancer research to trigger the immune system to attack cancer cells.\n\nWhat was the approval process like?\n\nThe coronavirus vaccines were created and tested using the same process the FDA and CDC require for every vaccine in use in the U.S. today. They were not experimental.\n\nHere is how it worked:\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies first had to apply to the FDA for permission to test new vaccines to fight the novel coronavirus. The FDA evaluated those applications, and was satisfied the ideas and the technology they planned to use met its standards for quality and safety.\n\nClinical trials began next.\n\nEach company recruited thousands of volunteers for randomized, blinded and controlled trials conducted in a series of phases that expanded at each level to include more people. The trials helped scientists determine whether the vaccines worked, what the side effects were and identified the ideal dose.\n\nData from the clinical trials was then submitted to the FDA and CDC for review. Federal regulators inspected the vaccine manufacturing facilities to ensure that the companies could produce the vaccines reliably and consistently.\n\nThen, the companies each had to submit a licensing application, asking for permission to distribute and market their vaccines to the public.\n\nThe FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, made up of an independent panel of expert scientists, reviewed all the data and recommended each vaccine for emergency use authorization. The FDA commissioner signed off on the recommendations.\n\nAt that stage, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices developed recommendations for the use of each of the vaccines, establishing who should get them, the number of doses that should be given and how far apart they should be spaced.\n\nAfter the CDC committee issued guidelines for the vaccines, the CDC director approved them. They then could be injected into the arms of Americans.\n\nPfizer was the first to win an emergency use authorization in mid-December 2020. It was soon followed by Moderna and then Johnson & Johnson in late February.\n\nIn August, the FDA fully approved the Pfizer vaccine for Americans ages 16 and older. The vaccine remains under emergency use authorization for teens and tweens ages 12-15 and for a third dose for people who are immunocompromised.\n\nAn FDA committee recommended Friday that an emergency use authorization be granted for a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for people six months after the second dose if they are ages 65 and older or are at high risk for severe COVID-19 complications because of underlying health conditions such as obesity or diabetes.\n\nThe FDA commissioner, a CDC committee and CDC director must all agree before that emergency use authorization can be granted. Those steps could come as soon as next week.\n\nModerna also has applied for full authorization of its vaccine, and Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply for full approval soon.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nAll three coronavirus vaccines continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring of any vaccines in U.S. history. Both the FDA and the CDC say the benefits of being vaccinated far outweigh the risks.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects for all three vaccines are mild and tend to dissipate within one to two days. They include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, chills and fever. There also have rarely been reports of severe allergic reactions.\n\nAll three vaccines are considered safe and effective in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19, but there have been some safety concerns:\n\nJOHNSON & JOHNSON: In April, the FDA added a safety warning, saying there's an association with rare reports of thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome following vaccination. The condition causes blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets that can be life threatening. Those at highest risk for the complication are women ages 18-49.\n\nA warning also was added in July about a small increased risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome after taking the vaccine. The rare neurological condition causes the body’s immune system to damage nerve cells, and can lead to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.\n\nIn August, warnings were added that the vaccine also could trigger tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nPFIZER & MODERNA: In June, the CDC vaccine advisory committee reviewed reports of heart inflammation among teens and young adults after they were immunized with either a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices acknowledged there likely is an association with myocarditis and pericarditis among 12- to 39-year-olds following vaccination.\n\nThe complication is more likely to occur in boys and young men, and the condition is most likely to appear within the first five days after vaccination. Most who developed the heart complication post-vaccination have made full recoveries.\n\nAnyone can report side effects to the federal government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System by calling 800-822-7967 or online at vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.\n\nDo the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks?\n\nYes. Unvaccinated people are 4.5 times more likely to be infected with coronavirus compared with fully vaccinated people. They also are over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 and 11 times more likely to die of the disease, said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.\n\nThe data comes from a new study of case rates, hospitalizations and deaths from the virus among more than 600,000 people in 13 states from April 4-July 17, when the highly contagious delta variant was circulating in the U.S.\n\nThe study, Walensky said, \"offers further evidence of the power of vaccination.\"\n\nWhile a very tiny percentage of people have had complications from vaccination, 1 in every 500 Americans has died of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. It was the third leading cause of death in the month of August and has now infected more than 41.8 million people and killed more than 668,000 in the United States.\n\nThe virus also can cause little understood long-term complications that can be disabling and last four or more weeks after the initial infection. Known as long COVID or post-COVID syndrome, it can affect every major organ system and can include fatigue, pain, brain fog, difficulty breathing, cough or shortness of breath, headache, heart palpitations, dizziness and more.\n\nScientists know the vaccines work at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Comparatively, the risk of serious side effects from any of the vaccines is extremely small.\n\nAmong 1 million women ages 18-49 who received the J&J vaccine, seven developed blood clots with low platelet count, according to the CDC. The incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome among Americans 18 and older who got the J&J vaccine is estimated to be about 1.5 in 100,000.\n\nFor those who took the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, cases of serious heart inflammation — myocarditis or pericarditis — have been reported at a rate of 12.6 per million people within 21 days after a second dose of a vaccine, though some cases have also been reported after the first dose as well.\n\nAnaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, has occurred in 2 to 5 people per 1 million who get a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S.\n\nWhat are the religious objections to the vaccines?\n\nVery few religions are opposed to COVID-19 vaccines as a matter of doctrine.\n\nTraditionally, Christian Scientists have rejected the use of vaccines; most of its members rely on prayer for healing and have sought religious exemptions from vaccine mandates.\n\nHowever, the church issued a statement on its website, saying that members \"are free to make their own choices on all life-decisions, in obedience to the law, including whether or not to vaccinate. These aren’t decisions imposed by their church.\"\n\nSome members of the Dutch Reformed Church also oppose vaccines, believing they interfere with God's will. But that isn't an absolute, either. Some members also view the vaccines as gifts from God, according to a review of religious objections to vaccines from Vanderbilt University.\n\nCatholics have some objections, too.\n\nIn early March, Michigan's seven Catholic bishops, including Archbishop Allen Vigneron of the Archdiocese of Detroit, called the J&J vaccine \"more morally problematic\" than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\n\nThat's because J&J \"utilized in the design, production, development, and confirmatory testing a cell line that originated from tissue taken from an aborted baby,\" and abortion violates Catholic doctrine.\n\nThe bishops urged the state's Catholic faithful to take Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccines instead, and to only take the J&J vaccine \"if there are no other alternatives.\"\n\nWhy isn't natural immunity just as good as a vaccine?\n\nWhile a person who contracts coronavirus is likely to develop antibodies that should provide some protection from reinfection for at least a little while, it's unclear how long that protection will last.\n\nThe CDC urges everyone, including people who've already had COVID-19, to get vaccinated. The federal agency published a study in August that analyzed coronavirus reinfections from May to June among hundreds of fully vaccinated people and unvaccinated people in Kentucky.\n\nIt found that those who were unvaccinated were more than twice as likely to be reinfected with the virus than fully vaccinated people were.\n\n“If you have had COVID-19 before, please still get vaccinated,” Walensky, the CDC director, said in a statement. “This study shows you are twice as likely to get infected again if you are unvaccinated. Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you, especially as the more contagious delta variant spreads around the country.”\n\nIf you had the virus and were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, the CDC recommends waiting 90 days before getting a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nWho should get a booster shot?\n\nFor now, federal regulators have not approved COVID-19 vaccine boosters for the majority of Americans.\n\nHowever, the CDC urges some people to get another shot. Anyone who had a two-dose series of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines who has a moderately to severely compromised immune system should get a third dose, the CDC advises.\n\nThat's because people who are immunocompromised might not build up the same level of immunity from the vaccines as healthier people.\n\nThe recommendation for a booster includes people who:\n\nAre being treated for tumors or cancers of the blood.\n\nReceived an organ transplant and are taking immune-suppressing medication.\n\nReceived a stem cell transplant in the last two years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system.\n\nHave moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency, such as DiGeorge syndrome or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.\n\nHave advanced or untreated HIV infection.\n\nAre undergoing treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress immune response.\n\nOn Friday, the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted to recommend a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for Americans ages 65 and older and for people who have other underlying health conditions that put them at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Those conditions include diabetes and obesity.\n\nThe third dose for that population would fall under an emergency use authorization and would be recommended six months after the second Pfizer dose. FDA officials are also considering whether to include in the recommendation that health care workers and other front-liners who are at high occupational risk of exposure to the virus get a third dose.\n\nBut there are still some hurdles it has to jump before that recommendation goes into effect. It first must be approved by the FDA director. It also must be reviewed by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which meets Wednesday.\n\nIf the CDC director signs off on the recommendation, a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine could win an emergency use authorization as soon as next week for those 65 and older, people with underlying health conditions, and, potentially, front-line workers.\n\nFederal authorities also are investigating whether people who took the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines should get another dose, but so far, no recommendations have been made.\n\nWhat we don't know\n\nThere's so much scientists are still learning about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, how to treat it and why it seems to cause severe symptoms in some people but not in others.\n\nBecause the virus is mutating, every new strain of the virus brings with it new questions and concerns. Some variants, like the delta strain, are more transmissible than others. Scientists worry that as the virus continues to spread, new variants will emerge that could evade the current tests or render the vaccines and treatments ineffective. Such a strain could be deadlier as well.\n\nThat's one of several reasons why doctors and health officials urge as many people as possible to get vaccinated. Immunizing more people will reduce the rate of infection and thereby cut the chances the virus has to mutate.\n\nBecause the coronavirus vaccines have been on the market for less than a year, some people who've yet to get vaccinated say they are concerned about potential long-term effects.\n\nWhile there aren't studies yet showing their safety over a long period of time, the CDC says serious side effects that could cause long-term health problems are extremely unlikely for the COVID-19 vaccines, as they are for any vaccine.\n\nThat's because side effects from any vaccination are most likely to occur within six weeks after getting a shot, the CDC reports.\n\nHow can I learn more?\n\nTo compare the data about the three COVID-19 vaccines available now in the U.S., and weigh the risks and benefits of getting a shot, go to: https://bit.ly/3zvOYrf.\n\nHow can I get a COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nText your ZIP code to 438829.

Also, Theranos did not adequately look into whether the small containers might obscure the clotting of blood, the FDA said.\n\nThese complaints were among 14 \"observations\" the FDA listed in two Form 483 reports compiled after visits to Theranos facilities between late August and mid-September. The agency publicly posted the findings after Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by The Arizona Republic and other media outlets.\n\nWalgreens halts expansion of Theranos bloodwork centers\n\nThe issues cited generally focus on matters involving the handling of customer complaints and the vetting of suppliers, and taken in total would appear to describe a company that doesn't have the level of back-office rigor one might expect of a $9 billion firm. In some instances, the FDA inspectors noted that while Theranos officials attempted to fix some of the problems raised during the inspections, they way they did so didn't meet the agency's standards.\n\nIn one section, the inspectors wrote: \"Specifically, you undertook several corrections of your Quality Management System procedures and records without documenting the investigations or causes of the non-conformities, the actions needed to correct or prevent recurrence of similar quality problems, the verification or validation of corrective actions, and the dissemination of information about the quality problems to responsible parties.\"\n\nTheranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, 31, who owns half the company, has been adamant about her desire to work with the FDA as it goes about vetting the new company, citing the FDA's approval earlier this year of its innovative and low-impact blood draw as well as its approval for Theranos labs to test for the herpes simplex 1 virus.\n\nA blog post on the company's website earlier this month emphatically noted that its nanotainer \"has already been cleared by FDA for use with our HSV-1 test. FDA had to review and clear all our proprietary systems, including the nanotainer tubes, in order to clear even this one test. Why? Because we’re innovative. Because we are doing things differently. Now we’re working with them on clearance of just the nanotainer tubes across all tests. But it’s the same tube. We’ve already met their rigorous standards in our first submission on our systems, and we’ll continue to do so.\"\n\nNow no doctor's note needed for blood test in Arizona\n\nWhile the FDA Form 483 is not as serious as a warning letter, it does shed light on hurdles the secretive company is facing as it attempts to reinvent the blood-testing industry that has long been dominated by companies such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. Holmes, who dislikes needles, has repeatedly stated that she dropped out of Stanford University to start Theranos out of a mission to make blood testing both easier and cheaper so as to encourage consumers to more closely monitor their own health without the need for a doctor's prescription.\n\nTheranos has enjoyed a long honeymoon period as it has built up its coffers (some $400 million in funding) and staff (which includes a range of well-known politicians and former military officials). But it has come under intense scrutiny of late after a Wall Street Journal report quoted unnamed former employees who questioned the efficacy and reliability of the company's proprietary equipment. At every turn, Holmes has strongly rebutted the report as being inaccurate and has insisted the company is eagerly working with federal officials, doing so both in blog posts and in person during an appearance at the Journal's tech conference last week.\n\n“If someone’s writing anything, they are writing FDA submissions, and that’s our full-time job right now,” Holmes said at the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif.\n\nOn Monday, Holmes appeared at a conference sponsored by the Cleveland Clinic, where she said Theranos would begin publishing the results of tests that spoke to the accuracy and reliability of its testing methods. “Data is a powerful thing because it speaks for itself,” she said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter: @marcodellacava", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/18/feds-limit-research-marijuana-medical-use/31547557/", "title": "Feds limit research on marijuana for medical use", "text": "Jayson Chesler and Alexa Ard\n\nNews21\n\nResearch on marijuana’s potential for medicinal use has been hampered for years by federal restrictions, even though nearly half of the states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana in some form.\n\nAn analysis by News21 shows that $1.1 billion of the $1.4 billion that the National Institutes of Health spent on marijuana research from 2008 to 2014 went to study abuse and addiction. Only $297 million was spent on its effects on the brain and potential medical benefits for those suffering from conditions like chronic pain. News21 is a Carnegie-Knight national student reporting project based at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.\n\n“We don't have new things to treat for pain,” Dr. Todd Vanderah, chief of pharmacology at the University of Arizona, said. “We're still dealing with narcotics that have been around for thousands of years, and it's led to this issue of people abusing drugs, and the rise of heroin.”\n\nSome parents with children suffering from seizures want to try using medical marijuana to treat their children more effectively than currrent medicine has been able to. But the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any marijuana-based medicines for seizures.\n\n“We know it will help our children or potentially give them a better quality of life,” said Heather Shuker, the mother of a child with Dravet syndrome, a form of epilepsy. “We’re being denied that because they (federal agencies and doctors) don't know the long-term side effects of medical cannabis.”\n\nAmphetamines and similar stimulants, typically prescribed as Adderall or Ritalin, are used to treat attention deficit disorder despite their potential to be addictive. “I was diagnosed with ADD when I was a kid. They gave me Ritalin and that was just a really bad thing,” said Jason Mac Adam, a medical marijuana patient in Hawaii. “I ended up becoming a meth addict. … I’ve used medical marijuana to help me get away from my meth addiction, as a medication to get me away from my anxiety.”\n\nYet researchers like Vanderah have faced challenges getting federal approval and funding to study marijuana’s potential medical uses for these and many other conditions. “The progress is a little limited because research is done based off of grants that have been harder and harder to get,” Vanderah said.\n\nAlthough medical and even recreational marijuana use has been increasingly legalized by states, the federal government still classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug — along with heroin and ecstasy — defining it as having potential for abuse and no medical benefits.\n\nThe approval process for doing any kind of research on marijuana is lengthy and difficult, with the FDA, Drug Enforcement Agency and National Institute on Drug Abuse all playing a role in allowing an approved researcher access to federal funding and federally-provided marijuana.\n\n“It took me three years from the time I got funding to the time I could enroll my first subject,” Dr. Mark Wallace, a researcher studying pain treatments at the University of California-San Diego, said. “Once we got approval it wasn’t that hard to do, as far as getting the marijuana.”\n\nFewer than 1,000 NIH-supported research projects studied marijuana for purposes other than abuse or addiction in the last seven years. University-backed researchers and a few larger companies have been able to use their own funding, rather than grants from the NIH, and their own advanced laboratories to study marijuana and cannabinoids — the chemicals found within it — as potential treatments for conditions such as seizures and breast cancer pain.\n\n“I think in the near future we’re going to see (research) get easier and easier to do,” Wallace said. “I don’t see how the federal government is going to continue to put so many restrictions on it.”\n\nSPENDING DISPARITY\n\nNews21 analyzed federally funded drug research projects from 2008 to 2014 using the NIH’s publicly available database. The $1.1 billion the agency spent to study marijuana abuse and addiction was $200 million more than what the organization spent on research into crystal meth, a highly addictive stimulant that the DEA has called an epidemic.\n\nWhile NIH spent $297 million on grants for non-abuse research of marijuana, it provided two to four times as much for similar research of opiates and benzodiazepines, including drugs such as Xanax, according to the News21 analysis. Opiates are the narcotics that Vanderah said can cause prescription drug dependency or even heroin abuse.\n\nThe research on marijuana abuse and addiction was largely, but not exclusively, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a branch of NIH. The research covered subjects including how parents can prevent substance abuse and studies of cannabis-use disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association calls a problematic pattern of marijuana use.\n\nMore federal money was spent researching potential marijuana abuse than on abuse of amphetamine and ketamine (an anesthetic sometimes used as a club drug), despite those drugs' histories of recreational use.\n\n\n\nResponding to questions about research spending, Mahmoud ElSohly, the director of NIDA’s marijuana program, said that the agency’s job is to fund abuse and addiction research, and that other NIH branches should be funding other kinds of research.\n\n“It’s not that NIDA would take it upon itself to investigate the medical aspects of cannabis,” ElSohly said. “It's not the charge of NIDA. It's the charge of other institutes within the NIH to investigate the use of cannabis.”\n\nBut the other parts of the NIH have not funded much marijuana research. A National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke spokesperson said that most NIH grants were based on what peer reviewers thought was the most promising science.\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health, for example, has spent just $48 million on medical-marijuana research despite states approving it to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet the NIMH gave grants totaling $91 million for ketamine research — largely to treat depression — and almost $120 million for amphetamine research, to treat attention disorders.\n\nSimilarly, despite several states’ approval of marijuana and cannabinoids to treat epileptic seizures, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke spent just $38 million through 2014 researching the potential effects of marijuana, compared with almost $100 million spent on opiate research, largely to treat different kinds of pain. Researchers said that number is expected to increase this year as more work is done on cannabidiol — a major chemical in marijuana that doesn’t have psychoactive effects — and seizures.\n\nPOT CONSIDERED SCHEDULE 1 DRUG\n\n\n\nIn 1970, Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act, which created one piece of federal law classifying all drugs. The law organized drugs into schedules based on their potential for abuse, status in international treaties and medical benefits.\n\nMarijuana was temporarily designated as Schedule 1, but President Richard Nixon created a commission to do a review of the drug to determine if it should keep the most restrictive scheduling. The commission’s findings from research projects and public polls made up almost 4,000 pages of reports and technical papers published in four volumes in 1972. It concluded that marijuana should not be criminalized, and suggested rescheduling the drug. But Nixon decided otherwise.\n\nOne hundred sixty substances have been removed, added or transferred from one schedule to another since the Controlled Substances Act went into effect.\n\nInvestigators working with Schedule 1 drugs need an additional level of clearance from the DEA, also created during the Nixon administration to enforce the laws of the Controlled Substances Act and to regulate the use of controlled substances. Wallace, the doctor at UC-San Diego, cited five separate state and federal groups that sent him requests before he received approval for his research on how different doses of marijuana might be used to treat pain.\n\nIf marijuana were to be reclassified as a Schedule 2 drug, which would mean it has a federally accepted medical use, researchers would no longer need clearance from the DEA to work with it.\n\n\n\n“The Schedule 1 designation makes it challenging,” Wallace said. “I think if they move it to Schedule 2, it’s going to get a lot easier to research.”\n\n\n\nThat change is easier said than done, according to Matthew Barden, a DEA spokesman. “A lot of people in the marijuana debate say to just put it under a different schedule. But in order to do that, the FDA would have to change everything.” Barden said. “So we, the DEA, can’t just put something in Schedule 2. That would be a violation of how things are scheduled.”\n\n\n\nRescheduling can be done by congressional or administrative action. A few bills have been proposed in Congress, but they’ve all died in committee.\n\nThe administrative route involves more steps and more agencies. To get the ball rolling, a petition must be filed by an interested outside party or by the secretary of Health and Human Services. The attorney general reviews the petition, then sends it back to HHS to request scientific and medical evaluation by the FDA.\n\nFindings and recommendations from HHS are reported to the attorney general, who then makes the decision whether to proceed, often in consultation with the DEA. The DEA and FDA have the power to deny the petition if there is not sufficient scientific and medical evidence. If the attorney general can go forward, the White House then decides if the rule could have economic effects or raises important policy issues.\n\nAPPLYING TO RESEARCH\n\nEven when researchers are cleared to do federally funded marijuana research, they must obtain their marijuana from a farm at the University of Mississippi operated under the authority of NIDA. The farm is nestled in the eastern portion of the 640-acre Ole Miss campus, a short distance from the stadium where the Rebels play football.\n\n\n\nThe heavily secured farm is surrounded by fences, guard towers and vaults. The sprawling 12-acre, marijuana farm, with its growing room, is the only federally sanctioned marijuana grow in the country.\n\n“The National Institute on Drug Abuse is the only agency that is allowed under the federal law ... to actually be in charge of the manufacturing and distribution of cannabis for any purpose,” ElSohly said. “We at the University of Mississippi, we're acting as the agent for the government to carry out that function.”\n\nBefore researchers can obtain marijuana and start their studies, they need three things: an approved investigational new drug application from the FDA, a letter of approval from NIDA and a Schedule 1 clearance from the DEA.\n\nDEA approval is needed for possessing and transporting the marijuana and researchers must prove they have a secure facility to store and keep track of the marijuana. Once they have both FDA and DEA approval, researchers can contact NIDA to obtain their marijuana.\n\nOutside of the University of Mississippi’s contract with NIDA, ElSohly said he and the other researchers at Ole Miss also are conducting marijuana research of their own. Even though federally approved marijuana is right outside their door, they have to go through the same application process as everyone else.\n\nWith a new $68.8 million contract, however, NIDA plans to help marijuana researchers by producing and growing products at the Mississippi farm that more closely mimic what dispensaries are selling to medical marijuana users.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The products were quite limited, as far as what we could get from them (before),” Wallace said. “Now, the NIH is coming out with a lot of different products for research, as far as oils, extracts and different strains that have different levels of THC (the psychoactive cannabinoid in marijuana) versus CBD.”\n\nNIDA’s marijuana grow at Mississippi is producing more varieties of marijuana that should be similar to medical marijuana in the states that have approved it, ElSohly said. It’s also growing 30 times more marijuana than it did under its last contract with NIDA, two signs that researchers and NIH branches are requesting much more marijuana for medical studies.\n\n\n\nLIMITS OF CURRENT RESEARCH\n\nLimited grant availability to fund those requests means that researchers need the backing and funding of a major university — as Vanderah has with Arizona or Wallace has with UC-San Diego — or business investors. Britain-based GW Pharmaceuticals has turned investor funding into marijuana research advances in the United States. Its British base allows GW to work with marijuana grown in its greenhouse in the United Kingdom.\n\n“We’ve got a full pipeline of products that are in the clinics, that have gotten through the preclinical steps,” said Steve Schultz, GW’s vice president of investor relations. “We’re looking at cannabinoids in a very large number of different therapeutic areas.”\n\nAmong those products are Sativex, a full-plant marijuana extract with both THC and CBD, and Epidiolex, a purely CBD extract. While Sativex is approved for multiple sclerosis patients in 27 countries, it is not approved in the United States. Epidiolex is still in clinical studies.\n\nGW extracts the marijuana’s cannabinoids in the company’s greenhouses in Britain, so only the finished Sativex or Epidiolex products enter the U.S. It still needs DEA licensing to bring marijuana-based products into the country, but it has total control over the quality of marijuana.\n\n“I think having a significant amount of variability in these medical marijuana products is a problem for research,” Schultz said. “It doesn’t result in research that has the required level of integrity because the product itself that you’re testing tends to be different every time you test it.”\n\nAny differences from one cultivation to another have the biggest impact on whole-plant marijuana, Schultz said, which is why the company works only with extracts. Very little information about the quality and properties of federally provided marijuana was given to U.S. researchers in the past.\n\nWhile marijuana-based medicine is still in its early stages, Vanderah emphasized that it’s no different than the development process for other medications.\n\n\n\n“I think that we are today where we were with narcotics 30 or 50 years ago,” Vanderah said. “I hope that we can advance the cannabinoid field much quicker with all that research we've done for the last 100 years on narcotics.”\n\n\n\nFUTURE OF RESEARCH\n\nCongress could play a major role in speeding up the marijuana research process. Legislators have crafted bills that would recategorize marijuana to Schedule 2 — which would ease some steps of the research approval process — and create federal marijuana grows beyond the one in Mississippi.\n\nHHS removed the mandatory public health services review from the marijuana research approval process to reduce the number of approval steps for marijuana research.\n\nParents campaigning for a form of CBD to treat their children’s seizures already have made strides in attracting public attention to marijuana research. Vanderah said that research and treatments with CBD should pave the way for future research because it proves that marijuana-based medicine can really work.\n\n\n\n“If you have your own child that's having 100 seizures per day and then they take some of this and it stops, you’ll look at it very differently,” Vanderah said. “They look at it as a medication, instead of how we always think of something like marijuana.”\n\n\n\nWallace, Vanderah and Schultz predicted future development in areas like multiple sclerosis, dementia, Lou Gehrig’s disease and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy , a condition that cuts the flow of oxygen in infants. To treat such a wide variety of conditions, researchers are going to have to look at marijuana in many different forms — not just the extracts that companies like GW work with, Wallace said.\n\n“I think what we’re going to find is a wide range of patient preferences, so we can’t think that we can just do away with the leaf and just extract it,” Wallace said. “It needs to be available in a wide range of products.”\n\nJayson Chesler is a Reynolds Fellow.

During this time, we will also conduct careful review of the agency’s overall structure and operations to ensure we are positioned for the future of public health, with a strong focus on the agency’s core capabilities – data modernization, laboratory capacity, public health workforce, health equity, rapid response to disease outbreaks, and preparedness within the US and around the world.\n\n“The work we do will not only inform what we can do during a pandemic, but also what we do during normal operations to ensure our science reaches the public in a timely and implementable manner. The strength of this agency comes from the people who work at CDC. Since the director’s arrival, she has heard from many employees and external experts that they would like to see CDC build on its rich history and modernize for the world around us – this effort will lean into the hard work of transforming CDC for the better.”\n\nOf the 16 people interviewed for this story, one is a senior federal official, one is a senior CDC official, and two are senior CDC physicians, and CNN granted those four anonymity given longstanding norms about government employees speaking to the media. The others were willing to be named: eight former senior-level CDC officials, including two past directors of the agency, and four outsiders who have worked with the CDC.\n\nThe senior CDC official said “data collection” for the review will take a month, and “synthesizing it and determining what the plan is” will take longer.\n\nWhatever the timeline, a CDC review is clearly a complex undertaking, given the agency’s size and the breadth of its mission.\n\n“It’s really hard to slice and dice an organization like the CDC to get everything into alignment,” said Dr. Nancy Cox, who served as chief of the CDC’s influenza team from 1992 to 2014.\n\nStill, she and others hope the review will be a starting point for finding solutions to problems, many of which have plagued the agency long before Covid-19.\n\n1. Get CDC scientists out of their silos\n\nThe CDC is huge: 13,000 employees spread across campuses in nine states and Puerto Rico, working in more than 10 centers – one for injury prevention, for example, and another for immunization and respiratory diseases.\n\n“CDC is notoriously siloed in its organization,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a vaccine adviser to the CDC for 40 years. “Everyone is so involved in their own matters that there is very little cross-fertilization and conversation.”\n\n“They care about their little potted plant, if you will, their budget line, and not about the broader public health issue,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, who served as director of the CDC from 2009 to 2017.\n\nCultivating one’s “potted plant,” as Frieden put it, might work when there’s not an emergency, but he and others say it hinders the agency when it needs to move quickly.\n\n“I think [the CDC] is pretty good in peace time,” said Andy Slavitt, who worked with the agency as temporary senior adviser to the White House’s Covid-19 response team from January to June last year. But he said the agency needs “a less contemplative, more practical approach during wartime.”\n\nFrieden and others recommended that the CDC send certain staffers to work in state or local health departments for a period of time because those offices are the ones that carry out much of the public health work during a crisis and receive about 70% of the CDC’s domestic funding.\n\n“There are so few people who’ve spent a lot of time in the state and local, especially local and city health departments [and] that’s really quite a major issue,” said Frieden, who was health commissioner for New York City before he became director of the CDC.\n\nDr. Arthur Reingold, a former assistant chief of the CDC’s Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch, agreed that sending CDC staff to local health departments was crucial.\n\n“I have worked in a local county health department. I have worked in a state health department. I have worked at CDC,” Reingold said. “Many of the people at the CDC, however smart they are, have never worked in a state or local health department. They’ve grown up, if you will, with the best academic training, [and] they’ve ended up at the CDC. They have expectations about state [and] local health department partners, but they have no experience working in those agencies and understanding the challenges and complexities that are there, and I think that perspective is badly needed.”\n\nThe senior CDC official said agency officials do go out to work in health departments “but not at the level that I think others would hope” and that structural changes would have to be made to allow it to happen more often.\n\n“You can’t just pluck an MD from here and stick them there,” she said. “We have to create a system to make this happen.”\n\n2. Practice for a pandemic\n\nIt was January 2007, and Dr. Stephen Redd, a retired rear admiral with the US Public Health Service, had never felt so grateful for an ice storm.\n\nIt was a CDC pandemic practice event, a military-like exercise in which, for 24 hours at the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta, hundreds of staffers pretended there was a pandemic and played out what needed to be done to stop the dangerous pathogen.\n\nThe exercise went so poorly that Redd said he was relieved when an ice storm forced everyone to go home and end the exercise early.\n\n“You could kind of feel the wheels were coming off the car during [the exercise],” he said. “We were not ready.”\n\nWhen the ice storm hit, “I remember thinking that was good that we were able to stop the exercise because it was about to blow up,” added Redd, who worked at the CDC from 1985 to 2020 and served as the CDC’s deputy director for public health service and implementation science.\n\nThere have been many more pandemic exercises since 2007, and the agency’s readiness has improved over the years, Redd said. The senior CDC official said the exercises have continued during the pandemic.\n\nCox, the former CDC flu chief who spent nearly 40 years at the agency, said the exercises were helpful not just for the practice but also because they allowed managers like her to observe staffers and identify who worked well under pressure.\n\n“You have to have a clear idea of how people are going to behave under a lot of stress, because a pandemic, especially one like Covid, is extremely high-stress,” she said. “Some people simply don’t work well under a lot of stress. You need to have a clear idea of how much of the firehose they can drink from.”\n\n3. Learn to ‘keep it simple, stupid’\n\nImproving the CDC’s communications was high on the list of every one of the 16 experts interviewed for this story. They said the agency must learn how to communicate with real people – not other doctors, not epidemiologists, not people with Ph.D.s in zoology or biostatistics, but real people.\n\nA senior CDC physician said Walensky asked Macrae, the HHS official leading the review, to specifically address communications during the pandemic in his review.\n\n“How did we handle things?” the physician asked.\n\nFor the sources interviewed by CNN, the answer was not well.\n\nThe senior federal official gave the CDC a grade of “D” for its communication during the pandemic.\n\n“We weren’t nearly as consistent as we needed to be in both the timing and the frequency of providing information that the public needed,” the official said.\n\nSeveral sources said it’s ironic the CDC had messaging problems during Covid, given that the agency taught the world how to communicate during a pandemic.\n\nStarting in 1996, the agency published what is now called “The CDC Field Epidemiology Manual,” which has a chapter on communicating during an outbreak. There’s also the CDC’s “Crisis and Emergency Risk Communications” manual, which was first publishsed in 2002.\n\n“It’s so odd, because CDC literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency – literally,” said Frieden, the former CDC director.\n\n“I don’t know what happened,” added Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, co-editor of the field epidemiology manual, who worked at the CDC for 20 years, including as director of the Division of Public Health Information Dissemination.\n\nAs an example of poor communication during Covid-19, a different senior CDC physician pointed to “horrible” CDC messaging to immune-compromised people about how many vaccine shots they need.\n\nThe doctor treats immune-compromised patients who “didn’t get it” that they needed more shots than other people.\n\n“It was just sh*tty. I have all these immune-compromised patients, and they didn’t understand it because we didn’t do a good job communicating it,” the physician said.\n\nMany pharmacies also didn’t understand the CDC’s directive and turned away immune-compromised people who needed extra shots.\n\n“This was a good example where we needed a spokesperson who could be all over the media and be on webinars with pharmacy organizations and Walgreens and CVS and explain all of this over and over,” the physician said.\n\nWhen the CDC did communicate with immune-compromised people, it was often in technical and confusing language. In January, a CDC website for immune-compromised people stated, in part, “After completing the primary series, some moderately or severely immunocompromised people should get an additional primary shot. Everyone 12 years and older, including immunocompromised people, should get a booster shot. If you are eligible for an additional primary shot, you should get this dose first before you get a booster shot.”\n\nAlthough that exact language is no longer on the CDC’s website, it still contains references to technical terms and includes no fewer than six footnotes.\n\n“There’s this misunderstanding among CDC scientists sometimes that if ‘I write a document and post it to the web, it will happen.’ That’s called hubris,” the doctor said.\n\nThe doctor added that CDC scientists are sometimes disdainful of simple messaging, even when it’s effective.\n\n“The media is excellent at communicating messages to the public, but some of the scientists say those are dumbed down too much, and I say to them, follow the principles of KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid,” the physician said.\n\nThe senior CDC official said messaging on fourth shots “is a very good example” of agency communication that wasn’t as good as it should have been.\n\n“That’s exactly what I’m talking about, which is, how do you translate science to practice? And I think that’s an area where we’re going to need some feedback and some recommendations of how we can do that better,” she said.\n\n4. The CDC needs to regain its voice\n\nThe federal official said the reason they gave the agency a D grade on communications is in large part because the White House, under both Biden and Trump, had a “stranglehold” on the CDC, making it difficult for the agency to communicate effectively.\n\nSeveral sources said a glaring example of this stranglehold happened August 18, when President Biden announced that “we’ll be ready to start” booster shots the week of September 20, even though there had been no review – or at least no publicly available review - of the science to see whether boosters even worked.\n\nBiden did preface the comment by saying that boosters would be made available “pending approval from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC’s committee of outside experts,” but sources for this story said it seemed clear the President was prejudging what the scientific data would show on the boosters. Less than two weeks later, two high-level FDA officials announced their retirement amid reports that agency scientists were angry about Biden’s announcement.\n\nThe sources interviewed by CNN said they were concerned that incidents like this engendered mistrust among Americans who didn’t like Biden to begin with – and that this was exactly the group that was hesitant to get vaccinated.\n\nThey said Americans who don’t trust the President would be more likely to listen to CDC scientists rather than to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, or to Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, who might be suspected as being too political.\n\n“Some messages are best heard not coming from the White House because a lot of the country isn’t going to believe anything this White House says,” Frieden said.\n\n“As much as I admire both Tony and Vivek, they ought to sit down and be quiet,” added Schaffner, the Vanderbilt infectious disease expert who has served on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices since 1982.\n\nAlthough Walensky appears frequently in public, it’s often on short television segments, where there isn’t enough time to explain the scientific reasoning behind public health decisions, or at White House briefings, which have the appearance of being political and might not engender trust.\n\nThe public has rarely heard about Covid-19 from CDC scientists besides Walensky, which is in stark contrast to other outbreaks and undercuts the agency’s authority with the public, the sources said.\n\nDr. William Foege said that while he was CDC director from 1977 to 1983, his policy was to let scientists working under him speak directly with journalists.\n\n“I told them they can talk to journalists; they don’t have to go through the front office,” Foege said.\n\nTraditionally during outbreaks, CDC directors and agency scientists have held regular media briefings that explained in detail the science and the agency’s public health measures.\n\n“You do need very clear, frequent communications: Be first, be right, be credible, express empathy, promote action, show respect,” Frieden said.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak of 2003, which resulted in zero US deaths, the CDC held 17 media briefings on the outbreak, according to CDC records. During the Ebola outbreak of 2014, which resulted in two US deaths, the CDC held 20 telebriefings on the virus. During the Zika outbreak, two years later, which resulted in two US deaths, the agency held 16 telebriefings.\n\nBut under the Biden administration, the CDC has held just nine media briefings on Covid-19. During that 16-month period, more than half a million people have died from the virus in the US.\n\nEven at arguably its most contentious moment during the Biden presidency, the agency did not hold a briefing to explain its science. In December, Walensky announced new CDC guidelines to shorten the quarantine time for Covid-19, earning the agency severe – and extremely rare – rebukes from the American Medical Association and others.\n\nIt’s unclear why there have been relatively few briefings under the Biden administration – whether it’s been the CDC’s choice or if it was done at the direction of the White House.\n\nWhen CNN asked the senior CDC official about the small number of briefings, she said that “we’ve heard this feedback loud and clear.”\n\nIf the CDC had fewer briefings because of pressure from Washington, all the reviews in the world won’t help, said Glen Nowak, a former communications specialist at CDC who co-authored the communications chapter of the CDC field manual.\n\n“You can change the structure all you want, but if at the end of the day CDC is always going to be overridden by HHS or the White House, I don’t know that the organizational structure is going to matter much,” said Nowak, who spent 14 years at the CDC, including six as the agency’s director of media relations.\n\nIf the CDC has been under pressure from Washington, what could help is joining forces with medical organizations and other partners, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, who worked at the CDC for 26 years.\n\nOrenstein was director of the CDC’s National Immunization Program from 1988 to 2004, and he said when HHS tried to “direct CDC” to make certain decisions, he found it helpful to get groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Defense Fund on his side.\n\n“No one wants to tick off the Children’s Defense Fund,” Orenstein said.\n\n5. The CDC needs a more modern data system\n\nDr. Robert Redfield has been relatively quiet since leaving his position as CDC director under Trump, but last week, he said one sentence that resonated with the sources interviewed for this story.\n\n“I always thought it was bothersome that the data the nation used to track the epidemic was from a medical school rather than CDC,” Redfield said at an event at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nRedfield was referring to data from Johns Hopkins University tracking Covid-19 cases and deaths, which the media and others have often relied on instead of CDC data.\n\nA senior CDC physician said Hopkins data was “faster” than CDC data because the university can “webscrape” – take data from state, county and local websites – but the CDC isn’t allowed to do that.\n\n“We can’t webscrape. We report [data] from the states, and the states gave it to us slowly,” she said.\n\nBeyond webscraping, there are concerns that the CDC’s data infrastructure is in serious need of modernizing.\n\nThe senior CDC official said the agency is making efforts “to move data collection to the cloud” so that it could be more “interoperable.”\n\nTempering expectations for the review\n\nDuring the measles outbreak of 2018, when anti-vaxxers were spreading lies to the Orthodox Jewish community, the CDC turned to Shoshana Bernstein, a pro-vaccine activist in the religious community in Monsey, New York.\n\nThe CDC staffers flew from Atlanta and met with Bernstein, who shared ideas about educational videos and publications that could help turn the tide.\n\n“The impression I got was that everyone was committed and dedicated to public health,” she said. “I can’t stress this enough: They were wonderful people and kind and caring. They were public servants. They were not just there to collect a paycheck.”\n\nBernstein said the CDC staffers were enthusiastic and followed up with emails. But then, to her surprise, it became clear there wasn’t CDC funding readily available to make the videos or the publications she’d suggested, even though measles was raging in her community and the projects were small and relatively inexpensive.\n\n“It was such a disconnect. They were so dedicated and committed and compassionate about public health, but there was so much red tape and processes that there didn’t seem to be a structure for pivoting from ‘that’s a great idea’ to actually making it happen,” Bernstein said.\n\nBernstein said to her great surprise, the CDC asked her if she had any ideas for where to get money to fund the pro-vaccine educational projects.\n\n“I was like, ‘wait, aren’t you the CDC? Aren’t you this giant agency with a huge budget, and you’re asking me for help finding money?’ ” Bernstein said.\n\nBernstein ran into what former CDC director Frieden calls “inflexible funding,” where the director cannot easily move funds around when a new public health threat emerges.\n\n“When Ebola hit, it happened to be at the end of a fiscal year, and we literally didn’t have enough money to buy plane tickets for staff. We had to borrow $3 million from another agency,” Frieden said. “When I was New York City health commissioner, I had 20 times more flexible funds than I had as CDC director.”\n\nDespite efforts by the CDC, that hasn’t changed since Frieden left the agency five years ago.\n\n“That’s an unfortunate part of the CDC budget,” the current CDC senior official said. “In the 150-plus individual disease and risk factor specific lines, [it] leaves minimal to no flexibility throughout the year to respond to public health emergencies.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBecause of this inflexibility, Frieden and others tempered expectations about what a review of the CDC’s internal processes and structures could accomplish.\n\n“I think it’s important that there not be the impression that structural changes alone are going to make a big difference in some of the big problems, because they won’t be sufficient,” he said.\n\nOne of the CDC senior physicians said she wanted to “set the stage for managing expectations” about what the review will accomplish.\n\nAnyone who thinks the review is “going to fix all the problems the CDC had and public health had, I think, is not sort of seeing the forest for the trees,” she said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen Danielle Herman", "Elizabeth Cohen", "Danielle Herman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}]}

It will be revisited again during another set of league meetings in May.\n\nAmong the layers to the tush push: The play is considered traditional in nature to the sport. However, the idea teammates can push one another on offense but are unable to push or raise another defensive player to block a kick is one-sided.\n\n\"Health and safety\" were also touted as a concern to ban the play, but the NFL simply does not have enough data to definitively say which injuries could occur.\n\nZero injuries were reported from such plays last season, but it barely accounted for 1/5 of a percent of all the offensive plays in the NFL in 2024. ESPN reported just 101 of the 35,414 offensive plays in 2024 were tush-push plays, or 0.285%.\n\n“We have very little data from it, but it's beyond data. There's also the mechanism of injury that we study, that type of thing that leads us to show the risk involved with a particular play or particular tackle,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said.\n\nEagles owner Jeffrey Lurie vehemently endorsed the play his club specializes better than any other NFL team, following the announcement it would be revisited.\n\nLurie believes the \"tush push\" is safer than the traditional quarterback sneak because the ball carrier is surrounded by more teammates instead of just lunging into a crowd of defenders by himself. Unless the data supports a health and safety issue, the play should stand.\n\n“I want to know what data there is. I don't think there is any. If you want to say that it could be [dangerous], it's hard to make rules on could-bes and should-bes,” Lurie told Eagles reporters Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"One of the reasons we like using the Tush Push is we think it's a safer play than the quarterback sneak. The quarterback sneak, if you talk to quarterbacks about it, there's more spearing going on. They're less protected by players around them. And one of the reasons we got motivated to develop an expertise in this play is it was more protective to the quarterback.\n\n\"So, it's ironic that people would bring up health and safety. We're at the top of the game in terms of wanting health and safety on every play. We voted for hip-drop tackle and a defenseless receiver.\n\n“We will always, always support what is safer for the players. It's a no-brainer. If this is proven to be less safe for the players, we will be against the Tush Push.\n\n“But until that's the case, to me, there would be no reason to ban this play.”\n\nRich McKay, CEO of the Atlanta Falcons CEO and co-chairman of the NFL’s competition committee, said the NFL teams discussed the play for about 30-40 minutes on Tuesday.\n\nMcKay said the tush-push play is essentially fruit from a previous rule change: In 2004, the NFL allowed players to push and pull because it became difficult to judge downfield pass plays.\n\nThe proposal to ban the play was initiated this offseason by the Green Bay Packers, who coincidentally lost twice to the Eagles last season. Green Bay asked to re-introduce 2004 language when the proposal is tabled again in May, McKay said.\n\n“I would definitely say there are some people that have health and safety concerns, but there’s just as many people that have football concerns,” McKay added. “It was much more about the play, the aesthetics of the play. Is it what football has been traditionally or is it more of a rugby play?”\n\nThe Eagles effectively found a play to game the NFL system. The Eagles use it when they’re typically within 2 yards of a first down on any spot on the field, and it’s become notorious when they are near the goal line for easy touchdown runs.\n\nThe play goes like this: Quarterback Jalen Hurts, known for being able to squat 600 pounds, lines up behind his center and the rest of Philly’s offensive line. When Hurts gets the snap, he waits for his linemen to make the first push while he pushes into them with a head-first dive. Often times, the Eagles have a player like running back Saquon Barkley and others push behind Hurts to effectively win short-yardage situations.\n\nThe Eagles converted \"tush push\" plays for first downs or touchdowns in 39 of 48 times (81.3%) they ran last season. Philadelphia and the Buffalo Bills are the only teams that used it for more than five plays in 2024.\n\nThe Eagles have used the play under coach Nick Sirianni since 2022, and played in two of the last three Super Bowls — beating the Kansas City Chiefs in the most recent. Hurts scored on the play during the first touchdown in the 40-22 rout on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.\n\n“We’ve been really successful at it,” Sirianni said Tuesday.\n\nSirianni, a former offensive coordinator with the Indianapolis Colts, started employing the play with backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett coming on the field for oft-injured former starter Andrew Luck in 2018, when Brissett was a starter in 2019, and Phillip Rivers’ lone season with the club in 2020.\n\nThe Eagles didn’t run the play much during his first season as an NFL head coach in 2021, but he employed tight end Dallas Goedert in motion as a pusher in the backfield. But the play began to gain attention after the Eagles used a tush push on 4th and 1 to end a game against the Detroit Lions during the 2022 season.\n\n“That was a pretty important quarterback sneak that happened, let's make sure we get them in,” Sirianni said about practicing the play more at the time.\n\n“They kind of evolved from there with different formations, different pushers. Then we turned it into two pushers. And just a cool evolution. And then what happened was all the compliments that come off of it, and all the cool things that you can do off it.”\n\nHowever, the Packers cited player safety as a main reason for opposition. Players are crouched over and dive head-first into the line. The play puts NFL players in an unsafe position, critics of the play say.\n\nMcKay did not want to divulge into what possible injuries could occur or what the league could prevent, citing the lack of data.\n\n“I think from a health and safety standpoint, a lot of people are concerned with what may be, not opposed to what has been,” McKay said.\n\nAdded Sirianni: “I think we were healthy on the play. I believe that whole entire NFL was healthy on the play … You have to trust the doctors and stuff like that in those scenarios, but you always want to do what's best for the players first and foremost.”\n\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin was in favor of keeping the tush-push play, which could be gone before next season if the league decides to ban it in May.\n\n“You hate to be against it because when people are innovative, you want to respect that. And so, there’s certainly been some teams that have been more innovative than the rest of us in that regard. And you hate to penalize them for that,” Tomlin said Monday.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

With Allen being one of the biggest and strongest QBs in the NFL, he was almost unstoppable when the Bills used the play, that is until the AFC Championship Game when the Kansas City Chiefs stopped him on four of the six times the Bills tried it.\n\nBased on reported numbers, since 2022 the Eagles have used the tush push 122 times, followed by the Bills (74), Steelers (55), and Broncos (52). Last season, the Bills used it 17 times in the regular season and Allen converted the first down or touchdown on 16, though that didn’t include the postseason. Their 94% success rate was actually better than the Eagles 82.3% rate (28 of 34).\n\nThe proposal fell two votes shy of getting the 24 it needed for ratification as 10 teams voted in favor of keeping the play. The 10 teams that voted against the ban were: The Eagles, Ravens, Browns, Lions, Jaguars, Dolphins, Patriots, Saints, Jets and Titans.\n\nWhen Allen spoke to the media on April 22 when the Bills began their voluntary workout program at One Bills Drive, he didn’t have much feeling one way or the other.\n\n“I think at this point it is what it is,” he said. “I don’t know if I have a particular feeling about it. I know that we’ve utilized it. I know that if it wasn’t banned, I think we would find a different play or a different way to still try to get the job done. But I don’t know the statistics behind player safety and all of that. So I really don’t have a say on it, to be honest.”\n\nSal Maiorana has covered the Buffalo Bills for four decades including 35 years as the full-time beat writer for the D&C, he has written numerous books about the history of the team, and he is also co-host of the BLEAV in Bills podcast/YouTube show.

NFL experts debate", "text": "When it comes to the Philadelphia Eagles' infamous \"tush push,\" some have more to say than others.\n\nThe Eagles have made a living on that signature play that comes with many nicknames. In 2024, they rode that controversy all the way to a Super Bowl victory. That was enough to ramp up the conversation.\n\nThat became especially true when Shawn Hochuli channeled his inner annoyed principal and told the Washington Commanders he could award the Eagles a score in the NFC championship game.\n\nSo like kids on the playground at recess, some NFL teams have learned that life isn't fair and they're ready to do something about it.\n\nSome have tried and almost all have failed to replicate the success that was pioneered by Jalen Hurts, Jason Kelce and Nick Sirianni. The Green Bay Packers chose to present the case to ban the controversial play, and NFL owners are set to vote on its fate this week.\n\nThe question is: Should it be banned? Does the \"tush push\" rise to the level of annoyance like Silly Bandz or fidget spinners? Is it as dangerous as old-fashioned dodgeball or a book that found itself caught up in a heated political debate?\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' NFL experts present their cases on the \"Brotherly Shove\" and whether or not the play should be outlawed:\n\nNate Davis\n\nI could be swayed to vote against the push play – but in the future, when it reaches the point of essentially being an automatic conversion league-wide, similar to what extra points became when they were 20-yard kicks. But now? Putting a stop to it in the moment feels something like a vendetta against the Super Bowl champion Eagles, who use it far more frequently – and effectively – than any other team.\n\nAfter all, the NFL is only a copycat league when you can copy the cat – but the Eagles have tush-pushed like no other. And I’ve been around them more than enough to know how they feel.\n\nPro Bowl guard Landon Dickerson told me it’s basically a modified quarterback sneak, so legislating it out of the game is problematic – though I might concede having QB Jalen Hurts rammed from behind by TE Dallas Goedert and others could be the component of the play most logically disallowed.\n\nLeft tackle Jordan Mailata told me after last season’s NFC championship game rout of the Washington Commanders, who crumbled against the tush push – I see you, Frankie Luvu – that the strategy encapsulated Philly winning in the “mental warfare” department.\n\nAs for the notion it’s dangerous – despite the utter lack of data to support that theorem – come on. You really going to contend the tush push is more fraught with bodily risk than RB Saquon Barkley barreling toward a goal line packed with bodies at full speed – for him or defenders?\n\nYou want my vote to kill the tush push? Fine. Just bring me a better case than I’ve seen to date. Until then? Stop the Eagles. Or successfully mimic them.\n\nVote: Keep it!\n\nTyler Dragon\n\nIt seems that most of the NFL's rules cater toward the offense and handicap the defense, so it's kind of refreshing to see the NFL consider a rule that helps the defense. But the tush push isn’t a play the NFL should outlaw.\n\nAccording to ESPN, the Eagles have a success rate of 86% since they started doing the tush push in 2022. The NFL average is 76%. While the success rate is high in short-yardage situations, the play isn’t unstoppable.\n\nI’m all for the NFL becoming a bit more physical on both sides of football (and still remaining as safe as possible). There isn’t evidence to suggest that the tush push is a dangerous play. But it’s a physical play in an NFL game that’s becoming less physical.\n\nVote: Keep it!\n\nTom Viera\n\nThe Eagles are one of 32 teams with a competitive advantage on this play. In 2024, they successfully executed 28 out of 34 \"tush push\" attempts, according to Next Gen Stats. Other teams prepare for the play, but they still can't stop it.\n\nThat's bad for entertainment value, therefore it's bad for business. Imagine in a few years' time if all 32 teams learned to run the \"tush push\" successfully; How's that entertaining?\n\nDust off the traditional QB sneak perfected by Tom Brady, which never garnered the same level of ire and detest as the \"tush push.\" Should the play be banned, Jalen Hurts and the Eagles are likely to navigate this situation better than many expect.\n\nVote: Ban it!\n\nJack McKessy\n\nThe Green Bay Packers’ proposal to ban the play reads like a tattletale child on the playground that didn’t get included in the latest game of tag.\n\n“Well if I can’t have fun, then no one should.”\n\nAll 32 teams could run the same exact play if they so choose. There’s no “secret” or “hidden method,” but the other 31 teams still don’t try it.\n\nWith that being the case, Occam’s razor would say the Eagles simply run a quarterback sneak play better than every other team, and every other team can’t run their own “tush push” effectively. It’s a copycat league, so why hasn’t this play been effectively copied yet in the three years since it’s been introduced?\n\nThat’s not to mention the poor wording of the current proposal, which leaves plenty of room for loopholes and liberal interpretations. And if the rule change does pass, the Eagles and other teams will simply find those loopholes or come up with other ways to run effective plays in short yardage situations.\n\nBanning a play that only one out of 32 teams has used effectively and consistently for three years is like the teacher listening to that aforementioned tattletale child and banning the game of tag at recess. The rest of the kids are just going to find other ways to have fun.\n\nVote: Keep it!\n\nAyrton Ostly\n\nWinning consistently in the NFL is tough. There are only so many ways to find small margins that make the difference on a weekly basis and teams shouldn't be punished for finding advantages with their personnel.\n\nThe Eagles have one of the best offensive lines in the league and a powerful runner at quarterback. Getting the upper hand in leverage in the trenches is no new concept. Philadelphia's just better at it than other teams due to their unique talent on the roster.\n\nDon't get mad and complain to the teacher (in this case, the NFL) to get the one kid banned from playing a game a certain way just because you can't exactly replicate it or beat them. Figure out how to win. Other NFL teams need to catch up in doing it themselves and/or invest in better ways to combat it defensively.\n\nVote: Keep it!\n\nNick Brinkerhoff\n\nDeath, taxes and \"tush push\" first downs can't be the only things guaranteed in life.\n\nYes, other teams have failed, but what if they don't going forward? Do we want to live in a world where players get their tushes pushed all game long? Think of the children – and the game that'll be left behind.\n\nAs it's said, one person has a tendency of ruining it for the rest. In this case, that's the Eagles. Inadvertent or not, they pushed the envelope too far, making their play too big of a talking point. It's a lot like that local restaurant that gets noticed by a big celebrity; You're happy for their bottom line and the success that follows, but annoyed that the 20 minute wait is now 40 and items on the menu are sold out.\n\nSometimes there is too much of a good thing and the Eagles may learn that the hard way. The \"tush push\" must go.\n\nVote: Ban it!\n\nJoe Rivera\n\nMuch like D.J. Khaled, the Eagles are suffering from success.\n\nIs it fair to penalize Philadelphia for being too good at one play? Probably not. However, unlike the NFL's oftentimes reactionary and late-to-the-party nature on rule changes, it's better for the league to get out in front of this than wait until the copycats crack the code on what makes the \"tush push\" darn near automatic.\n\nSure, not all 31 other squads have a world-class offensive line and a quarterback who can squat Volkswagens, and at least a small fraction won't for a long time, if ever.\n\nBut, as a fan, do you want to wait until that point in which those other teams are spending the majority of their Sundays pushing their own quarterbacks around more than the opposing team's? Do you want to see the drama and suspense sucked out of critical short-yardage situations? That doesn't sound like an entertaining product to watch.\n\nNo one has been able to replicate the Eagles' success on the \"tush push.\" That doesn't mean the league never will. I'd rather not wait to find out what that looks like on NFL Sundays.\n\nVote: Ban it!\n\nFinal tally\n\nKeep it: Four votesBan it: Three votes", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/05/21/tush-push-ban-nfl-eagles/83658502007/", "title": "Tush Push vote: NFL doesn't get enough support to ban Eagles play", "text": "After all the fanfare and debates, the NFL owners have ruled the league can keep on pushing. The \"Tush Push\" play is here to stay.\n\nThe league officially failed to ban the \"Tush Push\" on Wednesday, after the proposal did not receive enough support in a vote by the owners. League rules dictate that at least 24 of the 32 teams had to be in favor of the move.\n\nThe final tally ended two teams short, with 22 teams voting in favor of a ban and 10 teams electing to allow the play to live on – with the New York Jets, Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions and New England Patriots among the teams that sided with the Eagles, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nIt was a rule change that appeared to be a guarantee heading into Wednesday's session, which was attended by Jason Kelce, who played an informational role in the process.\n\nThe Eagles celebrated the decision on social media, with a simple \"Push On\" posted on X.\n\nAny attempt to ban or limit the play has been controversial in NFL circles. The Green Bay Packers initially proposed the idea at the NFL league meetings in April, when it was revealed they didn't have enough support at the time and would table the discussion until May.\n\nThe Packers submitted a revised proposal to ban the play earlier this week. In the updated proposal's language, no offensive player may \"push or pull a runner in any direction at any time or lift him to his feet.\" The Packers also eliminated \"immediately at the snap\" in the updated language.\n\nThe \"Tush Push\" was a play made famous by the Philadelphia Eagles, who perfected the process following head coach Nick Sirianni's arrival in 2021. However, the play's origins date back to 2018, when Anthony Barr of the Minnesota Vikings was captured in a mic'd up moment talking through the strategy.\n\nJalen Hurts, Jason Kelce and the Eagles used the concept to make most short-yardage situations nearly automatic.\n\nDepending on your perspective, the play resembles a rugby scrum and is not a football play or a quarterback sneak that rarely fails.\n\nTUSH PUSH BAN: What Jalen Hurts, Eagles players have said about looming NFL vote\n\nMany teams have tried to mirror the Eagles and their ability to convert at a high level, but that hasn't been the case for most.\n\nDespite that reality, the Packers pushed for a ban. The team's president, Mark Murphy, spoke back in April about his optimism surrounding the potential ban despite the tabling of talks.\n\n\"I think it ended up in a good place,\" Murphy said in an interview with the Packers' YouTube channel. \"We ended up tabling it but we had really good discussions. Talked a little bit about our safety concerns regarding the play, just kind of the style of the play. But good interaction with the league. So it'll be tabled. And then what we're going to do is, it'll be voted on in the May meeting.\"\n\nMost opposition, including Murphy, to the \"Tush Push\" has pointed to a previous rule that said you can't push or pull players. According to NFL Competition Committee chairman Rich McKay, it was too hard for officials to officiate, which is why the rule was done away with in 2005.\n\nConsidering how close the league got to banning the \"Tush Push\" this offseason, it seems likely that there will be more challenges in the future.\n\nFor now, the Eagles' infamous play lives to fight another day.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/05/22/saquon-barkley-tush-push-ban-nfl-contracts/83793894007/", "title": "Saquon Barkley talks failed 'tush push' ban, NFL guaranteed contracts", "text": "Saquon Barkley has a love-hate relationship with the \"tush push\" play.\n\nThe NFL owners failed to pass a ban on the Philadelphia Eagles' controversial quarterback-sneak, falling two votes shy of passing the rule change on Wednesday. It ensures that the play will live for at least another season, something the Eagles have been celebrating ever since.\n\nBarkley, on the other hand, appears to understand that it's good for the team but bad for his season stats. The running back routinely lost out on touchdown-scoring opportunities to Jalen Hurts and the \"tush push\" when the Eagles were at the one-yard line.\n\nDuring an appearance on the \"Exciting Mics\" podcast with teammates Cooper DeJean and Reed Blankenship, Barkley discussed that and also offered his thoughts on the play. The episode released Thursday was recorded before the owners' voted.\n\n\"I think it's soft, to be honest,\" Barkley said. \"Everybody can do it. It's not a play that we only can do. We happen to have one of the best and biggest O-lines, and Jalen Hurts can squat 600 pounds. That's not our fault.\"\n\nThe reigning offensive player of the year turned his attention to the other teams across the league that have tried, and failed, to replicate the Eagles' success.\n\n\"Josh Allen is super big, they're not successful with it,\" Barkley continued. \"Lamar Jackson is one of the best running quarterbacks of all-time, they're not successful with it. So it's not something that everyone can't do. Them trying to eliminate it, I think that's kind of lame.\"\n\nThere were 10 teams that voted to keep the \"tush push\" – nine if you exclude the Eagles. Of those nine teams, seven play in the AFC. Barkley acknowledged that the biggest push for a ban came from teams that Philadelphia has to compete against more often.\n\n\"And the teams that want to get rid of it are the teams that gotta see us two or three times a year,\" he said.\n\nBarkley pointed out that he could understand passing a ban if there was a health risk for players. He suggested the league would have to ban the quarterback sneak in general if that were the case, since the \"tush push\" is another version of the play.\n\nDeJean and Blankenship presented Barkley with the idea of crafting an elevator pitch for NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell. The running back, like he would during a game, took that opportunity to change directions and focus on a bigger issue, in his mind.\n\n\"Everybody can do it, there's no health issue and why we talking about the tush push, let's make sure everybody's contract is guaranteed,\" Barkley said.\n\nHe added that baseball and basketball players have guaranteed deals, something the NFL doesn't.\n\n\"We play the hardest sport of all of them,\" Barkley said. \"Not saying like technical wise, but physicality wise. There's no reason why we put our bodies on the line, our minds, our brains on the line. It should be fully guaranteed, in my opinion.\"\n\nThe trio proceeded to talk about the scheduling side of things, with games taking place on Thursday, Friday, Sunday and Monday throughout the season which leads to short weeks and limited recovery time.\n\nAs the NFL eyes an 18-game schedule and 16 international games across the league each year, the discussion surrounding player safety and contract value figure should only ramp up over time.\n\nThe current NFL collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is set to expire in March 2031.

Multiple outlets have reported that the group of 32 team owners is now ready for the vote and will meet in Minneapolis on Tuesday and Wednesday to make a final decision.\n\nThe team owners also will vote on the Detroit Lions' proposal to re-seed playoff teams based on record after the first round, on tweaks to the kickoff rule and on allowing players to participate in flag football events at the 2028 Olympics, according to Sports Illustrated.\n\nDiscussions surrounding a ban on the Eagles' perfected version of the quarterback sneak play – in which the quarterback is pushed from behind by a running back and tight end to gain extra leverage – has been around since Philadelphia debuted the play in 2022. But talks of a potential ban heated up in February after the Packers submitted their initial proposal.\n\nESPN reported in late March that the \"tush push\" ban proposal had supporters within the NFL's competition committee. Still, certain teams are opposed to the ban entirely, and others have criticized the imprecise language the proposal had at the annual league meeting:\n\n\"No offensive player may immediately at the snap, push or throw his body against a teammate, who was lined up directly behind the snapper and received the snap, to aid him in an attempt to gain yardage.\"\n\nAccording to Sports Illustrated, New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel and Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh were among those looking for clarification.\n\nCould a quarterback still be pushed from behind if it were by a guard? Could guards be pushed from behind by extra linemen on the field for the play?\n\nExtra clarity has not been added to the proposal's language so far, though that could change as the meeting in Minneapolis – and ensuing vote – gets underway.\n\nHow do rule changes work in the NFL?\n\nFor the \"Tush Push\" ban proposal to become an official rule, it will first be reviewed by the NFL competition committee, which includes various team owners, front office officials and even active head coaches. According to the NFL, the committee is instructed to consider the following questions about a new rule or rule change:\n\nDoes the change improve the game?\n\nHow will it be officiated?\n\nHow will it be coached?\n\nCan the player apply the rule on the field?\n\nDoes the change enhance player protection?\n\nOnce the NFL competition committee outlines how the rule change will be implemented, all 32 team owners vote on whether or not to adopt the rule, usually at the annual team meeting. The new rule must have a 75% approval rating (24 of 32 teams) to pass.\n\nLast year's rule changes included the implementation of the NFL's new kickoff format as well as a ban on hip-drop tackles.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/mike-freeman/2025/05/14/eagles-schedule-release-tush-push/83618479007/", "title": "Eagles will be NFL schedule fixture. 'Tush push' might not be", "text": "This is schedule release week with Wednesday being the big day. Of course the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles will figure prominently. Makes total sense. But when next season arrives will the Eagles have their vaunted \"tush push?\"\n\nThe answer is likely no which means one of the best plays in recent league history (yes, I said best) could be absent from all of the various screens the Eagles will be on this coming season.\n\nThe fate of the play will likely be determined at the league meetings starting May 20 in Minneapolis. The NFL delayed a potential ban on the controversial play in the spring during the meetings then. The NFL needs 24 of 32 team owners to support or deny a rule change.\n\nThe belief was that the owners were just delaying the inevitable. No one knows for certain but the play seems destined to be eradicated.\n\nThe play is one of my favorites to see. It's not just rugby as some have described it. The elegance of it is its simplicity. It's also not easy to do and requires extensive practice. There's a reason why a number of teams have tried and failed. Laughingly so. One weekend two years ago, three teams tried to do it, and couldn't.\n\nWhat the Eagles have done is find a secret weapon, refined it, worked on it constantly, and shaped it into something almost unstoppable. The league's response has been not working on a way to stop it, but to try and ban it, like cowards.\n\nOne reason for wanting to ban it has been health and safety but the NFL admits there's no definitive data proving that it causes injuries. There were no injuries reported from the \"tush push\" last season. ESPN reported just 101 of the 35,414 offensive plays in 2024 were tush-push plays, or 0.285%.\n\nI hate, absolutely hate, that the Eagles will be a huge part of the broadcast year next season, and we may not be able to see what's become not just one of the team's signature plays, but the NFL's.\n\nWe already know part of Philadelphia's schedule and the Eagles will be highly visible next season. The team will play in the Thursday night season opener against Dallas, a Week 10 Monday night game against Green Bay, the Black Friday game against Chicago, and a Dec. 20 Saturday doubleheader against Washington. Quick note: the Packers were the team that ratted out, err, proposed the \"tush push\" ban. The Packers also lost to the Eagles twice last season.\n\nEagles owner Jeffrey Lurie told reporters recently that unless the play is proven to be a health and safety issue, his team should be allowed to continue using it. His quote here is long but I think it's useful to see in its entirety.\n\n\"I want to know what data there is,\" Lurie said. \"I don't think there is any. If you want to say that it could be (dangerous), it's hard to make rules on could-bes and should-bes.\n\n\"One of the reasons we like using the tush push is we think it's a safer play than the quarterback sneak. The quarterback sneak, if you talk to quarterbacks about it, there's more spearing going on. They're less protected by players around them. And one of the reasons we got motivated to develop an expertise in this play is it was more protective to the quarterback.\n\n\"So, it's ironic that people would bring up health and safety. We're at the top of the game in terms of wanting health and safety on every play. We voted for hip-drop tackle and a defenseless receiver.\n\n“We will always, always support what is safer for the players. It's a no-brainer. If this is proven to be less safe for the players, we will be against the tush push.\n\n“But until that's the case, to me, there would be no reason to ban this play.\"\n\n\"I would definitely say there are some people that have health and safety concerns, but there’s just as many people that have football concerns,\" Rich McKay, CEO of the Atlanta Falcons, and co-chairman of the NFL’s competition committee, has said previously. \"It was much more about the play, the aesthetics of the play. Is it what football has been traditionally or is it more of a rugby play?\"\n\nIt's not a rugby play.\n\nIt's gorgeous.\n\nAnd when the Eagles star across numerous broadcasts this coming season, we may not see it.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/02/06/trump-going-to-superbowl-59-chiefs-eagles/78250650007/", "title": "Trump going to Super Bowl despite rocky relationship with NFL", "text": "President Donald Trump’s appearance at Sunday’s Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans will go down in history as the first sitting commander-in-chief to attend the National Football League’s title game, in which the Kansas City Chiefs will go for an unprecedented “three-peat” against the Philadelphia Eagles.What isn’t historic is his on-again/off-again decades-long feud with the NFL and its players since the 1980s.\n\nWhile Trump and the NFL seem to be on the same page now, their relationship has been rocky over the decades. Here is a breakdown of Trump’s long and complicated history with the league.\n\nTrump, the NFL and DEI\n\nTrump will attend the big game on Sunday following the NFL’s recent decision to remove the “End Racism” message from the end zones for the first time since 2021. Instead, the league will use phrases like “Choose Love” and “It Takes All of Us.” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told USA TODAY Sports that the change is in response to deadly tragedies throughout the U.S. so far this year.\n\nThe NFL’s phrase change comes after Trump signed an executive order last month “terminating radical DEI” to “protect the civil rights of all Americans and expand individual opportunity,” according to the White House.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs consist of a range of policies aimed at rooting out bias in hiring and opening career opportunities for people of color, women and members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell defended the league’s current diversity policies, saying on Monday that they didn’t conflict with Trump’s administration’s efforts to ban DEI programs in the federal government.\n\n“Our policies have been designed to be well within the law, well within the practice,” Goodell said on Monday. “There are no quotas in our system. This is about opening that funnel and bringing the best talent into the NFL.”\n\nDonald Trump criticized NFL players over national anthem protests\n\nWhen former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began a controversial social movement by kneeling during the national anthem before games, other NFL players followed suit, causing an outcry from Trump and several conservatives. Kaepernick said he was protesting racial inequality and the oppression of Black people in the U.S.\n\nIn September 2017, during Trump’s initial term, he made a speech in Alabama criticizing the NFL players who were kneeling during the anthem.\n\n“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a (expletive) off the field right now? Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” Trump said at a rally for former Republican Sen. Luther Strange of Alabama.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump also attributed the NFL’s dip in ratings at the time to several rule changes that were implemented to make the game less violent and limit concussions and other head injuries.\n\n“The NFL ratings are down massively,” Trump said. “Now the No. 1 reason happens to be they like watching what’s happening … with yours truly. They like what’s happening because, you know today, if you hit too hard, 15 yards! Throw him out of the game!”\n\nDonald Trump tried to purchase the Buffalo Bills in 2014\n\nTrump tried to buy the Buffalo Bills football team in 2014, but he may not have even had the funds to do so at the time, the president’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, testified in 2019 before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nCohen said Trump inflated his net worth by $4 billion in financial documents, raising it from $4.26 billion to $8.66 billion from 2011 to 2013.\n\n“Mr. Trump is a cheat,” Cohen said. “It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.”\n\nAfter Cohen's testimony in 2019, Trump described his former attorney's words as \"shameful\" and accused him of lying frequently.\n\nUltimately, Trump was outbid by Terry Pegula, a billionaire businessman and petroleum engineer, and his wife, Kim. The Pegulas’ $1.4 billion bid beat out Trump’s and a group led by singer Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nNFL players receive backlash for supporting Trump, MAGA\n\nSeveral NFL players who have openly supported Trump and his MAGA (Make America Great Again) campaign have received backlash over the years, including San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa.\n\nBosa disregarded the NFL’s rule against wearing or messaging political slogans when he crashed an NBC postgame interview last year and pointed to his “Make America Great Again” cap.\n\nThe NFL fined Bosa $11,255 for violating the uniform and equipment rules policy by “wearing a hat that contained a personal message.”\n\nAccording to NFL rules: “Throughout the period on game-day that a player is visible to the stadium and television audience (including in pregame warm-ups, in the bench area, and during postgame interviews in the locker room or on the field), players are prohibited from wearing, displaying, or otherwise conveying personal messages either in writing or illustration, unless such message has been approved in advance by the League office.”\n\nIn response to the fine, Bosa, who agreed to a five-year $170 million contract extension in September 2023 with the 49ers, said: “It was well worth it,” the Associated Press reported.\n\nOther former and current NFL players and owners have supported Trump’s presidency over the years, including his longtime friend Herschel Walker, now-retired NFL quarterback Tom Brady, former NFL offensive lineman Richie Incognito, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, former NFL head coach Rex Ryan, legendary New York Jets center Nick Mangold, former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, former NFL quarterback Brett Favre and former NFL coach Mike Ditka.\n\nDonald Trump’s dance takes the NFL by storm\n\nThroughout Trump’s second presidential campaign, he often did a dance that became quite popular among NFL players.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers, Nick Bosa, Detroit Lions defenders Za’Darius Smith and Malcolm Rodriguez, and Tennessee Titans pass catchers Calvin Ridley and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine were all spotted doing the Trump dance during the 2024-25 season.\n\n“I’ve seen everyone do it,” Bowers told USA TODAY Sports in November. “I watched the UFC fight [Saturday] night, and Jon Jones did it. I like watching UFC, so I saw it and thought it was cool.”\n\nThe dance is simple: It involves bending one’s elbows, closing one’s fists, and moving one’s arms back and forth, as Trump did during his campaign rallies. Head-tilting and facial expressions can be added for some extra oomph.\n\nAside from Bosa, the other players who did the Trump dance did not openly support Trump. The president did shout out to Bosa for his performance of the dance in a Truth Social post in November, calling him “A GREAT PLAYER!”\n\n“I think you know the answer to that question,” Bosa told the San Francisco Chronicle in November about his inspiration for the Trump dance. “All the guys wanted me to do it. I wasn’t even going to do it, but the boys reminded me. And it was fun.”\n\nDonald Trump led USFL’s anti-trust lawsuit against NFL\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Trump spent less than $10 million to become the owner of the New Jersey Generals in the United States Football League (USFL), CNBC reported.\n\n“I don’t know about the rest of you people, and I don’t know how much money you guys have, but I have the money to get into the NFL. And that’s where I plan on being,” Trump told his fellow USFL owners at a meeting in 1984, the outlet said, citing the book “Football for a Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL.”\n\nInstead, Trump spent $6 million in 1983 to buy New Jersey Generals as part of the new United States Football League and led a lawsuit against the NFL to attempt to force a merger. According to ESPN, it was “widely considered” Trump’s strategy for the league that led to its demise in 1985.\n\nContributing: Safid Deen, Jarrett Bell, Lorenzo Reyes, Mark Giannotto, Joey Garrison, Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz/ USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2025/04/28/white-house-visit-donald-trump/83322514007/", "title": "Eagles' White House visit: Philadelphia celebrates with Donald Trump", "text": "The Philadelphia Eagles celebrated their recent Super Bowl championship with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, though at least two dozen players – including Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts – did not attend.\n\nDuring a brief ceremony on the South Lawn, Trump lauded the Eagles for a dominant season, which they capped with a 40-22 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl. He also praised the team's famed \"tush push\" play, which some NFL teams are now seeking to ban, and praised running back Saquon Barkley as \"a handsome guy\" whom he wouldn't want to tackle.\n\n\"I was with the (New York) Giants, the head coach and some people, and I said, 'Do anything you have to, but don't lose Saquon.' They lost Saquon,\" Trump said to laughter from the crowd. \"That was not good. I called that one. That was an easy one to call.\"\n\nTrump also noted his presence at the Super Bowl, which was rare for a sitting president. And he appeared to take a jab at pop star Taylor Swift, who was also in attendance to support her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\n\"I was there along with Taylor Swift. How did that work out? How did that one work out?\" Trump said of Swift.\n\nThe ceremonial visit came nearly seven years after the team's public spat with Trump during his first term in office. The president abruptly disinvited the Eagles on the eve of their planned trip after their first Super Bowl title in 2018, amid reports that they were planning to bring only a small contingent of players to the White House. Trump's press secretary at the time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, publicly ripped the team for what she deemed \"a political stunt.\"\n\nGiven the previous acrimony between Trump and the Eagles, there were questions about whether Monday's trip to the White House would happen – or whether the president would even invite the team to visit in the first place. Trump extended an invitation last month, after the team publicly signaled it would accept one if offered.\n\n\"We just felt that this is a time-honored tradition, being invited by the White House,\" Eagles chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie told reporters at the NFL owners' meeting earlier this month. \"There was no reticence whatsoever. To be celebrated at the White House is a good thing. There were special circumstances back then (in 2018) that were very different.\"\n\nLurie added that \"it is totally an optional thing\" and would be left up to each player and coach to decide if they wanted to attend. That decision seemed to be easier for some players than others.\n\nWhich Eagles players didn't go to the White House?\n\nHurts and wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith were among the key players absent from the ceremony. A White House official told USA TODAY that Hurts would be among those not in attendance due to a \"scheduling conflict.\" When asked by a reporter last week if he would join the team in visiting Trump, Hurts said \"umm\" and did not otherwise respond.\n\nUltimately, 54 members of the Eagles' organization attended the ceremony, including Lurie, general manager Howie Roseman head coach Nick Sirianni and several assistant coaches and support staffers like chief security officer Dom DiSandro, who also got a mention from Trump. Barkley, offensive lineman Lane Johnson and safety Reed Blankenship were among the players in attendance.\n\nBarkley had spent time with Trump at his company's golf club in New Jersey one day earlier, even traveling to Washington with Trump on Air Force One later in the day. The running back responded to critics on X, formerly known as Twitter, by noting that he had also played golf with former president Barack Obama, who is a Democrat. \"Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand,\" Barkley wrote.\n\nEagles are rare NFL team to visit Trump White House\n\nThe act of celebrating a championship at the White House has become increasingly thorny under Trump, who has repeatedly used the world of sports as a battleground for cultural issues. During his first term, sports teams' visits were more sporadic than under past administrations, with several championship teams in the NBA and women's sports leagues either not invited or declining to attend.\n\nSo far during his second term, Trump has already hosted several teams, including the NHL's Florida Panthers and MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers. But the athletes who have chosen to visit the White House have also faced public criticism – claims that their attendance is a tacit endorsement of Trump's presidency, which has been mired in controversies.\n\nThe Dodgers' visit, for example, came after the Trump administration had scraped references to legendary former Dodger Jackie Robinson, the first Black player in MLB, from a government website as part of a broader initiative to eliminate references to diversity, equity and inclusion. (The page was later restored after public backlash.) Mookie Betts, the lone Black player on the team, decided to visit the White House after skipping a past visit under Trump in 2019.\n\n\"I just think the politics of today are so polarized that whatever you do, you’re going to be perceived to be supporting a political platform or a position,\" historian Frank Guridy said earlier this year.\n\nThe Eagles are just the second NFL team to visit the White House under Trump, who spent part of his first term criticizing the league and some of its players for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police brutality. The 2017 New England Patriots are the only other NFL team to have visited Trump's White House.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/us/brett-favre-race-deconstructed-newsletter-reaj", "title": "The Mississippi welfare scandal, Brett Favre and privilege | CNN", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA version of this story appeared in CNN’s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here.\n\nThe welfare funds scandal involving Brett Favre has left people reeling.\n\nA string of texts appears to show the Pro Football Hall of Famer pressuring former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, about funding the construction of a volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi – Favre’s alma mater and where his daughter played the sport at the time – though Favre had been told that misusing state funds was potentially illegal, per new court filings. The funding of the project was part of an investigation into millions of dollars of misspent public welfare funds within the Mississippi Department of Human Services.\n\nIt’s unclear how the matter might unfold. But, already, it’s revived discussion about an age-old pattern: In the wake of scandal, White athletes seem to be treated differently from their Black peers.\n\n“People believe there’s just more vitriol directed at Black athletes when they commit wrongdoings or give the appearance of messing up – and I think that’s more than fair. While no one is standing up for Favre, there isn’t this loud cry that he should lose everything,” the journalist Jemele Hill pointed out on Twitter.\n\n“People almost always want a pound of flesh when it comes to Black athletes, and it’s often unrelenting. So sometimes it’s not about coverage, but tone,” she added.\n\nTo further explore the issue, I spoke with Harry Edwards, a professor emeritus at UC Berkeley whose research interests include race relations and the sociology of sport. He’s also the author of the 1969 book “The Revolt of the Black Athlete,” about activism among Black athletes.\n\nOur conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat were your thoughts when you first heard about the scandal involving Brett Favre?\n\nWell, on the one hand, I was familiar with Favre’s history, even while he was playing in the league, so on that level, I didn’t think that something like this was outside the bounds of his capabilities, let’s say.\n\nOn the other hand, there’s an awful lot of publicity around this case. He hasn’t been charged with anything at this point, much less convicted of anything. But he’s become the face of this tragic situation.\n\nThe people who also should be the face of this situation are the former governor, the people who administer funds and so forth. But, instead, because of his fame, Favre has become the poster boy for ripping off poor people in the poorest state in the country.\n\nJemele Hill recently noted that Black athletes often face more vitriol following an allegation of wrongdoing. Would you agree that this is a theme?\n\nAbsolutely. We can look at this situation as part of the fabric of White privilege in US society. When a White athlete behaves in a detestable way, the incident tends to be sportswashed, which is typical when you’re dealing with athletic celebrity. But it’s also whitewashed. That’s the White privilege element of it.\n\nFor example, people talked for decades about Jack Johnson – the first Black American world heavyweight boxing champion – and his philandering and casual relationships with women. (He had several interracial relationships throughout the early 20th century.)\n\nIf you compare Johnson with Babe Ruth (the legendary baseball player, who was White and also involved in various affairs), you couldn’t get a credit card between them. But Ruth wasn’t just sportswashed; he was whitewashed. It became a situation of masculinity, prowess, virility. But it became an issue of degeneracy with Johnson. So, this goes back for decades. There’s whitewashing that goes on in combination with sportswashing.\n\nSportswashing: That’s a term I’m not familiar with. Could you say more about what it means?\n\nAthletic celebrity involves such an investment by masses of people. I mean, what kind of allegiance does it take to walk around in a jersey with someone else’s name on it? That kind of allegiance is very hard to reverse, unless it involves something perceived to be of greater sentiment or political, religious, personal or racial value.\n\nFor example, you had people who had worn Colin Kaepernick’s jersey start to burn it when he took a knee in protest of police violence against Black people. Something involving ripping off poor people, especially poor Black people? I don’t think that people are going to burn Favre’s jersey over that.\n\nTo me, this appears to be one of those situations where sport prevails over common decency, especially because the athlete was a winner. That’s what people buy into.\n\nWhat will you be keeping an eye on in the weeks ahead?\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how everything evolves and how long the issue remains a focus of conversation, especially since a lesser-valued group is being victimized and the scandal involves one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. At the end of the day, that’s what I’m looking for. It’ll also be interesting to see how the NFL responds.", "authors": ["Brandon Tensley"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}]}
