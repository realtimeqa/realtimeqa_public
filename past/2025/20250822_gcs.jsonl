Even when they don't brush the coast or make landfall, such storms can be deadly and cause millions of dollars of damage.\n\nErin is expected to remain hundreds of miles offshore, according to the National Hurricane Center, part of the National Weather Service. As of 5 p.m. Aug. 16, Erin is forecast to be centered roughly 600 miles east of Savannah on Aug. 20.\n\nBut because Erin is growing both in size and intensity, chances are increasing that it will still create rough conditions at sea and along beaches as it moves northward off the coast, the weather service says.\n\nMany lives have been lost during hurricanes that remained well offshore but created rough surf or deceptive conditions that can disguise hazardous rip currents. Over a 10-year period, about 10 to 15% of all deaths in tropical storms and hurricanes were attributed to rip currents, according to the hurricane center. That's one reason behind a new public safety campaign NOAA launched earlier this year – \"Blue IQ.\"\n\nErin and past storms also clearly demonstrate how dependent we are on overhead weather patterns to steer tropical storms and hurricanes away from the coast. Examples of these patterns include the jet stream and a ridge of high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean, known as the Bermuda High.\n\nWhat’s the chance Erin could veer closer to the coast?\n\nWhile the paths of many previous hurricanes have made wobbles or turns toward the coast, as Superstorm Sandy did in 2012, it's unlikely in this case, forecasts say.\n\nThe hurricane center’s skill at predicting storms – especially large, well-formed hurricanes – has improved significantly in recent years. That’s thanks in part to the years of federal science data that have been collected and fed into computer models that assist the center’s hurricane specialists in plotting forecasts.\n\nThe weather service, including the hurricane center, \"has done a pretty darned good job over the last five years of predicting the path of storms,\" said Rob Young, director of the program for the study of developed shorelines, a joint venture with Duke and Western Carolina universities.\n\nIn March 2025, the hurricane center announced its 2024 track forecast performance was the best in its history.\n\nThrough Aug. 21, the locations along the U.S. East Coast with the greatest risks of tropical storm force winds are Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where the center lists the risk at 6%. Cape Hatteras has only a 1% chance of experiencing hurricane-force winds and both locations have only a 1% chance of hurricane-force winds.\n\n'Storms like this can be beach eaters'\n\nBecause Erin is growing in size, it's increasing the risks for coastal erosion, rip currents and hazardous conditions at the coast, the weather service said. Meteorologists are already warning beachgoers and mariners to pay attention to conditions and forecasts as Erin approaches the offshore waters.\n\nThe hurricane center warns Erin’s swells are expected to affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos through August 17. Swells are then expected to spread into the Bahamas, Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast by August 18 and are likely to create life-threatening surf conditions and rip currents.\n\n\"These storms that stay offshore like this one is expected to do can still impact over 1,000 miles of coast with waves and a little storm surge,\" Young said. \"They're unlikely to knock down homes, unless those homes are already in the water.\" Such at-risk homes could include structures in southern St. Johns County on Florida's east coast and homes on a section of North Carolina's Outer Banks.\n\n\"Storms like this can be beach eaters,\" Young said. \"Storms like this can really chew up the sand,\" including on renourished beaches, even if the storms never come ashore, he said. \"Erin may still do what some folks would call damage to the beaches on the order of tens of millions of dollars.\"\n\nWhich storms took a path similar to Hurricane Erin?\n\nDozens of storms have traveled north offshore, often curving completely away from the coast without making landfall in the mainland United States or in Canada, but some leave damage in their wakes, in the form of erosion, coastal flooding and even deaths from rough seas. These are some of the more notable storms:\n\nHurricane Erin: The last time there was a Hurricane Erin was in September 2001. That Erin also traveled a northward path, farther offshore. A NASA satellite photo of the massive hurricane swirling offshore east of North Carolina and Virginia on September 11, 2001, also showed smoke trailing from the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center's twin towers.\n\nHurricane Bill: In August 2009, even though the hurricane was offshore of the U.S, two people died in large waves and rough seas: a 7-year-old girl in Acadia National Park in Maine and a 54-year-old in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, according to the hurricane center's after-storm report. The strong surf led to multiple rescues along the coast, as well as coastal flooding. The hurricane later made landfall in Newfoundland.\n\nHurricane Joaquin: Joaquin looped in the Bahamas in late September and early October of 2015, and then traveled northeast. After sailing into Joaquin, the SS El Faro was lost at sea on Oct. 1 and ultimately sunk, killing 33 crew members. A weather system that developed over the Southeast tapped into a steady stream of moisture from Joaquin and created days of rain, while high tides from the hurricane's swells all combined to cause historic flooding in South Carolina, including in Columbia and Charleston, even though the hurricane remained offshore.\n\nHurricane Lorenzo: Like Erin, 2019's Hurricane Lorenzo rapidly intensified and became a major hurricane. Even though it was centered much farther to the east in the Atlantic, Lorenzo created massive swells that caused \"hazardous surf and rip currents along U.S. beaches for several days,\" the hurricane center said. Eight people died in the storm's rough surf and rip currents, four in North Carolina, one in Florida, two in New York and one in Rhode Island.\n\nWhat's a 'fish storm?'\n\nMany hurricane veterans jokingly refer to hurricanes and tropical storms that remain offshore as \"fish storms,\" because they remain over the open ocean. However, Brian LaMarre, a veteran meteorologist who recently retired from the weather service, said this week there's \"a great deal more than fish out there\" given the dense shipping traffic and commerce networks offshore.\n\nImpacts from the waves and long-period swells can be \"incredibly disruptive and can extend hundreds of miles outward from these ocean storm systems,\" LaMarre said.\n\nTrack Erin's progress\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate change and the environment for USA TODAY.

For the latest news on Hurricane Erin, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Tuesday, Aug. 19.\n\nHurricane Erin fluctuated in intensity on Monday and expanded in size as people fled North Carolina's Outer Banks and forecasters warned of \"life-threatening\" rip currents and surf conditions along most of the East Coast.\n\nAfter losing some intensity over the weekend, Erin briefly strengthened back into a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. But by an 11 p.m. advisory from the National Hurricane Center, its winds had fallen to an estimated 125 mph after its north side encountered shearing winds. The forecast indicated Erin is slowing down in forward speed and may continue to see fluctuating wind speeds over the next couple of days as it gradually turns northward along a track between the United States and Bermuda.\n\n\"The core of Erin is expected to pass to the east of the southeastern and central Bahamas today and tonight, and move between Bermuda and the East Coast of the United States by the middle of the week,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nThe first hurricane to form this Atlantic season and the first to become a major storm, Erin was 690 miles southwest of Bermuda and 780 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras on Monday. Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island were placed under a mandatory evacuation as officials warned of possible storm surge, flooding, and tropical storm conditions.\n\nHurricane Erin path tracker: See where the Category 4 storm is headed\n\nThe system is expected to steer clear of the United States, though forecasters warn it could bring dangerous surf and rip current conditions to the Eastern Seaboard, all the way to Canada's Atlantic coast. According to the latest forecast, the Outer Banks face the biggest threat as coastal flooding could inundate the low-lying islands by midweek.\n\nParts of the North Carolina coast could get wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph from late Wednesday through Thursday and waves of 10 to 15 feet on the Outer Banks, AccuWeather said.\n\nOutside the country, a tropical storm warning was in place on Monday for the Turks and Caicos Islands as well as parts of the Bahamas, with forecasters warning of possible \"flash and urban flooding.\" Up to 8 inches of rain was possible across parts of the Southeastern Bahamas.\n\nErin is growing in size, and is expected to create high seas and large waves across hundreds of miles of ocean. By Tuesday, dangerous surf conditions are expected along the U.S. East Coast, hurricane center director Michael Brennan said in a video update on the storm.\n\n\"It's not going to be a safe environment to be in the ocean,\" he said, adding that though the weather can be pleasant on shore, dangerous and possibly life-threatening rip currents could be lurking in the water.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Tropical storm and storm surge watches were issued for parts of the Outer Banks in the latest National Hurricane Center update. A watch means conditions are possible within 48 hours. Coastal flooding may start Tuesday afternoon, more than 24 hours before tropical storm-force winds reach the area, the National Weather Service said.\n\n∎ Emergency officials rescued at least 60 people caught in rip currents and heavy surf on Aug. 18 in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, prompting a \"no swimming\" advisory through Friday.\n\nErin's waves could start causing damage by Tuesday\n\nIn a video update at 5 p.m. ET, Brennan warned the Outer Banks may have to contend with 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, the increase in water level above the normal tide that often accompanies hurricanes.\n\nEven though it's on track to pass well offshore of North Carolina, Erin's considerable size presents a danger to the state and other parts of the U.S. East Coast. Brennan said destructive wave action will start late Tuesday and peak overnight Wednesday and into Thursday.\n\n\"This is going to be a very significant event,\" he said. \"We could see widespread inundation of coastal roads like North Carolina Highway 12, some submersion of vehicles, some structural damage, and ocean water is going to extend well inland in some places and cause some significant threats to life and property.\"\n\nResident: Outer Banks island empties ahead of Hurricane Erin\n\nWhen news of the evacuation orders hit Hatteras Island, Fatty’s Treats & Tours was flooded with tourists complaining about having their vacations cut short, said the restaurant’s owner, Jeff Dawson.\n\nBut the island started emptying overnight during what is typically the height of tourist season, and Dawson expects to close down after lunch on Monday. “We've had one table so far,” Dawson said midday. \"So, a generally very busy day has been turned into an absolutely nothing day.\"\n\nThough county officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents beginning at 8 a.m. ET on Tuesday, Dawson plans to hunker down in his home, which is nestled in a small community in the woods of Buxton, North Carolina. He fears a tree might hit his house, but said he’s otherwise not particularly concerned about Hurricane Erin, having lived through countless storms since 1982.\n\nStill, Dawson said he expects to spend the next few days helping neighbors board up their windows and then clearing debris.\n\n\"I don't ever leave during storms because there's too much I can do to help,\" he said.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nFlorida beaches could see waves higher than 7 feet\n\nIn Jacksonville, ocean breakers exceeding seven feet are expected to begin Tuesday, according to the weather service, with the peak wave height around high tide on Wednesday.\n\nMinor coastal and tidal flooding is possible with \"at least moderate beach erosion,\" said Angela Enyedi, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Jacksonville. The high water could inundate boat ramps, parking lots, and some campgrounds, she said.\n\nWave heights offshore are climbing ahead of Erin's path, as illustrated by a buoy due east of Fort Pierce, Florida, about 400 miles east-northeast of Nassau in the Bahamas, that rose to more than 18 feet Monday. Further to the north, a buoy about 258 miles south of Cape Hatteras was recording waves over six feet in height, an increase of more than a foot over wave heights on the previous day.\n\nThere will be rip current threats at beaches along the coast before the higher surf arrives, according to the weather service. In East Central Florida, the weather service expects rough pounding surf with breakers of 5 feet to 8 feet this week.\n\nThe danger extends far beyond Florida. Weather service offices along the coast up to Maine are warning of hazardous conditions at the beach and potential coastal flooding.\n\nSome Outer Banks residents calm amid evacuation orders\n\nNot everyone on the Outer Banks' Hatteras Island appeared panicked about Hurricane Erin, despite mandatory evacuation orders.\n\nAngela Tawes, co-owner of Conners Supermarket, said there were few signs of the impending storm, other than longer-than-usual lines at the gas station.\n\n\"It's beautiful outside. The sky is blue. It's like 80-something degrees. There's no wind. It's gorgeous,\" Tawes told USA TODAY on Monday. \"It's really hard for people to be thinking there's a storm coming in a couple days.\"\n\nTawes said she expects to see many more people evacuating on Tuesday once signs of the storms appear. \"That’s when the chaos hits,\" she said.\n\nBrennan, the National Hurricane Center director, urged people not to minimize the potential for impacts along the coast, despite Erin's distance from shore. In the mid-Atlantic on Wednesday and Thursday, especially as Erin makes its closest approach to the U.S. along the Outer Banks, \"breaking waves of 15 to 20 feet plus coastal flooding and storm surge could over wash dunes and flood homes and flood roads and make some communities impassable,\" he said.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\n'The wind was really sandblasting everything'\n\nNicholas Himebaugh and his girlfriend drove several hours over the weekend from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to a national campground on the Outer Banks to relax and take in the beauty of the islands' beaches. But even days before Hurricane Erin prompted evacuation orders, Himebaugh said he could notice the storm's impact.\n\nThe couple only went briefly into the ocean and hugged the shore because of rip currents. Heavy waves slammed on the beach, and strong winds could be felt across the islands.\n\n\"The rip currents were very, very strong and the wind was really sandblasting everything,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nThe couple left on the afternoon of Sunday, hours before mandatory evacuations were issued for the islands of Ocracoke and Hatteras. Ferries off Ocracoke were already packed, and traffic on roads leading off the islands delayed the journey back home by at least two hours for Himebaugh and his girlfriend.\n\n\"There was a steady stream of people trying to get off the islands,\" he said.\n\nErin is huge – and getting larger\n\nErin is a huge storm and is expected to grow larger. As of Monday morning, its wind field was some 397 miles in diameter. In addition, Erin is creating seas of 10 feet or more across an area roughly 500 miles in diameter.\n\nErin ranks around the 80th percentile in terms of storm sizes of major hurricanes in the past couple of decades, John Cangialosi wrote in the National Hurricane Center's 5 a.m. ET discussion. Erin's wind field is forecast to grow over the next few days, as a cycle of eyewall replacements continues.\n\nSome of the largest hurricanes on record include 2012's enormous Hurricane Sandy, which was among the largest known Atlantic hurricanes with a wind field spanning approximately 1,100 miles. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 was also quite large, with a diameter of 580 miles.\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nHurricane Erin triggers evacuations for Outer Banks islands\n\nTwo counties in North Carolina declared states of emergency and issued mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the Outer Banks, a string of low-lying islands in the Atlantic Ocean dotted with quaint villages and fishing towns.\n\nOfficials for Dare and Hyde counties said Hurricane Erin is likely to cause major flooding, making it impossible to drive on Highway 12, which runs along the islands. Officials issued a mandatory evacuation for visitors in the islands of Ocracoke and Hatteras; mandatory orders for residents were set to take effect Tuesday.\n\n\"Dangerous waves, 20+ feet, will likely inundate and destroy protective dune structures along the highway,\" said a Hyde County news release. \"Life-threatening swimming and surfing conditions are expected.\"\n\nThe statement said \"it is extremely likely\" Hyde County emergency services won't be available if Highway 12 is washed over by heavy waves. \"Please take this warning seriously, especially if you have medical issues or are likely to need special care,\" the county said.\n\nFurthermore, the weather service advised residents on the Outer Banks to consider moving their cars to higher ground.\n\nTwo new potential storms being watched\n\nThe hurricane center is watching two tropical waves in the Eastern Atlantic.\n\nThe first disturbance is given a 60% chance of producing a tropical storm over the next seven days as it moves generally westward to northwestward toward the Windward Islands, which fringe the eastern edge of the Caribbean.\n\nThe second is a wave that just emerged off the west coast of Africa. It faces a chance of development for a day or two, but then is expected to encounter unfavorable conditions for development, the hurricane center said at 11 p.m. on Monday, Aug. 18.\n\nCategory 5 hurricanes not so 'rare' anymore?\n\nErin's brief flirtation with Category 5 winds over the weekend made it the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic since 2016. That is 11 in just nine years, according to University of Oklahoma student and hurricane mapmaker Michael Ferragamo.\n\nThat's the largest amount of Category 5 hurricanes recorded in a nine-year timeframe in the hurricane database (since 1851), he said.\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nErin briefly exploded into Category 5 hurricane\n\nErin formed into a hurricane from a tropical storm on Friday. The following day, the storm quickly intensified into a Category 5 hurricane with sustained minimum winds of 160 mph before it lost momentum and was downgraded to a Category 3.\n\nOver the weekend, the storm lashed Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, causing tens of thousands of power outages, flight cancellations, and closures across both islands. No deaths were reported, and crews have restored power to most of the homes and businesses that experienced outages.\n\nErin has since begun a new period of intensification, which could end Tuesday as it encounters wind shear, though forecasters say it will remain a major hurricane.\n\nEven hundreds of miles offshore, hurricanes can be damaging and deadly\n\nHurricane Erin is expected to take a path familiar to many as the massive storm moves northward parallel to the United States coast.\n\nDozens of hurricanes have made a similar trek in recent years, testing the nerves of millions who wait to see if the storms are destined to make any sharp left turns or wobbles toward the coast. Even when they don't brush the coast or make landfall, such storms can be deadly and cause millions of dollars of damage.\n\nMany lives have been lost during hurricanes that remained well offshore but created rough surf or deceptive conditions that can disguise hazardous rip currents. Over 10 years, about 10 to 15% of all deaths in tropical storms and hurricanes were attributed to rip currents, according to the hurricane center.\n\nRead more: Powerful Hurricane Erin could mimic damage from earlier hurricanes that stayed offshore\n\nHurricane Erin caused outages across Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands\n\nHurricane Erin's rainbands lashed Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rainfall over the weekend, resulting in power outages and temporary closures.\n\nNone of the islands saw major impacts from the storm, but in Puerto Rico, over 150,000 homes and businesses lost power, most of which have been restored, according to LUMA Energy.\n\n\"Today we should be overcoming the effects of the winds and rain brought by Hurricane Erin, which thank God, did not have major impacts in Puerto Rico,\" Gov. Jenniffer González said at a briefing Sunday, adding that schools and government offices were expected to open the following day.\n\nOver the weekend, nearly the entire island of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands was without electricity, though workers managed to restore power to most locations within hours, local officials said.\n\nWhen did the 2025 hurricane season begin?\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and lasts through the end of November.\n\nThe Atlantic basin includes the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of America, formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico. Based on a 30-year climate period from 1991 to 2020, the average Atlantic hurricane season has 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nActive hurricane weather typically peaks between mid-August and mid-October.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/08/08/rip-current-forecast-weekend-hurricane-season/85541331007/", "title": "Hurricane season heats up; danger possible at East Coast beaches", "text": "If you're headed to beaches along the East Coast over the Aug. 9 weekend, remain alert for possibly dangerous swimming conditions as a result of disturbed weather offshore.\n\nEven without a named tropical storm directly at the coast, waves and swells from distant storms hundreds of miles away can create life-threatening conditions in the water and at the beach.\n\nThere's plenty happening offshore or nearshore as of Aug. 7 that could make conditions rough in the water, and that may continue through the weekend, said Erik Heden, a warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Newport/Morehead City, North Carolina.\n\n\"Love the beach and respect the ocean,\" Heden said, borrowing a phrase from Dare County on North Carolina's Outer Banks.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the National Hurricane Center was watching an area of disturbed weather off the Southeast Coast that had about a 20% chance of developing into a tropical storm and a tropical wave that had emerged off the west African coast showed potential for development. Marine forecasters also were still watching Dexter, the former tropical storm about 1,000 miles east of Cape Cod. And the full moon on Aug. 9 could add to the effect of rip currents and waves.\n\nWaters from North Carolina to Long Island could hold a moderate to high risk of rip currents on August 7 and 8, and possibly further into the weekend, Heden said. \"Anytime you get ocean storms, whether they be full tropical cyclones or strong areas of low pressure, or an onshore flow you can get rip currents.\"\n\nRip currents are narrow, powerful currents of water that can form perpendicular to the beach and flow quickly away. They can be powerful enough to carry even strong swimmers away from shore. Unlike thunderstorms and lightning that you can see and hear, Heden said rip currents aren't as obvious and can occur days before or after a storm.\n\nRip currents, rough surf and other strong currents – even at beaches not on the ocean – kill dozens of people in the United States and territories each year. As of July 17, the National Weather Service had reported at least 25 deaths this year from rip currents, including 10 in Florida, six in Puerto Rico, three in Texas, two each in South Carolina and Hawaii and one each in Guam and North Carolina.\n\nAnother two dozen fatalities have occurred in the surf zone so far this year, including seven attributed to high surf and sneaker waves, the weather service has reported.\n\nStorms can be fatal even when they don't make landfall. In 2019, as Hurricane Lorenzo moved northward off the Atlantic Coast, \"we lost eight people from Florida up through Rhode Island,\" he said.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, parent agency to the weather service, and others have worked to emphasize the risk of rip currents and how to stay safer while recreating outdoors. For example, earlier this year, the National Hurricane Center launched a rip current graphic to illustrate the dangers associated with tropical storms, even when they're long distances away.\n\nOver a 10-year period, about 10-15% of all deaths in tropical storms and hurricanes were attributed to rip currents, the hurricane center said. Earlier this year, NOAA launched a new public safety campaign \"Blue IQ\" focused on hazards in the surf.\n\nStaying safe in a rip current\n\nOne of the singlemost important things to remember about a rip current is that it doesn't pull a swimmer under, it pulls you out away from the beach. So, staying calm and remembering to swim parallel to the beach can help you escape the rip and save your life, advises Heden and many others.\n\nOne of the newer pressing concerns is an increase in deaths from bystanders who try to help people caught up in rip currents, Heden said.\n\nHe offers the following additional points for rip current safety.\n\nSwim at a life-guarded beach.\n\nAlways know your location when you're at the beach, so you could tell 911 operators.\n\nIf someone is caught in a rip current, call 911 immediately.\n\nInstead of going in after someone, give them directions from shore, or throw them a floatation device\n\nKnow the forecast before you get in the water\n\nHow can you spot a rip current?\n\nHeden and the weather service offer the following ways to help identify rip currents:\n\nMore common near low tide and jetties or piers.\n\nOften found in areas where it may look like a good place to swim because waves aren't breaking there.\n\nWater might be darker in color, or have a line of debris moving away from shore.\n\nEasier to spot from an elevated viewpoint such as a beach access.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, writes about climate change, violent weather and other news.

For the latest news on Hurricane Erin, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Wednesday, Aug. 20.\n\nHurricane Erin slowly moved northward on Tuesday, triggering rough surf and dangerous rip currents along the East Coast that have already resulted in dozens of water rescues, swimming bans, and beach closures across the region.\n\nHundreds of thousands of beachgoing tourists were keeping a watchful eye on the massive hurricane as Erin was expected to produce life-threatening conditions for the Atlantic Coast from central Florida to Canada. The National Hurricane Center urged beachgoers in those areas to follow advice from lifeguards, local authorities, and beach warning flags.\n\nEvacuations were underway along parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks, a big draw for vacationers every summer. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon \"to assist with the response and to mobilize resources.\"\n\nWith Erin's predicted storm surge and waves of over 10 feet, the National Weather Service advised people in the Outer Banks to stay out of the ocean to avoid deadly surf conditions expected through at least Thursday. Tropical storm conditions were forecast to arrive by Wednesday evening or night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"The storm surge will be accompanied by large waves, leading to significant beach erosion and overwash, making some roads impassible,\" the hurricane center said in its key messages at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nTropical storm conditions were also possible along the southeastern coast of Virginia — where a tropical storm watch was in effect — on Thursday, according to the hurricane center. The agency advised interests in the mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts to monitor the progress of Erin due to potential strong winds on Thursday and Friday.\n\nErin was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane earlier Tuesday but remained powerful, driving sustained winds of 100 mph by late night. Erin was moving north-northwest at nearly 12 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in an 11 p.m. ET advisory.\n\nThe storm appeared to be making the long-forecast, slow cruise northward hundreds of miles offshore − and no U.S. landfall was forecast. Still, Erin's large and expanding wind fields mean storm-driven waves, coastal erosion, and high seas are expected to batter areas of the coast, especially along the Outer Banks, the barrier islands that fringe the coast of North Carolina.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Bermuda's weather service issued a tropical storm watch for the archipelago, which has seven main islands and a total population of 65,000.\n\n∎ Winds with tropical-storm force from Erin will probably extend outward more than 230 miles from its center, AccuWeather said. According to the outlet, wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph could impact parts of the mid-Atlantic and even southeastern Massachusetts as the storm heads north later in the week.\n\n∎ The National Weather Service office in the Baltimore/Washington area has issued advisories that include a coastal flood warning for Annapolis, Maryland, where flooding is expected within 36 hours.\n\nBeach closures along the East Coast\n\nVacationers at beaches were forced to forgo the final days of summer sand due to swimming bans and beach closures in North Carolina, parts of New Jersey, Delaware, and New York City, as high waves and rip currents whipped up the surf.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said all the city's beaches will be closed for swimming on Wednesday and Thursday \"due to dangerous riptides from Hurricane Erin.\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy urged visitors and residents to avoid wading or swimming in the ocean, citing the dangerous rip currents and high waves.\n\nOn Tuesday, officials in Cape May, Ocean City, and Longport ordered beachgoers to stay out of the water altogether. The ocean was largely off limits in beach towns that included Atlantic City and Ventnor.\n\n\"Conditions are deadly,\" Ocean City's Beach Patrol said in a Facebook post. \"Do not enter the ocean until further notice.\"\n\n'Window to safely evacuate is closing quickly'\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, officials in Dare County warned that roads, including the main exit route, could soon be overwhelmed by water. In neighboring Hyde County, a mandatory evacuation order went into effect Tuesday for Ocracoke Island.\n\n\"Dare County remains under a State of Emergency and a Mandatory Evacuation order is in effect for Hatteras Island,\" the county posted on social media. \"Please note that N.C. Hwy. 12 may be impassable by August 19 at 5 p.m.\"\n\nThe villages under the evacuation order include Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco, and Hatteras. County officials urged residents to immediately evacuate, warning that the \"window to safely evacuate is closing quickly, as coastal flooding and overwash is already beginning to occur along vulnerable stretches of N.C. Highway 12—and is expected to continue to worsen with the approach of today’s high tide.\"\n\nCounty officials noted that once coastal flooding begins, inundation will persist for several days and will worsen with each high tide. Though the most severe impacts from the storm are expected on Hatteras Island, county officials advised residents and visitors north of Oregon Inlet to remain alert.\n\nNWS warns of submerged cars, dangerous surf for Outer Banks\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Newport/Morehead, which provides forecasts for the Outer Banks, has spared no effort in alerting residents and visitors about the incoming danger from Erin.\n\nIn addition to showing a portion of the crucial Highway 12 in Buxton already starting to flood two hours before high tide on Tuesday, the office is warning that the storm's impacts will be prolonged, with some roads being impassable or inaccessible for days. \"Vehicles will likely be submerged,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe office also predicted a storm surge of up to 3 feet and said waves in the surf zone could reach 15 to 20-plus feet, likely causing severe damage.\n\n\"Despite the path of Erin forecast to remain offshore, the threat for life-threatening rip currents, damaging beach erosion, major coastal flooding and overwash, and extremely dangerous surf is expected,'' the weather service said in a situational overview Tuesday shortly after 5 p.m. ET.\n\nErin expected to grow\n\nAt 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Erin was about 585 miles southwest of Bermuda and 570 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras. The center of Erin was forecast to pass to the east of the Bahamas on Tuesday and then move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nA tropical storm watch was extended north to Chincoteague, an island off the Virginia coast.\n\nA storm surge warning was issued for the Outer Banks from Cape Lookout to Duck, meaning there's a danger of life-threatening rising water moving inland from the coastline during the next 36 hours. A tropical storm warning is also in effect from Beaufort Inlet to Duck.\n\n\"Erin forecast to substantially grow in size while moving over the western Atlantic through the week,\" National Hurricane Center meteorologist Robbie Berg wrote in a public advisory. \"Dangerous rip currents expected along U.S. East Coast beaches.\"\n\nErin's strength could still fluctuate before it finally begins to wind down later in the week, according to the center's forecast.\n\nScores of swimmers rescued\n\nLifeguards have rescued dozens of people from the churning waters along East Coast beaches even as Hurricane Erin remains hundreds of miles offshore. Officials in North Carolina said at least 60 people had to be rescued from rip currents at Wrightsville Beach, prompting a no-swim order in place through the rest of the week, according to reporting from the Wilmington Star-News, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nAnother person was rescued from rip currents at a South Carolina beach, and a dozen rip currents were reported at South Carolina and Georgia beaches on Aug. 18, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said.\n\nThe threat exists up and down the entire East Coast, hurricane forecasters said. Beaches as far north as Massachusetts are closed to swimmers due to rough surf. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, officials said beachgoers were restricted to getting knee-deep into the water and were prohibited from using boogie boards. Read more here.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nDozens rescued from rip currents as Hurricane Erin brings danger to East Coast beaches\n\nOuter Banks at risk\n\nTropical storm and storm surge watches were in effect for parts of the Outer Banks and coastal North Carolina, which means tropical storm winds and higher-than-normal sea levels are possible. The hurricane center warned that storm surge could cause the water to rise 2 to 4 feet above dry ground along the Outer Banks as Erin pushes northward.\n\nSome roads could remain impassable in several locations for several days. Dare County announced that transportation was available on Tuesday to a shelter in Warren County.\n\n\"Individuals evacuating on the buses need to bring clothing and medications for 7 days,\" the county said in a statement. It said shelters are available for dogs and cats and that owners can transport these pets on the buses.\n\nDare County has a permanent population of about 37,000, but the population balloons from June through August to about 225,000 to 300,000, according to the county's website.\n\nThe county said several Facebook accounts were sharing misinformation surrounding Hurricane Erin. \"The Town of Kill Devil Hills truly said it best: \"Misinformation spreads quicker than storms,'\" the county said on social media.\n\n\"The photos shown here are examples of false, AI-generated images and videos that have been circulating,\" the post warned. \"Stay informed by following trusted sources for information.\"\n\nTwo tropical systems lurk in the Atlantic\n\nHurricane Erin is the current concern of meteorologists, and not the only one.\n\nForecasters are monitoring two tropical systems in the Atlantic − one in the central part of the ocean, the other off the coast of Africa − and gauging whether they could develop into a named storm. If so, the next one will be called Fernand.\n\nAt this point, neither disturbance appears to be a threat to land, though the National Hurricane Center gives the one farther west a 60% chance of developing.\n\nThe hurricane season, which began June 1, has yet to reach its midpoint, so plenty more activity is expected before the season's closure at the end of November.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nSome fishing excursions put on hold in New Jersey\n\nIn Asbury Park, New Jersey, boats were tied up and fishing trips were being canceled or delayed this week. Erin's swell could see waves build to 22 feet in the underwater Hudson canyon that sprawls for hundreds of miles along the shores of New Jersey and New York, forecasters said.\n\nThe timing isn't good − the mid-Atlantic fishing competition was scheduled to run from Aug. 17 to Aug. 21 with over $3.2 million in cash payouts at stake. The event kicked off amid much fanfare in Cape May, New Jersey, and Ocean City, Maryland. For the safety of tournament participants, staff, sponsors, and venues, the competition directors announced that the competition will run an extra day, through Saturday.\n\n\"Tournament staff have been closely monitoring all aspects and impacts the storm would have on the event,\" a statement on the competition's website said. \"We take date changes very seriously, but don’t see any way to avoid it under these exceptional circumstances.\"\n\n− Dan Radel, Asbury Park Press\n\n'Not going to be a safe environment to be in the ocean'\n\nDangerous conditions in the surf zone with large, breaking waves are forecast from East Central Florida to Canada's Atlantic Coast beginning Tuesday, Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan has warned. Brennan is pleading with U.S. residents to take Erin's potential coastal impacts seriously, even though the nation will be spared a direct landfall.\n\nOffshore wave heights could exceed 20 to 30 feet.\n\nHigh tides are also expected to bring higher-than-normal water levels further southward along the coast, the weather service has warned.\n\n\"It's not going to be a safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said, adding that even when the weather may be pleasant on shore, dangerous and possibly life-threatening rip currents could be lurking in the water.\n\nBecause of its slow movement, coastal areas of North Carolina are expected to feel the brunt of the ocean's impacts for several days, according to the weather service office in Newport/Morehead City. Mandatory evacuations were issued Aug. 18 for Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island.\n\nWhat's next behind Hurricane Erin?\n\nFollowing behind Erin is yet another tropical wave that's given a 60% chance of becoming a tropical storm over the next seven days, the hurricane center said. A third disturbance just moved off the West African coast, but it's expected to encounter hostile conditions that may limit its further development.\n\nWhen did Hurricane Erin form?\n\nErin formed on Aug. 11 from a tropical wave that moved across the Cabo Verde Islands. By Aug. 15, it was a hurricane and quickly joined the ranks of the fastest intensifying hurricanes in Atlantic history, increasing its winds by 85 mph in about 21 hours.\n\nIt has mostly spared the islands along the Eastern Caribbean but soaked Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and portions of the Southeastern Bahamas with up to 8 inches of rain. Its winds caused widespread power outages in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nDoes a Category 5 hurricane say anything about the rest of the season?\n\nThough the Atlantic hurricane season that started June 1 is forecast to be more active than normal, Dan Brown, branch chief of the center's hurricane specialists, said that Erin's formation has no bearing on what may happen later in the season.\n\nAnd Levi Silvers, a research scientist at Colorado State University, pointed out that it only takes one intense landfalling hurricane to make it a disastrous season.\n\nContributing: Lori Comstock, NorthJersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2024/08/15/noaa-hurricane-tracker-ernesto-impacts-florida-bermuda/74800049007/", "title": "Hurricane Ernesto path moves toward Bermuda: Weather impacts ...", "text": "After battering Puerto Rico with torrential rain, Hurricane Ernesto is now heading toward Bermuda.\n\nErnesto strengthened overnight, with winds now at 85 mph.

A prolonged period of strong winds and storm surge is expected on Bermuda beginning late Friday, and a hurricane warning is in effect for the island. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion. Rainfall associated with Ernesto is expected to begin to affect Bermuda this evening and may result in flash flooding Friday through this weekend. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S. East Coast, swells generated by the storm are expected to reach the area during the next few days, including over the weekend. Beach goers should be aware of a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards.

Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 6 to 12 inches in Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts up to 15 inches. This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding.\n\n➤ Excessive rainfall forecast\n\nSURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas. These swells will spread toward Bermuda later today. Swells are expected to reach the east coast of the United States tonight and continue into the weekend.

Just a day earlier, Erin's sustained winds had reached 160 mph.\n\nA mandatory evacuation order was issued for Hatteras Island, a barrier island located off the North Carolina coast, on Aug. 17. Local officials said they anticipated life-threatening impacts due to coastal flooding and ocean overwash that was expected to begin as early as Aug. 19.\n\nErin, still a major hurricane, is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the first to reach hurricane status. And Erin is growing in size, a trend expected to continue over the next few days, according to the hurricane center.\n\nErin was moving west-northwest at nearly 13 mph on Aug. 17 and was expected to gradually turn to the northwest on Aug. 18 and Aug. 19, the hurricane center said. The storm's core was forecast to pass the east and northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas for the night into Aug. 18.\n\n\"Some increase in size and strength is forecast during the next 48 hours,\" the hurricane center said in its 5 p.m. ET advisory. \"Erin is likely to remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.\"\n\nThe storm's dangerous eyewall will most likely remain at sea, but the storm can do damage from afar, AccuWeather warned. The government of the Bahamas on Aug. 17 issued a tropical storm warning for the southeast Bahamas.\n\n\"Combined with any shifts in track, this could bring tropical storm-to-hurricane conditions to parts of the U.S. Atlantic Coast,\" AccuWeather warned.\n\nRichard Pasch, senior Hurricane Specialist for the hurricane center, was among forecasters warning that Erin was expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip currents along the beaches of the United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada for several days.\n\nImpacts from Erin are expected in Outer Banks of North Carolina\n\nThe hurricane center advised that interests along the Outer Banks of North Carolina monitor the storm's progress as there is a risk of strong winds associated with the outer rainbands during the middle part of the week.\n\nThe agency's forecast products have also increased the percentage of tropical storm force winds at Cape Hatteras to 14%, advising that wind probabilities are likely being underestimated beyond 36 hours because the size of the storm's wind field is \"considerably larger than average.\" Cape Hatteras is located on Hatteras Island, one of the barrier islands of North Carolina.\n\n\"While we still expect Erin to track well offshore, impacts along the Outer Banks due to waves and coastal flooding are expected,\" the National Weather Service office in Newport and Morehead City, North Carolina, said on Aug. 17. \"The risk for high rip currents will begin tomorrow and continue through the week.\"\n\nThe hurricane center also warned that the storm is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the U.S. East Coast, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada over the next several days. Tropical storm conditions were forecast in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas on Aug. 17 and Aug. 18.\n\nLocal state of emergency issued for North Carolina county\n\nOfficials in Dare County, the easternmost county in North Carolina with an estimated population of about 37,000, declared a state of emergency on Aug. 17. The declaration went into effect at 6 p.m. local time.\n\nA mandatory evacuation was issued for residents and visitors in Hatteras Island, including the unincorporated villages of Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco, and Hatteras.\n\nCounty officials said that while the storm is expected to stay off the North Carolina coast, it was forecast to increase in size and bring life-threatening impacts to the county coastline. A coastal flood watch has already been issued for Dare County, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe county noted that coastal flooding and ocean overwash were expected to begin as early as Aug. 19 and continue through Aug. 21. Officials warned that parts of North Carolina Highway 12 on Hatteras Island will \"likely be impassable for several days.\"\n\nThe weather service said coastal flooding could cause a significant threat to life and property, and that severe flooding is expected to extend inland. A high surf advisory was also issued for the area, meaning that large breaking waves reaching over 15 to 20 feet should be expected in the surf zone.\n\nPuerto Rico avoids 'major impacts' from Erin\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González said public schools and government offices plan to be open Aug. 18. The University of Puerto Rico's Río Piedras campus will be open if power can be restored promptly, she said.\n\nMore than 150,000 LUMA Energy customers were without power midday on Aug. 17. The company posted photos on social media of its employees in the communities working to restore power.\n\nBy 7:30 p.m. local time, LUMA Energy said in an update that about 95% of customers had power, and the majority of affected customers were concentrated in the areas of Caguas, Mayagüez and San Juan as rainbands moved away from Puerto Rico.\n\nAdditional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with locally higher amounts to 6 inches, is expected across Puerto Rico through Monday, the hurricane center said. The agency also warned that locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or mudslides, were possible.\n\nGonzález urged residents to stay out of the water but said the worst of the storm had moved on.\n\n\"Today we should be overcoming the effects of the winds and rain brought by Hurricane Erin, which thank God did not have major impacts in Puerto Rico,\" González said at a briefing.\n\nForecasters eye two potential storms in addition to Hurricane Erin\n\nErin aided by warm waters\n\nAccuWeather explains that Erin struggled through relatively cool water and dry air early last week. But it gained momentum quickly from Thursday to Saturday, rolling over much warmer water while surrounded by moisture.\n\nErin was a tropical storm before gaining hurricane status on Aug. 15. It became a major hurricane early on Aug. 16 when sustained winds exceeded 110 mph to gain Category 3 status, and later that day grew to a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph before those winds began to ebb.\n\nErin's power expected to fluctuate but remain dangerous\n\nErin has experienced a hurricane phenomenon called an eyewall replacement, AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said. As the old eyewall expands outward, a new eyewall forms closer to the center.\n\n\"Top winds often ease back during this cycle, but it is followed by another surge in wind intensity as the new eye completes organization,\" Buckingham warned.\n\nErin's core not expected to reach US shores\n\nEarlier on Aug. 17, nearly the entire island of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands was without electricity early on Aug. 17 — 19,126 out of 23,252 customers, according to PowerOutage.us. By 9:30 p.m. local time, only 2,073 customers remained without power. Only scattered outages were reported on St. John and St. Croix.\n\nThe core of Erin is expected to pass to the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas late on Aug. 17 and on Aug. 18. The meteorological services of France and the Netherlands discontinued tropical storm watches for St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, and Sint Maarten, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nU.S. shores are unlikely to see a direct hit, but a strong offshore hurricane can produce massive and dangerous waves well away from its center, AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\n\n\"The storm is forecast to remain hundreds of miles off the East Coast,\" DaSilva said, adding that \"beaches along the entire East Coast, from Florida to New England and Atlantic Canada, will likely experience rough surf and dangerous rip currents as Erin tracks north and eventually northeast.\"\n\nSwells generated by Erin will continue to affect parts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands for the next couple of days, the hurricane center said. These swells will spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the early and middle portions of the week.\n\nHurricane Erin tracker: See map of the storm's forecasted path\n\n'Major coastal flooding' possible in North Carolina\n\nHurricane Center director Michael Brennan said 50-foot waves could occur near the center and to the right of Erin as the storm moves north, resulting in large breaking waves at beaches along the coast. Wave heights, long-period swells, and life-threatening rip currents — powerful currents of water that can rapidly carry swimmers out to deeper waters — are expected to increase along East Coast beaches by Aug. 18, according to the hurricane center and local National Weather Service offices.\n\nEven from far offshore, \"the threat for life-threatening rip currents, damaging beach erosion, major coastal flooding and extremely dangerous surf is increasing,\" the National Weather Service office in Morehead City, North Carolina, said on Aug. 17. Wave heights could range from 12 to 20 feet along the Outer Banks, the office reports.\n\nAccuWeather said Portions of the Outer Banks and the Virginia beaches will experience a storm surge up to several feet and \"significant\" coastal flooding and beach erosion. North Carolina's Highway 12 could see heavy overwash with closures possible beginning around midweek.\n\nHow fast did Hurricane Erin intensify?\n\nErin quickly exceeded expectations, undergoing a period of strengthening that the hurricane center refers to as \"rapid intensification.\" Erin's burst of intensification will be among the most rapid ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nErin's winds increased 45 mph in just 12 hours overnight on Aug. 15, from 75 mph to 120 mph. Ultimately, its wind speeds increased a total of 80 mph in just 18 hours from Friday to Saturday.\n\nIn a post-season summary of the 2024 hurricane season, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that Hurricane Milton's rate of intensification — 90 mph in 24 hours in October 2024 — was \"among the highest ever observed.\"\n\nAt least two other hurricanes have exceeded that increase. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma's winds increased to 125 mph in 24 hours. In 2007, wind speeds in Hurricane Felix increased by 100 mph in 24 hours, according to hurricane center data.\n\nHurricane Erin brings heavy rain to Puerto Rico\n\nThe tropical storm watch in the Southeast Bahamas means tropical storm conditions are possible within the area for over 24 hours. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, meaning tropical storm conditions are expected within 24 hours.\n\nRain bands in Erin's expanding quadrants raked Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late Aug. 16, with heavy rain and tropical storm force wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, prompting flash flood warnings in some locations. The National Weather Service warned that up to 8 inches of rain was possible.\n\nOn the night of Aug. 16, a buoy near the storm in a north-northeastward direction from San Juan, Puerto Rico, was recording significant wave heights of 22 to 28 feet. That's the average of the highest one-third of waves being measured at the buoy.\n\nWhat else is happening in the Atlantic?\n\nStorm activity is increasing in the Atlantic Ocean as the 2025 hurricane season reaches the time of year when peak activity traditionally begins. Along with Hurricane Erin, the National Hurricane Center is monitoring two other potential tropical disturbances; one is a couple of hundred miles off the North Carolina coast, with a very low percentage of developing into a tropical storm; another is in the eastern region of the central tropical Atlantic.\n\nA westward-moving tropical wave could produce an area of low pressure in the tropical Atlantic late in the week of Aug. 18, the hurricane center said. But the center shows a 20% chance of storm formation over the next week. If the wave beats the odds and becomes the next named tropical storm, it would receive the name Fernand.\n\nA long-term outlook from the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also shows the potential for storm formation increasing between the eastern Caribbean and the African coast. It lists the chances of storm formation in the central tropical Atlantic at greater than 40% during the seven days beginning on Aug. 20.\n\nWhen did the 2025 hurricane season begin?\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and lasts through the end of November. The Atlantic basin includes the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of America. Based on a 30-year climate period from 1991 to 2020, the average Atlantic hurricane season has 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nActive hurricane weather typically peaks between mid-August and mid-October.\n\nThe eastern Pacific has a slightly longer hurricane season, running from May 15 to November 30. The eastern Pacific basin extends from Mexico and Central America westward.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricane/2025/08/18/jacksonville-beach-rescue-to-monitor-deadly-week-long-currents-by-erin/85708415007/", "title": "Jacksonville Beach rescue to monitor deadly week-long currents by ...", "text": "AI-assisted summary Hurricane Erin, a Category 4 storm, is churning offshore and expected to cause dangerous beach conditions in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nA High Rip Current Risk is in effect through Thursday, with high surf and beach erosion expected Tuesday through Thursday.\n\nDaily showers and thunderstorms are anticipated throughout the week, with potential for heavy rain, strong winds, and localized flooding.\n\nBoaters are advised to exercise caution due to a Small Craft Advisory in effect from tonight through Friday.\n\nJacksonville is bracing for dangerous beach conditions this week as Category 4 Hurricane Erin churns offshore.

The storm strike was unlike any this part of Florida has ever seen.\n\n\"Hurricanes Milton and Helene are likely to go down as one of the most devastating one-two statewide punches of all time.\" Truchelut said. \"My goal is to keep you safe by providing accurate, no-hype, real-time information through the time Milton is inland and weakening and we have a good idea how things will play out.\"\n\nHere is a blow-by-blow account of Milton's collision into Florida.\n\n12:50 a.m.: Signing off, but Milton has a long way to go and more surge, rain and wind to inflict upon Florida\n\nWith Milton tracking predictably along the NHC track and having just laid out forecast expectations for east-central and northeast Florida, I’m going to wrap up WeatherTiger’s live coverage for the night with a final check in on the three ongoing hazards from Milton to Central Florida: surge, rain, and wind.\n\nSurge remains an ongoing life-threatening hazard across southwest and west-central Florida and will continue to be so through the night.\n\nWe don’t have live tidal gauges between Fort Myers and Tampa Bay, but onshore tropical-storm-force winds out of the west are still driving coastal flooding higher in the region, and may do so for several more hours depending on your location. The surge threat will mount through morning along the Northeast Florida coast, where Daytona Beach is seeing 75-80 mph onshore wind gusts currently.\n\nThe flooding rainfall threat is the most serious inland hazard. Flash Flood Warnings are currently in effect for the entire I-4 corridor and north to Ocala and Palm Coast across central Florida, as well as for the entire Tampa Bay area.\n\nStorm totals along and just north of I-4 are heading for the 10-15” range, and this area is at high risk of overnight flash and urban flooding, which will continue into tomorrow morning and slowly end from west to east.\n\nThe wind threat is slowly winding down in the Tampa Bay area, but increasing in the Orlando area. Both Orlando and Daytona Beach airports just reported wind gusts of around 85 mph in the past hour, and peak inland wind gusts of 70-85 mph are most likely in the I-4 corridor through about 5 a.m. when Milton will exit the coast near Cape Canaveral.\n\nDamaging hurricane-force wind gusts are also expected along the northeast Florida coastline through the morning hours.\n\nThis storm still has a long way to go, so keep sheltering in place across Central Florida. I’ll be back in the morning with an update. Until then, good night.\n\n12:10 a.m.: Lake Wales once again the crossing point for an infamous hurricane\n\nThe 12 a.m. NHC update still has Milton as a Category 2 hurricane, still hustling east-northeast at 16 mph. Milton is now located in Polk County very near Lake Wales.\n\nIf that sounds familiar in hurricane Florida lore, it’s because Lake Wales was the infamous triple point where the paths of Charley, Frances, and Jeanne crossed 20 years ago in the brutal 2004 hurricane season.\n\nOn another note, wrapping up the liveblog shortly.\n\n11:55p: Northeast Florida overnight threats: Erosion coming to Daytona Beach; wind and rain will lash Duval and Volusia\n\nEven as onshore flow continues to cause rising storm surge in southwest Florida (more on this in next post), we do also need to think about the Atlantic coast as well, where surge and wind will combine to cause a damaging and impactful hurricane event.\n\nWith the new NHC track bringing Milton out of Florida through Cape Canaveral, significant surge is a major concern for Volusia County north to Jacksonville and coastal Georgia where the strongest winds tomorrow morning will be out of the north or northeast.\n\nThe NHC forecast as of 11 p.m. is unchanged, calling for 3-5’ of surge in this area. If history is any indication, this is also going to cause major beach erosion issues in Daytona Beach, Flagler Beach, and St. Augustine (etc), as onshore flow continues through the day on Thursday.\n\nWith Daytona Beach already recording a 76 mph wind gust out of the northeast in the last hour, wind gusts in the upper 70s and 80s are also a good bet overnight and through the mid-morning Thursday in Volusia north to St. Johns Counties.\n\nThis might be a little lower in coastal Duval County, but gusts in the 60-75 mph range are likely there. Finally, Volusia County is also in line for storm totals of 10”+ of rainfall, and flooding is a major risk both along the coast and inland.\n\n11:30 p.m.: Orlando area overnight threats: Extreme rainfall, flash flooding and 60+ mph winds coming\n\nWith the heaviest of the rainfall and strongest winds finally leaving the Tampa Bay area, east-central Florida is now in line for its worst weather, which is starting now and will continue through about 5 a.m.\n\nExtreme rainfall and flash flooding is the primary threat and concern, and a Flash Flood Warning is already in effect for much of Metro Orlando. Stay off the roads, as existing flooding will continue to worsen past midnight as rain rates of 1-3”+/hr overwhelm drainage systems and inundate low-lying areas.\n\nWe are also heading for another long-term flood of the St. Johns River basin, as happened following Ian, with the Orlando Metro and east-central Florida, especially areas along and north of I-4, likely to see 10”+ storm totals from Milton.\n\nThe overnight wind risk is notable as well in east-central Florida. Wind gusts so far in the Orlando Metro area are mostly in the 60-65 mph range at the airports. The highest inland winds are still in the northwestern eyewall over west-central Florida, which will angle northeast overnight.\n\nWith peak wind gusts in Polk County already in the 75-95 mph range and a recent 75 mph wind gust in Leesburg, expect wind gusts out of the northeast to peak out in the 65-80 mph range across east-central Florida, possibly backloaded in the 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. range.\n\nRains should diminish and winds drop off towards daybreak as Milton races away from Cape Canaveral.\n\n11:05 p.m.: Look for Milton to exit Florida at 5 a.m. through Cape Canaveral and Brevard County\n\nThe new NHC advisory package at 11 p.m. finds Milton centered about 75 miles southwest of Orlando, continuing on an east-northeast heading of 60 degrees at 16 mph.\n\nMilton remains a Category 2 hurricane with 105 mph sustained winds, and the next forecast point for 8 a.m. tomorrow already has Milton well east of Cape Canaveral as a Category 1 hurricane; at this rate, Milton will likely exit the Florida peninsula via Brevard County by 5 a.m. or so.\n\nNext couple of posts will focus on overnight and morning wind/rain impacts in the Orlando area and northeast Florida coastline, respectively.\n\n10:45 p.m.: St. Petersburg airport clocks a 101 mph wind\n\nAs the center of Milton works into Polk County, the western eyewall is continuing to produce destructive winds in the Tampa Bay region within the life-threatening flash flood event.\n\nSt. Petersburg airport just saw a gust to 101 mph, and Sarasota is still gusting to 85 mph. Westerly winds and rising tide will continue to bring storm surge into Southwest and west-central Florida through the night.\n\nBack with the 11 p.m. NHC advisory soon.\n\n10:25 p.m.: Extreme rainfall threat continues; steer clear of floodwaters\n\nAs shown on the long radar loop of Milton, a persistent band of heavy rainfall has set up (as anticipated) along the I-4 corridor, where Milton and a front are colliding.\n\nRain rates of 1” an hour up to an incredible 5” an hour have characterized this band, which will shift northeast and continue to crank through the night across Central Florida.\n\nThree-day totals in Pinellas and Hillsborough range from 7-17” so far, and it’s still raining hard there and will be into the early morning hours.\n\nTake the Flash Flood Emergency for the emergency it is in the Bay Area, stay indoors, and avoid any and all bodies of water.\n\nFarther northeast, the Orlando area has seen general 3-6” totals since Sunday, and your heaviest rainfall is likely to start after midnight and continue through tomorrow morning.\n\nShelter in place and stay off the roads until Milton is over in Central Florida.\n\n10:05 p.m.: Milton drops to Category 2 hurricane as 16 inches of rain falls in St. Petersburg\n\nAs of the NHC 10 p.m. position update, Milton is now centered about 20 miles northeast of Sarasota, and is now a Category 2 hurricane. Numerous reports of winds over 100 mph, including a gust to 105 mph with 86 mph sustained winds in the mouth of Tampa Bay.\n\nThe headline, however, is the continuing Flash Flood Emergency in the Tampa Bay area, with over 16” of rain falling today at the St. Petersburg airport.\n\nThis is a life-threatening situation tonight across the I-4 corridor, and I’ll look more closely at where those rainfall extremes have fallen and can be expected in the next post.\n\n9:55 p.m.: Western eyewall winds bring punishing winds back to Sarasota, Bradenton and Venice\n\nAs the western eyewall moves inland across west-central Florida, Bradenton, Sarasota, and Venice are now as predicted seeing extreme winds from the western eyewall of Milton.\n\nSarasota just reported a sustained wind of 69 mph with a gust to 102 mph at 9:36 p.m. out of the northwest, and at least one station in the Tampa Bay area had also reported 100 mph or higher wind gusts earlier this evening.\n\nPeak wind gusts at or above hurricane-force are also pushing towards Lakeland, and many stations have gone down in west-central and southwest Florida due to power outages or possibly instrument damage.\n\nSarasota’s airport is no longer reporting a wind observation following the peak gusts in the western eyewall.\n\n9:45 p.m.: Flash Flood Emergency in Tampa Bay Area\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Tampa Bay has issued a Flash Flood Emergency for central Hillsborough, southeastern Pinellas, and eastern Manatee Counties.\n\nA Flash Flood Emergency is a rare warning statement, issued only when severe, life-threatening flash flooding is ongoing.\n\nIn this case, extreme rain rates of up to 5” per hour have been observed. Stay indoors and away from any body of water through the night in the Bay Area!\n\n9:30 p.m. As Hurricane Milton's winds flip, surge threat is just beginning for Sarasota and points south\n\nWith the center of Milton trackable by surface weather observations, the eye moving into eastern Manatee County means that winds have flipped to out of the north in Sarasota and are more out of the west and northwest south to Venice and Charlotte Harbor.\n\nThat means onshore winds will be piling the storm surge into west-central Florida for the next several hours on the west and south side of the hurricane. The surge danger is NOT over for Sarasota and points south, and in many places, is just beginning.\n\nFarther south in Ft. Myers and Naples, surge has generally been on the order of 4-6’ and is still rising. Meanwhile, there is strong anti-surge of several feet in Tampa Bay as water is blown out of the bay by northeast winds.\n\n9:15 p.m. Landfall portraits\n\nHere’s some various perspectives on Hurricane Milton as it made landfall near Sarasota in the last hour.\n\nFirst, infrared satellite imagery, looking down from space at how cold the tops of Milton’s intense thunderstorms are:\n\nNext, a broader water vapor satellite loop, showing Milton’s outflow as the hurricane interacts with a dip in the jet stream over the East Coast:\n\nFinally, a couple looks from below via Doppler radar. First, a stateside composite showing the wet, windy northwestern half of the hurricane and drier southern half:\n\nAnd finally, a close up look at west-central Florida, and Milton’s intense northern and western eyewall.\n\n9 p.m.: Tampa getting lashed by wind and rain as Sarasota gets brief calm of the eye\n\nAs the center of Milton moves east-northeast across Sarasota County, that region plus some of Manatee County are in the hurricane’s calmer eye.\n\nDue to the interaction of the hurricane with a front and a mid-latitude jet streak, all of the strongest winds are on the north and northwestern side of the storm.\n\nThe Tampa Bay region continues to be experiencing the worst weather of Milton at this time, and another round of punishing winds will be moving back into the Bradenton, Sarasota, and Venice areas within 60-90 minutes as the western eyewall comes ashore.\n\nThis western and northwestern eyewall will likely bring the strongest winds of the hurricane to the west-central Florida coast between 10 p.m. and midnight.\n\nThe NHC 9 p.m. update still finds 115 mph sustained winds and an east-northeast movement at 15 mph, with the center now 5 miles north of Sarasota. A wind gust of 102 mph was also noted at the Sunshine Skyway fishing pier at the mouth of Tampa Bay.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Milton makes landfall at Siesta Key - in shortest time span in history between major storm strikes\n\nMilton, the 44th major hurricane landfall in Florida history since 1851, has officially come ashore near Siesta Key at 8:30 p.m. Estimated maximum sustained winds at landfall were 120 mph, a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nIncredibly, Milton is the sixth Category 3, 4, or 5 hurricane to make landfall on Florida’s Gulf Coast in just seven years. 2024 is also only the fifth hurricane season since 1851 with two major hurricane landfalls in the state, joining 1926, 1950, 2004, and 2005.\n\nFinally, this is the shortest time between consecutive major hurricane landfalls in Florida (if we don’t include the same hurricane hitting twice), coming just 13 days after Category 4 Hurricane Helene.\n\n8:25 p.m.: Sarasota landfall imminent: Milton nearly onshore\n\nWith a wobble east, Milton is now minutes from landfall at Sarasota, where a wind gust of 96 mph was reported in the eastern eyewall at 7:41 p.m. Winds are now falling there as Sarasota moves into the eye and pressure bottoms out around 959 millibars. The vicious northern and northwestern eyewall is over Tampa Bay, though fortunately those winds are mostly blowing water out of the bay.\n\nStandby for confirmation of landfall from the NHC.\n\n8:10 p.m.: Milton 20 miles west-southwest of Sarasota with 120 mph winds\n\nThe NHC’s 8 p.m. advisory is out, with little change from the previous information we had. Estimated minimum central pressure is up a couple ticks to 954 millibars, and motion is now east-northeast (60 degrees) at 15 mph, with the center located just 20 miles west-southwest of Sarasota. Sustained winds are still estimated at 120 mph.\n\nChecking on the broader radar loop, Category 3 Milton’s inner core is now pushing into the Metro Tampa/St. Pete area to the north and the Charlotte Harbor area to the south.\n\nExtreme winds are raking this section of the coast and will continue to do so until past midnight as the western eyewall is quite intense. Portions of Sarasota County will start to enter Milton’s calmer eye in the next hour, with Milton’s actual center crossing land between 9 and 10 p.m.\n\n7:40 p.m.: Final approach to landfall for Hurricane Milton; Sarasota surge coming soon\n\nTwo Hurricane Hunter aircraft are now engaged in “Shore Patrol,” flying back and forth to take last-minute data on Milton’s eyewall and center in the hours just prior to landfall. Center fixes continue to show Milton moving east-northeast, now within a couple of hours from crossing the coast near Sarasota.\n\nSurge is rising along the west-central Florida coastline in the landfall zone, but because the winds are still mostly along rather than onshore north of Charlotte Harbor, the real rush of water likely remains ahead in Sarasota and Venice.\n\nTo the north, powerful winds are sweeping the Tampa Bay area, still under the Extreme Wind Warning, with an airport in Pinellas County reporting an 89 mph gust at 7:25 p.m.\n\n7:20 p.m.: Flooding rain threat for Florida I-4 corridor\n\nAs Milton’s intense core interacts with the fast jet stream winds to its north, the eyewall is starting to take on a stretched appearance.\n\nThat jet interaction is also causing basically all the rainfall to be on the northwestern half of the storm, as dry air chokes out all but intermittent bands of showers over the southern third of the peninsula. On the drier side of the hurricane, even the eastern eyewall pushing through Charlotte Harbor and Sarasota has relatively little rain with it, though reports of intense winds are still emerging.\n\nWith the focus of heavy rainfall likely to continue on the northern and western halves of Milton overnight, the National Weather Service continues to expect an additional 8-12” of rainfall along and just north of the I-4 corridor.\n\nThat includes Orlando and Tampa metro areas, which remain at high risk of flash and urban flooding through tomorrow morning.\n\n7:05 p.m.: Sun sets on Hurricane Milton\n\nAs the sun sets on Hurricane Milton, which will likely be the first major hurricane to strike between Cedar Key and Charlotte Harbor in 103 years, the NHC has issued their 7 p.m. position estimate.\n\nThis statement confirms the turn I discussed last hour, with motion now on a 55 degree heading at 15 mph versus 45/15 last hour.\n\nCenter position is 35 miles west-southwest of Sarasota, and sustained winds remain near 120 mph — still a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\n6:45p: Extreme Wind Warning: Pinellas, Hillsborough and Manatee county residents should shelter in interior room\n\nThe Tampa Bay National Weather Service office has issued an Extreme Wind Warning for all of Pinellas, Hillsborough, and Manatee Counties. This is an extremely rare warning issued only when non-tornadic winds exceeding 115 mph are possible.\n\nTreat this warning, which lasts until 9:30 p.m., as you would a Tornado Warning and seek shelter in an interior room. Wearing helmets to protect your head against treefalls is not a bad idea, either.\n\n6:35 p.m.: Recon shows Milton turning as Tampa's main threat shifts from surge to 100 mph winds\n\nA fresh recon flight has just crossed the center of Milton in the past half hour, finding that the hurricane now appears to be making its expected turn to the east-northeast.\n\nOver the past two hours, Milton has tracked at a heading of more like 60 degrees, or east-northeastward, at about 15 mph.\n\nIf this heading persists, that would bring the center of circulation to landfall at Sarasota around 9 p.m. or so. Sarasota Airport just reported a 77 mph wind gust, so conditions are deteriorating there as expected.\n\nThis rather definitive turn puts a center track into Tampa Bay out of reach, unless something drastic happens in the next hour or two. That’s good news for Hillsborough and Pinellas County, as it eliminates the worst-case surge scenarios for Tampa Bay proper.\n\nHowever, radar indicates that the very intense northern and northwestern eyewall are angling towards the Bay Area through midnight, likely packing winds of over 100 mph. A very damaging wind event looks probable for at least the southern half of the Tampa/St. Pete metro area.\n\n6:15 p.m.: NHC update puts Sarasota under the gun with life-threatening surge, winds\n\nPer the NHC 6 p.m. update, Milton’s movement has shifted to the right and slowed down in the last hour, which is noticeable on radar as we await the next batch of Hurricane Hunter data.\n\nMovement is now estimated at true northeast (45 degrees) at 15 mph, slower and more eastward than the 35/17 last hour. The right turn is happening, albeit in the typical fits and starts.\n\nOverall, Milton seems to be following the NHC track for a landfall between Bradenton and Sarasota. Maximum sustained winds are down a blip to 120 mph.\n\nThe center of Milton is now just 50 miles west-southwest of Sarasota, and the worst conditions in the Bradenton, Sarasota, Venice, and Englewood area will be ramping up within the next hour or so as the center of Milton moves your direction.\n\nExpect structurally damaging wind gusts, possibly strongest when you get the other side of the eyewall late in the evening as Milton’s windfield is skewing north with shear.\n\nWith the center tracking for Sarasota/Bradenton, these areas south to Charlotte Harbor will also see the very worst of Milton’s storm surge, which will come roaring ashore late tonight through early tomorrow morning as winds switch from being off- or alongshore (as now) to onshore, out of the west and southwest.There is no reason to expect that the NHC 9-13’ surge range should not happen on this section of coast, at least from Sarasota and south.\n\n5:55 p.m.: Surge inbound to Fort Myers and Naples\n\nAs the eyewall approaches the west-central Florida coastline at a rapid clip, onshore winds out of the south are howling further south in Southwest Florida.\n\nSustained tropical-storm-force winds are onshore in the Fort Myers area south to Naples. Sustained tropical-storm-force winds along the coast will continue into the early morning hours, turning increasingly out of west through the night as Milton’s center heads east-northeast across Central Florida, with hurricane-force wind probable along the coast, especially later tonight towards Fort Myers.\n\nHowever, there isn’t much rainfall in Southwest Florida and not a whole lot more is expected as dry air sweeps the southern half of Milton.\n\nFor surge, that shift in wind direction to the west will pile in the highest surge in Fort Myers and Naples through the early morning hours.\n\nBoth reporting stations have already reached flood stage as of 6 p.m., and are expected to continue climbing this evening, even though the inner core of Milton will pass to SW Florida’s north.\n\n5:35 p.m.: Heavy rains, strong winds, tornadoes spreading across the Florida peninsula\n\nTurning our attention back to conditions on the ground, Milton is spreading the expected extremely heavy rainfall across north-central and central Florida in the late afternoon hours. This rain is heaviest in the Tampa Bay area, but steady and soaking in the Orlando area as well.\n\nCentral Florida has already seen anywhere from 2-4” of rain just in the last six hours, heaviest in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota where Flash Flood Warnings are in effect.With dry air wrapping into the southern half of the storm, rainfall is much more scattered near and south of Lake Okeechobee, though several Tornado Warnings remain in effect with supercell thunderstorms from Indian River south to Palm Beach Counties.Winds are also picking up as Milton’s broadening core of strong winds reaches the west-central and Southwest Florida coastline. A weather station in the mouth of Tampa Bay is reporting sustained winds over 50 mph and gusts to 63 mph, and hurricane-force wind gusts are likely to start reaching the coast in the next hour between Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay.\n\n5 p.m.: New NHC advisory: Milton at Category 3, will likely make landfall as major hurricane\n\nThe NHC has issued their 5 p.m. advisory package, including a new position and intensity estimate, as well as updated track and intensity forecasts.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are now 120 mph, down 10 mph from the 2 p.m. update and making Milton a Category 3 storm. Milton is now just 65 miles west-southwest of Sarasota, tracking on an 35 degree heading at 17 mph. This is just north of true northeast.\n\nThe next forecast point for 2 a.m. has Milton as a Category 1 near Lakeland, but the accompanying discussion product strongly indicates that NHC forecasters believe Milton will make landfall as a Category 3 hurricane within a matter of 4 to 5 hours.\n\nThe new forecast track is shifted north from the 11 a.m. advisory, and is also faster than the previous forecast, now implying landfall between Sarasota and Bradenton. In comparison, the 11 a.m. NHC forecast track with a landfall point just south of Sarasota is shown below.\n\nBottom line is Milton is racing towards having a catastrophic surge impact on Bradenton south to Charlotte Harbor, and the jury remains out on the severity of the surge in Tampa, though the forecast track remains to your south. Reasonable worst case surge graphic from the NHC still has 6-9’ surge across Tampa Bay for this reason, with 9-13’ from Anna Maria Island south to Boca Grande.\n\nNext post will take a closer look at current conditions across the state.\n\n4:35p: A tale of two storm surges for Tampa Bay, Southwest Florida\n\nWith another Hurricane Hunter center passage in the last half-hour, data continues to show that Milton is keeping a 30-35 degree heading for now. With a 45 degree heading from its current position to Anna Maria Island, Milton needs to slow down and make its expected right turn to avoid tracking directly into the mouth of Tampa Bay this evening.\n\nWhether or not this happens makes a big difference in Tampa Bay surge impacts.\n\nHere is CERA modeling for surge values if Milton follows the NHC 11 a.m. forecast towards a Sarasota landfall (yellows are 5’ surge, dark reds are 10’). In this scenario, the worst surge hammers Sarasota south to Charlotte Harbor, with severe coastal flooding south of Charlotte Harbor as well. In Tampa Bay, that scenario means relatively diminished surge versus the worst-case scenarios, due to strong offshore winds.\n\nHowever, if the track shifted north to a landfall point near or north of Bradenton, Tampa Bay, especially eastern shores, would see severe storm surge. Extreme surge values of 8-12’ would still occur in Sarasota, Venice, and Charlotte Harbor in this case as well. Milton may have slowed in the last few radar frames, so a turn still could be coming. But, as I’ve said before, Tampa Bay remains in wobble range of surge is tracking for a severe wind event.\n\n4 p.m.: NHC seeing speedup; Milton from space\n\nAt the 4 o’clock hour, the NHC is also seeing the acceleration I mentioned in my previous post. The 4 p.m. Tropical Cyclone Update bumps the hurricane’s forward motion up a mile per hour, and Milton is estimated to be still moving on a heading of 35 degrees at 17 mph, compared with 35/16 at 3 p.m.\n\nWe will see how this may change their landfall point forecast and inland trajectory in the 5 p.m. advisory package, but I would look for an earlier and possibly slightly further north track than at 11 a.m.\n\nStepping back to look at Milton from space, the hurricane is unfortunately continuing to generate strong core convection per visible satellite imagery as it races towards land. That indicates that Milton has not lost a well-organized inner eyewall this afternoon despite the shear, and will likely remain a powerful major hurricane through landfall in west-central Florida.\n\n3:35 p.m.: Tampa remains on razor's edge as Milton speeds along toward an 8 to 11 p.m. landfall\n\nAs I discussed yesterday, one of the most agonizing aspects of Milton’s forecast was that it would be likely be unknown if Tampa Bay would take a direct hit from the hurricane, or whether a track south would spare it the worst-case surge until hours before landfall.\n\nWell, just hours before landfall, Tampa Bay is still north of the NHC forecast track, but it is very much in “wobble range” of the center possibly moving into the Bay, with any small northward deviations in track.\n\nCalculating Milton’s movements in real-time using Hurricane Hunter data, the hurricane has moved on a heading of about 40 degrees over the last three hours, at a speed of a little less than 20 miles per hour.\n\nIf Milton continued that heading, it would reach the coast near the mouth of Tampa Bay (Anna Maria Island) around 8 p.m. The heading from its current position to Sarasota is 50-55 degrees, and 60-65 degrees to Venice.\n\nSome slowing down and eastward turning is expected over the next few hours, but based on what I’m seeing, probable landfall is between Anna Maria Island and Venice between 8 and 11 p.m. tonight, faster than expected.\n\nTampa Bay, you are in for a severe wind event, and not out of the woods for surge. Next post a little after 4.\n\n3:05 p.m.: As Hurricane Milton windfield grows, peninsula is lashed with tropical storm winds\n\nMilton may not be quite as large as Helene, but its windfield is expanding notably as it tracks northeast. The 2:30 p.m. NWS wind gust snapshot above shows Milton’s 350-mile wide tropical-storm-force wind diameter in full effect and overspreading west-central Florida and Southwest Florida.\n\nHurricane-force winds as measured by recon aircraft span about a 70-mile diameter and remain offshore for now. As of 2:50 p.m., observed peak gusts so far today across Central and South Florida have generally been in the 35-45 mph range, with top gusts in the 45-65 mph range on the Southwest and west-central Florida coasts from Tampa Bay and south.\n\nThe 3 p.m. hourly position and intensity estimate from the NHC finds Milton still a Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds of 130 mph. Motion continues on an 35 degree (northeast) heading at 16 mph.\n\nNext post will discuss how important each tick of latitude is to the impacts outcome in west-central Florida, and what I’m seeing now.\n\n2:35 p.m.: A tornado outbreak in Florida ahead of Hurricane Milton\n\nIf you had a chance to watch my forecast video, you know a focus of it was the ongoing, significant tornado outbreak across south-central and South Florida this afternoon.\n\nLooking at radar as of 2:30 p.m., there are numerous Tornado Warnings in effect, most concentrated in the area just north of Lake Okeechobee.\n\nTornadoes embedded in the outer bands of hurricanes are a common occurrence on the east side of storms, and unfortunately we are seeing that with Milton today.\n\nIf you receive a Tornado Warning, go quickly to an interior room and stay there until the warning ends. Tornado Watches, indicating that conditions are favorable for tornado development, are in effect for all of Central and South Florida.\n\nCheck the Storm Prediction Center for the latest watches and your local National Weather Service forecast office for the latest Tornado Warnings (plus lots of other great information).\n\nAdditionally, the NHC has issued the 2 p.m. intermediate advisory for Milton. Unlike the full advisory packages typically issued at 5 and 11 a.m. and 5 and 11 p.m., there is not an updated track and intensity forecast with intermediate advisories. These are issued at the 3-hour point (the 2s and 8s) to update intensity, positions, and warnings.\n\nTakeaway here from the 2 p.m. advisory is that Milton’s estimated sustained winds are now 130 mph, Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Pressure as measured by NOAA Hurricane Hunters continues to rise, and is now about 945 millibars. Bottom line this afternoon is Milton is spreading out its windfield as maximum sustained winds come down in response to shear, as expected. It remains an extraordinarily dangerous storm. You can read the advisory here.\n\n2 p.m.: Meteorologist's livestream forecast breaks down impacts for those in Hurricane Milton's path\n\nTo get you up to speed on what’s going on with Milton right now, I will be livestreaming a forecast video which you can watch at the top of this article at 1:30 p.m. It will have my latest thoughts on the timing, location, and severity of surge, wind, and rain impacts across the state, which I’ll also be going into further detail in future posts.\n\nI'll be going live on webpages and Facebook pages throughout the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida, including the Tallahassee Democrat, Gainesville Sun, Lakeland Ledger, Ocala StarBanner, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Florida Today, TCPalm, Fort Myers News-Press, and Naples Daily News.\n\nThen I’ll be back around 2:30 to start rattling through current conditions and the threats ahead for specific cities and regions.\n\n1:30 p.m.: An introduction from WeatherTiger: 'We'll get through this together'\n\nWelcome to WeatherTiger’s Hurricane Milton landfall live blog. If you’ve never read my work prior to today, I’m Ryan Truchelut, Chief Meteorologist at WeatherTiger, a Tallahassee-based weather newsletter and consulting company. By my native Central Floridian roots, in earning a doctoral degree in meteorology from FSU, and through 20 years of real-world hurricane forecasting experience, I’ve been preparing for days like this my entire life.\n\nAnd days like this keep happening. In just the past seven years, I’ve liveblogged the landfalls of Irma, Michael, Ian, Laura, Idalia, and, less than two weeks ago, Category 4 Hurricane Helene’s siege of North and Central Florida. Frankly, I wish I had a bit less hard-knocks forecasting experience, if you know what I mean.\n\nOver the next 12 hours or so, I’ll be frequently updating this page with minute-by-minute meteorological developments: the latest NHC advisories, National Weather Service warnings, local observations from across Florida, and forecasting insights on all aspects of this catastrophic storm. My goal is to keep you safe by providing accurate, no-hype, real-time information through the time Milton is inland and weakening and we have a good idea how things will play out.\n\nFolks, I know we’re already bruised and broken from Helene.\n\nToday and tomorrow are going to be bad days in Central and North-Central Florida, and my heart goes out to everyone in the path of this storm from an exhausted North Florida. I’m from Orlando and have many, many friends and family connections to the Tampa area and Southwest Florida. My job is to try to make your awful experience a little less awful and more manageable by giving you informed straight talk on what’s going to happen and when with Milton.\n\nWe’ll get through this together with heart and hustle.\n\nKeep watching the skies.\n\nHere's what to know about Hurricane Milton today:\n\nDr. Ryan Truchelut is chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger, a Tallahassee company providing forensic meteorology expert witness services, and agricultural and hurricane forecasting subscription services.

(Rip currents can prove a deadly hazard for beachgoers far away from the center of a hurricane).\n\nIn North Carolina, at least one coastal house collapsed into the Atlantic Ocean in the Outer Banks, a local fire and rescue crew showed in a video posted Friday evening. A number of other homes are at risk of collapse as well from Ernesto, officials said.\n\n“Ocean conditions will be dangerous for swimming due to surf height and scattered debris now,” the Chicamacomico Banks Fire and Rescue said in a social media post. “Please be cautious.”\n\nIn New York City, officials closed beaches in Brooklyn and Queens for the weekend due to dangerous rip currents from Ernesto. New Jersey officials also warned of dangerous and life-threatening rip currents along the Jersey Shore.\n\nErnesto made landfall early Saturday morning as a category 1 hurricane on Bermuda, a British territory that's about 650 miles away from North Carolina. Throughout Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said Ernesto continued to create strong winds and rain on Bermuda hours after the storm moved northward toward Canada. Its effects also rippled across the Atlantic.\n\nErnesto previously left hundreds-of-thousands of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico without power when it hit the island Wednesday.\n\nDozens of rescues reported by New Jersey lifeguards\n\nOn the southern tip of New Jersey, Cape May Beach had a double red flag warning on Saturday to not enter the water. People followed those calls Saturday afternoon as a breeze came onshore with a few feet of groundswell, said Rich Demers, of the Cape May Beach Patrol.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, lifeguards rescued 40 people out of the water, prompting them to issue double red flags, Demers said. Currents were strong again Saturday, and the beach patrol expected to issue another double red flag warning Sunday.\n\n“Whenever it gets a little bit sketchy, just be cautious,” he told USA TODAY. “Educate yourself about what rip currents are.”\n\n2 men drown on Hilton Head, South Carolina, amid rip current warnings\n\nTwo men drowned Friday on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina the local sheriff’s office said. The picturesque resort town and the surrounding region have seen high rip current risk as Hurricane Ernesto made its way through the Atlantic Ocean far offshore.\n\nClose to 10:30 a.m. Friday, Beaufort County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a drowning call. Beach patrol and emergency medical personnel were performing lifesaving measures on Ralph Jamieson, 65. Eyewitness testimony said Jamieson had been caught in a rip current before drowning, the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n\nJust after 3:20 p.m. deputies responded about 3 miles upshore to another drowning call. Witnesses saw Leonard Schenz, 73, in the water before it appeared he went under. Local firefighters attempted lifesaving measures, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nThe National Weather Service Charleston office said dangerous rip current risk remained in effect Saturday for South Carolina and Georgia beaches.\n\nHow a rip current works\n\nRip current risk will stretch nearly the entirety of the East Coast, Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, said in a Saturday morning update. He emphasized that distant hurricanes can be deadly.\n\nNational Weather Service offices from Maine to Florida, warned of dangerous rip currents this weekend.\n\n“Only go in the ocean if you think it’s safe, and follow any advice given by local lifeguards,” Brennan said. “And please heed those warning flags at the beach so you don’t become a statistic to Ernesto’s dangerous ocean conditions.”\n\nBut what are rip currents? As USA TODAY previously reported rip currents are narrow, strong currents that quickly flow away from the shore. Typically, they move about 1 to 2 feet per second, but they could move as fast as 8 feet per second, or 5.5 mph, beyond any Olympic swimmer’s pace. They’re usually no wider than 80 feet.\n\nNormally, when waves hit the beach, water flows back to the ocean uniformly. But low spots in the ocean floor, near surf or breaks in sandbars, disrupt that uniform return of water. This causes water to rush through one area to create that powerful rip current outward.\n\nIf you're caught in a rip current, relax. Rip currents pull you out, not under. Float or tread water until you can escape or are rescued. Then, swim parallel to the beach, not against the current. Try to draw attention by yelling or waving.\n\nCheck conditions before entering water, and learn to identify rip currents. Always swim at a beach with a lifeguard.\n\nBermuda still under hurricane conditions hours after Ernesto passes\n\nBermuda still had hurricane conditions hours after Ernesto passed, Michelle Pitcher, director of Bermuda Weather Service, said in a Saturday afternoon briefing.\n\nThe eye of the storm had already passed by 8:30 a.m. local time, but Bermuda was still under a hurricane warning as of Saturday afternoon, Pitcher said. Earlier Saturday morning, Ernesto brought 89-mph winds and gusts of 109 mph at the National Museum of Bermuda, located west of the capital of Hamilton.\n\nLater on Saturday, Bermuda still saw hurricane-level conditions, with 74-mph winds and gusts up to 89 mph. The archipelago is expected to continue seeing tropical storm-force winds until after midnight, in addition to a few more inches of rain, as Ernesto moves northward, Pitcher said.\n\nOn Bermuda, nearly three-quarters without power as officials wait to assess damage\n\nHurricane Ernesto knocked out power to nearly three-quarters of Bermuda, officials said in a Saturday afternoon briefing.\n\nNo major damage has been reported as Bermudians are urged to stay indoors and to keep businesses closed for now, Lyndon Raynor, of Bermuda’s disaster risk reduction mitigation team, said. About 11 people were in an emergency shelter, which Raynor added indicates people are staying home.\n\nFirst responders would begin full evaluation of damage when conditions improved. Bermuda's causeway, a major roadway that runs through the archipelago, has been closed due to the hurricane. Inspections by structural engineers to reopen it wouldn't occur until at least daylight Sunday morning, Raynor said.\n\nNearly 64,000 people live on Bermuda, a collection of islands forming an archipelago that is a British territory.\n\n“We need Bermudians, we need the residents, to stay off the streets, to stay sheltered,” Michael Weeks, national security minister, said, “so that we can weather this storm safely, and hopefully, with no major damage and/or injury and/or loss of life.”\n\nOuter Banks home collapses into Atlantic, local officials say\n\nAt least one house collapsed in North Carolina’s Outer Banks. On Friday evening, Chicamacomico Banks Fire and Rescue posted video showing a two-story home swaying to and from the shoreline.\n\n“Another house has collapsed due swell from Ernesto,” the local fire and rescue agency’s social media post said. “Please do not enter the ocean as the debris will be washing around for the next few days.\"\n\nThere were a number of other homes in the area at risk of collapse, the agency said. “We’re in for a rough weekend,” the department said in another post showing damage from the collapse.\n\nWhere is Hurricane Ernesto?\n\nRip currents can kill, even when a hurricane is far offshore\n\nThe strong winds of a hurricane can cause dangerous waves that pose a significant hazard to mariners and coastal residents and visitors, the hurricane center says. When the waves break along the coast, they can produce deadly rip currents – even at large distances from the storm.\n\nA report published by the American Meteorological Society last year concluded the percentage of direct deaths attributed to tropical-cyclone-related rip currents has doubled in recent years. The authors found that fatalities often occur one or two at a time from distant storms hundreds of miles offshore.\n\nIn 2008, despite the fact that Hurricane Bertha was more than a 1,000 miles offshore, the storm resulted in rip currents that killed three people along the New Jersey coast and required 1,500 lifeguard rescues in Ocean City, Maryland, over a 1 week period.\n\n“The reason rip currents are so deadly is because all the other hazards in a hurricane have a visual cue,” the hurricane center's Jamie Rhome previously said.\n\n‒ Doyle Rice and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nWhen is the Atlantic hurricane season?\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.\n\nThe peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; John Gallas and Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The Category 4 hurricane was packing 145-mph winds and churning 550 miles to the south-southeast of Bermuda and moving north-northwest at 16 mph.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles from Sam's center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles.\n\nTropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda, where a tropical storm watch was in effect. \"At this time it appears the main impact to Bermuda will be rough surf and rip currents from late Thursday into Saturday as Sam passes to the east,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Adam Douty said.\n\nSwells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the next few days, the hurricane center said.\n\nSwells are expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas by Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Victor, which formed Wednesday afternoon, continued to spin in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane center said. The forecast for the storm shows it curving north and staying away from land as it swirls over the open ocean off the coast of Africa.\n\nVictor is the 20th named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Only one name – Wanda – remains on the regular list of storm names. A new supplemental list of names will be used if the regular list of names is exhausted before the season ends.\n\nForecasters also were monitoring one other weather disturbance in the Atlantic, but it didn't appear likely to form into a depression or storm as of Thursday morning.\n\nTrack Hurricane Sam", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/30"}]}

Racist violence on the part of police in Minneapolis and Louisville and vigilantes in southeast Georgia have metastasized into national revolt and backlash. Malevolence and incapacity at the White House have worsened a pandemic that is nowhere near wrapping up. Economic catastrophe and consequent hunger are already facts of life for tens of millions of Americans. The whole is more, and worse, than the sum of the virulent parts.\n\nThe momentum of chaos, violence and polarization is all the more ominous in an election year, when a significant chunk of the country hopes to extend for four more years the government that has brought this to pass. Thoughts inevitably return to the dreadful year 1968, when on top of white backlash, a miserable war was raging toward American defeat; the greatest civil rights leader of the 20th century, Martin Luther King Jr., was assassinated in Memphis; and the political leader most likely to lead a movement for national recovery — Sen. Robert Kennedy — was assassinated in Los Angeles.\n\nA president presiding over shambles\n\nAnalogies between 1968 and 2020 are not perfect. For one thing, America’s war today, ripping the nation apart, is wholly internal, not expeditionary. For a second, America’s world dominance is no longer a wasting asset — it is no longer an asset at all. It has vanished. Third, in 1968 the Great Society had screeched to a halt and not even President Lyndon B. Johnson was still touting his slogan, whereas today’s chaos takes place under a president who promised to “Make America Great Again” and yet, as most of the country sees plainly, he is presiding over shambles. The question to which there is yet no answer is whether President Donald Trump can parlay his ineptitude and national panic into another term.\n\nIn 1968, Johnson understood that his leadership was fatally damaged, and declined to seek four more years. The vice president to whom he tried to bequeath his waning position as the Democratic Party leader was the once crusading Hubert Humphrey who, as the historian Rick Perlstein reminds us, in 1966 responded to a wave of uprisings in American cities with the unguarded statement that if he had to live in the slums, \"I think you'd have more trouble than you have had already because I’ve got enough spark left in me to lead a mighty good revolt.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHumphrey squandered much of his once liberal aura by refusing to break with Johnson over the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War. Johnson’s intractable war-mindedness broke the Democratic Party and brought on primary challenges first from Eugene McCarthy and then from Robert F. Kennedy. Humphrey’s attachment to the war cost him dearly on the left.\n\nPresumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden today must stand for racial justice and peaceful protest without appearing to sanction urban violence, but the baggage he carries — the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the Iraq War vote — is not nearly as heavy as what Humphrey had to carry. Correspondingly, the challenge Biden faces from the left has little of the scale and intensity that left Humphrey in the lurch.\n\nAthletes on George Floyd killing: Hold police accountable for black deaths and start now, before more people die\n\nIn 1968, Richard Nixon handily mobilized law-and-order sentiment against urban disorder by pinning all the insurgencies, troubles and miseries on Democratic leadership. In 2020, Trump would love to follow suit. Like Nixon, he calls himself \"your president of law and order\" and blames Democrats for all troubles everywhere: Democratic governors for failing to stop the coronavirus pandemic and Democratic mayors for failing to pacify the cities.\n\nThe trouble is that since 2017, the president has not been Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. No one but Trump leads the dominant political party. He runs against conditions that he himself has wrought. He has to run against himself. He has pulled many neat tricks during his ruinous political career, but however vast and ugly his repertoire, this is the trick that might very well be beyond him.\n\nTragic pessimism became real in 1968\n\nCheery prophecy has never been my game. In 1968, I was a 25-year-old writer for the underground press and a freelance radical with a tragic sense that nothing good was in the cards and pessimistic about the chances that the New Left, with which I had been associated since 17 years old, was going to recover a clear and practical vision for progress as the world fell apart. That tragic sense was realistic, borne out in assassinations, war and rampaging inequality.\n\nAs it turned out, the best of America also came through, though in fits and starts: White supremacy was rolled back, women’s equality stepped up, gay rights recognized, the right to be different honored and humanity held responsible, at least in theory, for the fate of the natural world.\n\nKeep Trump on Twitter. Each indefensible tweet is a reminder of the stakes this fall.\n\nIn 2020, I’m a 77-year-old university professor with a deeper and, if anything, more tragic sense that humanity is at a watershed and that unless we renew our relations with our better angels, the worse is yet to come. Is a new reconstruction possible? For all our perilous conditions, this year offers a promise that 1968 with its dashed hopes and bitter disappointments denied us: a promise that out of chaos a single humanity can emerge to overcome viciousness and stupidity. This depends not on fate, but most immediately on millions of decisions as near as November about who can lead America out of chaos and toward decency.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/03"}]}

Stan Baker, who was appointed to his current position on the U.S. District Court by former President Donald Trump, ruled against the Republican-led suit, stating that it lacked a \"basic level of statutory review and reading comprehension.\"\n\nThe decision echoed a Monday ruling from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer, who struck down a separate lawsuit seeking to prevent Fulton County election officials from accepting 305 hand-delivered absentee ballots that were received the weekend before the election.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nA dispute in Florida over electioneering near a polling site\n\nOn Tuesday, opponents of a state constitutional amendment question addressing abortion rights set up in a driveway across from a polling place in DeBary, Florida, with big signs showing ultrasound photos from a pregnancy and signs encouraging a no vote on the amendment.\n\nThe opponents were well within a 150-foot no solicitation zone around voting precincts set aside by Florida law, and the law makes no clear exceptions for private property, said Amity Boye, an attorney working with the local Democratic Party, which protested to to the Volusia County Supervisor of Elections. “I absolutely think it’s a clear violation of the law.”\n\nThe statute specifies the county elections office is responsible for marking the boundaries 150 feet from the door of the precinct, said Lisa Lewis, Supervisor of Elections in Volusia County. “But if it crosses the road, we don’t go beyond the road,” Lewis said, based on direction she said she received from county attorneys.\n\n“When it’s a home, you get into first amendment rights,” Lewis said. “Do I wish they wouldn’t do it? Absolutely.”\n\nWhen the opponents to the amendment set up there during early voting, “we were very upset,” Boye said. “We escalated it to our state lawyers, and they said there’s nothing we can do.”\n\n“There’s an advisory opinion that leaves it an open question whether that kind of activity can occur on private property,” Boye said. The six-page advisory opinion was issued in 2020 on state letterhead by Maria Matthews, director of the state division of the elections in response to a query by Hillsborough County’s elections supervisor.\n\nThe opinion outlined previous case law, but ultimately declined to advise whether the supervisor could impose the no-solicitation zone against a private property owner, unless the activity begins to interfere with maintenance of order at the polls.\n\n“If the rule is there that no one should be in the zone, no one should be in the zone,” said Jewel Dickson, chair of the Volusia County Democratic Party. “I couldn’t care whether it’s private property or not no one should be in that zone if it’s protected for voters.”\n\n“If you live there, you should be allowed to have a sign, but we don’t want them trying to proselytize voters,” she added.\n\n-Dinah Pulver\n\nMilwaukee rerunning more than 30,000 absentee ballots over machine error, delaying results\n\nMilwaukee's central count location will rerun about 31,000 ballots after a \"sealing\" error with the tabulation machines was discovered at the downtown site, potentially delaying a final count by one to three hours, city spokesman Jeff Fleming said.\n\n\"It's just out of an abundance of caution.

Interest in partisan observers has grown as politicking grew more polarized.\n\n“In this particular election, there has been greater interest,” Heck said. “In part that has been sparked by election deniers and conspiracy theorists who are always trying to figure out how nefarious election clerks are, which of course isn’t the case.”\n\nA large number of observers are expected Tuesday night at central facilities where absentee ballots are counted in Milwaukee and Green Bay.\n\n“Generally, the process hasn’t been interrupted. It generally is civilized and there is no problems,” Heck said. “But with the high tension and the high velocity and the high temperature of this election, I think everybody is just watching carefully to see how this new universe of partisan observers is going to behave.

Lopez Askin, according to KVIA, said dismissals of election workers are not uncommon.\n\nThis story is developing and more information will be shared when it becomes available.\n\nReported by the staff at the Las Cruces Sun-News.\n\nPittsburgh trying to count absentees quickly\n\nPennsylvania is one of only two swing states, the other being Wisconsin, that doesn't allow absentee ballots to be opened and counted before Election Day, which increases the likelihood of a long wait for results from the Keystone State, whose 19 Electoral College votes may prove decisive to the presidential election outcome.\n\nBut the county surrounding Pittsburgh is trying to count those ballots as quickly as possible.\n\nBy 9:15 am, Allegheny County had opened the outer envelopes of about 100,000 absentee ballots, according to county spokesperson Abigail Gardner. Absentee ballots have inner secrecy envelopes that need to be opened in order to get the ballot out and put it in a machine to be counted.Gardner previously told USA TODAY she expected the county to process about 250,000 absentee ballots for the election.\n\n-Erin Mansfield and Ben Adler\n\nFBI warns about fake FBI videos claiming 'high terror threat' at polling stations, rigged prison voting\n\nThe FBI is warning this morning about a fake news video claiming to be an FBI alert telling Americans to “vote remotely” due to a “high terror threat” at polling stations – and another with false claims of rigged prison inmate voting.\n\nIn a statement released to USA TODAY, the FBI said it was made aware of “two instances of its name and insignia being misused in promoting false narratives surrounding the election.”\n\nThe first, the FBI said, is a “fabricated news clip purporting to be a terrorist warning issued by the FBI.”That fake news clip reports falsely that the FBI purportedly stated that Americans should “vote remotely” due to the high terror threat at polling stations. “This video is not authentic and does not accurately represent the current threat posture or polling location safety,” the FBI said.\n\nAnother fabricated video circulating online contains a fake FBI press release that alleges that the management of five prisons in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona rigged inmate voting and colluded with a political party. “This video is also not authentic, and its contents are false,” the FBI said.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nGeorgia judge rejects GOP lawsuit that sought to prevent ballot acceptance during weekend\n\nA county judge in Georgia rejected a last-minute Republican lawsuit that sought to prevent election workers in Fulton County from accepting absentee ballots the weekend before Election Day.\n\nThe state election law restricted the hours voters could return absentee ballots to drop boxes. In a lawsuit filed Friday, the Republican National Committee and state Republican Party alleged Fulton County officials were violating the law by accepting the ballots outside regular office hours.\n\nBut Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer quoted the law aloud to GOP lawyers during an emergency hearing.\n\n“’Such envelope shall then be securely sealed, and the Elector shall then personally mail or personally deliver same to the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk,’” Farmer said. “That seems to indicate that personal delivery to the registrar and not to a drop box, is kosher. And more than kosher, lawful.”\n\nRepublicans filed a second lawsuit in federal court in Savannah on Sunday, making the same argument against accepting ballots in seven Democratic-leaning counties: Chatham, Clarke, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett.\n\nThe federal court hadn’t ruled on the argument by late Monday.\n\n−Maya Homan, Savannah Morning News\n\nNew voter ID law will be tested in N.C.\n\nNorth Carolina’s elected leaders have been jousting over election regulations months ahead of the 2024 presidential election, but of all the new rules the state’s voter ID law worries Democrats and their allies the most.\n\nThey fear it could be used to deter turnout or throw out votes of core constituencies: the elderly, students, racial minorities and low-income voters.\n\nA lawsuit by North Carolina Republicans, for example, blocked University of North Carolina Chapel Hill students using their mobile digital IDs to vote after the State Board of Elections approved the use.\n\nAll voters are still allowed to vote with or without a photo ID, according to the board, but voters who cannot show identification must fill out a form explaining why before casting a provisional ballot that is susceptible to being challenged before the final tally is certified.\n\nMatt Mercer, spokesman for the North Carolina GOP, said the state’s record 4.2 million in-person early voting ballots undercuts “radical” Democrat’s criticisms about the law’s impact.\n\n“We trust the voters of North Carolina and their common sense belief that identification should be required,” he said.\n\n−Phillip M. Bailey\n\nGeorgia poll worker charged with bomb threat\n\nA Georgia poll worker was arrested Monday and charged with mailing a letter to the Jones County elections superintendent that threatened poll workers.\n\nNicholas Wimbish, 25, of Milledgeville, Georgia, was serving as a poll worker on Oct. 16 when he had a verbal fight with a voter, according to prosecutors. Later that day, Wimbish allegedly wrote a letter posing as the voter to the county elections superintendent that said Wimbish and others “will get the treason punishment by firing squad if they fight back” and women would get “rage rape,” according to prosecutors. The handwritten note concluded: “PS boom toy in early vote place, cigar burning, be safe.”\n\nWimbish is charged with mailing a bomb threat, conveying false information about a bomb threat, mailing a threatening letter and making false statements to the FBI. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nRNC sues Milwaukee Election Commission over polling observer rules\n\nThe Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit Monday accusing the Election Commission in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, of “arbitrarily” limiting the number of observers during early voting and on Election Day, which officials denied.\n\nThe lawsuit argued the city would limit observers to one Republican and one Democrat at polling locations Tuesday, casting “doubt on the administration of our elections” and causing “a lack of voter confidence in our electoral process.”\n\nBut the commission’s executive director, Paulina Gutiérrez, said state law allows reasonable limitations on observers. The Republican Party was never denied the presence of an observer during early voting or on Election Day, she said.\n\n−Allison Dirr, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nRussia ramps up effort to push fake news, US intelligence agencies say\n\nRussia is ramping up its effort to undermine the legitimacy of the election by spreading fake news stories about how officials in key battleground states are preparing to commit election fraud, U.S. intelligence agencies say.\n\nAlthough other countries like Iran and China are meddling somewhat in the election as they have in the past, “Russia is the most active threat,” according to a joint statement released Monday night by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n\n“Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences,” the agencies said. “We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close.”\n\nThe new warning is the latest in a series of bulletins from the intelligence agencies warning about Russia’s efforts to manipulate public opinion in the U.S. to help elect former President Donald Trump and smear his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n—Josh Meyer\n\nWhere are the violent groups of the 2020 election?\n\nThreats of political violence, intimidation and insurrection have surged across the online extremist ecosystem in recent weeks, driven by a network of conspiracy theorists, disinformation peddlers and propagandists.\n\nWith tensions and rhetoric sky-high, experts who monitor domestic extremists say they're watching for what many feel is an inevitable violent post-election showdown, possibly along the lines of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThey also note that 2024 is different from 2020.\n\nThe pro-Trump groups and communities that helped organize the Jan. 6 Capitol riot remain largely fragmented and have barely been seen in public for years. Trump, while still drawing crowds, does not have a track record post-2020 of organizing mass protests. And, perhaps most crucially, disgruntled members of the far-right have not, so far, gathered on the streets in the same way they did in the run-up to the 2020 election, said Megan Squire, deputy director for data analytics at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n−Will Carless\n\nState-by-state election results\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | District of Columbia | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming\n\nThousands of Pennsylvania ballots challenged\n\nThousands of Pennsylvania ballots have been challenged by questioning the eligibility of overseas voters.\n\nBy Saturday, state officials counted more than 3,600 total challenges to overseas ballot applications. These included 1,200 in Bucks County, 350 in York County and 127 in Beaver County.\n\nThe challenges came after the dismissal of a federal lawsuit filed by six Republican congressmen who wanted the state to set aside military and overseas ballots for additional vetting. The Bucks County challenges were filed by state GOP Sen. Jarrett Coleman, according to county spokesman Jim O'Malley.\n\nVoting rights groups condemned the challenges, which they said were made by election deniers. Deborah Hinchey, state director of the advocacy group All Voting is Local Pennsylvania, said “these baseless challenges have failed before and the proper checks and balances are in place to make sure they’ll fail again.”\n\n−Bethany Rodgers, The Erie Times-News\n\nInfluential bar association leaders put lawyers on notice not to file politically motivated election lawsuits\n\nA group of 125 current and past presidents of the country’s local, state and national bar associations have signed a letter putting lawyers on notice of their professional obligations – including not filing false lawsuits in an effort to overturn an election result they don’t like.\n\nThe letter, published Monday night and organized by the American Bar Association’s Task Force for American Democracy, noted that dozens of lawsuits in seven swing states have already been filed this year, including one new lawsuit per day in October, citing news reports.\n\n“Many of these lawsuits aim to tighten ballot rules by purging voter lists and imposing stricter requirements on mail voting, even though there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud,” the letter said. “A baseless lawsuit not only squanders judicial resources but also undermines the public’s trust in our democracy and our profession.”\n\nThe letter noted how some 628 legal cases were filed following the 2020 election, alleging fraud or impropriety, “and they were overwhelmingly unsuccessful,” and often filed without legal merit.\n\n“As such, lawsuits must be grounded in fact, supported by law and free from improper motives,” the bar association members said. “This ethical foundation prevents the courts from being misused to sow confusion, pursue a political agenda or harass opponents.”\n\n—Josh Meyer\n\nTrump-aligned group says it's suing no matter what\n\nA Trump-aligned group that has filed lawsuits in several swing states challenging voter registration lists is already planning to sue over this year's election results, one of the group's founders told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We feel compelled to file in defense of this beautiful country,\" said Marly Hornik, who co-founded United Sovereign Americans in 2023. \"We already have signs and numbers coming in of errors inside of the process.\"\n\nThe organization, which describes itself as nonpartisan, is regularly represented by Bruce Castor, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nFence around While House: A signal of unease for visitors and voters\n\nLawsuits from both the group and Republican organizations suggest widespread voter fraud could be happening – without providing proof that it is.\n\nThe claims feed into the false narrative from former President Donald Trump that he didn't lose the 2020 election, which critics fear is a precursor to claiming similar election theft if he loses again. Numerous counts and audits showed President Joe Biden won the last presidential election. Nearly all of more than 60 lawsuits from Trump allies in the wake of that election failed.\n\n−Aysha Bagshi\n\nFor N.C. activists, ‘E-Day’ isn’t the end\n\nAmericans eager for the 2024 presidential race to end may not get their wish on Tuesday as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's allies are gaming out a prolonged election battle.\n\nThe Harris campaign told reporters Monday the country might not know the election result \"for several days,\" given the different count rules in the seven critical swing states. Few places will be as closely watched as North Carolina, where Trump defeated then-candidate Joe Biden by 73,697 votes, or 1.3%, four years ago, his narrowest victory in any state in 2020.\n\n\"No one here actually expects full resolution on E-Day,\" Todd Zimmer, co-founder of Down Home Carolina, a progressive-leaning nonprofit group, told USA Today, referring to Election Day.\n\nIn a memo provided to USA Today, the group, which focuses on organizing in rural areas, advised its canvassers to be ready to help fix voter’s provisional ballots in case of a recount scenario where those votes could be challenged. He said many activists, whether liberal or conservative, anticipate days or possibly weeks of administrative jockeying and legal maneuvering over election rules.\n\n\"It almost seems the foregone conclusion is we expect a recount or some kind of post-election activity to secure the popular vote beyond the vote itself, and that does feel new,\" Zimmer said.\n\n−Phillip M. Bailey\n\nFederal judge in Missouri rejects GOP request to bar DOJ monitors from polling sites\n\nA federal judge rejected an attempt Monday by Republican Missouri officials to block election monitors from the Justice Department at polling places in St. Louis on Election Day.\n\nThe department had announced Friday that St. Louis was one of 86 jurisdictions in 27 states where federal monitors would be posted to ensure election officials complied with federal voting laws.\n\nThe St. Louis monitoring falls under a settlement agreement between the city and the department over compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey and Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft filed a lawsuit Monday to block the federal monitors by arguing they had no permit to enter polling locations. But U.S. District Judge Sarah Pitlyk cited the settlement agreement, which runs through July 11, 2025, to justify the monitors watching for potential irregularities.\n\n“In practical terms, the expected harm is monitoring by two individuals at one polling place to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as contemplated by an agreement that has been in place for several years, and as already done at least twice without incident,” Pitlyk wrote.−Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/opinions/domestic-terrorism-threat-we-cant-ignore-thompson", "title": "Opinion: Domestic terrorism is a threat we can't ignore | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, is chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nSince the 2016 election campaign, rhetoric from former President Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans in Congress has inspired right-wing domestic terrorists to violence. In this time, we have seen an uptick of extremists of all types willing to engage in political violence, we’ve seen militia groups mobilized to violence for the 2020 election and we’ve seen political violence continue throughout and beyond Trump’s presidency.\n\nBennie G. Thompson Mark Wilson/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nThis August, after the execution of a federal search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, violent rhetoric from the far-right escalated exponentially, including – shockingly – calls for civil war. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, warned that if former President Trump is prosecuted, there will be “riots in the streets.” MAGA Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona compared the FBI to “brown shirts,” a term used to describe Nazi storm troopers.\n\nSadly, public figures on the extreme right are crippling our efforts to curb this violence by attacking the rule of law and continuing to give extremists the go-ahead, either tacitly or expressly.\n\nIn January 2021, hours before the tragic January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Trump declared to his followers on the National Mall, “[I]f you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama told Trump supporters that “[t]oday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass” while telling the crowd that “our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives,” before asking, “Are you willing to do the same?” And no one will forget GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri pumping his fist in solidarity as rioters assembled at the Capitol demanding the election be overturned.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, insurrectionists testified in court that they were only “following presidential orders,” when they breached the Capitol and threatened the lives of all who work there.\n\nMake no mistake, the January 6 attack was not an isolated incident. I have followed the threat of domestic terrorism for nearly two decades, have watched it grow and have urged action to combat it. According to the Department of Homeland Security, it is the greatest terrorism threat to our homeland. And from what we’ve seen after the 2020 election, it is also clearly a threat to the rule of law and our democracy.\n\nSince 2015, the year Trump declared his candidacy for president, there have been 333 domestic terrorism plots or attacks in the United States – an all-time high. Right-wing extremists have perpetrated 80% of those attacks, resulting in 91 tragic deaths.\n\nOur public spaces increasingly face violence. Mass shootings, hostage taking and other violent plots have reduced state capitols, grocery stores, schools, houses of worship, and concerts to crime scenes. Just last week, the federal government released a bulletin warning that there is a heightened threat to next week’s midterm elections by a rise in violent domestic extremism.\n\nThis rise in domestic terrorism comes at a particularly dangerous moment for the country: A recent survey found that half of the country believes “in the next few years, there will be civil war in the United States,” and more than one in 10 Americans expressed their own willingness to commit political violence “to threaten or intimidate” others.\n\nAccording to experts at the University of Chicago, an estimated 13 million Americans believe force would be justified to restore Trump to the White House, and an estimated 15 million Americans would support using force to prevent the former president from being prosecuted. These startling numbers again underline that our safety and security – as well as the rule of law – are under attack.\n\nHaving spent nearly 30 years in Congress, including as Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security and, since last year, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the US Capitol, I know that not every Republican embraces the MAGA extremism that is turning many to violence. But I also know that MAGA Republicans, and their leader, are drowning out the voices of reason within their party while they erode American democracy. In fact, many on the right are all too willing to exploit this extremism – and resulting division – for political gain.\n\nTo understand how MAGA Republicans exploit their followers and dog-whistle at violence, look no further than their reaction to the FBI’s execution of a lawful search warrant for highly classified documents apparently kept illegally at the former President’s beach club. According to the wide breadth of public reporting, the Department of Justice followed the law and all normal procedures after attempting to obtain the classified documents voluntarily. Although no one is above the law in this country, Trump and MAGA extremist politicians’ immediate reaction was to attack the rule of law and dog-whistle at violence.\n\nKnowing full well that MAGA extremists hang on their every word as marching orders, the former President and Republican leaders shamefully nodded toward violence after the execution of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. The former President said he does “not believe the people will stand for it” and said that if the temperature is not brought down in the country, which he has only dialed up, “terrible things are going to happen.” Extremist members of Congress have called for the FBI, the principal law enforcement agency of the United States, to be defunded.\n\nWhat ensued has been all too predictable. Twitter posts about “civil war” rose nearly 3,000% in a matter of hours after the search. Federal law enforcement saw an increase in threats against their officers. A week later, an armed man attempted to breach an FBI office in Ohio before engaging in an hours-long standoff with police. The incident ended when the man pointed his firearm at police and was shot and killed.\n\nMembers of Congress have also been targeted, with one Democratic Congressman reporting that a caller to his office threatened to use a firearm to assassinate him. I have also received threats. And just last week, an armed intruder steeped in right-wing conspiracy theories broke into Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s home in what appeared to be an attempt to kidnap and attack our country’s third-highest ranking elected official.\n\nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media.

Of course, rhetoric directed at the Speaker has been violent in nature for years – and pushed by members of Congress.\n\nMany of us in Congress have recognized that the scourge of domestic terrorism, and the extremism that drives it, are a threat to the homeland. We’ve been investigating it for years. We know it when we see it, and we know ignoring it can have deadly consequences. With our democracy and the rule of law now also on the line, we resolve to combat extremism wherever it may occur – even in the halls of Congress.", "authors": ["Bennie G.

But other races on the ballot in Eugene and Lane County could also have significant impacts on local communities.\n\nOne of the most closely watched local races is for Oregon's 4th Congressional District. Incumbent U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle, D-Springfield, seeks to retain her seat against three Eugene-based challengers: Republican Monique DeSpain, Green Party nominee Justin Filip, and Libertarian Dan Bahlen.\n\nState legislative races are also on the ballot, including the open race for Oregon House District 12, and voters are also weighing in on local ballot measures, including a proposal for a Citizens Redistricting Commission for Lane County and tax initiatives in Cottage Grove.

Proponents described the 2021 redistricting as a gerrymander the measure will correct in 2025.\n\nHoyle leads in preliminary results for HD4 race\n\nRep. Val Hoyle, D-Ore., was leading as the first batch of vote totals were released Tuesday in her bid to serve a second term in Congress. She was leading Republican challenger Monique DeSpain with more than 250,000 votes counted.\n\nThose totals were expected to change, though. The vote results released in Oregon early on Election Night are preliminary and include only ballots counted through Monday. Ballots returned or mailed later will still be processed, meaning final results may shift significantly as additional votes are tallied.\n\nWhen does Oregon release election results?\n\nWhile Oregon is typically called on election night, the presidential election may go days without a clear winner. In the 21st century, the presidential race call has varied from 8 p.m. PST election night in 2008 to five weeks after Election Day in 2000.\n\nMost local races will be safe to call based on election night returns but those with write-in candidates could take longer.\n\nLane County will post results in eight rounds:\n\n8 p.m., Tuesday, Nov. 5: Will include include ballots received through Monday, Nov. 4.\n\n11 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 5: Will add ballots received from ballot boxes Tuesday morning.\n\n5 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 6: Will add ballots received during the 8 p.m. election day ballot box collection.\n\n5 p.m. Friday, Nov. 8: Will add remaining election night ballots as well as cured and postmarked ballots.\n\n5 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 12: Will add additional cured and postmarked ballots.\n\n5 p.m. Friday, Nov. 15: Will add more cured ballots.\n\n5 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 27: Will add more cured ballots.\n\n5 p.m. Monday, Dec. 2: Final official results.\n\n-Alan Torres\n\nOregon voters receive 'voter report card'\n\nOregonians recently received \"voting report card\" mailers from the Center for Voter Information and the Progressive Turnout Project, sparking concerns over voter intimidation.\n\nThe mailers display voting history, address details, and obscured neighbor information. Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown criticized CVI’s mailers for pressuring recipients, though CVI’s legal team claimed the content is standard and non-revealing of individual voting records.\n\nOregon election officials noted these mailers are legal, though they may unsettle recipients. CVI and Progressive Turnout Project, both left-leaning, use public voter registration data to target underrepresented groups.\n\nSome officials and recipients worry these mailers blur the line between voter mobilization and coercion.\n\n-Anastasia Mason\n\nHow can I check the status of my vote in Oregon?\n\nVoters can check the status of their ballot through oregonvotes.gov/myvote.\n\nIf your ballot has not been received by your county election office, you can request a replacement ballot.

If someone casts two ballots in this way, only the one the county receives first will be counted.\n\n-Alan Torres\n\nUniversity of Oregon props up election efforts\n\nIn preparation for Election Day, the University of Oregon has several initiatives to help ease potential anxieties of students and staff.\n\nThe Pop Up Duck’s Nest, on the second floor of University Health Services, has been converted into a “no news media zone” with opportunities to listen to music, watch a movie, drink hot cocoa or tea, do crafts, or get connected with mental health support.\n\nUHS will be bringing around therapy dogs as a way to destress.

Since then, the state’s political lean has shifted dramatically toward the Democrats, with candidates like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama capturing Oregon by solid margins.\n\nClinton’s back-to-back victories in the 1990s marked Oregon’s full swing to the left, especially with growing support for progressive issues in urban hubs like Portland and Eugene.\n\nAl Gore’s win in 2000 set the stage for a blue streak that’s been uninterrupted, as Democratic nominees capitalized on the state’s environmental and social justice priorities.\n\nMore recently, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have kept Oregon in the Democratic column, benefiting from strong showings in populous counties.\n\nThis year, Democrats have held leads in what polling has been done so far, although the margins in those polls appeared smaller than recent election results.\n\n-David DeMille\n\nWhere to find Election Day results, map\n\nIt's a presidential election, where voters will select the winner of Oregon's eight electoral college votes.

Many students were motivated by the historic presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, with Harris’ potential to become the first woman president resonating strongly with some.\n\nEighteen-year-old Kaylee Dildine, excited to vote, highlighted the importance of civic duty and women’s rights. Eireann Coehlo, another first-time voter, expressed pride in Harris' candidacy as a woman of color. Taliek Lopez-Duboff, president of the UO student senate, emphasized the need for young voter turnout, noting that many students feel ignored by politicians. Lopez-Duboff organized a voter registration drive, hoping it would lead to record youth engagement.\n\nFor many students, women's rights, abortion access, climate change, and homelessness were pressing issues. Discussions among friends and social media have heightened political engagement, with some students like Madisen Kunkler feeling the social pressure to vote. Lena Lovett encouraged students to discuss ballot measures openly to better understand complex issues.\n\nOregon ballots are due by 7:59 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n-Miranda Cyr\n\nWhat presidential candidates are on the ballot in Oregon?\n\nSeven candidates qualified to appear on Oregon ballots. In addition to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, five candidates are listed with endorsements from Oregon third parties.\n\nRepresenting the Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris, who energized Oregon Democrats after President Joe Biden dropped out, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are the favorites to win Oregon.\n\nBiden won Oregon's Democratic primary with 87.13% of the vote, compared to 7.36% for Marianne Williamson and 5.51% for write-in candidates. Opponents of Biden's support for Israel encouraged allies to write in \"uncommitted\" as a protest vote, which they said was counted with write-in votes.\n\nOn the Republican ticket, former President Donald Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance are polling in the low-40s in Oregon. The Trump campaign chose to not submit a statement for Oregon's voter pamphlet, but Trump will appear on ballots.\n\nTrump won Oregon's Republican primary with 91.6% of the vote and 8.4% going to write-ins after all other Republican candidates had dropped out of the race. Oregon's May primary was held after both Biden and Trump had earned enough delegates for the nomination.\n\nFive more candidates got ballot access through \"minor party\" nominations: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (We The People), Cornel West (Progressive), Chase Oliver (Libertarian), Randall Terry (Constitution) and Jill Stein (Green).\n\n-Alan Torres\n\nLegal fights, long delays likely\n\nBoth major parties expect court battles over voter rolls, mail-in ballots and overseas ballots as polls show an incredibly tight contest between Harris and Trump. Election officials are on guard for equipment failures and software issues that snarled some local vote counts in prior elections – as well as violent threats that have infected the democratic process.\n\nTrump has refused to commit to accepting Tuesday’s results, and he and many of his supporters assert that only rampant fraud by non-citizen voters could explain a possible loss.

Fifteen other states permit voting by mail in counties, for specific small elections, or certain small jurisdictions.\n\nIn Oregon, here’s how it works:\n\nRegistered voters receive their ballot in the mail about two weeks before an election. They can return it by mail in the provided envelope with prepaid postage or to any county election office or designated drop site.\n\nBallots must be postmarked or returned by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day.

Erica Lee/CNN\n\nStallings cut him off.\n\n“She was like, look, this one died, part of their original party. And he died and this one died. The mud is like to up to here to them,” she said Friday in the shade of the parish house porch, pointing to her thigh. “And you see them, they literally have to lift their legs out the mud. They die because they get stuck.”\n\nDuring their whirlwind 44-hour visit this week, migrants like the young Venezuelan woman left an indelible mark on their accidental hosts in this isolated enclave known as a summer playground for former US presidents, celebrities and billionaires.\n\nThey were flown from Texas on Florida’s dime\n\nThe guests, including young children, boarded buses Friday morning around the corner from St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church.\n\nDays of uncertainty on the small island off the coast of Massachusetts and a massive effort by locals to provide for them ended with a new odyssey – a ferry ride and then another bus caravan to temporary housing at Joint Base Cape Cod.\n\nA mother stands outside St. Andrew's church with her child. The migrants were fed lunch with donated food from the community. Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nThe asylum seekers – most of them from Venezuela – had been flown from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard on Wednesday under arrangements made by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – part of a series of moves by Republican governors to transport migrants to liberal cities to protest what they describe as the failure of the federal government to secure the southern border.\n\nMartha’s Vineyard had not been expecting them but a small army of activists mobilized to help people who had become pawns in the contentious debate over America’s broken immigration system.\n\nDeSantis’ move was sharply denounced by the White House, Democratic officials and immigration lawyers who vowed legal action on grounds, they said, the migrants were lured north with promises of work, housing and help with immigration papers and ultimately misled about their final destination.\n\nFlorida’s governor denied the migrants did not know where they were going. He said they had signed a waiver and had been provided with a packet that included a map of Martha’s Vineyard. “It’s obvious that’s where they were going,” he said, adding that the move was voluntary.\n\nLisa Belcastro, winter shelter coordinator for the Harbor Homes nonprofit, was close to tears about an hour after the migrants left the island on Friday, with volunteers beginning to clean up the parish house and church hall where the newcomers slept.\n\nInside St. Andrew's Parish House, where the migrants slept for two nights in the basement. Erica Lee/CNN\n\n“I want them to have a good life,” she said. “I want the journey they experienced and the hardships they experienced to have been worth it for them and their families. I want them to come to America and be embraced. They all want to work. And I just I want their journey to have a happy ending.”\n\n‘No one knew we were coming’\n\nOn Thursday night, a group of young male migrants congregated on the narrow street outside the church, just blocks from the glittering upscale shops, restaurants and art galleries on Main Street in Edgartown. One asylum seeker, in his early 20s, ventured down the street to explore at one point. He asked about the price of a hamburger at a fancy eatery. When told it was $26, he noted that was much more than he earned in a month in Venezuela when he could find work.\n\nThrough a front window in the parish house, young children could be seen in a playroom filled with books and stuffed animals.\n\nJuan Ramirez, who is 24 but appears younger, stood outside the hall of the 123-year-old church – where 18 of the men slept on portable cots and inflatable mattresses under donated blankets for two nights. He teared up talking about the family he left behind in Táchira state in western Venezuela when he embarked on his journey in late July with his phone and $400 in cash.\n\n“My friends thought I was crazy for leaving, that I would never make it. I only want a better future for my family,” he said of his parents, grandparents and his favorite niece back home. “I try but it’s hard not to think about them.”\n\nThe cash was long gone and his phone stolen by the time Ramirez reached northern Mexico and the border with the United States, he said.\n\nRamirez and other migrants said they were released by US immigration authorities with an order to return for a hearing. In San Antonio, they were approached by a woman who offered them a plane ride to a shelter in the Northeast where there would be housing, jobs and assistance with immigration papers. The migrants were put up in a hotel until about 50 of them were assembled for the flight to Massachusetts.\n\nThe migrants gather outside the church on Wednesday, the day they arrived on Martha's Vineyard. Juan Ramirez said he and the other migrants \"came upon kindhearted people who have supported us with everything we need.\" Ray Ewing/Vineyard Gazette/AP\n\n“When we landed no one was waiting for us,” he said. “No one knew we were coming. We realized they had lied to us. But, thankfully, we came upon kindhearted people who have supported us with everything we need.”\n\n‘We’re all in this together’\n\nPedro Luis Torrealba, 37, said he left the Venezuelan capital of Caracas with his wife in mid July. Their two children – ages 6 and 11 – stayed behind with relatives.\n\nThe couple started the roadless crossing on the border between Colombia and Panama – the deadly Darién Gap – with more than 60 other migrants, Torrealba said outside the parish house on Thursday night. Only 22 completed the trek across the 60 miles of jungle and steep mountains, he said. Some fell from cliffs, others were swept away by flood waters.\n\nThose deaths are occurring at a time when a record number of undocumented migrants are overwhelming the US-Mexico border and dying while attempting to cross.\n\nIn Mexico, Torrealba said, the couple and other migrants were briefly abducted by members of the Zetas cartel, a violent drug trafficking organization. When he told them he could not make the extortion payment to allow them to continue, he said, a cartel member used pliers to pull out his two gold teeth.\n\nThey finally made it across the US-Mexico earlier this month. In San Antonio, they encountered a woman who offered them a free flight to a place they had never heard of, along with a promise of immigration assistance, housing and employment. Torrealba did not receive treatment for the injuries to his mouth and jaw until they arrived on Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nAnother Venezuelan, David Bautista, 26, said he left San Cristóbal, the capital city of Táchira state, in late July. More than a month later he crossed the Rio Grande to Eagle Pass, Texas, from the Mexican border city of Piedras Negras. He said he was released by US immigration authorities after 11 days in detention. They gave him papers for an immigration hearing in Washington, DC.\n\nAt a migrant shelter in San Antonio, he too was offered the free flight and the benefits that supposedly came with it – including help with changing the date and location of his immigration hearing.\n\n“I can’t tell you any more because I don’t know any more,” he said. “We’re all lost. We’re all in this together. We just know this is an island somewhere in the United States.”\n\nMartha's Vineyard is known as an affluent vacation spot. The migrants arrived as the offseason gets going. Erica Lee/CNN\n\nStanding next to Bautista, a 52-year-old man named Osmar Cabral, who said he is from Portugal and has been living on Martha’s Vineyard for four months, handed the migrant a folded $100 bill.\n\n“I’ve never met him before,” Cabral said. “But I came here with a friend because I wanted to help. We’re all brothers.”\n\nHis friend, Franklin Pierre, a Venezuelan who has lived on Martha’s Vineyard since 2015 and works for a party rental company, was there to speak with some migrants and offer them advice.\n\n“You have to show up for your immigration hearing or you’ll be deported,” Pierre told Bautista and other young men gathered around him. “You’re arriving here after the busy summer season and work is hard to find. And winter is very cold, sometimes reaching 10 degrees below zero. Imagine that and not having work.”\n\nA sweet gesture\n\nAt one point Thursday night, a group of lawyers who had interviewed the migrants told reporters outside the parish house that they were exploring legal action, claiming that due process and the civil rights of the migrants had been violated.\n\n“This is a human rights violation. This is a constitutional violation,” Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director for Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, said as volunteers and other supporters applauded. “And we will hold the states and perpetrators accountable to the fullest extent of the law. This will not go unanswered.”\n\nSome passersby recorded the scene on their cell phones.\n\nWorkers behind St. Andrew's help build a house in Edgartown. Franklin Pierre, a Venezuelan who has lived on Martha's Vineyard since 2015, advised the migrants that \"work is hard to find\" after the busy summer season. Erica Lee/CNN\n\nRachel Self, an immigration attorney from Boston, also drew applause.\n\n“We’ve got their backs and they are not alone. And to that end, I would like to specifically thank Trader Fred for donating underwear because Martha’s Vineyard doesn’t have a Walmart down the street,” she said, referring to the migrants and a local retailer who stepped up to help them.\n\nA bystander suddenly tossed a bag of chocolates.\n\n“I brought the candy,” said Matt Frederick, 54, a local who said he works as a waiter and cab driver and lives in his car. He had been handing out bags of candy to the migrants on the street. He said he had spent $100 on the sweets.\n\n“I just feel compassion,” he said, adding that he lives in his car because he refuses to pay the exorbitant rents on the island. “There are lot of people here who are struggling to get by.

Powerful. Persistent.\n\nThousands of protesters gathered in the nation's capital Saturday, peacefully demanding justice for black victims of police misconduct. Few problems were reported across the country as citizens continue to rally against racism and police brutality following the death of George Floyd. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Sunday that the citywide curfew will be lifted after he said Saturday night was largely marked by peaceful protesting. And President Donald Trump has ordered the National Guard to withdraw from Washington, D.C.\n\nResidents of smaller cities are also making their voices heard. They, too, are grappling with existential questions. Where racism is blanketed by the relative calm of a quieter way of life, how does the urgent need for equality find a voice? Who will listen to it and how will people's lives truly change? USA TODAY Network journalists in towns across the country spoke to citizens at protests and community centers to better understand the situation on the ground. Here's what we heard.\n\nBreonna Taylor would have been 27\n\nFriday would have been Breonna Taylor's 27th birthday. But the emergency room technician wasn't here to see it. Instead — nearly three months after Louisville police fatally shot Taylor in her apartment — a crowd of at least 1,000 gathered on her birthday to celebrate her. Organizers of the downtown event dubbed it \"Sisters Friday,\" and they asked that women in the audience take turns sharing what they had to say. Rameka Jackson, 32, said the goal was to show how much women support the movement against police brutality. \"We want to show … that we are Breonna,\" Jackson said. \"We are her. It could have been me, it could have been any of those women over there. So that's the purpose of us coming out today. So the women can be heard.\"\n\n'George Floyd sparked that fuel'\n\nFamily, friends and community members packed a church near Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Saturday to mourn George Floyd in the town that he was born. The Rev. Christoppher D. Stackhouse delivered a stirring eulogy about Floyd, noting \"there was something different about that day\" he died in Minneapolis. \"A movement is happening today, and George Floyd sparked that fuel,\" Stackhouse said. \"He sparked the fuel that is going to change this nation.\"\n\nFloyd was memorialized Thursday by family and friends at Minneapolis’ North Central University, an event that included a “national eulogy” by Al Sharpton and a “national criminal justice system address” by Floyd family attorney Ben Crump. Another public viewing will be held Monday in Houston, where Floyd was raised and lived most of his life.\n\nGeorge Floyd's brother will testify before a key House committee as lawmakers draft legislation to curb police violence.\n\nAmericans' perceptions of police drop significantly in one week\n\nThe perception of police by white Americans has dropped by double digits in just one week, as police continue to target peaceful protesters, bystanders and journalists. The findings are important not only for the future of police forces but also for President Donald Trump, who on Monday declared himself \"the law and order president.\" Among white Americans, those who have a very favorable or somewhat favorable impression of police officers dropped to 61 percent, in the survey conducted May 28 to June 3. That's down from 72 percent the previous week. In addition, the percentage of white Americans who hold a somewhat or very unfavorable view of police rose to 31 from 18 percent.\n\nFour in five registered voters in a new poll feel \"things in the country are out of control\" as the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic continues to rise, unemployment remains at a level not seen since the Great Depression and protests continue across the country.\n\nTwo Buffalo cops have been charged with assault after video shows officers shoving a 75-year-old man to the ground.\n\nA Florida police chief condemned an officer's chokehold on a black man in May.

These past grievances, past harms by law enforcement, need to be addressed before even attempting to move forward.”Read the full story.\n\nHistorians say national mobilization and outrage over black deaths hearkens back to 1955: \"Many black demonstrators and faith leaders have invoked the name of Emmett Till to suggest the nation could be in the midst of a defining moment that could inspire societal shifts. They say the degree of outrage, national mobilization and international attention ... could have a similar catalyzing effect as Till's lynching, which shocked the world's conscience and gave birth to a generation of civil rights activists.\" Read the full story.\n\nTropical Storm Cristobal makes landfall along southeast Louisiana coast\n\nTropical Storm Cristobal made landfall in southeast Louisiana early Sunday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center, bringing hazardous conditions that will continue to spread inland across portions of the northern Gulf Coast. Prior to making landfall around 5 p.m., Cristobal had slowed down on its trek toward the Gulf Coast. As the storm remained offshore, thousands were without power Sunday morning in parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi. Some roads had flooded. The National Weather Service reported one tornado Saturday night in Florida, near downtown Orlando\n\nReal quick\n\nCoronavirus outbreaks climb at U.S. meatpacking plants despite protections\n\nCoronavirus outbreaks at U.S. meatpacking plants continue to soar as the beleaguered industry ramps up production, scales back plant closures and tries to return to normal in the weeks after President Donald Trump declared it an essential operation. Meat production, which had briefly tanked, quickly rebounded after the order to near pre-coronavirus levels. But the number of coronavirus cases tied to meatpacking plants has more than doubled since then, topping 20,400 infections across 216 plants in 33 states. At least 74 people have died.\n\nMore than 400,000 people have died from coronavirus globally, with the United States accounting for 109,000 of those deaths.

Biden swept all seven states holding presidential primaries on Tuesday — Maryland, Indiana, Rhode Island, New Mexico, Montana, South Dakota and Pennsylvania — plus the District of Columbia. He had been inching closer to the delegate number all week as votes continued to be tallied. The Democratic National Committee will hold their convention in mid-August, where Biden will officially be nominated to represent their party in the general election.\n\nP.S.

Here's what happened ...", "text": "On Jan. 21, 2017, America witnessed the dawn of the anti-Trump resistance. Despair at the results of a historic presidential election gave way to a massive worldwide protest, anchored by the Women's March on Washington and supported by millions of people in sister marches in every state and on every continent.\n\nBut after the buses departed, the savage posters were discarded and the pink knit hats were put away, many wondered what would happen to all the outrage. March organizers hoped they could channel it to fuel a new wave of civic activism and to encourage more women to run for office.\n\nMomentum has continued. In October, thousands reconvened at the Women's Convention in Detroit. According to Emily's List, an organization that works to elect more progressive women to office, 2018 is on track to be a historic year for women in politics, with more women saying they plan to run than ever before.\n\nThe women of the #MeToo movement have forced a national reckoning on sexual violence.\n\nTrump at One Year: Women's March returns, but the real focus now is the midterm elections\n\nThis weekend, on the anniversary of the march, organizers are again mobilizing — this time to kick off a national voter registration tour. Marches and gatherings will be hosted in local communities across the country, and international events are planned.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with six women who attended a women's march last year to hear why they protested, how the experience changed them and what their activism looks like now.\n\n'We could not bring ourselves to believe that Americans, especially women, could ... vote into office this misogynistic, irreverent, buffoon'\n\nName: Denise Migliaccio\n\nAge: 68\n\nWhere she lives: Robbinsville, N.J.\n\nWhere she marched: New York\n\nOn whether she's marching this year: Yes, in New York. \"We will be there to let the Donald and his entourage know that we are watching.\"\n\nWhy she marched: \"We could not bring ourselves to believe that Americans, especially women, could ... vote into office this misogynistic, irreverent, buffoon,\" she said. Migliaccio committed to the March in New York and became part of a group called SS4T, Stand Strong 4 Truth.\n\n\"Last time I marched was in the late '60s, protesting the war and supporting George McGovern. This felt more important than even that time, those concerns. We felt our country was in danger,\" Migliaccio told USA TODAY. \"My husband and I joined our group ... with a resurgent activism we had not experienced in a very long time.\"\n\nWhat it felt like to be there last year: \"Emotional,\" she said. \"We thought it was going to be a march, but it was, I'm talking about, like in the nightclub back in the '70s when you can't get to the bar because it's 18 people deep. ... It was amazing, and everyone was friendly. Everyone was courteous because we were all there for the same reason.\"\n\nHow it changed her: Migliaccio said she's more committed to defending her values.\n\n\"The only thing I can compare it to is when I was younger, I went to Catholic school, so when you become confirmed it's this 'onward Christian soldier' thing, and I can remember the nuns drilling into us, 'Just remember, don't be afraid to defend your faith,'\" she said. \"And I kind of felt like a kid again with that. I had to speak up.\"\n\nMigliaccio said now she speaks up every chance she gets.\n\nWhat she thinks about #MeToo: \"I truly do believe the march and all the ancillary groups that have cropped up have given support, encouragement and strength for women as well as men to come forward with their experiences,\" she said.\n\nLasting memory: The moment she grasped the scope of the march.\n\n\"It was confusing because they were only letting one side street out at a time, so when you finally got through this herd ... and you looked up, as far as you could see there were people,\" she said. \"That moment was the moment. It took our breath away.\"\n\n'It has just created an inner circle of trust that can't be broken'\n\nName: Verna Ingram\n\nAge: 33\n\nWhere she lives: Queens, N.Y.\n\nWhere she marched: Washington\n\nOn whether she's marching this year: Yes, in New York.\n\nWhy she marched: \"People in my family marched for civil rights, and my family is from the South,\" she said. \"It was important to continue that legacy and to make sure everyone's voice is heard.\"\n\nWhat it felt like to be there: \"Powerful\" but also foreboding, she said. Ingram said she couldn't shake the fear of what was to come.\n\nHow it changed her: The experience strengthened her relationships with the women she marched with, she said, and inspired her to seek out new relationships with women at work and in her community.\n\n\"We've created a little niche network where we include each other on things that maybe this person on the other side of the company doesn't know about, and even just community events that just go on — if there's any marches going on, we stay connected to each other, and then we spread the word to other women,\" she said.\n\nIngram said the march \"has just created an inner circle of trust that can't be broken.\"\n\nAfter the march, Ingram said she became more active in two groups, Hear Me Code and the professional organization Women in Tech. She said she felt it was important for her, as a black woman, to show other young women, and especially women of color, that they should not be afraid to enter fields where they are under-represented.\n\nWhat she thinks about #MeToo: \"It resonates a lot,\" she said. \"I know tons of women who have been a part of sexual assault and domestic violence.\"\n\nLasting memory: \"I was actually over by the (Washington) Monument with another girl and we were talking how we, as black females, have always felt our voices weren't heard and it was really nice to see that not only women of color but other women were there together, united, and that we wanted to continue that trend,\" she said. \"And we took a picture. She had (a sign) that said 'Black Girl Magic,' and I said we had to keep that mindset even when we continue on doing other things. We have to continue to motivate each other. I always go back to that. \"\n\n'Joining this group has been a lifeline for me, a way to funnel my rage into positive action'\n\nName: Molly Lee\n\nAge: 52\n\nWhere she lives: Portland, Ore.\n\nWhere she marched: Portland\n\nOn whether she's marching this year: Yes, but there's no march planned in Portland. Lee says she's headed to the city's National March for Impeachment on Saturday with her husband and 17-year-old twin sons. \"That's a message I can definitely get behind!\"\n\nWhy she marched: Lee said she didn't want to take freedom for granted any longer.\n\n\"I think a lot of us woke up the morning after the election and realized how complacent we had been,\" she said. \"I thought I was being a good citizen by voting regularly and reading just enough news articles to be able to vote intelligently and that's about it. That was the extent of my political engagement. And then the morning after the election ... I think we were awakened to a different world.\"\n\nWhat it felt like to be there: \"Life-affirming,\" Lee said.\n\nThe weather that day was miserable, even for Portland. It was pouring, and everyone was soaked, but it didn't dampen spirits.\n\n\"Knowing that we were all there and we all felt the exact same thing felt like such a unifying experience,\" she said. \"So on the one hand it was physically a little uncomfortable, but emotionally it was a huge high.\"\n\nHow it's changed her: Before the march, Lee said she was a \"political neophyte.\"\n\nSince then, she has attended marches for science and tax reform. She joined the board of Nasty Women Get Shit Done PDX and attended the Women’s Convention in Detroit.\n\nLee says Nasty Women changed her life.\n\n\"Joining this group has been a lifeline for me, a way to funnel my rage into positive action,\" she said.\n\nIt's transformed her into something she never would have imagined before the 2016 election.\n\n\"A few weeks ago, I was heading out the door to run some errands and was throwing my 'Nasty Women Get Shit Done' hoodie over my Women’s Convention T-shirt and wondered if it was too much,\" she said. \"'I look like an activist,' I remember thinking. With surprise, I realized that I was an activist.\"\n\nLee also said the march made her realize that she lacked Asian women role models. And then, as fate would have it, it gave her one — an Asian woman she met at the Women's Convention who was strong and outspoken and, in Lee's eyes, worth idolizing.\n\n\"I didn't realize what I was missing until I saw it,\" she said.\n\nWhat she thinks about #MeToo: Lee said #MeToo may be the \"silver lining\" to Trump's presidency.\n\n\"We just accepted it as just part of life, but this enraged us so much this year, when President Trump was elected, that we finally said, 'We're not going to take it anymore.' I almost think, and I would never want to wish for Trump, but we almost needed someone as horrible and divisive as that for the pendulum to swing back, and I'm hoping for huge grand successes in the midterm elections and, for God's sake, in the next presidential election,\" she said.\n\nLasting memory: The response to her Nasty Women flag.\n\n\"Having people stop us every half a block to take our picture, or run up and ask where they could get that — having this unifying message to stand behind, literally, and having so many people affirm that 'yes, this is the America that we believe in, too' was something that really resonated with me.\"\n\n'I feel like we are fighting for a new age of feminism where all forms of femininity are not just included, but honored and cherished'\n\nName: Lara Americo\n\nAge: 33\n\nWhere she lives: Charlotte, N.C.\n\nWhere she marched: Washington\n\nWhy she marched: \"I felt like it was a historic moment where we had elected someone who had a complete disregard for marginalized people, and I thought it was important to march and be present,\" she said.\n\nWhat it felt like to be there: \"Euphoric,\" she said. \"There were so many people there, in the streets, standing up for equality.\"\n\nOn whether she's marching this year: No. As a transgender woman of color, she did not feel like the march was as inclusive as it should have been.\n\n\"I felt like one of the biggest problems about the march last year is that it centered white women,\" she said. \"White women are the least marginalized people and need the least support.\"\n\nIt was upsetting, she said, to hear chants thanking police, when \"police statistically and historically have not kept people of color safe. I just can't be a part of that.\"\n\nAmerico said this year she does not feel like enough has changed for her to support the women's march.\n\n\"I feel like the people who marched will show up for one day and then go back to supporting structures that marginalize people like me, and instead of marching — I do the work all year round of supporting other trans people — I feel like I'm going to take my day off, do the opposite of the majority, and keep working the rest of the year,\" she said.\n\nAmerico said she hopes the feminist movement will become more inclusive.\n\n\"I feel like we are fighting for a new age of feminism where all forms of femininity are not just included, but honored and cherished,\" she said.\n\nWhat she thinks about #MeToo: \"I've had my own experiences with sexual assault and it hurts to be reminded of those times constantly, but ... I feel like #MeToo has been really important in making a statement, in standing up and making voices heard that haven't been heard,\" she said.\n\nLasting memory: The oddly comforting feeling of being crushed by the crowds.\n\n\"Being in the middle millions of people and being physically suffocated by the amount of people that just didn't have enough room ... and knowing that it was so uncomfortable for such a good reason, and being happy to be that uncomfortable, was strange,\" she said.\n\n'There is room for everyone to participate in progress'\n\nName: Jamie Zabinsky\n\nAge: 23\n\nWhere she lives: Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nWhere she marched: Washington\n\nOn whether she's marching this year: Yes, in New York.\n\nWhy she marched: Zabinsky, who studied feminism as an undergraduate at Cornell University, didn't initially plan to attend the march. It was her dad who said she couldn't miss it. They decided to go together.\n\nWhat it felt like to be there: \"Overwhelming,\" she said.\n\n\"I couldn't believe how many people were there. I've never been to any kind of event that big. ... Being there with my dad was really special because I basically grew up hearing his stories about Vietnam protests,\" she said.\n\nHow it's changed her: Zabinsky said she's become more aware of just how intensely black women are marginalized. She didn't fully comprehend their invisibility until she marched in Washington.\n\n\"The crowd felt overwhelmingly white,\" she said. \"There was representation of people of color, but it definitely felt like a very white feminist movement, which worried me.\"\n\nZabinsky said since the march, she's \"made a conscious effort to buy and read books by women writers of color,\" including Angela Davis and Samantha Irby.\n\nWhat she thinks about #MeToo: In short, #HerToo.\n\n\"A man just harassed me inside of Grand Central Station,\" she said. \"He walked up to me and said, 'Give me a kiss.' That stuff happens all the time.\"\n\nZabinsky said she wasn't surprised by the number of women in her social network who posted about #MeToo, and she was glad that the men in her network \"were forced to see.\"\n\n\"There is room for everyone to participate in progress,\" she said. \"It doesn't have to be a million person march on Washington. It can be sticking up for someone at Grand Central Station when someone said something to them that was inappropriate. Or it can be checking in with a friend. There's room for everyone to do something.\"\n\nLasting memory: Her dad's raw emotion.\n\n\"It's sort of because of the way masculinity works in our culture, you remember really strongly any moments when you get to capture your dad crying,\" she said. \"Being there, I think, was very emotionally overwhelming for him, and there's nothing more special than to see your dad overcome with emotion because he's somewhere with you.\"\n\n'It gave me more confidence as a woman, who happens to be transgender, that I wasn't in this fight alone'\n\nName: Alaina Kupec\n\nAge: 48\n\nWhere she lives: Orange, N.J. (previously Raleigh, N.C.)\n\nWhere she marched: Raleigh\n\nOn whether she's marching this year: Yes, in Morristown, N.J.\n\nWhy she marched: Kupec said she knows what it's like to be a target.\n\n\"After living through the nightmare with HB2 in North Carolina ... and then seeing what I would personally call a nightmare in terms of the presidential election, it was an opportunity to stand up and be heard and to be visible,\" she said.\n\n(North Carolina's House Bill 2, known as the \"bathroom bill,\" eliminated local non-discrimination protections for LGBT people and forced trans people to use the bathroom that matches the sex on their birth certificate.)\n\nWhat it felt like to be there: \"Empowering,\" she said.\n\n\"We have a voice, and we expect that voice to be heard and acted upon,\" she said.\n\nHow it changed her: \"It gave me more confidence as a woman, who happens to be transgender, that I wasn't in this fight alone,\" she said.\n\nWhat she thinks about #MeToo: Kupec, who transitioned five years ago, says she's become increasingly aware of the unique challenges women face. Last summer, she was groped on a subway in New York. She said the sexual assault made her feel \"powerless.\"\n\n\"Being brought up male ... you're never prepared for something like that to happen to you,\" she said.\n\nKupec shared her experience with other women, many of whom responded with \"me, too.\"\n\n\"It's disheartening that women have had to experience that kind of behavior and endure that kind of behavior and experience that kind of disbelief and shock from men when they share those experiences,\" she said. \"It was very eye-opening to me and one of a number of socialization lessons I've had to learn over the last five years of how women are reacted to and treated.\"\n\nLasting memory: The breadth of the march.\n\n\"Just to see the sheer number of people — I mean, I had no expectation that the march would be that large in Raleigh,\" she said. \"It was so encouraging to see that — just the people coming together, banding together to be visible and voice their concerns about the attacks on women's issues and to make a statement that they were a force to be reckoned with.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nPower to the Polls: When and where is the women's march in 2018?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/miller-analysis-january-6-secret-service", "title": "With renewed finger pointing around January 6, was there a failure ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe documents the Secret Service provided to the congressional investigators that CNN has obtained exclusively tell us a lot about what law enforcement knew and when they knew it leading up to January 6.\n\nThere is a habit in post-9/11 Washington, especially among politicians, to call out any failure to predict the future as an “intelligence failure.” That allows elected officials to put the feet of the people on the front lines of intelligence gathering to the fire.\n\nBut the Secret Service documents obtained by CNN tell us there was plenty of intelligence coming in just before January 6 regarding the potential for violence.\n\nThe documents tell us that federal law enforcement agencies were meeting regularly in the days leading up to January 6 and that intelligence was moving between agencies. The Secret Service documents indicate a summary of reporting from the FBI based on coordination briefings that occurred every two hours between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on the night before the protest that would become an insurrection.\n\nOne summary of FBI intelligence from January 5 reads: “Right wing groups responding from across the nation and establishing ‘quick reaction forces’ in Virginia. Standing by at the ready should POTUS request assistance.”\n\nThe summary indicated that the FBI was tracking 52 threat reports coming in from field offices across the country.\n\nThere was also information provided to the Secret Service by the US Marshals Service from a post from 9 a.m. on January 6 on Parler, the online social site which is popular with conservatives: “Now you got weapons I came packing got my dc carry permit in November,” writes a Trump supporter. “I’m here for justice bang bang. F—k Pence sellout traitor we better see him coming out that building in handcuffs or were going in.”\n\nAnother post two days earlier in the same app predicts, “It’s gonna get violent as we charge the federal buildings and drag out corrupt politicians dead or alive!”\n\nAt the time of the January 6 assault on the Capitol, I was the deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism at the New York Police Department. My intelligence analysts also shared information we gathered with the US Capitol Police and the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police. Now the Secret Service finds itself in the crosshairs of congressional critics about whether the Secret Service shared information with other agencies.\n\nThe question shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how intelligence flows between agencies. The two organizations that are supposed to share information widely with law enforcement partners are the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe documents the Secret Service shared with the January 6 committee show most of the intelligence was coming from the FBI. Much of that was being passed in briefings at the FBI’s Washington field office to all agencies involved in preparing for the January 6 protests. Critics have also pointed to a December 31, 2020, Secret Service summary of Facebook posts promoting pro-Trump protests on January 6 with each paragraph ending with “there is no indication of civil disobedience.”\n\nCritics claimed that shows the Secret Service was downplaying the potential for violence. As an intelligence professional who read similar summaries for nearly two decades, I can tell you that caveat simply meant this: There is simply no indications in the Facebook posting of planned violence.\n\nTo underscore that point, the same document went to great pains on its first page to point out that prior demonstrations by some of the same groups in Washington just weeks earlier had resulted in “physical altercations between pro and anti-Trump demonstration groups as well as numerous arrests” including for assault, assault on a police officer, possession of a weapon and inciting violence.\n\nThe most on-point paper from the days before January 6 may the threat assessment produced by the US Capitol Police intelligence arm on January 3 – three days before the storming of the Capitol.\n\nThe document was written by a team of Capitol Police intelligence analysts working for Jack Donohue, an expert on politically motivated violent extremism. Prior to joining the Capitol Police, Donohue had been one of my deputies in the NYPD.\n\nThis is what his January 3 memo concluded: “Supporters of the current president see January 6, 2021 as the last opportunity to overturn the results of the presidential election. This sense of desperation and disappointment may lead to more of an incentive to become violent.” Another key judgment on that page: “Unlike previous post-election protests, the targets of the pro-Trump supporters are not necessarily the counter-protesters…but rather Congress itself.”\n\nThe analysis ends with these words: “this, combined with Stop the Steal’s propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence, may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike.” That was Sunday, January 3 at 3 p.m.\n\nSo, where is the intelligence failure? If the intel was on target, and the information was being shared, how did the events of January 6 unfold the way they did?\n\nOne of the key questions after the assault on the Capitol by thousands of protesters was, where was the National Guard?\n\nA day after Capitol Police Chief Steve Sund read Donohue’s Intelligence analysis, according to his testimony in the Senate, “I approached the two Sergeants at Arms to request the assistance of the National Guard, as I had no authority to do so without an Emergency Declaration by the Capitol Police Board.”\n\nSund testified that he asked the House of Representatives Sergeant-at-Arms, Paul Irving, to ask for National Guard troops for January 6. According to Sund’s testimony, Irving, who effectively reported to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said “he was concerned about the ‘optics’ of having National Guard present and didn’t feel that the intelligence supported it.” Irving denied Sund’s account in his written testimony,\n\n“Certain media reports have stated that ‘optics’ determined my judgment about using those National Guard troops. That is categorically false. ‘Optics’ as portrayed in the media did not determine our security posture; safety was always paramount when evaluating security for January 6.”\n\nSund, at Irving’s suggestion, then tried the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger who reported to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nAccording to Sund, Stenger also would not approve the request but “suggested I ask them how quickly we could get support if needed and to ‘lean forward’ in case we had to request assistance on January 6.” When Sund called National Guard Gen. William Walker on the days leading up to January 6, he asked if Walker would be able to get troops on the ground if needed. Walker told Sund yes, but needed the formal approvals to mobilize.\n\nBoth sergeants-at-arms testified in March that they never brought the January 3 request from the chief of the Capitol to either Pelosi or McConnell until the Capitol was fully under siege on January 6. Irving said, “The intelligence was not that there would be a coordinated attack on the Capitol, nor was it contemplated in any of the interagency meetings I attended before the attack.” Stenger died of cancer in June.\n\nAnother thing that might have changed analytic judgments and even police deployments would have been advance word from the White House that President Donald Trump was going to give a speech to a large crowd of supporters outside on the Ellipse and tell them they had to “fight like hell” to save the country as they prepared to march to the Capitol. That didn’t enter the threat stream until it actually happened.\n\nIn the end, both sergeants-at-arms and the Capitol Police chief had to fall on their swords. In March, Congress called for a review of how critical operational decisions are made by the Capitol Police. Congress passed legislation giving the chief of the Capitol Police the authority to ask for emergency assistance from the DC National Guard and other federal agencies without having to go through the Capitol Police Board.\n\nThe swift passage of the new legislation shows us that even elected officials who routinely work by committee, understood that their police chief shouldn’t have to run a crisis through one.", "authors": ["John Miller"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/asia/pakistan-imran-khan-us-conspiracy-intl-hnk", "title": "Imran Khan claims there's a US conspiracy against him.

Otherwise, I will re-enter Islamabad with 2 million people.”\n\nRapturous cries of support and chants of outrage against the US and the current Pakistani administration, reverberated through the crowd.\n\nFormer Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan gestures as he travels on a vehicle to lead a protest march in Islamabad, Pakistan on May 26, 2022. Akhtar Soomro/Reuters\n\nKhan’s claims of a US-led conspiracy against him have become a staple at the many rallies he has held across Pakistan in a bid to return to power following his ouster on April 10 in a parliamentary no-confidence vote.\n\nThe claims have struck a chord with a young population in a country where anti-American sentiment is common and anti-establishment feelings are being fueled by a rising cost of living crisis.\n\nBut Khan’s critics say there’s a problem with his claims: there is no evidence of a conspiracy.\n\nBoth the US and Pakistan’s military have vigorously denied Khan’s allegations, and the former Prime Minister has refused to offer anything substantive to back them up.\n\n“Imran Khan is trying to tap into anti-American sentiments to mobilize support,” said Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the US and the United Nations. Khan’s “loyal band of supporters [are] ready to discard facts and believe his foreign conspiracy narrative even though there isn’t a shred of evidence to support it.”\n\nThe aim, Lodhi said, is clear: Khan sees playing on decades-long animosities as his route back to power.\n\nPolice attempt to quell protests by supporters of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) political party during a demonstration called by former Prime Minister Imran Khan, in Islamabad on May 26, 2022.

Khan claimed he presented the minutes from that meeting to Pakistan’s National Security Council (NSC).\n\nThe NSC last month staunchly rejected Khan’s accusations, saying in a statement they have “found no evidence of any conspiracy.”\n\nKhan has also said he is aware that his official visit to Moscow in late February, coinciding with the day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, likely rankled American officials.\n\nKhan has also previously accused Pakistan’s military and opposition led by current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of conspiring with the US, which they both deny.\n\n“People are so incensed and feel insulted that these criminals have been foisted upon us,” Khan said.\n\nA history of distrust\n\nTo understand how even the flimsiest of conspiracy theories could prove such a potent rallying tool in this South Asian democracy of 220 million people, experts point to mutual distrust that has been festering for decades.\n\nIt’s a remarkable period of time that spans wars on Pakistan’s doorstep, perceived betrayals, special forces operations and rogue CIA contractors. Against that backdrop, according to Islamabad-based political analyst Hussain Nadim, “foreign conspiracies don’t appear too outlandish.”\n\nIn fact, they are “believable,” he said.\n\nMuch of the distrust stems from events in neighboring Afghanistan, where many Pakistanis blame US actions for destablilizing their own country – including attacks by Afghanistan-based militants on Pakistani soil.\n\nFresh in Pakistani minds are the chaotic scenes of Afghans, desperate to escape the advancing Taliban, clinging to the wheels of planes taking off from Kabul airport in August 2021. And as the security situation deteriorates, many Pakistanis sense it is they who will pay the price.\n\nThe 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks – when it launched its hunt for Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network – only deepened the divide.\n\nResidents gather outside a house, where al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was caught and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 3, 2011. Anjum Naveed/AP\n\nWhile Pakistan was early to sign up to George W. Bush’s “war on terror,” many in the Muslim-majority country saw the invasion – and the subsequent war in Iraq – as targeting Islam.\n\nA string of wartime controversies exacerbated this feeling; Islamabad accused the US of killing thousands of Pakistanis in drone attacks on Pakistani soil and felt humiliated when the US did not give it advance warning of US Navy Seals’ raid on Bin Laden’s hideout in the Pakistani military town of Abbottabad in 2011.\n\nIts anger was exacerbated by a fake vaccination program the CIA carried out in a bid to collect DNA samples to verify Bin Laden’s presence at the compound. The operation was a success in American eyes, but Pakistanis responded with vaccine skepticism, anger and violence.\n\nPakistani security officials escort Raymond Davis, center, to a court in Lahore on January 28, 2011. Hamza Ahmed/AP\n\nIn 2011, an American CIA contractor named Raymond Davis killed two Pakistani men in Lahore. Davis claimed he shot the men in self-defense when they attempted to rob him at gunpoint, but authorities at the time called the case “clear-cut murder.”\n\nHe was charged with murder and illegal possession of a firearm, but was acquitted after more than $2 million in compensation was paid to the victims’ families. The incident heightened tensions between the two nations, with Congress warning Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars in US aid could be jeopardized without Davis’ release.\n\nSuch events have caused “irreparable damage to trust,” according to Hassan Kamal Wattoo, a lawyer and columnist in Islamabad, who added it is “lending credibility to the belief that shadowy figures are plotting against Pakistan from afar.”\n\n‘Blind belief’\n\nThis troubled history goes some way to explaining why even when Khan was in office – apart from a brief period of congeniality with former US President Donald Trump – he was keen to play the anti-American card.\n\nNow he is seeking a return to power, Khan is reaching for a familiar tool to rally support, said Madiha Afzal, a foreign policy fellow at The Brookings Institution.\n\n“This is part of a long history of conspiracy theories gaining traction in Pakistan, especially about the West’s role in the country,” she said.\n\n“It is something his supporters believe blindly.”\n\nKhan’s stellar cricket career has ensured his enduring appeal with voters. Riding a wave of popular support, he was elected four years ago on a promise to eradicate poverty and corruption and to build a “new Pakistan.”\n\nAccording to Brookings Institute’s Afzal, Khan’s supporters have been drawn by the former Prime Minister’s argument that it’s the corruption of the traditional parties “that have ruled Pakistan through much of its democratic period that is at the root of Pakistan’s problems.”\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif gestures during a guard of honour ceremony in Islamabad on April 12, 2022.

But what seems clear is that, more than a month into office, Shehbaz Sharif’s government has done little to get to grips with the rising inflation and mounting economic crisis that contributed to Khan’s ouster.\n\nWhile the government on Thursday lifted a cap on fuel prices, which will allow a much-needed deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to go through, Karachi-based finance journalist Ariba Shahid said the jostling for power was only making things more difficult.\n\n“This need for political clout is costing the average Pakistani long-term inflation, a fast-depreciating rupee, and eventually greater taxes to make up for the large deficit,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Khan’s popularity has “soared to unprecedented heights,” said Nadim, the political analyst.\n\nTo his supporters – primarily young, middle class and tired of corruption and the political elite – Khan is still the obvious choice as the country’s leader.\n\n“(His ouster) gave him victimhood and made him a political tragedy,” Nadim said, adding they were “two very powerful emotions” that had galvanized Khan’s public support.", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul Sophia Saifi", "Rhea Mogul", "Sophia Saifi"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/30/star-wars-wing-lands-dc-disney-delays-cruise-truman-museum-news-around-states/117326470/", "title": "'Star Wars' X-wing lands in DC, Disney delays cruise, Truman ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State House Speaker Mac McCutcheon said he will not seek reelection next year. McCutcheon, 68, said in a statement that he is stepping away from politics to spend time with his family and to do some traveling with his wife during retirement. “It’s been an honor and a privilege to represent the people of District 25 in the House and the citizens of the State of Alabama as speaker, but after four terms it’s time to go home,” McCutcheon said. McCutcheon, a Republican from Monrovia, is a former police officer and crisis negotiator. He was first elected to the House in 2006. He served as the chairman of the influential House Rules Committee, which decides which bills come up for debate, from 2012 to 2016. A new speaker will be selected in the organizational session in 2023.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House reached in dramatic fashion an agreement that Gov. Mike Dunleavy said would avert a government shutdown. House Speaker Louise Stutes indicated the outcome was not assured when she called the House to order, and House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton, who had been negotiating with Stutes, said things were “absolutely, completely close” to unraveling. Involved was adoption of a statement of the House, calling for creation of a House-Senate working group to make recommendations on a “comprehensive fiscal plan” for the next special session. There also was another vote on the effective date provisions attached to the state spending package lawmakers approved earlier this month. Those provisions failed in the House at that time but squeaked by on Monday. The new fiscal year starts Thursday.\n\nArizona\n\nChandler:A new casino will open on Gila River Indian Community land south of Chandler, the tribe recently announced. This will be the tribe’s fourth casino, allowed because of Arizona Native American tribes’ newly negotiated tribal compact with the state. Before, the Gila River Indian Community was allowed three casinos, which it operates at Wild Horse Pass and Lone Butte in Chandler and Vee Quiva in Laveen. The new casino will be on community trust land south of Gilbert Road and Hunt Highway, outside Chandler’s southern border. The casino is expected to open in 11/ 2 to 2 years. Gov. Doug Ducey in April signed a historic agreement with Arizona’s tribes, marking the biggest update to gambling in the state in decades. In addition to allowing sports betting, the compact provides for casino expansions and at least four new casinos, including at least two in metro Phoenix.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:The River Valley Regional Food Bank and Antioch for Youth and Family have partnered to fill in the gap with the Summer Picnic Basket for Kids program. The Summer Picnic Basket for Kids program was made possible through a grant from Feeding America. The program was designed to help students attending eight elementary schools with the highest levels of food insecurity in Fort Smith. Arkansas ranked fourth-highest in the nation for child food insecurity in 2020, according to Feeding America, the largest domestic hunger relief organization. A 2019 study conducted by the Urban Institute found that 1 in 4 children was food-insecure in Sebastian County. Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to enough food and the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods for a healthy, active lifestyle, as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Health officials in Los Angeles County now strongly recommend that people wear masks indoors in public places – regardless of their vaccination status – to prevent the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus. The move came two weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom reopened California and lifted the statewide mask mandate. The LA County recommendation – which is not a mandate – in the nation’s most populous county does not match what the state government and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, which is that vaccinated people in certain public indoor settings do not need to be masked. Unvaccinated people are supposed to wear masks in public. The World Health Organization, however, is urging vaccinated people to wear masks as cases of the delta variant spike worldwide, which was first identified in India. Hong Kong said it will ban all passenger flights from the U.K. starting Thursday. More than 95% of COVID-19 cases in the U.K. are of the delta variant.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: A portion of Interstate 70 in western Colorado was closed Monday following a series of mudslides triggered by rainfall over the weekend near where a wildfire burned last year. Although eastbound lanes of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon were expected to open later in the day because of cleanup work overnight, there is no estimate for when westbound lanes of the highway will reopen, the Colorado Department of Transportation said. The largest of the mudslides that happened on Sunday along Colorado’s main east-west highway flowed down the same drainage as the one that happened Saturday along the Grizzly Creek Fire burn scar, the Glenwood Post Independent reported. The fire, which started in August, burned about 51 square miles. Sunday’s main mudslide reached 80 feet wide and 5 feet deep in areas. Travelers might have to expect on-and-off closures of I-70 in Glenwood Canyon when rainfall is expected in the area this summer, said Kane Schneider, a CDOT transportation maintenance employee.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont’s office said rebates under the state’s Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate program will increase to between $750 and $7,500, depending on the type of vehicle purchased. That’s up from between $500 and $5,000. The state is also extending the program to the purchase of used electric vehicles. Connecticut has about 7,000 electric vehicles on its roads, the administration said. The administration estimated that state consumers need to be driving 125,000 to 150,000 electric vehicles by 2025 and 500,000 by 2030 to meet the state’s statutorily mandated greenhouse gas reduction target. The move comes the same day the administration announced it has been awarded a $7.4 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration for the purchase of 10 battery electric buses and 10 DC fast chargers. The buses are earmarked for CTtransit’s Waterbury division and will help make that city’s bus depot the first bus facility in the state capable of running a 100% battery electric bus transit fleet, the governor’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:City officials are reminding area residents that city pools are open and free electric fans are available for eligible older adults as dangerous hot temperatures and high humidity are expected to linger through at least Wednesday. The National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning for New Castle County through 8 p.m. Wednesday. The temperature Monday afternoon at New Castle County Airport was 90 degrees and was expected to climb to a high of 92 degrees. Wilmington Parks Director Ian Smith said most city pools and spray parks are now open with COVID-19 health protocols in place. The city operates five indoor and outdoor pools, but the Foster Brown Pool is closed for repairs and the P.S. du Pont Middle School indoor pool does not open until July. The three operating pools, William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center Pool, Eden Park Pool and Joseph R. Biden Jr. Aquatic Center (formerly Prices Pool), are staffed by Red Cross-certified lifeguards and have changing facilities and showers. There is no cost to use the pools during public swim hours. The city also operates six water spray parks daily from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. City residents who want a free fan must bring a photo ID showing proof of age and address to the lobby of the Louis L. Redding City/County Building, 800 N. French St., Monday through Friday between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., or call the City Customer Service Center by dialing 311.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Starting in 2022, the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum will display an X-Wing Starfighter model from the latest \"Star Wars\" trilogy, WUSA-TV reported. The X-wing will sit at the entrance of the museum's Albert Einstein Planetarium, located on the National Mall. The detailed replica with a 37-foot wingspan is housed at the museum's reservation hanger in Fairfax County for restorations, where it is also on public display. \"Star Wars introduced generations of fans here on Earth to outer space as a setting for adventure and exploration,” said Margaret Weitekamp, chair of space history at the museum. “All air-and-space milestones begin with inspiration, and science fiction so often provides that spark. The iconic X-wing displayed amid our other spacecraft celebrates the journey from imagination to achievement.” The Smithsonian did not provide a specific date in 2022 for when the X-Wing would be moved to its main site. Lucasfilm -- the producing studio of the \"Star Wars\" series -- has indefinitely lent the model to the Smithsonian Institute. The museum previously curated a 1997 \"Star Wars: The Magic of Myth\" exhibit that displayed props and costumes from the original trilogy. The museum remains closed because of COVID-19 restrictions, though it is set to reopen July 31.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral: Disney Cruise Line is postponing its first test cruise since the pandemic brought the cruise industry to a standstill after a handful of participants had inconsistent test results for the coronavirus, the company said. The Disney Dream had been scheduled to set sail Tuesday from Port Canaveral, Florida, with 300 employees who had volunteered for the “simulation” cruise. But the trip was postponed until next month, pending approvals, because a small number of employees had inconsistent results for the coronavirus, “which is considered positive by the CDC,” Disney said in a statement. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had approved the cruise line’s request to conduct a two-night test cruise. The federal government is starting to allow cruises to sail again, but only if nearly all passengers and crew are vaccinated against the virus. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill banning business from requiring proof of vaccination, so cruise lines must prove the effectiveness of their COVID-19 safety protocols on test cruises. Last weekend, Celebrity Edge departed Fort Lauderdale, Florida, becoming the first cruise ship to leave a U.S. port in 15 months.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: A federal grant has been awarded to sample, grow and save 14 rare plant species in Georgia. The $780,000 grant will support work by a partnership led by the state Department of Natural Resources, the agency said in a news release. It will also increase the capacity to preserve plants at the State Botanical Garden of Georgia, Atlanta Botanical Garden and the Chattahoochee Nature Center and to spread expertise and support to others in the Georgia Plant Conservation Alliance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Recovery Challenge grant was awarded for a five-year project to protect the 14 plants, which are all listed as endangered or threatened by federal authorities, and to all members to the alliance to help do that work. Safeguarding the plants includes protecting species’ genetic stock, growing the plants in a nursery and planting them in the wild, the release says. Protecting and restoring habitats is also crucial to saving at-risk plants.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Officials want to study parking lots at crowded beach parks on the Hawaiian island of Kauai and explore the possibility of imposing fees on tourists’ vehicles. Kauai has allocated $30,000 of the county’s federal coronavirus relief money to study parking at Poipu, Lydgate and Hanalei’s Black Pot beach parks, The Garden Island reported Monday. The measure that directs the Department of Parks and Recreation to conduct the study was in the works before the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kauai was feeling the strain of too many tourists, Councilmember Luke Evslin said. When officials imposed travel restrictions to try to protect Hawaii against the spread of the virus, there were days when fewer than 100 people entered Kauai County. Now that restrictions are easing, more than 32,000 people traveled to the state one day last week, with more than 2,500 going to Kauai, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The ordinance allows the parks department to impose parking fees on visitors and directs it to conduct a study to determine those rates. The department will be facilitating the study but would need council approval to enact such a program. Violating the parking fees would come with a $100 fine for the first offense. More than two offenses would mean a fine of up to $500.\n\nIdaho\n\nRigby: The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said a woman drowned in eastern Idaho on Sunday after she became trapped in a log jam. The 50-year-old woman and her husband were kayaking on the Snake River near Rigby when the accident happened about 5 p.m., EastIdahoNews.com reported. The sheriff’s office said in a prepared statement that the woman’s kayak overturned in the log jam, causing her to be pinned underwater against the logs and current. It took first responders about an hour to recover the woman’s body, the sheriff’s office said. The woman and her husband are both from Jefferson County. Authorities did not release their names.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: A man who said he sprayed trees in a suburban Chicago park to protect them after a dog chewed off the bark has been ticketed by authorities. Asher Thomas is accused of “altering flora” in a Naperville dog park. The ticket from the Will County Forest Preserve carries a $225 fine, the Aurora Beacon-News reported. “Just as you can’t go around doing things to other people’s property, even if intentions are good, you can’t allow your dogs to do damage or spray a foreign substance on trees,” said Forest Preserve Deputy Police Chief Dave Barrios. Thomas said he regularly takes his dog, Dixie, to Whalon Lake Dog Park and learned that another owner’s German shepherd had gnawed away the bark on more than a dozen trees. He said he used a can of tree pruning sealer to cover the wounds. “The whole purpose was to prevent trees from being lost,” said Thomas, who works for the U.S. Coast Guard. “What if I saved the trees? What if the other nine I did not spray died and the ones I treated lived?” He said a “tree is worth more than gold” in his native state, Colorado. Thomas said he will ask a judge to dismiss the ticket for “good Samaritan” reasons.\n\nIndiana\n\nNoblesville:Firefighters and police officers in Noblesville will receive coronavirus-related bonuses of $2,000 each and other city workers will get $1,000 each. “We didn’t give raises this year, and this is our way of saying thank you for working through the health crisis. … People will spend a lot of this money locally,” Mayor Chris Jensen said. The money will come from Noblesville’s share of federal aid for the COVID-19 pandemic. Hamilton County gave $3,000 to each of its workers. Jensen said police and firefighters are getting larger bonuses because they were at risk of getting COVID-19, the Indianapolis Star reported. “They were out answering calls and in close contact with people,” he said.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: Police arrested an Ankeny man Saturday after he allegedly threatened to blow up a McDonald’s restaurant for neglecting to include dipping sauce with his order of chicken McNuggets. Television station WHO 13 reported that police in the Des Moines suburb arrested the 42-year-old man after he admitted to investigators that he called the Ankeny restaurant Saturday night upon realizing his order mistakenly didn’t include the dipping sauce. During the call, he threatened to blow up the restaurant and punch an employee. The man was charged with a felony of false report of an explosive or incendiary device. He was booked into the Polk County Jail on Saturday and released on a bond Sunday.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: The government’s latest crop snapshot Monday showed the Kansas winter wheat harvest is running slower than usual for this time of year. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported that about 41% of the state’s wheat has been cut. That is behind the 44% at this time last year and the 48% five-year average. The report reflects crop conditions as of Sunday and comes amid recent rains that have kept many combines out of fields. The agency also reported that 83% of the wheat had matured. It rated the condition of the crop still in the ground as 12% excellent, 50% good, 25% fair and 13% as poor or very poor. Planting for two other major Kansas crops also is nearly finished with 95% of the soybeans and 94% of the sorghum now seeded. The state’s corn crop is also mostly in good shape with just 6% rated as poor or very poor.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A startup spirits producer is reviving an old name as it plans to open a distillery at the same Kentucky site where whiskey was made starting in the late 1860s. The new E.J. Curley distillery will be located at Camp Nelson in Jessamine County. It’s at the same site as the original E.J. Curley & Co. operation. Spirits production is scheduled to begin by May 2022, along with the opening of a tasting room. Company leaders said they expect to welcome more than 100,000 visitors annually. The new distillery will offer two Kentucky mash bills that will reflect traditional bourbon whiskey, with plans to launch a first-of-its-kind Kentucky-blended international spirit, according to a news release announcing the project. The company is reviving the E.J. Curley name, which dates to the Civil War-era. After Prohibition, it was known as Kentucky River Distillery until it closed in the late 1960s, early 1970s, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: A volunteer organization that mobilizes veterans for disaster recovery efforts has helped a southwest Louisiana woman return to her hurricane-damaged home. Team Rubicon renovated the home of Susan Stewart of Lake Charles. The American Press reported that Stewart returned to the house late last week – months after hurricanes Laura and Delta struck the area. “My house was shuffled during Laura, but rain came in during Delta and fell through the cracks,” Stewart said. She met Team Rubicon members when they were cutting trees down in the neighborhood. Volunteers initially signed her up for gutting and mold treatment but ended up completely restoring the home, including heating and air conditioning, plumbing, electrical work, flooring, roof and windows. A Team Rubicon press release said the organization was founded following the Haiti earthquake of 2010. The volunteer veterans use skills and experience gained from their time in the military to help people prepare, respond and recover from disasters.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Maine Hospital Association wants the state to mandate that all health care workers get the COVID-19 vaccination once the federal government grants full approval for the vaccines. Health care worker vaccination data showed wide variations in vaccination rates among the state’s hospitals and nursing homes. “We would prefer if there is a mandate, that we want the mandate to cover all health care providers,” said Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association. “Job No. 1 for us, however we can get it done, is to get them vaccinated.” A blanket requirement would prevent health care workers who don’t want the shot from switching jobs to employers who do not mandate the vaccine. Such clusters of unvaccinated workers could lead to more outbreaks, Michaud said. The vaccines in use – Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson – were approved in 2020 and early 2021 by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. Studies showed the vaccines worked, and have worked safely and effectively as they’ve been given to millions of people worldwide starting in December.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:The Ferris wheel at a historic amusement park on the Ocean City boardwalk has reopened following a zoning violation. Trimper’s Rides said on June 9 that it would move the ride after a surveyor contracted by the company found that the Ferris wheel overhung town property by at least 10 feet, the Salisbury Daily Times reported. When company president Antoinette Bruno confirmed that the ride would be dismantled and relocated, she said it wouldn’t operate this summer. But Trimper’s Rides said “It’s baaaaack!!” in a Facebook post on Saturday with an accompanying photo of its 149-foot-tall Ferris wheel. The Ocean City town council said at its meeting on June 7 that the company would continue to be penalized with fines if it didn’t move the ride. Bruno told the council that the ride’s placement was the result of human error. She estimated that moving the Ferris wheel and other rides could cost more than $100,000 – an expense she said the company couldn’t afford. Trimper’s Rides received multiple fines from Ocean City before the ride was removed from town property, according to the Daily Times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Department of Transportation has scheduled two virtual meetings to discuss plans to replace the Bourne and Sagamore bridges. Officials at the public information meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday will present an overview of the proposed Cape Cod Canal Area Transportation Improvement Program, which not only includes replacing the two bridges across the Cape Cod Canal, but improving the approach road networks. The purpose of the meetings is to provide the public with the opportunity to become acquainted with the proposed project and to gather feedback. The state’s policy concerning land acquisitions for the project will also be presented. The $1 billion effort to replace the bridges – both more than 80 years old – will be done in three phases, with construction not expected to start until 2025 at the earliest, state transportation officials have said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: COVID-19 vaccinations will be mandatory for employees at one of Michigan’s largest health care providers. Henry Ford Health System in southeastern Michigan said the policy starts Sept. 10 and covers employees, medical students and contractors. Nearly 70% of 33,000 staff members have been fully vaccinated, Henry Ford Health said Tuesday. “We acknowledge the magnitude of this decision and we did not make it lightly. … Safety and infection prevention are everyone’s responsibility,” said Wright Lassiter III, president and chief executive. There will be exemptions for people with medical or religious reasons. Henry Ford Health said employees already are required to get a flu shot every year and stay current with vaccinations for other diseases. The Detroit-based health system has five acute care hospitals: four in the Detroit area and one in Jackson. It has treated thousands of people with COVID-19.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: June’s dry weather has impacted Minnesota’s pastures, and might soon force cattle farmers to make tough decisions before they run out of grass. Cattle veterinarian and University of Minnesota extension educator Joe Armstrong said those decisions include possibly weaning calves early to lower the amount of energy cows need, or selling cattle early to reduce the size of the herd, the Star Tribune reported. Minnesota is abnormally dry. A majority of the state is declared to be in a moderate or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska. Monday’s crop report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said roughly half of Minnesota’s pasture and range land is in very poor or poor condition. Only 14% of the state’s pastures are in good condition and none was deemed excellent for the week ending Sunday, the USDA said. “At this point, if we get rain, it may help regrowth a little bit, but we’ve lost so much that even a decent amount of rain is just not going to benefit the crop this year,” said Armstrong. Jared Luhman, who raises Red Angus with his family near Goodhue, said he has never experienced anything like this, and his father told him this is the worst it has been since the drought of 1988. Their pasture usually gets 60% of its grass growth in May and June before conditions dry out in July, Luhman said. “But we are already dry in what is usually the wet season, so we don’t know what that means for the rest of the year,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenville: A historic northwest Mississippi building complex with 19th century roots has been purchased by a nonprofit economic development group and will reopen as a hotel this fall after closing down during the pandemic. The Delta Democrat-Times reported that the Greenville Inn and Suites building was purchased from the Mississippi Levee Board in June by Main Street Greenville, a division of Greater Greenville Development Foundation. The plan is for it to reopen as a 36-room, boutique hotel in September. The Levee Board most recently leased the building to TROP Casino, which operated it as a hotel. The hotel closed last year during the COVID-19 pandemic and TROP did not renew its lease. “The Levee Board is thrilled that the Greater Greenville Development Foundation wanted to purchase the hotel. It is a win-win for downtown Greenville, GGDF, and the Levee Board,” said Peter Nimrod, the chief engineer of the Levee Board. “They will do an excellent job in preserving a downtown landmark and will run a very successful and unique hotel for visitors to stay while visiting Greenville.” The property was originally comprised of a bank built in 1880 and the Levee Board Building built in 1883. The Levee Board acquired the bank in 1919. In 1997 the property was converted into a hotel and a third building was erected, creating a courtyard between the two original buildings.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: After nearly two years of renovations complicated by COVID-19 restrictions, the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum is ready to welcome visitors back with an updated focus on how Truman’s legacy resonates today.The museum opens to the public Friday, with hours and visitor numbers initially restricted because of pandemic regulations. Visitors will find a museum reimagined during its most extensive renovation since it opened in 1957 in Truman’s hometown, an eastern suburb of Kansas City. The nearly $30 million project includes a sparkling new entrance; many more artifacts, photographs, videos and films; and exhibits that encourage visitors to touch and interact with displays. One solemn gallery showcases Truman’s first four months in office, some of the most consequential months in U.S. history. Germany surrendered, the U.S. dropped nuclear bombs on Japan to end World War II, and world leaders at the Potsdam conference determined the makeup of the postwar world.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A federal judge said a management plan for the Flathead National Forest failed to adequately protect imperiled grizzly bears and bull trout, but he’s leaving the plan in place while officials review their policies. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy will allow several planned timber harvest projects on the 3,750-square-mile forest to proceed, the Missoulian reported. The development came in a 2019 lawsuit from environmental groups who alleged that allowing new road building in the forest could harm threatened species like grizzly bears. Molloy agreed that the Fish and Wildlife Service did not properly analyze how the plan for the forest could harm grizzlies and trout. But the judge said shutting down timber projects could have yielded severe economic damages to local communities, and that the new forest plan was better than a previous one from 1986.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska will formally end its coronavirus emergency this week, Gov. Pete Ricketts said, even though rural parts of the state continue to lag larger cities in vaccinations. Ricketts said he will let the state’s current virus emergency expire as scheduled on Wednesday along with its remaining social-distancing guidelines that were made mandatory earlier in the pandemic. He said he also expects all schools to be open for in-person learning this fall without imposing any mask or vaccination requirements. “We need to get back to normal,” he said at a news conference. His comments came as the number of virus-related hospitalizations dropped to 27 on Sunday after more than a month of declines. Still, Nebraska continues to show a wide disparity in vaccination rates between urban and rural areas. In Lancaster County, encompassing Lincoln, more than 52% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard. But in the rural Panhandle, the proportion is 31%. In Sioux County, on Nebraska’s northwestern border, less than 19% of the population has been fully vaccinated.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: MGM Resorts International switched on a giant solar farm Monday that will power up to 90% of the company’s 13 Las Vegas properties and 36,000 hotel rooms. “As Nevada’s largest private employer and operator on the Strip, MGM Resorts is uniquely positioned to use our scale and resources to make a significant and positive difference. It’s an obligation and commitment to take incredibly seriously,” MGM Resorts President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said. “It’s fair to say that much in Las Vegas Strip has now gone solar.” The 323,000-panel system will produce an estimated 100 megawatts, roughly enough to power 27,000 U.S. homes annually. The company said the energy will be enough to supply 90% of its daytime energy needs. MGM called the solar farm the hospitality industry’s largest renewable energy project. It said it wants to transition toward renewable energy sources to reduce carbon emissions by 45% per square foot throughout its roughly 65 million square feet by 2025. The array of solar panels sits in the desert northeast of Las Vegas and will be managed by Invenergy, which owns and operates renewable energy developments throughout the world.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is selling its FM radio station, meaning that for the first time since at least 1958, the college will not broadcast on either AM or FM frequencies. The sale of the school’s FM radio show that goes by the name 99Rock on WFRD-FM could take up to a year to complete, the Valley News reported Saturday. WFRD-FM had been operating at a loss, Dartmouth spokesperson Diana Lawrence told the newspaper, and the school decided that it was not, “fiscally prudent or sustainable to continue to operate the station.” The sale of the FM station will also mean the elimination of the station’s one remaining employee. The Federal Communications Commission first granted Dartmouth a commercial license for its AM frequency in 1958, and that station, WDCR-AM, stopped broadcasting and moved online in 2008. Students will continue to produce radio programming online after the FM station’s sale, the college has said. Proceeds from the sale will support the ongoing work of Dartmouth Broadcasting, which is the student umbrella organization that had overseen both AM and FM stations, the school has said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New Jersey’s prison system is about to begin housing inmates based on gender identity, the result of a lawsuit filed in 2019 by a transgender woman who said she was forced to live in men’s prisons for a year and a half. The new policy goes into effect Thursday and provides greater protections for transgender, intersex and nonbinary people in state prisons, most importantly by housing them based on the gender they identify with rather than by sex assigned at birth. Inmates can provide information about their gender identity at anytime during their incarceration, under the policy. Other protections include single-cell housing while final housing determinations are being made; being able to shower separately from other inmates; the right to have input into housing decision and to appeal those decisions, and a prohibition of physical examinations to determine an inmate’s genital status. Pat-down searches or strip searches by transgender women by male officers will be prohibited. The policy will be maintained for at least one year, according to the settlement. Under terms of the settlement, the woman, identified in court papers as Sonia Doe, will receive $125,000 in damages and $45,000 for attorneys’ fees, and won’t face any sanctions in connection with an assault that occurred in prison in May 2019.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An organization that represents thousands of racehorse owners and trainers is accusing New Mexico regulators of violating their civil rights. The New Mexico Horsemen’s Association said it is suing the New Mexico Racing Commission in U.S. District Court, saying it had no other recourse since the commission had barred the group and its members from contacting any commissioners or attending the panel’s regular public meetings. The commission took action to limit communication after the horse owners sued in December to stop the commission from using purse money to cover operating costs at the state’s five privately owned race tracks. The commission also voted earlier this year to prohibit association members from contributing 1% of their purse winnings to the association and ending the contribution of starter fees that fund medical expenses as well as fees that go toward advocacy efforts. That prompted another legal challenge by the association in state district court. The commission has not commented on any of the pending litigation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Tenants and their advocates hope New York’s revamped rent relief program will finally help renters and landlords who have struggled to get assistance since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Paperwork requirements made it tough for tenants and landlords to get relief funds in a previous round of pandemic assistance. Last year, New York dedicated $100 million from the federal CARES Act to rental relief and received 94,000 applications. But it ended up rejecting most applicants. It has dispersed $47 million to date to 18,000 applicants, far fewer than officials had hoped to reach. Now, it has a new $2 billion fund, passed in April, but people can only submit online applications and the website has been crashing in recent days and weeks. Ernesto Tohom, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala studying business at Baruch College who lost his job in a deli last year, said the state denied his application for rental relief last year because he could not provide documentation that he had lost his job, which was off-the-books. This year, he’s trying again because of expanded eligibility criteria – which does not consider immigration status – but has not been able to submit the required documents because that part of the website has malfunctioned each time he’s tried to load it. In New York City alone, renters owe at least $1 billion in back rent, according to a survey of rent-regulated apartments by Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord trade group.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Textile executives joined advocates for the environment and the poor to urge state legislators to reject a major energy bill pushed by state House Republicans. The coalition held a news conference to criticize the wide-ranging proposal, which would order an early retirement of several coal-fired plants operated by Duke Energy subsidiaries. The bill, which got a committee hearing earlier this month, also would expand solar production and allow the electric utility to seek multiyear rate increases from the North Carolina Utilities Commission. Textile companies are worried about the financial expense the likely rate increases would have upon Duke Energy customers like themselves. They warned the burden would be so great it would discourage efforts to expand in the state. North Carolina is home to 30,000 textile industry positions, which in turn support 90,000 additional related jobs, Dan Nation with Gastonia-based yarn maker Parkdale Mills said. Significantly higher electricity costs would push industry investments out of North Carolina and into other states, Nation said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: Col. Timothy Curry is the new commander at Grand Forks Air Force Baser, replacing Col. Cameron Pringle during a change of command ceremony Monday for the 319th Reconnaissance Wing. Pringle was named commander in June 2019, the same month Curry took over as vice commander. Curry has been in charge of organizing, training, and equipping the base’s RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aircraft fleet. He has been recognized with numerous awards, including the Meritorious Service Medal. Curry graduated from the United State Air Force Academy in 1999, He has earned three master’s degrees, in strategic intelligence, military strategy and pastoral counseling,\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine signed legislation directing about $2.2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief to children’s behavioral health care, water and sewer infrastructure projects, local government budgets and paying off the state’s unemployment insurance loan. “There are bill signings you’re OK with, then there are bill signings that you’re very happy with,” the Republican said at a Statehouse signing ceremony. “This is one I’m very happy about.” The bill allocates all but $500 million of Ohio’s first payout from the American Rescue Plan Act, with decisions yet to be made on how the rest will be spent, DeWine said. It includes $84 million for pediatric behavioral health initiative, $250 million for water and sewer infrastructure, $422 million for more than 2,000 local governments and roughly $1.5 billion to repay a federal loan that shored up the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma National Guard troops who have been assisting with the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic will begin ending their assignment beginning Thursday, health officials said. Over a 15-month deployment, Guard troops helped sanitize long-term-care facilities that were particularly hard hit during the first several months of the pandemic. Troops also helped distribute personal protective gear and transport testing specimens and supplies across the state. Meanwhile, data from Johns Hopkins University showed Oklahoma’s seven-day rolling average of daily deaths and daily new cases have increased over the last two weeks. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma increased from 120.29 new cases per day on June 12 to 196.43 new cases per day on June 26. The rolling average of daily deaths also increased during the same time period from 1.29 deaths per day to 4.29 deaths per day. Oklahoma ranks 40th in the nation with just 37.9% of its population fully vaccinated, compared to a national average of 45.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregon hospitals over the weekend saw a sharp increase in the number of people experiencing heat-related illnesses, according to the Oregon Health Authority. Agency spokesperson Delia Hernández said 128 people visited Oregon hospitals for heat-related illnesses on Sunday, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. That compared with 24 heat-related hospital visits Friday and 56 such visits Saturday. The heat has broken state records, with Portland reaching 112 degrees on Sunday. That record was broken again Monday when temperatures reached 113 degrees. Hernández said the state health authority couldn’t immediately confirm whether anyone had died from the recent heat-related illnesses, or the severity of any of those illnesses. Richard Leman, a public health expert with the Oregon Health Authority, among other things urged people to use fans or air conditioning, avoid hot food and heavy meals and to close windows and shades during the afternoon, the hottest part of the day.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGoldsboro:Authorities said dozens of freight train cars derailed in Pennsylvania, but no injuries or hazardous spills were reported. Chief Steve Lutz of the Newberry Township police force said 33 of the 133 cars on the eastbound Norfolk Southern train derailed and overturned shortly after 3 p.m. Monday in northern York County near Goldsboro. Lutz said all of the cars were intact except for one car that contained pellets of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. One of the overturned tanks carried crude oil, but none of it leaked, he said. The York County emergency management office said no injuries, evacuations or environmental hazards occurred. Lutz said there was no concern about anything leaking into the Susquehanna River or drinking water. The cause of the derailment wasn’t immediately known. Norfolk Southern spokesperson Jeff DeGraff said the company is investigating and will complete a report for submission to the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state and the city have committed a combined $600,000 to revive the WaterFire Providence arts installation this year. Gov. Dan McKee and Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor said $150,000 would be provided through a state discretionary fund, with another $150,000 provided from the Commerce Department’s budget if approved by the board, WPRI-TV reported. Also, the Providence City Council reversed course and pledged to provide $300,000 in federal relief funding for WaterFire, which was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The future of the event founded in 1994 was in jeopardy. Peter Mello, managing director of WaterFire, told city councilors last week that the organization had gone into debt during the pandemic after losing private sponsorships. Employees were furloughed, but the organization wants to bring them back this summer to reinstall infrastructure. WaterFire brings hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city to see the arts festival backlit by burning braziers on the city’s rivers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State officials gave initial approval Tuesday to a $6 million settlement to resolve dozens of prisoner lawsuits against the Department of Corrections following a riot that killed seven inmates. With one abstention because of a conflict of interest, the State Fiscal Accountability Authority voted unanimously to approve the deal, which it said would work toward resolving a total of 81 lawsuits filed by or for inmates in state and federal courts against the prison system. The 2018 riot raged for more than seven hours at Lee Correctional Institution in Bishopville, about 40 miles east of Columbia. Most of the slain were stabbed or slashed; others appeared to have been beaten. One inmate described bodies “literally stacked on top of each other, like some macabre woodpile.” Corrections officials have blamed the violence – the worst U.S. prison riot in 25 years – in part on illegal cellphones, which Department Director Bryan Stirling has said represent the greatest security threat inside prisons because they give inmates an unmonitored way to communicate with the outside world and each other. Stirling told the Associated Press after the vote that the deal next goes to the plaintiffs for signatures, before a court decides how to divvy up the money.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said she will join a growing list of Republican governors sending law enforcement officers to the U.S. border with Mexico. Noem’s announcement that she will send up to 50 South Dakota National Guard troops to Texas comes as the GOP ramps up a political fight with President Joe Biden over border security. The issue has drawn a host of prominent GOP figures: former President Donald Trump was expected to travel to the border this week and Republican governors from Florida, Nebraska and Iowa have committed to sending law enforcement officers for border security. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this month announced plans to build more barriers along the border.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee plans to suspend construction-related lane closures on interstates and state routes during the Fourth of July holiday weekend to reduce traffic delays, transportation officials said. Suspension of lane closures in construction areas will start Friday morning and end on the morning of July 6, Tennessee’s Department of Transportation said. “It is estimated that 939,000 motorists will travel Tennessee’s interstates and state routes this July 4 holiday,” Tennessee Transportation Commissioner Clay Bright said. “To help motorists reach their destinations safely and without unnecessary delays, we are suspending lane closures during this holiday travel time.” Drivers will still face some long-term lane closures on construction projects, the department said. Workers might be on the site of construction zones, and reduced speed limits in work zones will still be in effect, the department said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:As coronavirus hospitalizations and cases continue to decrease in Austin and Travis County, Dr. Desmar Walkes, the area's top health chief, said she's growing increasingly concerned about one variant of the disease and the threat it poses for unvaccinated residents. Walkes, who began her role as Austin-Travis County health authority earlier this month, said Austin and Travis County health leaders are closely monitoring the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant making its way across the nation. Walkes said although the strain has yet to be confirmed in Austin and Travis County, the Delta variant will put the area's unvaccinated residents most at risk. Seven cases have been confirmed in Dallas County, according to the county's website last updated on Tuesday. Although residents who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can still be infected by the variant, they are likely to have a milder case and not experience severe illness leading to hospitalizations, Walkes said. Unvaccinated residents, even if they were previously infected with COVID-19, though, will likely be at greater risk of contracting the coronavirus if exposed to the Delta variant.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, is planning to visit Bryce Canyon National Park in southern Utah this week as part of a tour through southwestern states, the White House announced Monday. Emhoff will be visiting the park on Friday as part of a Biden administration tour to celebrate the country’s progress against COVID-19. Emhoff’s visit comes as many U.S. states continue to experience lagging vaccination rates. No additional details about his visit were immediately available. First lady Jill Biden also announced Monday that she and Emhoff will tour a vaccination site in Houston on Tuesday and another vaccine clinic at a middle school in Phoenix on Wednesday. Biden’s office said the trips are intended to highlight the ease of getting vaccinated and mobilize outreach efforts. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited southern Utah in early April as she prepared to submit recommendations on whether to reverse President Donald Trump’s decision to downsize the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The long-awaited extension of the Amtrak line from Rutland to Burlington might be delayed until later in 2022 because of issues in the supply chain. Vermont Rail Action Network Executive Director Christopher Parker told the Rutland Herald on Monday that work is under way at the station in Rutland and the yard and station in Burlington, but some parts are proving difficult to get. “It turns out the switches are on back order,” Parker said. “I don’t know how serious that is.” That could delay the opening of the line from early 2022 to sometime later in 2022, Parker said. The Ethan Allen Express train is being extended north from Rutland to Burlington with stops in Middlebury and Vergennes. The Vermont Rail Advisory Council recently discussed the schedule for the line, Parker said. Southbound trains would leave Burlington at 10:15 a.m. and then depart from Rutland at 12:25 p.m., arriving at New York’s Penn Station at 5:50 p.m. The northbound trips leave from New York City at 2:21 p.m., reaching Rutland at 7:46 p.m. and Burlington at 9:55 p.m. Amtrak service to Vermont was suspended last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Service from Washington and New York City will resume on July 19.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia is expanding its Medicaid program to provide a comprehensive dental benefit to poor adults, meaning more than 750,000 Virginians will be eligible for the benefit starting Thursday. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that it is part of a two-year state budget that includes $35 million in state and federal funds to provide a wide range of dental care to adults for the first time. Currently, Medicaid will pay only for emergency tooth extraction for adults. The benefit expansion includes checkups three times a year to prevent oral disease that can lead to bigger medical problems. The safety-net program serves more than 1.8 million Virginians, including 558,000 people who receive health care coverage because of expanded eligibility. The change will likely mean a significant jump in demand for dentists and about 1,500 dentists have committed to serving adults under the Medicaid benefit. Virginia Dental Association Executive Director Ryan Dunn said more dentists will be needed. Currently, about 2,000 dentists provide dental services through Medicaid, but to get more to participate in the program, Dunn said the state must raise reimbursement rates.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Most of the COVID-19 restrictions that have been in place and modified several times since March 2020 will be lifted Wednesday, meaning restaurants and bars and other businesses can resume full indoor occupancy levels and physical distancing requirements will be lifted. Since May, all of the state’s 39 counties have been in the third phase of a four-stage reopening plan, with indoor capacity limited at 50%. Now, businesses across the state can resume normal operations. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee had set the June 30 date for reopening, and the state fell short of an option that would have allowed earlier opening if 70% of residents age 16 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Even with the creation of lottery incentives with prizes up to $ million, the statewide vaccination rate for those 16 and up is just over 68%. Residents age 12-15 have been eligible for vaccinations since last month, and more than 37% of that group have initiated vaccination, and about 28% are fully vaccinated.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal regulators are proposing a $12,288 fine in response to an explosion and fire at a West Virginia chemical plant that killed a worker and injured three other people. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed that Optima Belle LLC pay the penalty in a citation issued this month, saying the plant in Kanawha County violated federal code that requires employers to provide a workplace “free from recognized hazards that were causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees,” the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. The agency found that the company left employees exposed to hazards while they conducted a chemical drying process on a solid chlorinated product, according to regulators. John Gillenwater, 42, of Hurricanewas killed in the Dec. 8 explosion. Optima Belle can abate the violation by developing policies and training to prevent similar occurrences in the future, regulators said. The company could also contest and litigate the case, OSHA spokeswoman Lenore Uddyback-Fortson said. If the company accepts the citation as issued, the fine would become a final order, she said. Optima Belle has scheduled an informal conference to discuss the citation, she said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A former drug smuggler can practice law in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The 4-3 ruling reverses a decision from the Wisconsin Board of Bar Examiners to block Abby Padlock from becoming an attorney in the state. According to court documents, Padlock became a drug smuggler to earn money so she could become an international language instructor. Police stopped her and a friend as they were driving through Minnesota in 2015 and discovered 114 pounds of marijuana in their vehicle that they were moving from Oregon to Wisconsin. Police also discovered $30,000 in her house that she had been paid for the job. Padlock was charged with two felony drug counts. The charges were reduced to one count of misdemeanor marijuana possession. She was sentenced to three days in jail, placed on probation for two years and ordered to pay a $30,000 forfeiture. She applied to the University of Wisconsin Law School while she was still on probation, but noted on her application that the charges had been dismissed. Applicants also are required to supply a host of details about any criminal violations. Padlock failed to provide any details about her arrest. She did not divulge the amount of marijuana she was carrying, the initial charges she faced, that she spent three days in jail or that she was ordered to pay a $30,000 forfeiture. She was admitted to the law school and began her studies. Officials there didn’t learn of her criminal history until she joined a program that required a background check. The law school chose not to discipline her and allowed her to finish school. She applied for admission to the state bar in 2019. This time, she did include details of her crime on her application.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Supreme Court decided Monday that it won’t allow Wyoming and Montana to sue Washington state for denying a key permit to build a coal export dock that would have sent coal to Asia. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito voted in the minority in the ruling against letting the states sue the third in a case that would have gone directly before the high court. The two major coal mining states have sought to boost exports to prop up an industry in decline for a decade as U.S. utilities switch to gas-fired power and renewable energy. The Washington state Department of Ecology in 2017 denied a permit for the export dock, saying the facility on the Columbia River would cause “irreparable and unavoidable” environmental harm. Denying the permit violated the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against trade protectionism between states, the coal states argued in 2020. Washington state officials were not trying to block Wyoming and Montana coal but acted because of “valid environmental concerns” about the dock, attorneys for the state argued in a court filing later that year In any event, the developer of the Millennium Bulk Terminal project went bankrupt and the project wouldn’t proceed, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in May. Wyoming this year set aside $1 million to help Gov. Mark Gordon’s office pursue the lawsuit and potentially file others against states with policies leading to the early shutdown of Wyoming coal-fired power plants.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/23/us/secure-community-network-jewish-security", "title": "Inside the Secure Community Network, the organization training ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen the survivors of last weekend’s attack on a Texas synagogue talk about why they’re alive today, they point to two factors.\n\nOne is the work of law enforcement. The second is the training and preparation they got from the Secure Community Network, a nonprofit safety and training organization that is “working to build a protective, proactive shield over the North American Jewish community,” as its national director and CEO told CNN.\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened,” Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker told CNN just days after he and others launched a daring escape from a hostage-taker who’d earlier joined their worship service.\n\n“I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the know-how or (known) what to do without that instruction.”\n\nAs last Saturday’s attack on Congregation Beth Israel approached its 11th hour, Cytron-Walker spotted a key moment – just as he’d learned in training set up by the Secure Community Network, or SCN. When he felt the gunman’s guard was down, the rabbi committed to action: He told the others to run, grabbed a chair and threw it at the assailant, giving the hostages enough time to escape with their lives.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” Jeffrey Cohen, vice president of the synagogue’s board of trustees, wrote on Facebook. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nAnd it’s not just active shooter drills. SCN has built a comprehensive security, training and intelligence operation designed to protect Jewish communities across North America – an operation that has proven its worth time and again amid a rise in anti-Semitic incidents, from vandalism to a gunman’s siege.\n\n“I believe that the work that we do and the manner in which we do it will make a difference in the lives of Jewish Americans,” SCN National Director and CEO Michael Masters told CNN, “to be able to participate freely in the practice of their religion and their culture and their traditions.”\n\nTo that end, SCN helps Jewish institutions – synagogues, community centers, day schools or assisted living facilities – implement tools like security cameras and alarm systems to keep them safe while still open and welcoming. It also provides or supports local security directors – many with deep FBI or other law enforcement experience – to monitor safety protocols and threats daily and to train community members to confront or escape deadly threats.\n\nThe problem, he said, is a too-common thread of the “narrative of the 3,000-year history of the Jewish people.”\n\n“Almost everywhere we have existed or sought to make a life, there have been those that have not wanted us there or not wanted us to exist,” Masters said, adding that’s true of other faith traditions as well. “The fact that it exists in the United States at this time is deplorable.”\n\nBuilding SCN to face down those targeted threats – broadly, systematically and head-on – “is about preserving not just who we are as a Jewish people,” he said. “It’s about also preserving, in my opinion, who we are as Americans and what our country stands for.”\n\nAdded Masters: “As a father, the idea that my children might ever question – or as a parent, I might ever question – whether they should, could or can identify as Jewish or participate in Jewish life because of safety and security concerns is not one that should exist in the United States of America – certainly not in 2022.”\n\nSecure Community Network National Director Michael Masters stands in SCN's Jewish Security Operations Command Center in Chicago. courtesy Secure Community Network\n\nA critical nudge at the Tree of Life synagogue\n\nSCN counts among its ranks Brad Orsini, who spent nearly three decades in the FBI before becoming a security director for the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh in 2017. The role was like being the local FBI agent for the Jewish community, he told CNN.\n\nIt was early September 2018 when Orsini huddled for training with members of the Tree of Life synagogue, he recalled. Its rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, told Orsini that in accordance with his Jewish faith, he did not carry his cell phone on the Sabbath.\n\nThat prompted Orsini to open a “hard conversation” with the rabbi.\n\nBrad Orsini was the security director for the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh at the time of the shooting at Tree of Life synagogue. Today he's the senior national security adviser for Secure Community Network. Courtesy Brad Orsini\n\n“I said this all the time – and I don’t say it anymore because it came true and this bothers me to this day,” Orsini told CNN. “I would say, ‘What do you do, how do we combat somebody that walks into our synagogue with an AR-15? Rabbi, we need to have someone with cell phones on.’”\n\nThe conversation changed the rabbi’s mind, Orsini said. Mere weeks later, a gunman stormed the Tree of Life synagogue during Shabbat services and opened fire, killing 11 people – most of them elderly – in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history.\n\nAs gunfire erupted that day, the first call to 911 was made by Myers.\n\nOrsini, who’s been credited by Tree of Life congregants like Steve Weiss for their survival, joined SCN the next year. He’s now the organization’s senior national security adviser, helping communities across the country employ the kind of tough lessons and security enhancements he enacted in Pittsburgh.\n\n“We want it engrained, especially in communities that are targeted like the Jewish community,” Orsini said. “We owe it to our community to educate the community, to give them the tools to save themselves prior to law enforcement getting there.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Rabbi: It feels like 'open hunting season' on Jews 02:38 - Source: CNN Rabbi: It feels like 'open hunting season' on Jews 02:38\n\nFrom security cameras to ‘Run, Hide, Fight’\n\nSCN was founded in the early 2000s in response to a series of threats against the Jewish community – mostly by foreign terrorist organizations, Masters told CNN. But it’s only been in recent years, after Masters took over in 2017, that it has evolved into a fully fledged security operation, Orsini said.\n\nIts mission relies on five pillars, Masters said: Intelligence and information sharing; physical security solutions and assessments; training and exercise; coordinating with local, state and federal law enforcement; and incident response and crisis management.\n\nThe work is tailored by community. “Every city’s a little different, every city has to work to their own culture,” Orsini said. “However, the basic tenets of a good program really remain the same.”\n\nSCN works with regional Jewish federations to embed its security directors and advisers in places with significant Jewish populations. Elsewhere, it partners to support local security teams. Other SCN experts oversee the security of smaller Jewish communities across wide zones or offer support to swathes of the North American network.\n\nSCN now has more than 50 security directors like Phil Niedringhaus, whose coverage area is Colorado. He relies on expertise and connections built over a career in law enforcement – including 29 years with the FBI – to provide some 105 Jewish organizations with best practices standardized by SCN.\n\nThey include threat vulnerability assessments, SCN security experts told CNN. Advisers visit a site like a synagogue and work with its leaders to see what kind of security is already in place and what gaps can be filled: Are there cameras? Does the organization have a relationship with local law enforcement? Has the congregation gotten training?\n\nThat last piece may be the most important, with three key tenets of its own, Orsini said: Trainees learn situational awareness to help identify potential threats; get Countering Active Threat Training, which includes the concept of “Run, Hide, Fight” and committing to action; and learn to “Stop the Bleed” to triage wounded or injured victims.\n\nAnother key component is coordinating with law enforcement at all levels before, during and after a crisis, Orsini said. On Sunday – just hours after the hostage attack at the synagogue in Colleyville, Texas – SCN convened a webinar for hundreds of Jewish community stakeholders, US Homeland Security officials and senior FBI personnel to talk about emergency plans.\n\nShort of mass casualty events, SCN experts also might deal with vandalism at a synagogue or anti-Semitic fliers, sharing intelligence with local police and with SCN’s Operations Center and Duty Desk in Chicago, which are staffed by intelligence analysts around the clock who can share credible threats with other agencies.\n\nWhen someone attacks the Jewish community, SCN notifies its directors across the country, keeping them updated on the latest information. Then, directors can coordinate increased patrols with local law enforcement and field calls from local Jewish leaders, offering advice or reassurance that the attack – like last weekend’s in Colleyville – looks to be an isolated incident.\n\nUltimately SCN’s goal is to create uniformity in security practices in Jewish spaces across the country, Masters said, in the same way Americans have spent decades learning uniform fire safety practices like “stop, drop and roll.”\n\nIt’s especially important, he said, because members of the Jewish community are “not static” – a Jewish child might grow up attending a day school in Chicago, go to summer camp in Wisconsin, go to college in New Orleans or get a job in Washington, DC.\n\nThe security measures should be the same everywhere, Masters said.\n\n“Fear is paralyzing,” he said. “Empowerment is mobilizing.”\n\nBalancing security with a welcoming faith\n\nWhen Rabbi Tuvia Brander was in rabbinical school, he never took a course on security.\n\n“I can tell you about Talmud, I can tell you about the Bible, I can tell you about Jewish law and Jewish history, and interface with other religions,” he said. “But I’m not a security expert.”\n\nStill, soon after he became the mara d’atra – a spiritual leader – of Young Israel of West Hartford in Connecticut, Brander on his own formed a committee to assess security. While he hoped the Centrist Orthodox congregation would not face a threat, he wanted to be prepared.\n\nSCN's community security director is the \"go-to person\" for security, says Rabbi Tuvia Brander, allowing him to focus on being his congregation's spiritual leader. R' Tuvia Brander (ELM)\n\nHis team had conversations with local police and fire departments – just as all the synagogues around them were doing. And while their local partners were great, Brander said, the planning was neither effective nor efficient.\n\n“When we wanted to give training to congregants in the past about ‘Run, Hide, Fight,’ stuff like that … it was only us, it was whatever our institutional capacity was,” he said.\n\nThen last year, the Jewish Federation of Greater Hartford hired an SCN community security director, “who can take all the expertise, the wisdom, the training and the vast and deep resources of the Secure Community Network and institutionalize it in our community,” Brander said.\n\nThat director is now the “go-to person” for security, he said, streamlining the process and allowing Brander to focus more on the work of a rabbi, which now includes finding a balance between keeping his congregation safe and ensuring it remains true to its identity and welcoming to the community outside its walls.\n\n“Nobody wants to go to worship in a fortress,” said Niedringhaus, the son of a Lutheran pastor, “because it doesn’t blend well for the mission of the organization or being part of the community or neighborhood you’re in.”\n\nTo that end, Brander’s congregation has what he described as “greeter guards” who are familiar with the congregation and can offer members a smile and a “Shabbat Shalom” – while also poised to identify suspicious activity.\n\nRabbi Scott Roland says faith and security can go hand-in-hand. Courtesy Ethan Karp\n\n“Sometimes people frame this as either/or: Can we be secure, and then we have to give up on the welcoming? What we really try to do is to double down on both,” Brander said.\n\nConcerns have been raised – though never hard pushback – that security measures could make synagogues less welcoming, said Rabbi Scott Roland of Congregation Shaarey Tikvah near Cleveland, where the Jewish federation has its own skilled security experts who often partner with SCN.\n\nBut in fact, faith and security can go hand-in-hand, he said: “We can serve God and one another and also do so in safety and security.”\n\n“Our tradition and our Torah implores us to choose life, to do what we can do to protect life,” Roland said. “And so the notion of securing our buildings and the safety of our communities is not separate from our religious lives. It’s very much an aspect of our religious lives, though we wish it didn’t have to be.”", "authors": ["Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/01/23"}]}

The guide was screaming, 'Let go! Let go!' I dropped down and felt my bones break.\"\n\nZavala, a young mother from Mexico, lay on a bed at an El Paso shelter on Wednesday in a room with four other migrants who survived terrifying falls from a barrier nearly three stories tall. Among them, they had undergone eight surgeries in the past month. Zavala's right leg was fastened with an external fixator that resembled scaffolding.\n\nEmerging public health data affirm what border county hospital trauma surgeons have been suspecting since the U.S. government began raising the height of the Southwest border wall to slow migration: the 30-foot fence causes more injuries and is far deadlier, than any barrier before it.\n\nPhysicians say the falls and fatalities are a public health crisis for border communities at a time when the Biden administration, and the state of Texas, are investing in new border fencing amid record apprehensions of migrants.\n\nCounty hospitals in El Paso and San Diego are receiving patients with border wall fall-related trauma at a rate of one per day in 2023, according to their chief trauma surgeons. The injuries range from complex lower extremity breaks including shattered ankles, foot and leg bones to life-altering spinal and cranial injuries.\n\nBorder wall falls carry \"a mortality rate that is higher than COVID in the general population,\" said Dr. Susan McLean, surgical ICU medical director at University Medical Center in El Paso. \"And it is something that is happening all up and down the border.\"\n\nThe Biden administration in October announced it would waive more than two dozen environmental protection laws to construct 20 miles of new border fencing in south Texas this year, breaking a presidential campaign promise to halt construction of new barriers. The fence proposed for Starr County has been described as shorter and \"moveable.\"\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security is already replacing an 18-foot fence with the 30-foot version near San Diego. DHS didn't immediately respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment regarding whether the agency takes into account public health outcomes when designing the style or height of border barriers.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year on the increase in migrant deaths at the border, Customs and Border Protection said: \"Crossing the border illegally is inherently dangerous. CBP urges migrants to seek lawful pathways into the United States and not to place their lives in the hands of human smugglers, whose priority is profit.\"\n\nTexas also is poised to expand its border security measures. In addition to the concertina wire and buoy barriers in the Rio Grande built under Gov. Greg Abbott's Operation Lone Star, the Texas House last week approved a $1.54 billion Senate proposal to fund the construction of 50 additional miles of border fencing.\n\n\"Texas will continue to utilize every tool and strategy to deter and repel illegal crossings between ports of entry as President Biden’s dangerous open border policies encourage migrants from over 150 countries to illegally enter the country,\" Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said in an emailed response to questions on migrant deaths.\n\n'This wall can't be climbed'\n\nWhen DHS began construction on a 30-foot fence in southern California in 2019, then-President Donald Trump described the barrier as impassable: “This wall can’t be climbed,” he said during a tour at Otay Mesa.\n\nBorder Patrol officials are rarely so starry-eyed. CBP prefers to use the language \"border barrier system\" in agency communications to refer to fencing, lighting, cameras, technology and roadways – elements Border Patrol agents say slow, but don't stop, migrants from crossing the border unlawfully and trying to evade apprehension.\n\nThe injured women at the shelter, each with a badly broken foot, ankle, or leg, climbed the 30-foot fence in the same way: using makeshift rope ladders of braided cord and plastic pipe, the kind favored by smugglers in the El Paso area.\n\nThey said they didn't realize they'd be forced to climb the wall; or that it was so high, or that there wouldn't be a way down on the U.S. side. They didn't believe, either, that they'd be eligible for a visa and never considered presenting at a port of entry.\n\nOnce there, in the hands of dangerous traffickers, there was no turning back.\n\n\"They don't treat you like a queen,\" Zavala said. \"You have to climb.\"\n\nShe thought about her toddler son, his delicate health and the money she needed to pay for his frequent medical care. She let go and landed face down, her foot twisting unnaturally. She said she only felt cold at first and began crawling north on all fours.\n\nBorder wall fall trauma\n\nFrom 2000 through 2019 – when construction began on the 30-foot fence in California – El Paso's University Medical Center recorded a single death from a border wall fall, McLean said.\n\nLast year alone at UMC, nine patients died after a border wall fall. Another 326 people were treated for injuries for a mortality rate of 2.8%, she said.\n\nThe University of California, San Diego Health medical center has documented a similar rate of border wall fall-related trauma: 345 patients this year, January through October, said Dr. Jay Doucet, chief of trauma. The human and financial costs keep rising, he said.\n\n\"October was the worst month we have seen: 70 major trauma victims,\" he said. \"It’s more than two a day.\"\n\nThere is no comprehensive count of border wall fall-related injuries, Doucet said.\n\nTrauma surgeons – especially at university-run hospitals in counties along the U.S.-Mexico border – have been collecting data independently to better understand a public health problem they say trumps politics.\n\nThe increase in border wall fall-related trauma rose in San Diego and El Paso after 2020, coinciding with the expansion of the higher 30-foot fence and a surge in migration. Border Patrol migrant encounters rocketed from 400,000 in fiscal 2020 during the pandemic to more than 2.4 million in fiscal 2023.\n\n\"We noticed starting right around 2020 that the numbers had gone up,\" McLean said.\n\n\"It qualifies as a public health problem,\" she said. \"It's a large population, and it's a preventable problem with serious consequences.\"\n\nMcLean and emergency room doctors have developed some best practices, she said, including regularly ordering CT scans of the spine as migrants often have spinal injuries they may not be aware of yet.\n\nThe height of the wall can be lethal. Vicki Gaubeca, associate director of U.S. immigration and border policy for Human Rights Watch, argues that it's by design.\n\n\"The rationale is that at 30 feet your body naturally experiences vertigo and it makes it easier to fall off the wall,\" she said. \"We’re talking about the equivalent of a three-story building. It almost seems intentional that they built it that high.\"\n\nMany migrants arrive at the border in poor condition after arduous journeys overland, and their health complicates their path to healing, Doucet said.\n\n\"Their rate of infection is higher and their immunity is poor,\" he said. \"They stay in the hospital much longer; their surgeries are more difficult. Their long-term healing is in doubt. They don’t come back to clinic appointments. They don’t get rehab; often they have to take out their own staples.\"\n\nAll this means local residents are waiting longer for care, as well, he said.\n\nThere aren't enough orthopedic surgeons at the hospital to meet the increased need in San Diego. Patients with spinal fractures, whether local resident or migrant, are waiting up to five days for surgery now instead of 2.5 days before 2019, he said.\n\n\"When the wall was built, comments were made that the wall wasn’t climbable,\" Doucet said. \"No one anticipated the number of injuries that were going to occur. The number of injuries appears to increase regardless of administration.\"\n\n'If you are fighting for your life'\n\nZavala could spend weeks in the shelter as she waits to heal.\n\nThe pain in her lower leg throbs and shoots up to her hip, she said. She was scheduled to undergo a second surgery. But she said she knew she was lucky: the other men in her group stayed with her in the desert until Border Patrol agents found them and put her in an ambulance.\n\nImmigrant advocate Crystal Sandoval, director of crossborder strategies at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, has worked with hundreds of migrants and refugees at the El Paso-Juárez border and has seen them face even the most dangerous obstacles – no matter the consequence.\n\n\"The wall is definitely not a deterrent,\" she said.\n\n\"If you are fighting for your life, if you are fighting not to starve to death, for the future of your children and your family, I don’t think a wall or anything is going to stop you,\" she said. \"It’s like saying you are going to forget hope.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/22/migrant-deaths-drownings-heat-stroke-injuries-mexico-border/7639106001/", "title": "MIgrant drownings, dehydration deaths mount on US-Mexico border", "text": "Border-crossing deaths in the El Paso area are mounting, as migrants desperate to reach the U.S. risk dangerous canals and scorching temperatures.\n\nAt least 37 migrants have died of injuries, drowning, dehydration and vehicle fatalities crossing into El Paso and southern New Mexico since October 2021, compared with 39 in all of fiscal 2021. Border Patrol in the Big Bend sector east of El Paso has reported an additional 24 deaths in that time period, though that figure does not include bodies recovered by other law enforcement agencies.\n\nFifteen people suspected to be migrants have drowned in canals along the border or died of water-related injuries, the majority since irrigation season began in early June when the depth of fast-moving water increased sharply. In the rugged landscape surrounding El Paso, climate change is driving up temperatures in the Chihuahuan Desert, where migrants risk deadly dehydration or heat stroke. Five migrants have died of heat exposure in the El Paso Sector since October.\n\n\"This is a major human rights crisis at the border,\" said Fernando Garcia, executive director of the nonprofit Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso.\n\nIrrigation season brings more than a dozen canal drownings\n\nIrrigation season on the Rio Grande poses a quiet threat. The system of concrete-lined canals that deliver Rio Grande water released from Elephant Butte in New Mexico to farms in Texas is designed to move the water rapidly; inches of water in winter can become 10- to 12-feet deep during the summer.\n\n“The purpose of the canal is to get water as fast as possible to our agriculture community,” Border Patrol Agent Orlando Marrero said.\n\n“At 62 pounds per square foot, the water traveling nine miles per hour will create exactly 302 pounds of force,” said Marrero, a trained emergency medical technician. “Imagine an average person, five-feet-eight or nine, in 10-foot deep water: There is no way. They are going to be swept.\"\n\nAgents in the sector go through a yearly swift-water training.\n\n“Our El Paso station leadership is fully aware of the dangers,” said Border Patrol El Paso Sector spokeswoman Valeria Morales. “There are chains and rescue ropes along the canal. But sometimes (migrants) are unable to grab onto them or they are too weak to hold on.\"\n\nMorales said El Paso Station leaders have discussed ways to prevent drownings in the canals. The El Paso County Irrigation District controls water flow through the canals, which are under the jurisdiction of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC).\n\nIrrigation district manager Jesus Reyes said most drowning deaths take place in the American Canal alongside the border fence, which under the Trump administration was built taller, to 30 feet.\n\n“That made it more dangerous,” Reyes said. “Those people are coming over and, in some cases, they climb over and fall directly into the canal.”\n\n“These people are trying to come over to make a better life,\" he said. \"All we can do is try and get the word to these people to not to attempt it.”\n\nIBWC public affairs officer Lori Kuczmanski said each year the IBWC and other agencies emphasize the dangers of approaching the canals.\n\nCrossing the Chihuahuan Desert is a dangerous gamble\n\nThe Chihuahuan Desert surrounding El Paso — extending east into Big Bend country and west across New Mexico — rises and falls over mountainous ridges and offers no respite from heat that can push the human body to its limit. This fiscal year five of the 37 migrant deaths in El Paso sector, which includes 264 miles of borderline in New Mexico and West Texas, have been heat-related.\n\nDehydration starts as dry mouth. Dry mouth turns to dry heaving. The veins constrict and muscles begin to cramp up. Or the body will stop sweating and begin seizing, signs of heat stroke.\n\n“The New Mexico region — Lordsburg and Deming — it is remote and mountainous,” Morales said. “It takes hours to days for these groups to reach a highway. It is already harsh terrain and you add triple-digit temperatures to that mix, it’s dangerous.”\n\nCriminal organizations routinely leave behind injured or dehydrated migrants, who then die in the desert, she said.\n\nTwo pedestrians killed in early April on Interstate 10 near Sunset Heights may have been undocumented immigrants, but law enforcement has not confirmed their identities.\n\nIf Border Patrol leadership believes the person is a migrant, it often will be included in the statistics — but not always. \"There have been instances where a person dies in the canal or in the desert and they are not a migrant; they are a local,\" Morales said.\n\nClimate change multiplies risks in the Big Bend Sector\n\nArizona's Sonoran Desert, which has even higher temperatures than the Chihuahuan Desert, has claimed migrant lives for decades. But an increase in border crossings in West Texas, and rising temperatures linked to climate change, means more migrants are now being exposed to deadly heat in the Chihuahuan Desert.\n\nEast of El Paso, Border Patrol agents in Big Bend Sector patrol 517 miles of U.S.-Mexico borderline demarcated by the Rio Grande. The desert terrain is rugged and the climate extreme, ranging from severe heat in the summer to freezing temperatures in winter. Border Patrol has recorded 24 migrant deaths in Big Bend in the first eight months of fiscal 2022, the same number recorded in all of fiscal 2021.\n\nThe total number is likely much higher, the Culberson County sheriff's office alone reported recovering more than 20 bodies in 2021.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2021, annual Customs and Border Protection encounters in the remote Big Bend sector did not surpass 10,000. Then during fiscal year 2021, encounters skyrocketed to 37,266. So far in fiscal year 2022, Big Bend has seen 25,573 encounters.\n\n“The real concern for us, as it is for El Paso to our west, is the summertime heat and the unscrupulous actions of the smugglers, the coyotes, who are pushing people through our sector who would not have come through before,” including people who are older or not in good shape, said Greg Davis, spokesman for Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector.\n\nIncreased border crossings coincides with record-high temperatures. Temperature records have fallen across Texas this May and June. El Paso's average maximum temperature during May is 88.7 degrees, but this year it was almost five degrees hotter at 93.3 degrees. The weather station at Rio Grande Village in the Big Bend tied the all-time temperature record of 117 degrees on June 8.\n\nIn an October 2021 study, state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon found that West Texas counties are experiencing faster temperature increases than other parts of the state. Since 1975, average temperatures have increased 0.83 degrees in El Paso County, 0.71 in Culberson County and 0.70 in Hudspeth County.\n\nA study published in the journal Science last year found that risks for migrants crossing the Sonoran Desert will increase as the climate changes. They found that over the next three decades higher temperatures will increase the risk of dehydration and that migrants will have to carry 34% more water to survive.\n\n\"In the next 30 years, with rising temperatures, it’s going to become even more extreme and push those levels to even further beyond what humans can actually sustain,\" Hallie Walker, a University of Idaho researcher and co-author of the study, told The Guardian.\n\nDeterrence measures have failed to discourage migrant crossings\n\nAdvocates say restrictive immigration policies are pushing people to cross in dangerous areas. For more than two years, the Center for Disease Control's public health order Title 42 has allowed Border Patrol to quickly expel most migrants to Mexico or their countries of origin, blocking many from seeking asylum or other immigration relief. The quick expulsions also preclude prosecution for illegal entry, leading some migrants to try to cross again and again.\n\nFernando Garcia said since the 1990s, immigration enforcement has funneled migrants to cross in more remote areas. In recent years, he said policies including Title 42, the Migrant Protection Protocols and the 30-foot border fence have made the problem even worse.\n\n\"We were very concerned that the number (of deaths) was going to spike dramatically,\" Garcia said. \"And unfortunately, nobody is doing anything.\"\n\n\"We have never seen so many deaths in a short period of time,\" he said. \"The structure of that canal means that whoever falls there does not come out alive.\"\n\nBorder Patrol has stepped up its efforts to prevent migrants from dying. In El Paso Sector, Border Patrol has installed 17 rescue beacons in areas with significant migrant traffic and limited cellphone service. The towers are topped with a strobe light and a flag with the emergency cross; when a migrant pushes the help call button, the tower transmits a precise location for Border Patrol to dispatch agents to the rescue.\n\nThere were 165 rescue beacons deployed across the Southwest Border in January, according to a Government Accountability Office report. The agency has also installed more than 2,500 placards with geographic coordinates that migrants can provide to 911 rescuers.\n\nGarcia said these preventative measures will fall short without change to immigration policy.\n\n\"This is not only about posting signs, this is about the whole policy that does not allow migrants and asylum seekers to come to the United States legally,\" he said. \"We need to fundamentally change this policy of deterrence at the border to alleviate the pressure of migrants going into these dangerous places.\"\n\nOfficial reports undercount border deaths\n\nThe true number of migrants dying in attempts to cross the U.S.-Mexico border is difficult to pin down. Border Patrol does not recover the bodies of all the people who perish in their attempts to cross, as local law enforcement agencies are often the first responders.\n\nIn a directive accompanying the 2020 appropriation to the Department of Homeland Security, a congressional committee required Border Patrol to report data on migrant deaths, create plans to reduce migrant deaths and coordinate with other agencies, such as local medical examiner offices. A U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in April found Border Patrol fell short on the directive.\n\n“Border Patrol has not collected and recorded, or reported to Congress, complete data on migrant deaths, or disclosed associated data limitations,” the GAO found.\n\nHuman rights organizations create their own tallies of migrant deaths in the absence of complete official data.\n\nThe United Nations' International Organization for Migration, or IOM, documented at least 650 deaths of people attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border between January and December 2021, more than in any other year since they began documenting deaths in 2014.\n\nIn the report, Michele Klein-Solomon, IOM regional director for North America, Central America and the Caribbean, said saving lives should be a top priority for the region.\n\n\"Families in search of the truth about missing migrant relatives need answers,\" she said, \"and policymakers need better data to ensure migration is safe and dignified for all.”\n\nReporting contributed by Daniel Borunda.\n\nStaff writer Martha Pskowski may be reached at mpskowski@elpasotimes.com and @psskow on Twitter.\n\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@elpasotimes.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/03/08/new-jersey-companies-want-help-build-trumps-border-wall/98911702/", "title": "New Jersey companies want to help build Trump's border wall", "text": "Hannan Adely, and Monsy Alvarado\n\nNorthJersey\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could be a windfall for some New Jersey companies that want to be part of the massive project.\n\nA dozen companies from the Garden State have expressed interest in a federal request for firms to submit concepts for “the design and build of several prototype wall structures” along the 2,000-mile southern border. They include companies involved with construction, steel, environmental consulting, fencing, lighting and landscaping.\n\nCAST Lighting, based in Hawthorne, hopes to be chosen to put its patented LED lighting atop any wall or fencing, said the national sales manager, George Ishee.\n\n“Fencing is the No. 2 deterrent.

Construction of Blackwood, which has been involved with several government construction projects in New Jersey and Philadelphia. Bob Gillies, vice president of construction for the company, said A.P. Construction has built sound-barrier walls along roads in the Garden State. He said the company plans to submit a proposal for the construction of a portion of the wall.\n\n\"I don't know how much, I don't know what segments they are giving out at this point in time,'' Gillies said. \"We have created walls up in this area, and I’m sure it would not be much different than those type of partitions, walls or fencing we have done up here.\"\n\nTrump issued an executive order to build a wall on the southern border just days after he was sworn into office. The president has said the wall is necessary for national security and to prevent illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The project has generated fierce political opposition, as well as concerns about land access, the environmental impact and the hefty cost.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted last month found that 43 percent of the 1,503 adults surveyed think a border wall would not have much impact on illegal immigration, while 29 percent thought a wall along the entire border with Mexico would lead to a \"major reduction\" in illegal immigration.\n\nMarshall Robert, of Rowbear Consulting, P.C., of Asbury Park, has expressed interest in the project. His engineering company specializes in helping government agencies execute projects that are cost-effective and environmentally sensitive, he said. His company is certified as a Hubzone firm, a designation given to small businesses in urban and rural communities that commit to hiring people from low income areas and that receive federal contract preference.\n\n\"If they are going to build it, they ought to pay attention to the ecosystem, and we specialize in doing some of the complex ecosystems big projects that tend to have controversy,'' said Robert, who said that before forming his firm 10 years ago he worked on a border patrol station project in Maine \"I'm a small-business person and I built my business and operate it in a low-income community. Not only do I want to help companies build cost-effectively and environmentally sensitive, I also want to make sure that people who live in a low-income area can benefit by getting a good job.\"\n\nMary Osendowski, of E-Federal Business LLC of Medford, said she works with steel, construction, fencing, and security companies and plans to submit one bid consisting of the work that all the companies would be able to do for the wall. She said her target would be to include 20 to 25 companies in her bid proposal. The companies she's been in contact with that are interested in the project are in different parts of the country, she said.\n\nOsendowski said she voted for Trump and that the wall would help curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking and would also prevent Islamic terrorists from entering the country.\n\n\"It's not just to keep the immigrants but it's really to keep the drug lords out,'' she said.\n\nOther companies in New Jersey that have filed to participate in the project are: Safeguards Technology LLC of Hackensack, Ameristar Contracting Group of Ocean Gate, Skyline Steel LLC of Parsippany and Paradigm Services Inc. of Wharton.\n\nAllied Building Products Corp. of East Rutherford and Maser Consulting PA of Red Bank were on the list but removed their names after The Record's story was initially published.\n\nKristie Wieland, communications manager for Allied, said the company has no interest in getting involved with the wall project. She said the name had been entered mistakenly by someone who works at Allied.\n\n\"We saw it run, and we had confirmed that someone had put us on the list and we immediately pulled it back,\" she said.\n\nSome companies that have supported Trump have faced backlash or boycotts, but it’s unclear whether or how the companies that will help build the wall will be affected.\n\nRobert, of Rowbear, said he's worried about the negative reaction he might receive for his interest in working on the project.\n\n\"Anybody who has a small business has got to be concerned, and putting your name on this list and having reporters call you, it tells you something,'' he said. \"I'm not here to make a political statement about anything.\"\n\nOthers said they are not concerned about any negative reaction they might receive, but declined to share their views on the wall.\n\nGillies said he prefers to stay \"neutral on politics.\"\n\nLegal residents feel urgency to obtain citizenship\n\nClergy, religious organizations and advocates mobilize to help immigrants facing deportation\n\nRefugees find help from local community organizations\n\n\"Every different administration puts out projects, and if you like or dislike a project because you are dealing with the administration, you may not work as much,'' he said. \"So we don’t put the work out, but if it's there we are going to go after it.\"\n\nIshee said his company was “not doing it for political reasons.”\n\n“There could be a political backlash, but we are in business to make money and put people to work and provide a good service, whether it’s at a wall or substation or airport or prison,” he said. “We don’t want to approach it from a political standpoint, only from a business standpoint.”\n\nAsked about the controversy around the proposed wall, Ishee responded: “All I know is we have locks on our front door for a reason. We don’t just open the door and let anybody come in at any time and take what they want,” he said.\n\nVendors have until March 20 to submit concept papers. In the second phase, they’ll have until May 3 to submit proposals, including pricing. The plan is to start building “wall segments,” according to the notice from the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection.\n\n“The intent of this procurement is to acquire and evaluate available wall prototypes and provide some initial construction of some wall segments, but is not intended as the vehicle for the procurement of the total wall solution for the border with Mexico,” the notice states.\n\nJim Tobias, a retired engineer who voted for Hillary Clinton and is a critic of the wall, was among the New Jersey residents to add his name as an interested vendor. Tobias said he and others plans to submit \"several hundred\" proposals that clearly show their opposition to the project and said he welcomes more ideas.\n\n\"What we are going to submit and what we are going to allow others to submit through us, since we already have a procurement account, will be what you might call politically critical concept papers,'' he said. \"We have a bunch of wonderful, wonderful ideas.\"\n\nAmong the \"concepts\" he plans to submit, he said, is removing the Statue of Liberty from Liberty Island and shipping it to the U.S. border in Texas. Once there, he said, Lady Liberty will lie on her side and be stretched \"out for 3,000 miles\" and be electrified.\n\nTobias said he first saw on Twitter that the government was going to accept proposals for the wall, and thought it would be an opportunity to protest.\n\n\"It just seems like there is a lot of ways to protest, and there are so many opportunities for questioning the current policies and practices of this new administration,'' said Tobias, of Matawan. \"The more people who speak up, the better.\"\n\nDespite the hurdles, Ishee believes the project will get built.\n\n“They are fast-tracking this though the government, through the [General Services Administration]. They are moving forward with full intent to do it,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/el-paso/2021/06/25/harris-border-patrol-immigration-policy-el-paso-us-mexico-border-crossings/5329546001/", "title": "Kamala Harris border visit holds chance to learn migration problems", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday visits El Paso, a city that continues to live up to its reputation as the Ellis Island of the Southwest with its ceaseless flow of migrants attempting to enter the U.S.\n\nThe one-day stop comes after a trip to Guatemala and Mexico earlier this month, part of the vice president's mandate to address the root causes of northbound migration. During that visit, while alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Harris — the daughter of immigrants — had a message for Central Americans: “Do not come. Do not come.”\n\nBut the immigrants keep coming.\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities in Juárez rescued 80 U.S.-bound migrants from Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala, who were crammed into a sweltering stash house. The Central Americans were among roughly 400 other migrants liberated in the past four weeks from multiple stash houses throughout Juárez, according to local police.\n\n“Human traffickers have managed to betray people from Central America and other countries who arrive here believing that the doors to the U.S. are open when in reality they’re not,” said Enrique Valenzuela, who directs a state-run migrant aid center near the international bridge in Juárez.\n\nBorder Patrol continues to confront repeat migrant crossings\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol reported stopping a total of 180,034 unauthorized crossings along the entire Southwest border this May — the highest monthly total recorded since 2000. The figure includes migrants who made repeated attempts at crossing.\n\nEl Paso has been the second or third busiest sector for the Border Patrol in recent years. The busiest region is currently the Texas Rio Grande Valley, where former President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to Edinburg next week. Trump will visit at the invitation of Gov. Greg Abbott, who announced plans earlier this month to continue the former presidents' border wall construction.\n\nBy choosing El Paso, Harris is visiting the place where the Trump administration first tested its widely criticized deterrence policy of separating migrant children from their parents or guardians. El Paso's military base, Fort Bliss, is also home to one of the largest federally run emergency shelters for migrant children who crossed the border alone. The site has come under fire amid allegations that conditions within the shelter are unacceptable.\n\nValenzuela has witnessed the recent waves of migrants who have overwhelmed binational sister cities like Juárez and El Paso. First, there was the record surge of Central American families attempting to enter the U.S. two summers ago. Many of those families were turning themselves in at official ports of entry. U.S. immigration authorities initially responded by limiting the number of migrants they allowed across. Families then began camping out in long lines along the international bridge between El Paso and Juárez, waiting for a chance at entry.\n\nThen came a borderwide program called Migrant Protection Protocols, better known as “Remain in Mexico,” which required asylum-seekers to wait out their U.S. court dates in dangerous Mexican border cities. President Joe Biden ended MPP in January and his administration is now incrementally admitting migrants who were part of the program.\n\nDuring the Remain in Mexico program, shelter populations in Juárez ballooned past capacity. Valenzuela’s office began maintaining an official waiting list that eventually grew to tens of thousands of migrants. Huge migrant camps also began popping up in public spaces in multiple Mexican border cities.\n\nThe recent stash house discoveries worry Valenzuela.\n\n“We are concerned that our local shelters will become saturated again,” he said. “We’re seeing very clearly that every day more and more people arrive.”\n\nValenzuela would like to see more U.S. support for combating human smuggling operations and opening more humanitarian spaces for migrants, such as shelters and aid centers in Mexico.\n\nMigrants arrive at El Paso nonprofit shelters\n\nAcross the border in El Paso, migrants continue to arrive at a network of nonprofit shelters run by Annunciation House. Director Ruben Garcia said their shelters are receiving an average of 350 migrants weekly. Most are families entering after being exempted from a pandemic-related provision that allows the Border Patrol to quickly expel unauthorized border crossers. The exemptions are migrants considered to be in \"vulnerable\" situations. The shelter also is receiving young adults who age out of the child migrant shelters and injured migrants who are discharged from the hospital after unsuccessful attempts at climbing over the border wall.\n\nGarcia welcomes Harris’ visit to the border.\n\n“It’s incredibly important to have a firsthand sense of the reality on the border … and have (politicians) just listen and see and come to understand, because they are the ones who are going to set policy,\" he said.\n\nHarris has faced political pressure to visit the U.S.-Mexico border ever since Biden appointed her with stemming the flow of U.S.-bound migration. Her visit to El Paso will be the first since becoming vice president and one of countless trips to the border made by a flurry of politicians.\n\nJosiah Heyman, director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies at the University of Texas at El Paso, feels these cameos at the border are mostly political theater.\n\n\"They’re not necessary (to addressing the root causes of migration),\" he said. \"That said, some degree of attention to the border is good … if it helps people in the borderlands speak their visions and opinions and articulate their interests.\"\n\nAddressing ongoing migration requires a long-term strategy\n\nHarris' office hadn't released details as of Thursday afternoon about where she would go and whom she would meet with during her time in El Paso. The vice president will travel with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who has made multiple trips to the border since assuming his post.\n\nContending with the rising numbers of migrants making the dangerous journey north requires complex long-term solutions, Heyman said. But, he said, the U.S. does have the option to take more immediate action on other related issues, such as expanding and speeding up legal migration pathways.\n\n\"I think we need to look through the entire immigration system and clear out all the backlogs,\" Heyman said. \"We have people who qualify to immigrate, who have been checked and are waiting for 20 years.\"\n\nBy constricting legal pathways, Heyman said, \"we’re just making money for the smugglers.\"\n\nValenzuela, with the migrant aid center in Juárez, said smugglers are charging migrants between $6,000 to $10,000 or more to come to the U.S.\n\nUnlike Ellis Island, most present-day migrants who show up at America’s southern doorstep can’t expect to legally stay in the U.S. after passing a series of government inspections.\n\n\"Many of us in the United States … convince ourselves that we should be exempt from having to deal with the reality of (our southern) neighbors,\" said Garcia of Annunciation House. \"We have to be willing to bite the bullet and come up with a system of allowing people to enter in an orderly manner.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/immigration/2018/04/16/trump-wall-border-cost-millions-near-santa-teresa-trigger-questions/508172002/", "title": "Trump wall is a go near Santa Teresa; but is it a wall at all?", "text": "It’s been a week since crews broke ground for the new $73 million border wall being constructed along a 20-mile stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border near Santa Teresa, N.M., west of El Paso.\n\nWhat's being erected will be similar to the 18-foot tall steel bollard barrier installed between Sunland Park, N.M., and Anapra, one of the poorest communities in Juárez last year.\n\nAaron Hull, Chief Patrol Agent of the U.S. Border Patrol in El Paso sector, last week said the agency is very pleased with the outcome of that 1.3-mile section of bollard wall between Sunland Park and Anapra, saying it's durable and has reduced illegal crossings in the area.\n\nThe bollards will be between 18 feet and 30 feet tall with a 5-foot anti-climbing plate. They will be embedded about six feet into the ground with another 2 feet of concrete underneath that, Hull said.\n\nBut is it a wall or a fence?\n\nWhether the structure is a wall or a fence remains a topic of debate.\n\nHull said the new barrier is described as a wall because \"it’s a very serious structure.\"\n\nRetired Border Patrol sector chief Victor Manjarrez Jr., an associate director of the Center for Law and Human Behavior at the University of Texas at El Paso, said the terminology is influenced by politics.\n\n\"They are referring to it as a wall, I’m used to calling it a barrier,\" said Manjarrez, who retired from the Border Patrol in 2011 after more than 20 years of service. \"But all terms are politicized, depending on who the administration is.\"\n\nFor example, under President Bill Clinton's administration when the Border Patrol started first building barriers in San Diego, it was acceptable to call it a wall, Manjarrez said. Then when President George W. Bush came into office, the term \"wall\" was not accepted anymore and instead it was called a barrier, he said.\n\n\"Now we have a president who calls it a wall all the time. On that, I'm sure the people at CBP are paying attention saying, hey, the president is calling it a wall, we are going to call it a wall,\" he said.\n\nDuring the press conference during last week's groundbreaking, Hull mostly referred to the project as the president's wall, sometimes calling it \"fence\" but quickly correcting himself.\n\n\"It’s very much a wall and we are going to use it to stop illegal entries,\" he said.\n\nHull said his agency took a look at the prototypes of the border wall recently built in San Diego, but decided to use the same model of the bollard wall that was installed last year in Sunland Park. The metal barrier was part of the 2006 Secure Fence Act signed by Bush.\n\n\"It works for us and it’s what we are going to put out here for the next 20 miles,” he said.\n\nWho's paying for it?\n\nDuring his campaign for office, President Donald Trump promised Mexico was going to pay for the \"beautiful wall\" he was going to build along the border. Mexican officials have said they will not pay for it.\n\nAs construction begins, Border Patrol officials said it will be paid with taxpayer money.\n\nBorder Patrol officials in El Paso said the $73 million for the 20-mile section of Trump's border wall will come from funds from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“This is taxpayer funded,” Hull said. \"We have been given resources by Congress through the president’s support to construct this border wall.\"\n\nLast year, Congress passed an omnibus bill that included the allocation of $341.2 million to replace about 40 miles of existing pedestrian and vehicle border fencing \"using previously deployed and operationally effective designs, such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety; and to add gates to existing barriers.\"\n\nTrump signed the bill into law on May 5, 2017.\n\nBarnard Construction, of Montana, is in charge of carrying out the project, which is expected to be completed in May 2019.\n\nWhat is 'the wall' replacing?\n\nThe new wall now being erected in the area is replacing some metal posts, about 4-feet tall, that mostly served as a barrier for vehicles.\n\nManjarrez, who served as Border Patrol Chief in El Paso when construction of fencing along the El Paso-Juárez began in 2006, said that at the time, there was already a need to install some type of barrier in the Santa Teresa area to stop pedestrians from crossing illegally into the United States.\n\nThe area was known to be problematic with illegal immigration and drug smuggling, he said.\n\nThe 18-foot-tall fence in El Paso is made of corrugated metal in some areas and metal mesh in others.\n\nDuring Manjarrez's tenure as the El Paso sector chief, some of the chain link fence along the Paso del Norte Bridge to the New Mexico state line was replaced with a sturdier barrier to stop undocumented immigrants from crossing into the Unites States.\n\n\"After retiring and talking to the people, it's still an issue. Maybe the narcotics not as high, but certainly with illegal immigration,\" Manjarrez said.\n\nAt the time, he wanted to build the barrier beyond Santa Teresa, but the funding was not available, Manjarrez said.\n\n\"I’m glad they are doing it now,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol's budget has quadrupled in the last 20 years, according to official documents. It increased from $717.4 million in 1997 to $3.8 billion in 2017.\n\nAre apprehensions up or down?\n\nBorder Patrol officials in El Paso said they keep experiencing a high number of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants and drug smuggling.\n\nWhile the numbers fluctuate from year to year, apprehensions in the Border Patrol’s El Paso sector, which includes El Paso County and New Mexico, have decreased nearly 67 percent the past decade.\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, the sector reported 25,193 apprehensions compared to 75,454 in 2007, according to CBP reports.\n\nAileen B.

I tried to get them to reappropriate, to redirect that money,\" Biden told reporters. \"They didn’t. They wouldn’t. In the meantime, there’s nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated for. I can’t stop that.\"\n\nAsked whether he believes a border wall is effective, Biden responded, \"No,\" contradicting the statement from Mayorkas justifying the project.\n\nIn June, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced the construction of a 20-mile barrier with steel bollard panels. The funding will come from $190 million remaining from a pool of $1.38 billion Congress approved in 2019 for fencing in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nMexican president criticizes Biden's wall expansion\n\nApprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border are on the rise again after initially dropping sharply in May and June after the Biden administration launched a new policy requiring migrants heading to the U.S. border to first seek protection in Mexico.\n\nMexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador criticized the wall expansion as he prepared to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Mexico City. \"This authorization for the construction of the wall is a step backwards,\" he said, according to Reuters, adding that it \"doesn't solve the problem\" of migration. \"The causes must be addressed.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said DHS was required to use the funding for the border wall as Congress intended. \"We have to comply by law to get this done,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nThe move comes amid a surge of migrant crossings along the Texas border with Mexico, and as the Justice Department is battling Republican Gov. Greg Abbott over some of his initiatives aimed at deterring illegal immigration.\n\nDemocratic activist and South Texas attorney Ricardo de Anda, who battled the Trump administration's efforts to take private land for his signature border wall project, called the Biden administration's wall expansion \"a slap in the face.\"\n\nTrump needled Biden on his social media web site Truth Social over the reversal. ''Will Joe Biden apologize to me and America for taking so long to get moving, and allowing our country to be flooded with 15 million illegals immigrants?\" Trump wrote.\n\nDeportation flights of Venezuelans in US illegally to resume\n\nPushing back at criticism, Mayorkas issued a statement Thursday saying the language in the federal notice is being taken out of context. \"There is no new administration policy with respect to border walls,\" he said. \"From day one, this administration has made clear that a border wall is not the answer.\"\n\nIn another step aimed at surging migration, the Biden administration announced it would resume deportation flights of Venezuelans who entered the U.S. illegally. Officials said it follows an agreement with the Venezuelan government to accept Venezuelan nationals who fled their country.\n\nTwo senior Biden administration officials, who discussed the move on the condition of anonymity, said 66,000 Venezuelan migrants have entered the U.S. legally since the administration announced the new policy.\n\nA political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela over the past decade has pushed at least 7.3 million people to migrate, most of them to neighboring Latin American countries, but more recently to the U.S through Mexico. Many have made their journeys through the dangerous Darien Gap, a remote jungle between Colombia and Panama that is treacherous and often deadly.\n\nAbbott, whose office had no immediate comment on Mayorkas' border wall announcement, has been the nation's harshest critic of the Democratic administration's approach to matters of unlawful immigration and border security. The Texas state Legislature has allocated nearly $10 billion since Biden took office for Abbott's Operation Lone Star, which has sent thousands of National Guard troops from the Texas Department of Public Safety to South Texas.\n\nTexas has also laid miles of razor wire and has built barriers on private land with permission from owners as part of the operation.\n\nOn Thursday, the state met the Biden Justice Department before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans for a hearing over whether Texas will be allowed to keep its controversial 1,000-foot string of buoys in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass while the federal lawsuit over the matter plays out. The court's three-judge panel did not issue a ruling after hearing from Texas and federal lawyers.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, The Associated Press\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/07/border-towns-trump-wall-wont-work/82617732/", "title": "Border towns to Trump: The wall won't work", "text": "Story by Gustavo Solis | Photographs by Omar Ornelas\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nTECATE, Mexico – Javier Alvarado Castillo, a Mexican welder who makes $300 on a good week, admires the work that went into building a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“They did a good job,” said Castillo, noting the high quality materials and the difficulty of building on rugged terrain.\n\nThe U.S. did such a fine job that other welders have been known to steal poles from the fence and sell them for cash. Just one can go for $3,000 pesos or $180. For Tecate’s working class, that can add up to three months’ rent, Castillo said.\n\nTecate and its surrounding suburbs boast a population of 100,000. The city has world-class hotels, fine dining, museums, universities, a brewery that bears the town’s name, and factories from companies like Toyota and Rockwell Automation. Tecate is the only border crossing between Tijuana and Mexicali.\n\nThe city is more than 2,000 miles away from Washington D.C., where lawmakers craft immigration policy. While the U.S. presidential election campaign trail has been littered with talk of walls, the people living in this border town believe it is a lost cause.\n\nSupreme Court receives letters of support in immigration case\n\nEver since New York businessman Donald Trump announced his bid for presidency, his suggestion of a border wall has made headline news and attracted international attention. Currently there is less than 700 miles of a 10- to 18-foot fence along the nearly 2,000-mile border. Trump has proposed putting a 50-foot concrete wall along 1,000 miles of it.\n\nThe idea, along with his anti-establishment brand and habit of speaking off the cuff, have propelled Trump to the top of the delegate count of Republicans seeking the nomination.\n\nTo force the Mexican government to pay for it, Trump this week threatened to block undocumented immigrants from sending money back to Mexico. In 2015, Mexicans overseas – both documented and undocumented – sent $24 billion to Mexico, according to The World Bank.\n\nHow Donald Trump got fired by a California casino\n\nTwo of Mexico’s former presidents and the current president have dismissed the idea of a wall and how to pay for it as “stupid.”\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz wants to add a second fence parallel to existing fences. Both Republican candidates want to increase the size of the border patrol.\n\n“What is being said is in so many ways irrational and illogical,” said Roberto Arjona, the chief executive of a luxury hotel and spa in Tecate. “To quote a former homeland security deputy, when she was asked about the wall she said, ‘you could build a 50 foot wall and they will build a 51 foot ladder.’”\n\n“So to me that is the essence of these absurd comments. I think people that need to cross the border or want to cross the border they’ll find a way to cross the border.”\n\nArjona runs Rancho La Puerta, a luxury spa retreat that has been voted Travel + Leisure’s best destination spa from 2011 to 2015.\n\nThe spa was founded in the 1940s as a place to escape the stresses of urban life and relax in nature. Guests started coming to the Tecate ranch decades before yoga, meditation, and vegan diets were in vogue.\n\nRancho La Puerta’s 3,000-acre grounds have pools, gardens, hiking paths, a spa and organic farm. Guests are asked to leave their cell phones inside their rooms when they arrive, encouraged to have meals with strangers, and refrain from eating meat and chicken during their stay.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the hotel’s guests are American. Running a business so close to the border presents unique challenges.\n\n“It’s complex to say the least,” Arjona said. “We’ve been around for 75 years. We sort of know how it works and every time there is a new regulation, we are quick to adapt to it and to ensure that our guests are not going to have to suffer through all the bureaucracy that’s involved with that process.”\n\nStaff here work to calm visitors’ reservations about travelling to the border. During the height of drug-related violence along the Mexican side of the border, the entire country saw a drop in tourism.\n\nTo put guests at ease, the hotel picks them up at the San Diego airport and basically holds their hand until they are in the resort.\n\nHow Riverside County became America's drug pipeline\n\nThe resort is a bubble within Tecate and is a sign of what Mexico has to offer to the United States. While politicians and presidential hopefuls like to leverage a tough stand of border security for votes, they don’t often know what it’s like to live along the border, Arjona said.\n\n“People in Washington D.C. and people in Mexico City do not get it,” he said. “If you cross the border and ask someone in San Diego about the relationship between Tijuana, Tecate, and San Diego, they’ll tell you that it’s important to the success of their businesses, it’s important to the success of their cultural system. And if you ask the same question in Tecate or Tijuana, they are going to tell you exactly the same.”\n\n“We have a strong dependency between these two sides of the border that has made us successful and any attempt to disrupt that from entities or people who are far away is not good. They need to take the time to understand the dynamics and then, based on that, perhaps make decisions to improve what we have already build.”\n\nAcross the border from Tecate in Mexico is California’s own Tecate.\n\nUnlike its Mexican neighbor, American Tecate does not boast spas, universities, or factories. The unincorporated community on the southeast edge of San Diego County has a gas station, a Payless Shoesource, money exchanges, and a post office.\n\nThe place is so small that locals from Mexican Tecate refer to it as Tecatito, or little Tecate. It is home to less than 200 people, according to the San Diego Association of Governments.\n\nThe Desert Sun: Immigration arrest moves gay wedding to detention center\n\n“It’s a quiet place,” said resident Ada Garcia, who runs one of the money exchanges.\n\nGarcia moved from Tecate to Tecatito about 20 years ago so that her son could go to school in the United States and learn English.\n\nThe move paid off. Her son will graduate from San Diego State University this spring, Garcia said.\n\nAfter living in Tecatito for so long, Garcia has no plans to move back to Mexico. She opened her small business right on the border, the money exchange that serves as a pit stop for international travelers.\n\nOn holiday weekends, people from Tecate flood Garcia’s shop to turn their pesos into dollars to spend on shopping trips to a nearby Walmart or stores closer to San Diego.\n\nGarcia’s clients aren’t exclusively Mexican.\n\n“A lot of Americans stop here to change currency before going to Mexico,” Garcia said. “A little while ago someone from Nebraska was going to La Paz and stopped here before crossing.”\n\nHearing politicians say they want to build a bigger wall and make it harder for people to cross the border doesn’t sit well with Allan Gomez, who was born in Orange County, moved to Tecate as a child and now works in Tecatito helping his mother run a store.\n\nGomez, 26, describes the two towns as “brothers” and believes closing off contact will hurt American and Mexican citizens alike.\n\n“It’s weird to hear of a bigger wall or if you’re Mexican you are not going to cross the border,” he said. “They are locking someone’s dream. It’s the Mexican dream. The people who live in Mexico, their dream is to work in the U.S.”\n\nLike many residents of Tecate, Castillo, the 40-year-old welder, moved to town with hopes of eventually moving to the United States. When that didn’t pan out, he decided to stay.\n\n“A lot of people trying to go to the other side, they stay here to live,” Castillo said. “They try once or twice, don’t make it, find a job here and realize it’s better here than the other side, so they stay.”\n\nCastillo has become a sort of unofficial tourist guide. He and his brother rent a house to American visitors through Airbnb for less than $30 a night. Whenever guests want to explore the city, Castillo drives them around in a green Expedition.\n\nHe had not heard Trump’s comments about building a wall to keep “criminals” and “rapists” out of the United States. Immigration is not something Castillo thinks of on a daily basis because he now has no plans to move north.\n\nAnd while the wall doesn’t affect him on a daily basis, it does have a psychological impact, Castillo said.\n\n“What necessity do they have to put a concrete wall 10 meters up,” Castillo said. “We are not animals. Are they trying to protect themselves from lions?”\n\n“We don’t live in a time where cities need to be walled off because of invaders. We live in a time where there are laws and they protect countries from one another.”\n\nReporter Gustavo Solis can be reached at 760 778 4443 or by email at gustavo.solis@desertsun.com and twitter @journogoose.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2025/05/07/rides-with-border-patrol-show-how-quiet-the-arizona-border-is-now/83334228007/", "title": "Arizona border, once the busiest in the nation for illegal immigration ...", "text": "YUMA — Brent Smart buckled into the cockpit of an A-Star four-seater helicopter, pulled a green pilot's helmet over his head and prepared for takeoff.\n\nA former U.S. Army Black Hawk pilot, Smart has flown helicopters for the Yuma branch of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations for 16 years.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2014/07/10/immigrant-children-border-kids-pipeline/12410517/", "title": "Pipeline of children: A border crisis", "text": "Daniel Gonzalez and Bob Ortega\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThe pipeline bringing a flood of Central American migrants to the United States, including thousands of unaccompanied children, begins in villages like Quebrada Maria, near the Caribbean coast of Honduras.\n\nThat's where dimple-faced, 14-year-old Brayan Duban Soler Redondo lived in daily fear of being beaten up or killed by members of gangs like Mara Salvatrucha, also called MS-13, and Calle 18.\n\nGangs such as these terrorize neighborhoods throughout Central America. Over three days in May, gang members in another Honduran city, San Pedro Sula, murdered five children ages 5 to 13.\n\n\"They cut their bodies into quarters as a warning to others because the children didn't want to distribute drugs in their neighborhood,\" said Father German Calix, director of Caritas Honduras, a Catholic relief agency.\n\nSlayings like these were why Brayan was desperate to leave. He imagines himself working in an office in the United States someday, \"wearing fancy clothes\" and sending money back to his family.\n\nBut his charming smile offered little protection in his village, where gangs kill over the smallest of things, he said, even for trying to go to school or wearing the wrong clothes.\n\nHe had no idea how he would escape that world until, the week before Easter, he heard news he thought could save his life.\n\nTwo brothers from the same village had set off a month earlier for the United States. Their mother had received a call. The boys, teenagers like Brayan, had made it. Word spread through the village fast. The boys told their mother that, after turning themselves in to \"la migra,\" the Border Patrol, they had been detained briefly and then released to relatives in the United States.\n\nBrayan saw a way out.\n\nThere was one big problem. Migrants often pay smugglers thousands of dollars to guide them to the United States. Brayan didn't have any money. He is the youngest of eight children. His parents are coffee pickers. And, unlike many migrants, he didn't know any relatives working in the U.S. to send him money for the trip.\n\nBut that didn't deter him. After hearing the story about the two boys, Brayan decided to leave his family behind and strike out the very next day on a 1,400-mile journey to the U.S. To earn money, he killed a rabbit and sold it for the equivalent of $9.50, which he carried in his pocket the day he left.\n\nSo in mid-April, Brayan entered the pipeline, which has grown increasingly crowded with children looking for an escape route out of their violent homelands. Kids such as Brayan and 16-year-old Levi Manases Miranda Peña from El Salvador and 16-year-old Jairo Garniga from Guatemala.\n\nThe pipeline carrying migrant kids and families to the United States ends at the Rio Grande, where the surge of thousands of women and children from Central America has overwhelmed the Border Patrol in southern Texas.\n\nIn the past eight months, about 57,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended in the U.S., already 18,000 more than fiscal 2013. With four months still remaining, experts predict the number could soar to 90,000 this year.\n\nMore than 70 percent are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, three Central American countries plagued by poverty and crime. All three rank among the top five countries with the highest murder rates in the world.\n\nThousands more from these countries have fled to neighboring countries, including Mexico, Costa Rica and Nicaragua.\n\nThe escalation of fleeing migrants has created a humanitarian crisis that has rippled across the U.S. Thousands of migrant children caught crossing the border end up crowded into detention centers and military bases in Arizona, Oklahoma and California until they can be moved to shelters, reunited with relatives in the U.S. or flown back to their home countries.\n\nA 2008 law requires the United States to provide full immigration hearings to any unaccompanied children who reach the U.S. from countries other than Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe same law requires unaccompanied migrant children to be placed in \"the least restricted setting possible\" as they await the outcome of their hearings.\n\nAs a result, many are released to relatives instead of being held in shelters until their immigration hearings.\n\nThe surge of migrants began sometime in 2011 but was barely noticed outside southern Texas until it became a gusher in recent months. It overwhelmed the Border Patrol system in southern Texas, which was set up to care for only about 5,000 unaccompanied minors per year, nothing like the numbers that are crossing the border now.\n\nMany young people, like Brayan, said they heard stories of others who made the arduous trip to the U.S. and were reunited with mothers and fathers, brothers, sisters or cousins, aunts and uncles.\n\nOthers who made the trip told The Arizona Republic they had heard or read reports in the Central American media or on the Internet that they could get \"permisos\" to live in the U.S. if they made it to the border. But when The Republic was in Central America, news media discouraged going to the United States.\n\nSmugglers also market their services, telling parents that children are their ticket to stay in the U.S.\n\nPoverty prompts some, like 16-year-old Juan David Chavez, to make the journey.\n\nJuan was among 114 Salvadorans — 72 of them minors — who arrived back in San Salvador one day in mid-June on three buses of deportees after being caught in Mexico.\n\n\"I left for economic reasons,\" Juan said. Jobs are hard to come by, he said, and pay far too little. \"I'm the oldest son, and I wanted to help my family,\" he said.\n\nJuan said he will try again to reach the U.S.\n\nBut the chance to reunite with relatives in the U.S. and the fear of gangs and violence appear to be by far the major factors motivating so many young people to take the risks involved to reach the U.S. Such risks include being robbed, beaten, held for ransom or killed while traveling through Central America and the length of Mexico.\n\nThe gangs reach into almost every corner of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nOne day in May, seven gang members boarded a public bus in San Salvador, El Salvador's capital. They were looking for two members of a rival gang. But they fired indiscriminately at passengers, killing six people and wounding a score of others, including a 2-year-old. On that day alone, 31 people were murdered in San Salvador. The city averaged more than 12 murders a day in June, according to federal police.\n\n\"The gangs are in schools, neighborhoods. They're everywhere,\" said Alison Ramirez, who works on a U.S.-funded, violence-prevention project in El Salvador and frequently visits Honduras and Guatemala. \"Even if the kids don't want to be a part of it, they get caught up in the crossfire, extorted, threatened.\"\n\nThe pipeline begins in the neighborhoods of major cities, like the leafy-green and crumbling Zacamil section of San Salvador. The rival gangs MS-13 and Calle 18 lay claim here.\n\nMembers spray-paint the letters and numbers of their gangs on telephone poles, apartment buildings and the walls of concrete-block homes abandoned by families who have fled.\n\nOn street corners, young men and boys watch who comes and goes. One shouts curses and flings rocks at a passing car when he spots a photographer's lens peeking out a window.\n\nIn contrast, vivid, cheerful murals of women and children cover the outside walls of the community center known as Fe y Alegria — Faith and Joy.\n\nBehind the walls topped with razor wire, children play in a concrete courtyard. A grassy football field awaits just past a padlocked iron fence. But the children don't play there anymore. Last year, a gang member climbed over a wall and shot to death a student and wounded a teacher during a soccer game.\n\nIn early June, gang members fired four shots at an older student on the street just outside the front gates, she said. The boy scrambled to safety. He has not been back since, Mena added.\n\n\"It's changed a lot in the last four years,\" said Federico Pliotez, who teaches woodworking. \"Many families have no source of income, no work. They eat one meal a day.\"\n\nThe gangs prey on vulnerable families, recruiting children as young as 10 to deliver drugs and to be their eyes and ears on the street. \"You can be killed for going to school if they tell you not to,\" Pliotez said.\n\nThe San Ramon neighborhood, at the foot of the San Salvador volcano, is another area infested by the MS-13 and Calle 18 gangs.\n\n\"They're a plague,\" said Kevin Briseño, 18, who agreed to meet reporters at a Catholic-run children's center.\n\n\"I was four months from graduating from high school, and I had to leave the school because they threatened me,\" he said. \"I couldn't go out of the house, I couldn't meet with friends. It was too dangerous.\"\n\nIt took more than a year before Briseño felt safe enough to go out into the community again.\n\nHe lives in a single, ill-lit room with his father, off a narrow courtyard they share with three other families, along with a common bathroom and large sink. Anyone arriving or leaving carefully locks the outer door, made of thick iron bars.\n\nBriseño and his friend, Omar Barrera, 19, both spoke matter-of-factly about why it may be a death sentence for those who try to leave but are caught and sent back.\n\nOne friend fled a year and a half ago after he was threatened and gang members murdered his father, a policeman. Their friend was trying to reach his mother in Maryland, but he was stopped in Mexico and returned to San Salvador.\n\n\"He was murdered the week after he got back,\" Barrera said, shaking his head.\n\nOne mother tried desperately to help her three daughters escape the gangs in San Salvador, taking them on the journey herself.\n\n\"I don't want to go to the United States,\" she said. \"I don't speak English. I don't think we'll be welcome there.\" But she said she saw no alternative but to flee north.\n\nThe woman huddled with her daughters, 10, 16 and 19, on plastic seats at the Salvadoran government's crowded processing center for returned deportees in San Salvador. They had been caught in Mexico and sent back.\n\nTwice a week, the buses bring children there. Some are accompanied by their mothers; others, mostly teens, travel alone. No unaccompanied children younger than 12 are sent by bus, said Ana Solorzano, chief of the department of migrant needs at the center.\n\nThe mother begged that none of her family be named or photographed. As she explained why, she gripped her hands so fiercely her knuckles turned white.\n\nA few months ago, some members of the Calle 18 gang went to their house in San Salvador's Soyapango neighborhood looking for the girls. They ordered the mother to turn over the two oldest daughters to be the \"girlfriends\" of gang members.\n\nThat night, the mother fled with her daughters to another part of the city. The gang soon found them. They ran again, to a countryside village. But, like its main rival, MS-13, the Calle 18 gang has tentacles throughout the region. Again, the gang caught up with them.\n\n\"The authorities here did nothing to protect us,\" the mother said. \"Nothing.\"\n\nSo, they fled north into the pipeline to the United States.\n\n\"We had to go; I want to save my daughters' lives,\" the mother said.\n\nBut near Villahermosa, in southern Mexico, police stopped the bus they were on to check for documents. They were deported to El Salvador.\n\nWith almost no money left, the mother said, \"I don't know what we'll do. I don't know where we'll go. I have to save my daughters, but I don't know what to do.\"\n\nAll children who arrive in the United States illegally without a guardian are categorized as unaccompanied minors by Customs and Border Protection. But most children don't enter the pipeline alone, especially the younger ones.\n\nThere has been a steady stream of mothers and their children making the trip, like the ones caught in Texas and then dropped off by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at bus stations in Arizona because of a lack of detention space. Other children are accompanied at least part of the way by an older family member.\n\nBrayan, the 14-year-old from Honduras, traveled for a while with his 25-year-old brother, Grebil.\n\nSome families with at least modest means entrust their children to total strangers — the human smugglers called coyotes or polleros.\n\nLevi Manases Miranda Peña is a 16-year-old who left El Salvador on June 5. His friends call him Guero because of his fair skin and light-brown hair. He is from Tonacatepeque, a small city about 12 miles northeast of San Salvador.\n\nHis mother owns a small restaurant and store that sells clothing and stuffed tortillas called pupusas. She contracted with a smuggler to guide him all the way to Omaha, Neb., where his 17-year-old sister, Linda, lives. Once in Omaha, Levi hoped to continue school, something he couldn't do in El Salvador because of threats from gangs.\n\nHe said he didn't know how much his mother paid the smuggler. His sister confirmed that her mother borrowed $7,000 to pay a smuggler for her trip to the United States.\n\nLevi (pronounced LEH-vee) said his grandmother accompanied him on a 70-mile bus ride from Tonacatepeque to Ahuachapan, a city near the border of Guatemala. In his backpack, Levi carried two pairs of pants, three shirts, three pairs of socks. In his pocket, he carried $150, about what many factory workers in El Salvador earn in a month.\n\nFor good luck, he wore bracelets on both wrists given to him by his friends before he left El Salvador. One said \"Peace\" in English.\n\nHis mother arranged for Levi to meet the smuggler at the bus terminal in Ahuachapan. Levi had never met this person. His mother instructed him to look for a short man about 35 years old with straight black hair wearing a red shirt, gray pants and black shoes.\n\nLevi said he was scared, but in El Salvador, \"my life was already in danger.\"\n\n\"It's very dangerous in my country,\" he added. \"You can't even go to the store without being afraid of being robbed or killed.\"\n\nLevi rode in a bus with the smuggler to Guatemala City, where they were joined by five more teenagers from El Salvador heading to the United States. Along the route, the smugglers changed guides often, handing off the group of boys from one smuggler to the next in different cities.\n\nBrayan and his brother traveled by bus, too, out of Honduras, then through Guatemala, where the pipeline funneled them to the same place it carries many of the migrants from Central America headed for the United States — to the Suchiate River in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, on the border with Mexico.\n\nOne night in June, 16-year-old Jairo Garniga and six other boys — three from Honduras, and Jairo and three others from a coastal town in southern Guatemala — arrived in Tecun Uman long after dark. The doors of the migrants' shelter had shut for the night.\n\nThey lacked money for even the seediest of hotels in the crime-ridden border town. So instead, they stretched out for the night with several other migrants in front of the doorway of the Catholic church.\n\n\"It seemed safer than just sleeping in the street,\" Jairo said. They had risen just after dawn and waited beneath a towering lapacho tree until the Casa de Migrantes shelter opened. After a breakfast of rice, beans and bananas, Jairo and several other boys chatted while looking at a map posted on one wall, showing the dangers— river currents, deserts, bandits, kidnappers, towns hostile to migrants — along various routes north.\n\nThey couldn't afford to travel by bus, said Jose Hernandez, a 28-year-old neighbor guiding Jairo and another boy. So, they would hop a freight train known as \"La Bestia\" (the Beast) and take it up the Gulf coast and north to Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Riders sit atop freight cars, clinging for their lives to the metal roofs.\n\n\"The train is riskier, but you don't have to have so much money. So, we'll go by train,\" Hernandez said. \"They told us about the dangers. ... We'll go slowly.\"\n\nThey know — having met a man at this shelter who lost one foot this way — that gangs extort money from riders and throw those who don't pay off the moving train. The migrants hope to find work and earn money along the journey, which can take days or even months — if they stop and work along the way.\n\nJairo listened and grinned. His mother told him she was worried about the risks.\n\n\"My mother wouldn't have let me go alone. And I didn't want to,\" he said.\n\nThin and small for his age, Jairo didn't seem fazed by the two days he'd spent roughing it since leaving home. Like several other youths at the shelter, he was traveling with next to no money and only the clothes on his back. Unlike most, he had no family waiting for him in the United States.\n\n\"I'm not sure where I'm going in the U.S., or how we'll get there,\" he said. \"I hope God will help me along the way. I'll do whatever work there is. I just want to work.\"\n\nThe Casa de Migrantes is one of a string of shelters along the routes north through Guatemala and Mexico run by the Roman Catholic Scalabrini order.\n\nFather Ademar Barilli, who founded the shelter 19 years ago, has spoken with many of the 135,000 migrants who have passed through its doors over that time. He said he has seen a jump in minors staying at the shelter: up to 123 in May and June from 47 for those two months a year earlier.\n\nBarilli said the closing of many parts of the U.S. border and tougher enforcement have pushed migrants into the arms of the Mexican drug cartels.\n\nFour or five years ago, he said, many coyotes were respected figures in their own communities. They would accompany migrants all the way from Central America to the United States. But those coyotes have been pushed out of business, he said, as new border fences have forced migrants onto cartel smuggling routes.\n\n\"The drug traffickers saw another source of income,\" Barilli said. \"They organized themselves. And now, the coyotes have to have ties to the cartels, and these organized groups see the migrants as a milk cow.\"\n\nAfter a night in the shelter, Jairo, several other teens, and Jose Hernandez left the next morning to cross the Suchiate River.\n\nThe southern bank of the river, wider and faster than the Rio Grande, lies less than 100 yards from the shelter. Sturdy men on homemade rafts, crafted of wooden planks lashed to massive inner tubes taken from tractor-sized tires, called out for passengers.\n\nNot all the crossers are undocumented. Many townspeople cross into Mexico to shop, and rafts ferry black-market goods south. Passage costs the equivalent of just over a dollar. A wide bridge, the legal crossing point, can be seen less than half a mile downstream.\n\nAt small stands, vendors sell iced drinks, corn and snacks. Coyotes wait by the main road. A pedicab pulled up, and a mother and three children, all in neat, clean clothes, with large handbags, were met by a coyote.\n\nHe walked them to the river and settled them on a raft, then called on his cellphone to a counterpart on the other side. His associate waved in acknowledgment, and the raftsman started to pole upstream, to the point from which he would let the current carry them across.\n\nMeanwhile, Jairo and the others boarded another raft.\n\nJose Hernandez, the neighbor, asked the raftsman whether they needed to watch for Mexican authorities on the other side.\n\n\"No,\" the man said, \"not this early.\" It's about 7 a.m.\n\nWithin minutes, they were in Mexico, with the most treacherous section of the pipeline still ahead. Jairo waved at the reporters and turned north with his companions, hiking out of sight, the last contact The Republic had with him.\n\nBrayan, the 14-year-old from Honduras, and his brother decided not to pay the fee to cross the Suchiate. They swam to the other side at midnight.\n\nBut after a dispute over money, the two separated on the Mexican side of the river in Hidalgo, Chiapas state.\n\nSo, Brayan set out alone.\n\nHe begged for money and food. He asked people which buses to take. He slept on the street.\n\n\"Do you have a job for me? Because I need something to eat. I am from Honduras,\" he would say.\n\nOn the way to hop the freight train in Arriaga, a city in Chiapas state just north of the Guatemalan border, Brayan said he fell asleep near a railroad terminal in the city of Tonalá.\n\nA hard slap on the back startled him awake. Men in Mexican immigration uniforms asked him where he was from. After telling them he was from Honduras, Brayan said the men threatened to send him back to Honduras unless he paid them money. Brayan handed over all he had: 200 pesos and 70 lempira, or about $18.\n\nLevi said he and the other migrants from El Salvador had a similar experience with Mexican authorities after crossing the border from Guatemala by bus.\n\nIn Mexico, he said, men in federal police uniforms stopped their bus. The men climbed aboard and asked each passenger where he or she was from. Passengers from other countries were allowed to continue only if they handed over 400 pesos, about $30.\n\n\"If you don't give them the money, they don't let you go,\" Levi said.\n\nLevi and the other minors from El Salvador arrived in Reynosa before dawn on June 12. The city of 600,000 in Mexico is located on the border with Texas. For Levi and many other Central American migrants, Reynosa is the last stop on the pipeline before trying to cross the Rio Grande into the United States. A smuggler was waiting for them at the bus terminal in a minivan to drive the group to the Rio Grande so they could cross while it was still dark.\n\nBut they never made it. On the way to the river, Mexican federal police intercepted the van and arrested the coyote.\n\nLevi remembers looking out the window of the smuggler's van and seeing a \"mysterious\" white pickup race up. He saw the windows roll down and pistols pop out. The men in the pickup, apparently part of the smuggling organization, \"started firing bullets everywhere,\" he said.\n\nLevi and the other migrants threw themselves on the floor of the van until the shooting stopped. The federal police didn't fire back, he said. In the end, no one was hit.\n\n\"I felt an incredible fear, a terrible fear,\" Levi said.\n\nThe federal police turned Levi and the other boys over to Mexican immigration authorities. After they were processed, the boys were taken to Centro de Atencion a Menores Fronterizos, a government holding shelter in Reynosa for undocumented minors caught near the border.\n\nBrayan also ended up in a shelter near Reynosa.\n\nBrayan's luck seemed to change after the men who identified themselves as immigration officials took his money. He met a truck driver and his wife who were hauling mangoes, pineapples and other fruit from southern Mexico to the north. He called them Don Macario and Doña Maria.\n\nThe couple offered to give Brayan a lift in their tractor-trailer rig 1,000 miles from Tonalá, Chiapas, all the way to Reynosa. Along the way, they passed through several immigration checkpoints. Each time, the truck driver told the immigration officials that Brayan was their son. The couple let Brayan stay at their house in Reynosa for a month.\n\nBrayan had no money to pay smugglers to take him across the river, so the truck driver took Brayan to the Senda de Vida (Path of Life), a migrant shelter run by a Christian pastor in Reynosa. The shelter has three dormitories, one for women with children, one for men, and one for elderly men and people with disabilities. Brayan slept in the one for the elderly.\n\nFor Levi and Brayan, the end of the pipeline was now a mere 100 yards away, across the Rio Grande into the United States, where they had planned to turn themselves in to la migra.\n\nBut it might as well still have been 1,000 miles away.\n\nReynosa is one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico.\n\nFor more than four years, two rival drug-trafficking organizations, the Gulf cartel and their former enforcers, the Zetas, have waged pitched gunbattles in the streets with each other and with Mexican law-enforcement authorities.\n\nHundreds of people have been killed, and thousands have fled the city.\n\nGunbattles still happen regularly, though not as frequently as the past. Federal police patrol the streets in pickups mounted with machine guns.\n\nOn June 19, at Centro de Atencion a Menores Fronterizos, the government shelter in Reynosa, eight teenage boys sat cross-legged in the shade of a peach tree.\n\nAll were from either Honduras or El Salvador. One by one, they named cities and states in the United States. The names mean nothing to them. They have never been to the United States. They know nothing about these places. They are just the names of places given to them by relatives they were trying to reach in the U.S. before they were caught.\n\nOne has a mother in Virginia.\n\nAnother a brother in Miami.\n\nAnother a mother in Boston.\n\nAnother a brother in Atlanta.\n\nBut before they could cross the border, they were intercepted by immigration authorities, not in the U.S. but in Mexico.\n\nFor now, their journey through the pipeline to reach their U.S. destinations has been halted.\n\nThe teens spend their days waiting to be deported to their countries of origin. On this particular day, there were 15 minors from Central America being held at the shelter: 12 teenage boys and three teenage girls.\n\nThe boys are kept segregated from the girls. They are allowed to sit outside in the shelter's courtyard for an hour or two each day. The rest of the time they are locked up in cell-like dormitories with bars on the doors. They sleep on dirty mattresses thrown on the floor, with nothing to do except watch a small TV sitting on top of a dresser.\n\nAfter traveling more than 1,400 miles for days and sometimes weeks, they give the same answer about what they will do when they are sent back: Turn around and try again.\n\nAll except one.\n\nAt first, Levi thought he would try to come back to the U.S. once deported back to El Salvador. But after spending several days at the shelter, he wasn't so sure. Despite the dangers in his home country, he said, he wouldn't want to leave his mother alone again. And he wouldn't want to repeat the ordeal of being smuggled.\n\n\"I have been thinking a lot all these days that I have been here at the shelter,\" he said. \"I don't want to have to suffer through everything I have already suffered. I don't want to go through everything I have already gone through and what I am still going through.\"\n\nOn June 26, Levi was sent back to El Salvador. His sister, Linda in Omaha, said he is back home living with their mother. But he is afraid to go outside for fear he could be attacked by the gangs, she said.\n\nOver at the Senda de Vida shelter, Brayan remained in limbo as of July 11. The shelter sits on land on the edge of Reynosa overlooking the greenish waters of the Rio Grande. By climbing up a small hill in the back, Brayan can see the United States on the other side.\n\nSmugglers want 1,000 pesos, about $76, to ferry him across the river in a raft. But he was out of money, and he had no idea how he would come up with the smuggling fee.\n\nTrying to cross the cartel-controlled waters alone is too risky.\n\nSo, he waited, hoping that his pipeline dream hasn't ended.\n\nAt the end of the pipeline, on a Saturday in June in southern Texas, two young boys walked up a gravel road from the Rio Grande a mile to the south.They were among the hundreds of migrants from Central America streaming across the Rio Grande daily.\n\nOne boy appeared to be about 9 or 10, the other 12 or 13. The younger one carried a jacket thrown over his right shoulder. There were no adults in sight. Just two boys walking up a road by themselves in the middle of a vast wildlife refuge on the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nThis is an area where armor-plated gunboats operated by the Texas Highway Patrol cruise up and down the Rio Grande, keeping a lookout for drug traffickers and human smugglers.\n\nSmuggling trails snake down the banks on the Mexican side and come up on the Texas side of the river. Hiding in the brush or high up in houses on stilts, los mañosos — thugs — working for the criminal organizations that control these waters on the Mexican side keep watch for the Border Patrol.\n\nBut at this time of the morning, the wildlife refuge was quiet except for birds chirping and the wind rushing through the thick brush. Up above to the east, there was hardly any traffic on the Anzalduas International Bridge connecting McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico.\n\nThe boys looked down at the ground as they trekked up the road, glancing up occasionally to scan the horizon. When they reached the top of a levee where two gravel roads meet, they stopped and crouched on their haunches. They reached the spot where they had been told to wait.\n\nSoon, they saw a Border Patrol van in the distance racing toward them on top of one of the levees. An agent climbed out of the van and walked up to the boys, a radio clipped to his belt. Only the older boy stood up.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" the Border Patrol agent asked.\n\n\"Honduras,\" the older boy replied.\n\nThe agent opened one of the van's side doors, and the two boys climbed inside. They had made it to the United States and turned themselves in to the Border Patrol, the same way thousands of migrants from Central America have.\n\nThe pipeline worked for them.\n\nBut many questions remain.\n\nWhat will happen to the boys?\n\nWill they be reunited with their families in the U.S.?\n\nWill they be allowed to stay?\n\nWill they be sent home?\n\nAnd how many more are coming?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2016/11/13/donald-trump-made-promises-here-what-they-mean-arizona/93611294/", "title": "Donald Trump made campaign promises.

And given the divisiveness and bitter aftermath of the election, Trump may be lucky to get any sort of a honeymoon.\n\n\"You don't just push buttons and get things done automatically in the White House,\" said Ken Khachigian, who was chief speechwriter and senior White House adviser to President Ronald Reagan. \"It's just not realistic to think that all of those things can be done at once.

It's not going to be an easy ride.\"\n\nWhile many details of Trump's proposals are still unclear, The Arizona Republic examined several of his campaign promises and talked to experts about what they might mean for the state.\n\nBuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\n\"We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it.\"\n\nWhat it would require: Building a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border would be a massive, expensive and time-consuming public-works project.\n\nTrump rejects moderation, goes hard-line on immigration\n\nThe Mexico-financed wall is perhaps Trump's signature campaign promise, so it is unlikely that he could avoid political blowback by characterizing his repeated call for a landmark barrier as a metaphor.\n\nBut Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, a former U.S. House speaker, recently said Trump's demand that Mexico pay for the wall was \"a great campaign device\" that might not be practical in reality. And Mexico has steadfastly said it won't pay for it, and suggested it could damage the trade relationship between the two countries.\n\n\"Any construction project any more has to go through so many designs, environmental reviews and regulatory cobwebs that I don't know how you get anything done in 100 days,\" Khachigian said. \"Every president finds you can't just order things done. This is not building a new hotel, or a house, or anything else. He's got different states he's dealing with, and different review processes, but ... there are very high expectations. So I expect him to move forward with it.\"\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, another Trump supporter, suggested Trump could build the wall via executive order by \"re-programming money\" already appropriated for immigration and border-security purposes. He also noted that Congress already has authorized fencing that was never built.\n\nCan Donald Trump build a border wall with Mexico? He'd have to tackle this\n\nBut others said Trump probably would need additional funding from lawmakers for a project of such magnitude, although he likely will realize, if he hasn't already, that some parts of his promise are unrealistic.\n\n\"I think he's going to have to honor part of that commitment and then spin the parts that aren't just going to work,\" said Louis DeSipio, a professor of political science and Chicano/Latino studies at the University of California-Irvine. \"It wouldn't surprise me if he sends a bill up to Congress to get an expansion of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or an investment in new technologies. He can call that whatever he wants: an electronic wall, or a symbolic one.\"\n\nArizona impact: A wall that stretches along Arizona's border with Mexico likely would come with steep environmental and legal costs in addition to whatever disruptions construction brings to border communities and Arizona-Mexico cross-border commerce.\n\nBesides environmental concerns related to the building, there are water-rights treaties that Trump wouldn't be able to unilaterally abrogate. Some of the border land is privately owned, which could require legal action to acquire.\n\n\"They weren't even able to get all of the rights needed for what we have now, even after trying for a number of years in court,\" DeSipio said. \"You get the irony, sometimes, of actually having, because of where they can get the rights, some of the United States being on the other side of the wall.\"\n\nTrump victory stirs anxiety, animus along the U.S.-Mexico border\n\nAlong some remote parts of the border, though not so much in Arizona, infrastructure for access to the area would have to be built before wall construction crews could get there.\n\n\"Just building in the roads to get the cement and rebar into west Texas would cost billions of dollars,\" DeSipio said.\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nEnd President Barack Obama’s immigration actions\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\n“We will immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants.\"\n\nWhat it would require: In 2012, Obama used his executive authority to create a program to protect \"dreamers,\" young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, from being deported. In exchange for admitting they are in the country illegally and registering their personal information with the government, dreamers without serious criminal records can receive federal work permits, a Social Security number and a two-year reprieve from the threat of deportation. The program is known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\nIn 2014, Obama created a second program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, that offers the same deportation deferments and work permits to undocumented immigrants with children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The second program, however, was blocked by the courts and hasn’t been implemented.\n\nCourt's immigration vote produces tears, cheers in Arizona\n\nThe same way Obama created the programs, Trump could end the programs, said Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The question is whether he would allow dreamers to hold on to their work permits until they expire, revoke them immediately or set a blanket date for them to expire, Meissner said. It’s also possible Trump could direct immigration enforcement authorities to use the information dreamers provided to the government to track them down and deport them, Meissner said.\n\nImpact on Arizona: More than 1.2 million dreamers nationally, including about 50,000 in Arizona, have been approved for DACA, or had their initial two-year reprieve renewed for another two years. Canceling DACA would have a “huge impact” on the lives of dreamers, said Daniel Rodriguez, a Phoenix immigration lawyer who himself was once a dreamer.\n\nWithout a work permit, dreamers would no longer be able to work legally and would once again live in fear of being deported, even though the United States is the only country they have ever known, Rodriguez said. Without a work permit, they would no longer be eligible for a driver’s license in Arizona or to pay in-state tuition at community colleges or at the state’s three public universities, he said.\n\n“It means everybody who has worked so hard for the last four years, everything they build they are going to lose all that. They are going to be back at square one,” Rodriguez said.\n\nHow we got here: The many attempts to reform immigration, secure the border\n\nRodriguez, whose mother brought him to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 7, received DACA in 2013. He renewed it in 2015. With his work permit, Rodriguez was able to get a job working as a paralegal while attending law school at Arizona State University. In 2015, he was able to become a legal permanent resident after marrying a U.S. citizen. As an immigration lawyer, he now leads clinics helping dreamers fill out the paperwork to apply for DACA. But since Trump was elected president, Rodriguez has begun advising dreamers that Trump could kill the program and those who have applied now face a higher risk that the information given to the government could be used to deport them.\n\n— Daniel González​\n\nCreate a deportation force\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\nTrump early on promised to create a deportation force to go after the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. At his immigration speech in Phoenix on Aug. 31, Trump said he would begin by deporting the more than 2 million “criminal aliens” inside the country. \"Day One, my first hour in office, those people are gone. And you can call it deported if you want,” Trump said.\n\nWhat it would require: The U.S. already has an agency responsible for arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants and legal immigrants who commit serious crimes rendering them deportable: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Under Obama’s administration, ICE deportation hit record levels, peaking at nearly 410,000 in fiscal year 2012. Deportations by ICE have since fallen to about 235,000 in fiscal 2013, according to the most recent data released by ICE.\n\nIn 2014, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson directed ICE to place the highest priority on removing immigrants who pose threats to national security, border security and public safety, including immigrants engaged in terrorist activity, those caught trying to enter the country illegally, and those convicted of felonies and aggravated felonies. He also directed ICE to use prosecutorial discretion when deciding whether to release immigrants deemed not an enforcement priority based on the type of criminal offense conviction, amount of time since the offense occurred, how long they had lived in the U.S., military service and other factors. Critics say the use of prosecutorial discretion has led to a decrease in deportations. In response to pressure from immigrant advocates and some local law-enforcement officials, Obama has curtailed the use of controversial programs that enlisted the help of local police to identify undocumented immigrants, known as 287(g) and Secure Communities.\n\nArizona immigrants on Donald Trump's election: 'Scared they're going to ... take us away'\n\nICE currently has the resources to ramp up deportations to about 400,000 a year, said Meissner, the commissioner of the INS under President Bill Clinton. To increase deportations beyond that number, Trump probably would have to ask Congress for additional resources, she said.\n\nArizona impact: There is broad public support, even among immigrant advocates, for deporting dangerous criminals. But to increase deportations, Trump could direct ICE to go after immigrants arrested on suspicion of crimes, not just convicted criminals, said Meissner. To cast a wider net, he could also revive the 287(g) and Secure Communities programs, which often resulted in people stopped for minor traffic violations being turned over to ICE and deported. There is concern, however, that efforts to drive up deportations could lead to more unlawful profiling of Latinos. For example, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio used the 287(g) program to allow his deputies to double as immigration-enforcement officers while conducting his controversial saturation patrols in heavily Latino neighborhoods and worksite raids. A federal judge eventually found Arpaio’s deputies had discriminated against Latinos by targeting Hispanics as a pretext to find undocumented immigrants.\n\n— Daniel González\n\nEnd Common Core\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\n\"Common Core is a total disaster. We can't let it continue.\"\n\nWhat it would require: States can use the academic standards if they choose to but are not required to do so. The law says states must adopt “challenging state academic standards,\" but they don't have to be Common Core based. Common Core is paid for by the states and gets no federal funding. However, Trump conceivably could seek some sort of ban on the use of Common Core, which is distrusted by many \"tea party\"-style conservatives.\n\n\"The adoption of Common Core is state-level,\" said John J. \"Jack\" Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Southern California. \"There are certain Education Department regulations that encourage it, but ultimately the curricular choice is up to the state. It's not even clear that Trump understands that.\"\n\nArizona AzMERIT scores: More questions than answers\n\nArizona impact: Diane Douglas, Arizona's superintendent of public instruction, was ahead of Trump in going after Common Core. The Arizona Board of Education actually voted in October 2015 to dump Common Core, also known as Arizona’s College and Career Ready Standards, which the state adopted in 2010. The vote was part of Douglas’ effort to replace it with the board's own standards. However, the move was symbolic as the standards essentially remain in place.\n\n\"It is state-based, so this notion of Arizona being beholden to it has always been kind of silly,\" said Jaime Molera, a Republican former state superintendent of public instruction. \"Let's say they outlawed Common Core at the federal level. OK, great. But then the state could say whatever the Common Core standards were, we're going to adopt them. They can do that now, so it doesn't mean anything.\"\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nRenegotiate and possibly rewrite international trade pacts\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\nTrade has been a central theme of Trump's campaign. In one September sound bite that garnered publicity, he vowed to charge a 35 percent tax on Ford vehicles imported from Mexico. But in a June campaign stop in Pennsylvania, Trump laid out his trade views more comprehensively. \"We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements and cheat in every way imaginable,\" he said. \"Trillions of dollars and millions of jobs flowed overseas as a result.\" In that speech, Trump called NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, \"the worst trade deal in history,\" and he slammed China's entry into the World Trade Organization as \"the greatest job theft in the history of our country.\" The Obama-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which hasn't yet been ratified and now probably won't be, would spell the \"death blow for American manufacturing,\" he said. Among specific steps, Trump said he would seek out better trade pacts with tougher negotiators, favoring bilateral agreements over multinational deals overseen by international commissions. He promised to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from it, and to instruct his administration to watch for trade violators. He said he would label China a currency manipulator and slap tariffs and taxes on Chinese imports. While the United States trades with nearly every nation on Earth, Trump has centered his criticism on China and Mexico, both of which run big trade surpluses with the U.S. China's trade balance with us is by far the largest, amounting to $258 billion this year through September — nearly half the $546 billion gap overall, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nWhat it would require: U.S. presidents enjoy broad powers to restrict commerce. A lot of it stems from the World War I-era Trading With the Enemy Act. That legislation gives the executive branch authority to \"stop all forms of commerce,\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics, in a recent commentary.\n\nThose powers include stopping imports and exports, suspending the issuance of patents to non-U.S. entities and seizing foreign-owned factories here and foreign cash held in U.S. banks. A later update of that legislation occurred in 1977. Presidents have the ability to declare national emergencies, putting some of these powers into play against foreign foes, and the courts rarely challenge them, said Hufbauer.\n\nThen there are treaties themselves, including the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a tariff-busting agreement negotiated by the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia and various other nations in Asia and Latin America, though not China. That pact, heralded by Obama, already faced a tough challenge gaining approval in Congress, even if Hillary Clinton had been elected. Now it's dead in the water without Trump's support.\n\nHow Arizonans' wallets might be affected by Donald Trump's presidential victory\n\nA bigger question will center on the fate of NAFTA, which links the U.S. with Mexico and Canada. Canada is a much larger trading partner with the U.S., second only to China, but Canada and the U.S. buy nearly the same value of goods from each other — a bit more than $200 billion through the first eight months of the year, alleviating protectionist criticism of our northern neighbor.\n\nMexico, with a $47 billion trade surplus with the U.S. so far this year, is a different story and has felt the wrath of Trump's criticism, especially regarding Mexican-built autos shipped to this country. Ironically, the recent slump of the Mexican peso stemming from Trump's election victory could make Mexican imports even cheaper.\n\nArizona impact: The expansion of global trade in recent decades has been one of the most dominant of all economic trends. Trade by definition is mutually beneficial — buyers and sellers wouldn't come together if it wasn't — but there have been unpleasant side effects including the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Trump tapped into this angst, especially as it devastated factory towns across the Midwest.\n\nStill, the prospect of heightened trade friction is frightening and harkens to the 1930s, when governments around the world raised tariffs, erected import quotas and curtailed currency flows to restrict spending on foreign goods. \"The Great Depression was marked by a severe outbreak of protectionist trade policies,\" noted Barry Eichengreen and Douglas Irwin in a study.\n\nThat's not necessarily in our future. Trump's threats could be sufficient to bring major trading partners to the table to renegotiate deals more favorable to the U.S. Yet to the extent trade tensions rise, Arizona would be on the front lines, especially if the tensions were directed against China or Mexico. The Mexican connection is obvious, given that no foreign nation buys more Arizona goods than Mexico. China ranks third, behind Canada, in that regard.\n\nTaxes, trade, more: Here's the economy according to President-elect Trump\n\nArizona sent $22.6 billion worth of goods to foreign countries last year, up from $21.1 billion in 2014, with the increase mainly attributable to manufactured products, according to a study by the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis. Arizona ranked 19th among the states in 2015 exports, climbing two spots from 2014. Exports at nearly 7,500 Arizona companies supported more than 93,000 statewide jobs in 2014, according to a Commerce Department report.\n\nArizona also is a major shipment route for trade. For example, a substantial amount of the fruits and vegetables consumed by Americans comes through Nogales for dispersion around the U.S. Another example: The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the dominant destinations for Chinese and Japanese container imports, with many of those goods sent by truck or train across Arizona to states further east.\n\nArizonans and U.S. consumers in general would face higher prices on a swath of imports — from Japanese cars and Chinese televisions to Mexican produce and Bangladeshi shirts — if trade was constricted or higher tariffs imposed.\n\n— Russ Wiles\n\nA temporary ban on Muslims coming to the United States\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2015, Trump’s campaign posted a press release saying, “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.”\n\nWhat it would require: As president, Trump would have the authority through the executive branch of the government to issue instructions to U.S. consulates all over the world and immigration officials at ports of entry to stop allowing Muslims into the U.S., said Meissner, the former INS commissioner. She is now director of immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe temporary ban could apply to all Muslims, including those applying for green cards to live in the U.S. permanently, as well as Muslims wanting to come to the U.S. to study, visit, or work on non-immigrant visas.\n\nConsular officials and immigration authorities would be responsible for asking every person applying for a visa to come to the U.S. if they were Muslim.\n\nSuch a ban would be difficult to carry out, however, Meissner said. Applicants could lie. And conducting religious background checks on every person applying for a visa would be costly and onerous, she said.\n\nA Syrian family fleeing war finds refuge in Phoenix\n\nIt’s unclear if Trump will follow through with a temporary Muslim ban. There is no mention of it in his 100-day plan. The plan does call for suspending immigration from “terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.” His plan also calls for applying “extreme vetting” to all people coming into the U.S.\n\nTrump is responding to concerns that violent extremists could enter the U.S. by pretending to be refugees fleeing ISIS and the civil war in Syria. Refugees already go through a lengthy vetting process that can take up to two years. FBI Director James Comey, however, has acknowledged there are challenges verifying information provided by refugees who are fleeing the war in Syria.\n\nImpact on Arizona: Some Muslims fear a ban on Muslims coming to the U.S. would send a message that all Muslims are potential terrorists, leading to a rise in hate crimes here, said Imraan Siddiqi, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Arizona, a civil-rights group. A Muslim ban would also make it difficult for Muslims who are legal permanent residents or U.S. citizens to apply for visas for relatives who would like to visit or move to the U.S., he said.\n\nWhere do Arizona refugees come from?\n\nThere are about 50,000 Muslims in Arizona, Siddiqi said. Many Muslims are doctors or came to the U.S. to work for Intel, Honeywell and other high-tech firms in Arizona, he said. Arizona also is known as a major state for refugee resettlement. In fiscal year 2016, which ended Sept. 30, the U.S. admitted 38,900 Muslims refugees, according to the Pew Research Center. Muslim refugees made up nearly half of the 85,000 refugees admitted that year.\n\nMuslim refugees from Syria and Somalia made up more than half of all the Muslim refugees who came to the U.S. in fiscal 2016. Arizona received 4,110 refugees in fiscal 2016, many of them from Muslim countries including 833 from Syria, 682 from Somalia, 388 from Iraq and 133 from Eritrea, according to the State Department.\n\n— Daniel González​\n\nEnsure veterans get the care they need\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\n“The V.A., it’s a disaster. ... We have to change that whole system. It starts with management. We have to have a whole different set of protocols.”\n\nWhat it would require: The Department of Veterans Affairs is part of the executive branch, beneath the president, who has authority to choose its leadership, establish department priorities and set policies. Trump’s No. 1 priority will be the appointment of a secretary “whose sole purpose is to serve veterans.”\n\nRep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., is considered a leading candidate to become Trump’s VA secretary. Miller, as chair of the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs, has been for years the VA’s most fierce and tenacious critic. Miller knows the department well but could face powerful resistance from a resentful, entrenched bureaucracy.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT: 7 VA hospitals, one mystery: What's happening?\n\nTrump’s platform on veterans affairs contains 10 key points, mostly vowing to impose discipline and control over a monolithic federal agency. Politicians have huffed and puffed about VA accountability, but political rhetoric struggles in the face of legal and bureaucratic intransigence.\n\nTrump also has endorsed basic tenants of the Choice Program, which allows veterans to get subsidized, private health care if the VA cannot render timely treatment. His campaign position does not say, however, who will be eligible or how the program is to be funded.\n\nPhoenix VA health-care system scandal: An Arizona Republic investigation - azcentral.com\n\nArizona impact: Phoenix’s VA hospital already is a top priority — and undergoing major changes — because it has been ground zero in the national crisis over veterans care. For two years the Department of Veterans Affairs has poured money, manpower and reform efforts into Arizona with some success, but also with nagging setbacks amid a revolving door of leadership.\n\nWill Trump be able to accelerate or improve progress? That’s an open question for roughly 80,000 enrolled veterans. The answer depends, at least in part, on specifics that have not been spelled out, and on the effectiveness of a new secretary in overhauling the VA system.\n\n— Dennis Wagner\n\nUndo climate change regulations\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\nClimate change is a hoax. “Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement,” he said on his campaign website, “and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.”\n\nWhat it would require: A new president can’t simply cancel an international agreement that more than 100 countries entered to limit carbon emissions and temperature increases. He can effectively halt or gut U.S. efforts to meet its commitments, though, starting with the Obama administration’s already embattled Clean Power Plan restricting coal power.\n\nArizona impact: The U.S. is responsible for about a fifth of the emissions reductions envisioned by the Paris deal, so abandoning the effort would seriously undermine the global effort to hold warming at 2 degrees Celsius this century.\n\nArizona is one of the nation’s hottest and driest states and is already showing signs of climate stress.\n\nBeyond the drought: How does Arizona grow from here?\n\nThe Colorado River reservoirs, drinking water source for millions of Arizonans, have been shrunken by drought since the turn of the century. Scientists expect increasing heat to exacerbate this problem. The most recent National Climate Assessment, written in part by University of Arizona researchers, projected a 9 percent erosion of Colorado River flows entering the state by 2050, a span in which the region depending on the river is expected to grow by millions of people.\n\nA hotter climate is also contributing to massive wildfires. The same climate assessment found that the number of forested acres burning across the Southwest has more than tripled since the 1970s, and it projected another 380 percent increase with the next 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of warming.\n\n— Brandon Loomis\n\nRepublic reporters Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Ricardo Cano contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/13"}]}

Many of them were camped out in airport lounges, uncertain whether when and if flights would resume or whether Air Canada would make tentative arrangements.\n\n\"We are kind of left to figure it out for ourselves and fend for ourselves with no recourse or options provided by Air Canada at this time,\" said Elizabeth Fourney of Vancouver.\n\nNeed a break?

In anticipation, the airline canceled most of its 700 daily flights, forcing more than 100,000 travelers to scramble for alternatives.\n\nWithin hours of the strike declaration, the Canada Industrial Relations Board complied with a request by Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu and ordered binding arbitration. The Canada Labor Code gives the government the power to ask the CIRB to impose such an order in the interest of protecting the economy.\n\nAirline news: Canadian government moves to end Air Canada strike\n\nGovernment acts\n\nAir Canada had encouraged the government to act, while CUPE had pushed for a negotiated solution, saying binding arbitration would take pressure off the airline.\n\n\"The federal government has entrusted a board to administer these rules in the Canadian Labor Code, and if you defy them, you are transgressing and essentially violating the law,\" said Rafael Gomez, a professor of employment relations at the University of Toronto.\n\nIt is exceedingly rare for a union to defy a back-to-work order. In 1978, Canadian postal workers refused to comply with back-to-work legislation, resulting in fines and the jailing of their union leader for contempt of Parliament.\n\nThe government's best option is to go to court to enforce the order and secure a contempt order if the union refuses to back down, said Michael Lynk, professor emeritus at Western University's Faculty of Law in London, Ontario.\n\n\"The union leadership could face the same consequences as what happened 45 years ago. It could be fines against the union ... potential of jail time for the union leaders,\" he said.\n\nThe minority Liberal government could also try to pass back-to-work legislation, but that would require the support of political rivals and approval in both houses of parliament, which is on break until Sept. 15.\n\n\"Like many Canadians, the minister is monitoring this situation closely,\" Jennifer Kozelj, Hajdu's press secretary, said in a statement.\n\n\"The Canada Industrial Relations Board (the Board) is an independent tribunal. Please refer to them regarding your question,\" she added in response to questions about the union's defiance of the order and about the refusal of the board's leader, a former Air Canada counsel, to recuse herself from the decision.\n\nThe CIRB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe government, under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, intervened last year to head off rail and dock strikes that threatened to cripple the economy. Lynk said the CUPE was also likely to file a legal challenge to the order.\n\nThe government's use of its extraordinary power to force binding arbitration through CIRB, called Section 107, is relatively new. Unions have criticized the provision, saying such interference favors employers and denies their right to collective bargaining.\n\nThe most contentious issue has been the union's demand for compensation for time spent on the ground between flights and when helping passengers board.

Rank-and-file members of four unions have rejected the agreement and are prepared to go on a railroad strike on December 9 without either a new labor agreement or congressional action.\n\nBiden, a longtime labor ally, along with Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and other administration officials helped unions and management reach a tentative deal averting a freight railroad strike in September.\n\nA railroad strike could clog supply chains and lead to a spike in prices on necessities such as gasoline and food – dampening an economy that many fear is heading toward a recession. It could also cost could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone, according to an analysis from the Anderson Economic Group.\n\nMichael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, one of the four unions whose members voted no on the deal, said Tuesday that Biden has let the union and its members down.\n\n“We’re trying to address an issue here of sick time. It’s very important,” Michael Baldwin, the president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on “Newsroom.” “This action prevents us from reaching the end of our process. It takes away the strength and the abilities that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads into a situation to actually do the right thing.”\n\nPelosi said Tuesday the chamber could vote as soon as Wednesday on legislation to adopt the September tentative agreement and avert a possible rail strike. Once passed, Senate action could occur later this week or next, several Senate sources have told CNN. The Senate is expected to have the votes to break a filibuster on the bill to avert a potential railway strike, the Senate sources also said. There are likely to be at least 10 Republicans who will vote with most Senate Democrats to overcome a 60-vote threshold.\n\nAfter the meeting, McConnell expressed openness to backing the legislation, and told reporters “We’re gonna need to pass a bill.”\n\nBut any one senator can slow the process down as timing agreements to move along legislation typically require unanimous consent from all 100 members of the chamber. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, criticized the proposed deal to avert a rail strike on Tuesday. Sanders reiterated his threat to slow down rail measure unless he gets sick-leave amendment vote in a tweet Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“At a time of record profits in the rail industry, it’s unacceptable that rail workers have ZERO guaranteed paid sick days. It’s my intention to block consideration of the rail legislation until a roll call vote occurs on guaranteeing 7 paid sick days to rail workers in America,” he wrote.\n\nAny one member can delay a quick vote and potentially put off final action until after the December 9 deadline to avert a strike.\n\nSome Republicans are still skeptical of congressional intervention, arguing they would rather the issue be dealt with administratively.\n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, a frequent swing vote, told CNN that the measure “deserves careful consideration.”\n\n“I’m going to wait and listen to the debate at lunch today before reaching any kind of conclusion,” she said.\n\nIowa Sen.

But thanks to a nearly century-old law that regulates labor relations only when it comes to railroads and airlines, what otherwise would be strictly an economic issue became a political one.\n\nThe Railway Labor Act was passed in 1926 as one of the very first labor laws in the nation. At that point most of the railroads already had been unionized, some all the way back to the mid-19th century. The structure was therefore set up to regulate labor negotiations between unions and management, rather than oversee organizing campaigns for new unions and additional members.\n\nBecause of the law, the House was able to vote Wednesday to impose unpopular contracts on four rail unions whose members have already rejected the terms, followed by a vote by the Senate vote late Thursday that did the same.\n\nThe measure now goes to President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign it. When he does, there will no longer be a chance of a Dec. 9 strike that would have shut down about 30% of the nation’s freight shipments. A prolonged strike would have caused shortage of a wide range of items, from food to gasoline to automobiles, and likely resulted in a spike in prices.\n\nA group of steam locomotives pour steam and smoke into the air in St. Paul, Minnesota in this file photo from 1925. The Railway Labor Act, passed in 1926, is the reason Congress could intervene this week to block a strike by freight railroad unions. Minnesota Historical Society/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe House also passed a law that would give the unions paid sick days, addressing the issue they said led members to reject the deals. But the efforts to pass that same measure in the Senate fell short, even though 52 of 95 senators voted for it. The measure needed 60 votes to pass the senate.\n\nUnder the Railway Labor Act, the federal agency that oversees railroad and airline labor relations is the National Mediation Board, which tries to bring the two sides together, and it set up a series of limits and cooling off periods during which unions can not strike and management can not lock out the workers. And if all those efforts fail, then Congress can step in and impose a contract under which both sides will have to operate.\n\nIn negotiations at other businesses, the workers’ ability to strike is the most powerful option unions have to achieve their goals at the bargaining table. And even the railroads admit that the law makes strikes extremely unlikely.\n\n“The goal of the Railway Labor Act was to reduce the likelihood of a work stoppage,” said Ian Jefferies, the CEO of the Association of American Railroads, the trade group that represents the railroads. “And it’s been remarkably effective in doing that.”\n\nAs much as management likes the law and its limits on strikes, the unions hate it. They say it would be far easier to reach a deal that their members can support if they had the leverage of a possible strike. And they say that management, when weighing the cost of that possible strike, would realize that they have the resources needed to meet those demands without an actual work stoppage.\n\nThe four major railroads — Union Pacific (UNP), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA)’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe — reported some form of record profits in 2021. Wall Street analysts expect even better profits in 2022, at least for the three railroads they cover.\n\nIf they were covered by the National Labor Relations Act, the labor law that oversees worker-management relations at most of the nation’s businesses, the unions could threaten to go on strike. But under the Railway Labor Act, management can fall back on hopes that Congress will give them the deal it wants.\n\n“This action prevents us from reaching the end of our process, takes away the strength and ability that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads to…do the right thing,” said Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, one of the four unions whose members voted against the tentative agreements reached last fall that Congress is now poised to impose on members.\n\nThe railroads deny they wanted this to end up with Congress, and they preferred to reach a deal with the unions that could be ratified by membership.\n\n“I don’t think it’s anyone’s goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,” said AAR’s Jefferies.\n\nBut Biden, in his statement calling on Congress to act to impose the rejected tentative agreements on the rail workers to keep them on the job, seemed to acknowledge that there was no chance that rail management would reach a deal with the unions.\n\n“During the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and management,” he said. “They believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table.”\n\nThe railroads refused to accept union demands for paid sick days. Jefferies also said the railroads would only agree to make changes in sick day rules if it was within the “framework” of the proposal put forth by a presidential panel this summer that was charged with trying to find a compromise agreement.\n\nThat means for the unions to get the sick pay they wanted, they’d have to give up some other pay or benefit in order to keep the overall economics of the package unchanged. The likelihood that Congress will impose a deal along the lines of the presidential panel’s recommendations, or the tentative agreements, means that management has little incentive to agree to union demands.\n\nThe decision to urge Congress to take action was politically difficult for Biden, who is often referred to as the most pro-union president in recent history. When he served in the Senate, Biden voted against an earlier effort to impose a contract on the rail unions to keep them on the job.\n\n“As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,” he said in his statement Monday night calling for Congressional action.\n\nBut he said he couldn’t ignore the economic upheaval that a rail strike could cause, and that he had no choice but to turn to Congress and the powers it has.\n\n“In this case – where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families – I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal,” he said.\n\nAnd he said the deals, while they weren’t everything the unions wanted, were good ones for the unions, with the biggest pay increases in more than 50 years, and some improvements in other contract terms.\n\n“On the day that it was announced, labor leaders, business leaders, and elected officials all hailed it as a fair resolution of the dispute between the hard-working men and women of the rail freight unions and the companies in that industry,” Biden said. “The agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.”\n\nBut the unions and their allies say that it’s wrong to force members to accept a deal they rejected because it denies the workers the basic sick days they are demanding.\n\n“During the first three quarters of this year, the rail industry made a record-breaking $21.2 billion in profits,” said a group of a dozen Democratic senators, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Guaranteeing seven paid sick days to rail workers would only cost the industry $321 million a year – less than 2 percent of their total profits. Please do not tell us that the rail industry cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to their workers.”\n\nBut only 4 of the 12 senators who issued the statement - Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - voted against imposing the unpopular contracts. The other eight who signed onto the statement - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Alex Padilla of California, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island - all joined in the 80-15 vote in favor of imposing the contracts to block the strike.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/business/uk-rail-strikes-october", "title": "Strikes could bring UK railway to a standstill as truce ends | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nLabor unions in the United Kingdom offered the country a brief respite from a wave of strike action during the period of national mourning for the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nNow, one day after the monarch’s funeral, strikes are back on as workers press their claims for better pay and conditions and annual inflation hovers around 10%.\n\nEarlier this month, rail and postal worker unions paused plans to walk out over demands for higher pay in the wake of the Queen’s death.\n\nThe National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said Tuesday that more than 40,000 workers spanning 14 train operators and Network Rail, the owner of the national railway infrastructure, would strike for 24 hours starting on October 1 in a dispute over pay, job security and conditions.\n\nThe RMT said the action — which will coincide with separate strikes by other rail staff and bus workers — would bring Britain’s railways to an “effective standstill.”\n\n“Transport workers are joining a wave of strike action on October 1st, sending a clear message to the government and employers that working people will not accept continued attacks on pay and working conditions at a time when big business profits are at an all-time high,” RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said in a statement.\n\nJubilee line trains parked at the London Underground Stratford Market Depot in London, as London Underground workers joined members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union in their nationwide strike in a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.

Average wages have failed to keep pace with soaring consumer price inflation, which stood at 9.9% in the year to August.\n\nMore strikes could be on the way this fall, threatening unprecedented disruption across a range of industries. Teachers, doctors and nurses are set to vote on strike action in the coming weeks. More unions could even coordinate their walkouts. Unite and Unison — the country’s biggest unions with 2.7 million members in total — are calling for others to join them in synchronized action.\n\nLast week, Unite said that 1,900 workers at Britain’s biggest container port Felixstowe will strike for eight days starting September 27 over pay for the second time in as many months. The walkout will overlap with strike action by hundreds of dockworkers at the Port of Liverpool, another key UK trade hub.\n\nIn the United States, too, workers are unhappy. Last week, the country narrowly averted a rail strike by more than 50,000 workers after unions and railroad companies came to a tentative deal over pay. The strike had threatened to cripple supply chains and push prices higher for many goods.\n\n— Chris Isidore, Vanessa Yurkevich and Jeremy Diamond contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban Arnaud Siad", "Anna Cooban", "Arnaud Siad"], "publish_date": "2022/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/business/boeing-defense-workers-strike", "title": "Boeing defense workers set to go on strike | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWorkers at Boeing’s defense plants in the St. Louis area are threatening to go on strike next week after union members rejected the company’s final contract offer.\n\nThere are 2,500 members of the International Association of Machinists set to go on strike at 12:01 am central time on August 1.

Boeing also offered to make a special contribution of 2% of workers’ pay in 2023 and 2024, and to provide matches on student loan payments for workers’ children.\n\n“We are activating our contingency plan to support continuity of operations in the event of a strike,” said the company’s statement.\n\nThe proposed three-year agreement would have raised average wages by 7.2% in the first year of the contract in addition to giving workers a $1,000 cash bonus, according to a web site about the offer from the company. Workers would have received a 4% increase in the second year and a 3% raise in the third year, according to Boeing.\n\nBoeing has posted deep losses each of the last three years, with net losses totaling $18.1 billion since the start of 2019. But those losses were primarily related to its commercial aircraft business, which has been buffeted by the 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that started in March of 2019 following two fatal crashes, as well as a sharp drop in demand for air travel caused by the pandemic.\n\nThe company’s defense, space and security business unit posted a $1.5 billion profit each of the last two years.

Many vital sectors — including oil refining, agriculture, auto and other manufacturing, plus the imports of consumer goods — depend on the railroads to operate. While a short strike would have a limited effect, economists say a strike lasting a week or more could have severe economic consequences.\n\nThe railroads announced last Friday that they had stopped accepting shipments of hazardous material, including fertilizer, as well as security-related materials, due to concerns that trains will immediately stop wherever they are once the strike begins. On Wednesday many stopped accepting shipments of agricultural products.\n\nMembers of Union Pacific (UNP) train crews were informed by the railroad late Tuesday that if they’re in the middle of a trip when the strike begins at 12:01 am EST Friday they should park and secure their train and wait for transportation.\n\nFreight railroad Norfolk Southern (NSC) is planning to use management employees to operate a limited number of trains in the event of a strike Friday. That could allow critical materials to reach their destinations, like chlorine to water treatment plants.\n\n“We’ll have some capability. Not a very good capability, but we’ll have some if it comes to that,” Norfolk Southern spokesman Connor Spielmaker told CNN Business Wednesday. “How we’re going to utilize them is still being planned out.”\n\nSpielmaker said the railroads still hope to reach a deal with the unions and avert such a situation. Freight railroads CSX, BNSF and Union Pacific declined to say if they’ll be using management employees to operate trains in the event of a strike.\n\nThe threat of the strike could snarl commutes across the country. Many Amtrak and local commuter trains travel on railways owned by freight companies. If striking engineers park their trans midroute Friday morning, commutes could be disrupted. Amtrak on Wednesday said it canceled all long-distance trains starting Thursday, and it announced 10 additional routes would be shut down Thursday evening. Amtrak said additional delays or cancellations are possible.\n\nStrike threat has White House under pressure\n\nThe effort to avert a strike is a major test for President Joe Biden and his White House, which has positioned itself as one of the most pro-labor administrations ever. At the same time, it also wants to avoid any potential shocks to the economy, especially with the midterm elections just seven weeks away.\n\nRailroad workers are governed by a different labor law than most workers, one that limits their freedom to strike and allows for more governmental intervention. In July Biden issued an order that prevented a strike at that time and created a panel, known as a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), to try to find a solution to the dispute. It also imposed a 60-day cooling off period during which the unions could not strike and management could not lock out workers.\n\nBut Biden cannot order the railroads to keep operating once the cooling off period ends Friday. Only Congress can act to keep workers on the job if there is no deal. Sen. Richard Durbin, the second highest ranking member of the Democrats’ Senate leadership, told CNN this week that Congressional action is unlikely, despite business groups calling on Congress to act. The Senate is in recess on Friday, and many members of Congress are flying to London to attend Queen Elizabeth’s funeral.\n\nFight not over wages\n\nThe PEB’s recommendations called for workers to get an immediate 14% pay raise, plus back pay dating back to 2020. It also called for a 24% increase in pay during the five-year life of the contract from 2020 to 2024, and cash bonuses of $1,000 a year.\n\nBut it did not address the staffing shortages and scheduling rules that have become the key sticking point in the dispute. The engineers’ and conductors’ unions say the railroads are requiring their members to be “on call” and ready to report to work on short notice as often as seven days a week. Leadership of the two unions say their members would not accept a contract without changes to those work rules.\n\nThere are more than 50,000 other unions members at the railroads who maintain tracks, operate signals, dispatch trains and work as mechanics, among other jobs. But they are not subject to the same work rules, and those unions already accepted tentative deals with the railroads based on the PEB’s recommendations.\n\nOne of those unions, the Machinists, announced Wednesday that its members voted to reject its tentative labor deal. There are about 5,000 members of the union at the railroads working as locomotive machinists, track equipment mechanics and facility maintenance personnel.\n\nTheir rejection of the proposed contract is not an immediate setback in efforts to avoid the strike. The union said it will not go on strike before the end of the month, as it tries to reach a change in the tentative agreement that its members will accept. But it is a sign of the complexity the railroads are facing in reaching deals with a dozen different unions that are also acceptable to rank-and-file membership.\n\nTwo other unions, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen and the Transportation Communications Union, which between them have 11,000 members, ratified deals on Wednesday.\n\n– CNN’s Matt McFarland, Ali Zaslav, Kate Sullivan, Phil Mattingly, Maegan Vazquez and Andrew Millman contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/tech/amazon-labor-union-staten-island-whats-next", "title": "Amazon warehouse workers in New York made history voting for a ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nAfter Christian Smalls was fired two years ago from an Amazon warehouse in New York City following his participation in a walkout over its pandemic response, an executive at the company suggested undercutting his organizing efforts by painting him as “not smart, or articulate.” When Smalls’ newly-established organization garnered enough interest to hold a union election at that facility this year, a spokesperson for the tech giant initially cast doubt on the legitimacy of the signatures indicating support. And when the election went forward, Amazon engaged in a full-blown campaign to combat the union drive, including text messages, signage and required group meetings to convey its anti-union message to workers.\n\nBut on Friday, the results of that election showed that employees at the Staten Island, New York, facility voted overwhelmingly in favor of unionizing with Amazon Labor Union (ALU), the grassroots labor organization started by Smalls and other current and former Amazon employees of the facility. The move marks the first time a group of US workers have successfully voted to form a union in Amazon’s 27-year history.\n\nThe win is striking for a number of reasons, including that ALU is a scrappy effort unaligned with an established labor union. It scored a decisive victory while a drive done in tandem with an 85-year-old labor union in Alabama has stumbled. (The results of an election at Bessemer one year ago favored Amazon but were scrapped after a National Labor Relations Board regional director determined Amazon had illegally interfered, a decision the company called “disappointing.” A do-over election currently remains too close to call.)\n\nNow, the milestone vote and the bootstrapped approach to achieve it may well have ripple effects throughout Amazon, where other union efforts are already underway. It has the potential to motivate workers at other warehouses to unionize, labor experts say, and perhaps to rethink more conventional tactics for doing so. It could also supercharge the broader labor movement in the United States.\n\nAmazon, the country’s second largest private employer, became even more dominant during the pandemic, hiring hundreds of thousands of workers to keep up with surging demand for online deliveries. The company is also widely viewed as setting the standards for what the future of work looks like across the United States, with its emphasis on ultra-efficient warehouses, automation and careful tracking of worker productivity.\n\n“Amazon workers around the country will now have a belief that it’s possible to organize and win an election – but it will still be difficult,” said Rebecca Givan, a labor law professor at Rutgers University. “The odds are always, always stacked against workers organizing in a situation like this, but this is proof that it can be done and it will likely inspire workers elsewhere.”\n\nChristian Smalls celebrates with union members after getting the voting results to unionize Amazon warehouse on Staten Island, N.Y., Friday, April 1, 2022. Eduardo Munoz Avarez/AP\n\nBut as the dust settles on the vote, questions remain about how much Amazon may push back at the new union – and any other efforts that attempt to follow in its footsteps.\n\nHow Amazon may push back\n\nAmazon has previously said in statements that its “employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union,” while spending $4.3 million just last year on anti-union consultants. In a statement Friday, the company indicated it will explore its options to challenge the results rather than accepting that workers had voted in favor of the effort. (Both parties have until this Friday to file any objections.)\n\nAmazon said it was exploring “filing objections” over what it claims was “inappropriate and undue influence” on the part of the NLRB, the independent federal agency tasked with protecting employees’ right to organize.\n\nKayla Blado, acting director and press secretary for the NLRB, issued a sharp statement to CNN Business in response to Amazon on Friday. “The NLRB is an independent federal agency that Congress has charged with enforcing the National Labor Relations Act. All NLRB enforcement actions against Amazon have been consistent with that Congressional mandate.”\n\nGivan said Amazon’s statement suggests it may not have a clear path to challenging the results through what might be considered a more typical means. “There don’t seem to be challenges based on conduct of the organizers in the campaign or they would’ve come to light by now, and certainly not on the eligibility of the voters or there would’ve been more challenged ballots,” Givan said.\n\nSimilarly, Kate Andrias, a labor law professor at Columbia Law School, called it a “very unusual argument,” noting that it appears the company is “hoping to put political pressure on the NLRB in order to have it stand down.”\n\nWhat’s clear, according to labor experts, is that Amazon isn’t likely to embrace the ALU, which has another election slated to kick off at a sorting facility in Staten Island later this month. And that could prove challenging when the ALU enters a next phase of negotiating a contract.\n\nWorkers at Amazon's Staten Island facility, known as JFK8, became the first in the nation to successfully unionize. Eduardo Munoz Avarez/AP\n\nGivan said that some employers at times attempt to undermine union efforts by making it difficult to achieve a contract, with a process called surface bargaining.\n\n“They’ll try to do the minimum or won’t be serious at the bargaining table. They have a legal obligation to supposedly bargain in good faith, but there’s not many teeth behind [enforcement of that obligation],” Givan said.\n\nWhile Amazon is legally obligated to begin bargaining in a timely manner, some labor experts noted Amazon may attempt to delay as much as possible and push off negotiations until any possible legal complaints are resolved. According to John Logan, a professor of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, some corporations are of the mindset that “you haven’t lost until you sign a contract.”\n\nGiven its significance, Amazon is likely to face a great deal scrutiny in how it navigates the coming weeks and months in response to the results of the election.\n\nWhere the union push goes next\n\nWithin hours of the union victory, the outcome was praised by the White House, advocacy groups and large labor unions, some of which hinted at plans to build on the new momentum to unionize Amazon.\n\n“The Teamsters are excited to continue this fight against Amazon—on the shop floor, at the bargaining table, and on the streets,” said Sean O’Brien, the newly installed general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, in a statement Friday. The Teamsters, which represents some 1.3 million members including UPS workers, voted last year in favor of making Amazon a key priority and helping its workers achieve a union contract.\n\nLiz Shuler, president of American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, who previously said the organization would help the Teamsters take on Amazon, also praised the Staten Island result. “In the face of one of the richest, most anti-union corporations, today’s victory proves when working people unite in the fight for justice, anything is possible,” Shuler tweeted.\n\nBut the Staten Island effort also underscores that an “unconventional” campaign can be victorious, said Logan. As he put it to CNN Business before the votes were tallied, unionizing Amazon will require “something that’s going to take off like wildfire and, to a large extent, going to be worker-led and based on the self-organization of workers.”\n\nALU, which bootstrapped its union drive largely through donations raised on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe, may inspire precisely that.\n\nEven before the vote, there were signs of labor organizing ramping up in various corners of Amazon’s vast empire. Those included walkouts over wages and workplace conditions at delivery stations in Chicago, an organizing effort underway at an Amazon Fresh store in Seattle and the other ALU-led union election at a Staten Island sorting facility.\n\nAt Smalls’ former warehouse on Staten Island, the focus now shifts from the ballot box to the negotiation table. In a press release Saturday, ALU said Smalls has demanded Amazon begin negotiations in early May. “It is our sincere hope that we can begin a constructive dialogue with our employer, and that the process will result in greatly improved working conditions for Amazon workers,” the release said.\n\nIn an interview with CNN Business ahead of the election, Smalls ticked off a list of demands the ALU intends to seek from Amazon, including higher wages, job security, better working conditions, longer breaks, making warehouse workers shareholders again, and securing funds to cover the cost of transportation to and from the facility.\n\n“I would never agree to anything that doesn’t benefit us, and I’m talking about us at the bottom, the entry level workers,” said Smalls. “We’re at least a year or more away from even thinking about dues. We have to fight for a contract first.”", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}]}

Ron DeSantis said at a news conference Thursday. Miami joins Fort Lauderdale and Orlando in the top five most popular domestic destinations for spring break travel according to AAA.\n\nBut when the world was beginning to emerge from the pandemic in 2021, partiers flocked to Miami Beach and law enforcement was overwhelmed with more than 1,000 arrests. The following year, several people were injured in shootings. Last year, Miami Beach said they were \"breaking up\" with spring break.\n\nEven as places like Fort Lauderdale lend a friendly welcome to spring breakers, many cities with spring break reputations are ramping up police patrols, asking the state to help with enforcement and issuing stern warnings to those preparing to visit.\n\nMiami Beach 'spring break reality check' touts fun-killing rules\n\nLike last year's \"breaking up\" with spring break viral campaign video, Miami Beach is warning travelers that their spring break party plans could be thwarted by tough restrictions.\n\nIn a reality television-style scripted video, a group of friends cheer about heading to the area for spring break, but things take a turn for their vacation because of the strict rules in place.\n\n\"Once we got to Miami Beach, things went downhill fast,\" one woman says in the video, before police crash their beach party, force them to dump out alcohol and kill the speaker. The group argues over the curfew, pricey parking and beach regulations.\n\n\"The show is fake,\" the video states. \"But the rules ... are very real.\"\n\nBy mid-March of 2024, Miami Beach Police were pleased with the progress they had made, a spokesperson told USA TODAY at the time.\n\n\"2024 was the most successful and smoothest spring break we've had here in a long time,\" DeSantis said Thursday at the news conference in Miami Beach. The state listed 36 felony arrests and 51 misdemeanor arrests for spring break in 2024, with 16 felonies and 17 misdemeanors coming from Miami Beach.\n\nStill, DeSantis said state law enforcement is standing by with more than 100 state troopers, drones and K9 units to help local agencies around the state.\n\n\"We can't have things just descend into madness and mayhem and chaos,\" DeSantis said at the news conference. \"I think we're going to have another successful season in 2025.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale keeps welcoming 'everyone under the sun'\n\nWhile Miami Beach tries to ward off its rowdy visitors, Fort Lauderdale is eager to welcome tourists again in 2025, Mayor Dean Trantalis told USA TODAY in an interview Wednesday.\n\n\"We have a different vibe here in Fort Lauderdale versus Miami Beach,\" Trantalis said. \"I think the mood is edgier in Miami Beach and honestly, I think the beach is sort of an afterthought when it comes to the reason for that destination. Most people are drawn to the party scenes.\"\n\nBut the relationship wasn't always harmonious between spring breakers and Fort Lauderdale. Trantalis previously said in the 1970s and 1980s, spring breakers came in hundreds of thousands, overwhelming the city. It led to the same kinds of pushback that Miami Beach is issuing, until crowds came under control.\n\nSome initiatives to keep spring break safe are still in place from Feb. 23 until April 12, like additional police presence and prohibitions on coolers, alcohol and amplified music on the beach.\n\n\"Everyone under the sun is welcome,\" Trantalist said. \"We appreciate everyone ... regardless of their background, their faith, their race, who they love, Fort Lauderdale is a place for everyone.\"\n\nPolice across Florida issue spring break warnings: 'We're a real fun beach, but we don't have a real fun jail'\n\nDeSantis said spring break party reputations have moved around the state, and therefore various cities have had crackdowns at one time or another. In fact, several places have issued stern warnings to partiers and restrictions this year.\n\n\"We're a real fun beach, but we don't have a real fun jail,\" said Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford at a February news conference along with Panama City Beach Police Department, as reported by the Panama City News Herald, part of the USA TODAY Network. The Bay County Sheriff's Office and the Panama City Beach Police, both located in the Florida Panhandle, said they are coordinating together and with the state ahead of the crowds to try to stop drugs and violence from coming to the area. The PCBPD chief mentioned spring breaks of the past that would no longer be tolerated.\n\nFarther down the Gulf Coast in the Tampa Bay area, the Clearwater Police Department is implementing its usual extra police patrols on the beach, spokesperson Rob Shaw said in an email. Officials also want visitors to swim near a lifeguard, avoid leaving items unattended and be prepared for lots of traffic.\n\nIn Volusia County, where Daytona Beach has long had a reputation for being a spring break party destination, Sheriff Mike Chitwood issued a stern warning.\n\n\"Let the word go forth: If you act a fool, we have a place for you,\" he said in a Facebook video. \"If you don't respect our community, you're going to get disrespected by law enforcement.\"\n\nContributing: Dylan Gentile, C.A.

Instead, it seems more likely that the public and health officials are simply paying more attention and getting better at identifying outbreaks quickly with advancing technology and improving testing methods.\n\nWith a new recall seemingly every week, however, it can be difficult for the average consumer to keep up with the onslaught of food safety alerts. Here's a look back at some of the largest food-related recalls of 2024.\n\nBoar's Head\n\nIn one of the most high-profile food recall cases of the last decade, a deadly listeria outbreak attributed to Boar's Head cold cuts, specifically its liverwurst, resulted in several deaths this summer.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFirst reported on July 19 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the outbreak ultimately resulted in the recall of roughly 7.2 million pounds of product by Boar's Head. The company later blamed the outbreak on its liverwurst, which it has since discontinued.\n\nAll told, the outbreak made 61 known people ill across 19 states, resulting in 60 hospitalizations and 10 deaths. It also led to the closure of the Jarratt, Virginia facility in which the recalled meat was produced, leaving roughly 500 workers without jobs.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture inspection records obtained by USA TODAY and other outlets later showed more than 60 reports of \"noncompliance\" at the Jarratt, Virginia plant including reports of insects and green mold, as well as mildew, dripping and standing water and other unsanitary conditions within the plant in the years leading up to the July recall.\n\nThe fallout has been wide-reaching, though the outbreak itself was declared \"over\" by the CDC in November. A USDA investigation into the agency's handling of the situation is ongoing and several lawsuits remain underway.\n\nHolocaust survivor dies in outbreak: His dad died from listeria tied to Boar’s Head meat. He needed to share his story.\n\nSlivered onions used on McDonald's Quarter Pounders\n\nAn onion recall initiated due to possible E. coli contamination made headlines this fall after being linked to McDonald's burgers.\n\nThe E. coli outbreak was attributed to raw slivered onions served on Quarter Pounder burgers, which the chain temporarily pulled from some of its menus. McDonald's previously told USA TODAY that Taylor Farms had supplied onions to McDonald's in the areas impacted by E. coli illnesses, and US Foods, to whom Taylor Farms is a third-party supplier, issued a recall on raw diced, peeled and whole peeled onions produced by the company on Oct. 22. However, the recalled Taylor Farms Colorado onions were not related to the company's removal of Quarter Pounders, the company said.\n\nThe outbreak was declared \"over\" by the CDC and FDA on Dec. 3, having caused 104 illnesses across 14 states, including 34 hospitalizations and one death in Colorado.\n\nMcDonald's has since \"identified an alternate supplier for the approximately 900 restaurants that had temporarily stopped serving Quarter Pounder burgers with slivered onions.\"\n\nIs it safe to eat McDonald's Quarter Pounders linked to E. coli outbreak has some worried\n\nDairy products\n\nIn one of the first recalls of 2024, Rizo-López Foods of Modesto, Calif. recalled about four dozen dairy products for possible contamination with listeria.\n\nThe recalled products – including cheese, crema, yogurt and sour cream – were distributed nationwide and sold under brand names including 365 Whole Foods Market, Don Francisco and Tio Francisco.\n\nThe FDA and CDC began investigating in January 2024 after the Hawaii State Department of Health reported it had found a sample of Rizo Bros Aged Cotija that tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Officials said this amounts to a multi-year multistate investigation because of previous listeria outbreaks connected to Rizo-López Foods in 2021 and 2017, with cases dating back to 2014.\n\nThe CDC and FDA reopened the investigation in January 2024 after the cheese sample showed that it was the same strain of listeria that caused illnesses in the earlier outbreaks.\n\nThe CDC declared the outbreak over in April, having resulted in 26 illnesses with 2 deaths and 23 hospitalizations in 11 states.\n\nBrucePac meats\n\nReady-to-eat meat producer BrucePac issued a recall in October for what ultimately amounted to 11.8 million pounds of product for listeria concerns.\n\nThe meat and poultry were used in frozen and ready-to-eat items across hundreds of brands, distributors and products, leading the USDA to release a 400-plus page list of recalled items.\n\nThe recall impacted not only well-known brands like Fresh Express, Udi's, Dole and Amazon Fresh, but popular grocery suppliers as well, including Walmart, Kroger and Trader Joe's. The USDA later released a preliminary list of roughly 200 schools across at least 17 states that received products included in the recall.\n\nThe outbreak is still listed as \"active\" by the USDA, though the last update was released on Oct. 17. There have been no confirmed reports of illness related to this recall.\n\nCucumbers\n\nA cucumber recall linked to a salmonella outbreak that has sickened 100 people across 23 states since October is still ongoing, according to a Dec. 19 FDA statement.\n\nAs of the most recent update, 100 people across 23 states were infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella, resulting in 25 hospitalizations. No deaths were reported.\n\nIn November, Arizona company SunFed Produce recalled cucumbers sold Oct. 12 through Nov. 26 in more than two dozen states – including at some Walmart, Wegmans, and Albertsons stores – and in parts of Canada. Costco and Kroger also recently notified customers they sold some of the recalled cucumbers.\n\nSince the initial recall, the FDA has issued several updates adding additional brands subject to the recall, including Crazy Fresh, Quick & Easy and Sprouts Farmers Market, among others.\n\nGrimmway Farms carrots\n\nCalifornia-based produce company Grimmway Farms grappled with E. coli concerns after issuing a recall for multiple sizes and brands of bagged organic baby and whole carrots on Nov. 16.\n\nThe CDC declared the outbreak officially \"over\" on Dec. 18, reporting a total of 48 illnesses across 19 states, including 20 hospitalizations and one death in California.\n\nThe carrots were distributed and sold under a handful of brands, including Trader Joe's, Wholesome Pantry, Cal-Organic, 365 and more.\n\nWolverine Packing Co.\n\nDetroit-based meat manufacturer Wolverine Packing Co. recalled about 67,200 pounds of fresh and frozen ground beef products for E. Coli concerns in November after illnesses were reported by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.\n\nWhile the products were distributed to restaurants nationwide, 15 cases of E. coli poisoning were identified in just Minnesota, with illness onset dates ranging from Nov. 2-10, said the USDA. No deaths were reported.\n\nThe recall covered over 100 raw fresh and frozen ground beef products. Products were sold under other brand names in addition to Wolverine Packing Co., including 1855 Beef, Davis Creek Meals, Farmer's Choice, Heritage Restaurant Brands and Cheney Brothers, Inc., according to a list of labels released by the USDA.\n\nFrozen waffles\n\nPerhaps one of the more unexpected recalls of the year, TreeHouse Foods issued a voluntary recall of its frozen waffle products in October due to potential listeria contamination.\n\nThe waffles were sold across brands like Best Choice, Kodiak Cakes and Good & Gather, and at several stores including Dollar General, Publix, Stop & Shop, Target and Walmart.\n\nTreeHouse Foods told USA TODAY that the issue was found at one of their manufacturing facilities. There have been no confirmed reports of illness linked to the recalled products to date.\n\nEggs\n\nA salmonella outbreak was linked to eggs in September, resulting in 65 people becoming infected across nine states. The illnesses started in May and hospitalized 24 people.\n\nAccording to the FDA and CDC, impacted eggs were supplied to retailers across Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan by Milo's Poultry Farms LLC. The eggs were labeled with Milo's Poultry Farms or Tony's Fresh Market. No deaths were reported.\n\nCinnamon\n\nThe FDA issued recalls in 2024 for several brands of cinnamon due to the presence of the toxic heavy metal and other \"possible health risks.\"\n\nA September Consumer Reports analysis identified 12 brands whose cinnamon and multi-spice powders contained such high traces of lead that a quarter of a teaspoon of any of the products would exceed an individual's daily consumption threshold.\n\nGround cinnamon sold by U.S. discount retailers including Dollar Tree and Family Dollar was also found to be contaminated with lead, the FDA said in March.\n\nYu Shang Food Inc. Ready-to-Eat Meat and Poultry\n\nOn Nov. 9, Yu Shang Food issued an initial recall of 4,589 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products for listeria concerns. On Nov. 21, the recall expanded to include a total of 72,240 pounds, including all Yu Shang Food, Inc. products made before Oct. 28, 2024.\n\nRecalled products included all those labeled with Yu Shang Food, including Yushang Brand Cooked Chicken, Seasoned Pork Hock, Japanese Chashu Pork Belly and more.\n\nIn a Dec. 5 update, the CDC said a total of 19 people became ill across eight states, including 17 hospitalizations and two deaths.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/29/stop-and-shop-stops-selling-tobacco-cigarettes/74998700007/", "title": "Stop & Shop stops selling tobacco, cigarette products at 360 stores", "text": "Customers will no longer be able to stock up on cigarettes and tobacco products at Stop & Shop as the retail chain announced plans to nix the products from its shelves.\n\nThe Massachusetts-based grocery store chain made the announcement Monday, noting that tobacco products will no longer be sold in any of its 360 stores.

A movie usher who can decide if someone goes to heaven or hell. Three brothers who learn they are each made of animal DNA. A look at gang life on the White Earth Indian Reservation.\n\nThese are only some of the films I have seen at the Palm Springs International Film Festival since I started covering it in 2013.\n\nThe first time I attended, I had no idea which films I should go see. I was overwhelmed while I looked through the program, trying to read all the synopses. So, I picked four films I knew nothing about — based on genre, country and one for the title alone.\n\nFilm Fest 2020: Quentin Tarantino nabs director of year award\n\nFilm Fest 2020: Jamie Foxx to receive Spotlight Award\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nOne of the most memorable films was \"Under the Same Sun,\" an Israeli/Palestinian film made in collaboration with Palestinian director Sameh Zoabi and John Marks, the founder of the international nonprofit Search for Common Ground. It's a fictional film about two businessmen who put aside their differences to solve an energy crisis on both sides of wall, which ultimately ends the conflict and shows both sides living in peace.\n\nAfter the screening, the Q&A with Marks and Zoabi was intense. People voiced their opposition, but many saw the value and engaged with the pair. I left with a real-life understanding of the conflict — the film might have been a fantasy, but it showed what could happen with good leadership.\n\nToday, I continue to pick festival films the way I did with \"Under the Same Sun,\" going into them with an open mind. I like the uncomfortable and adventurous feeling I get when I'm gambling with 80 minutes or three hours of my time, totally unaware of what I'm going to experience once the lights are off and the screening begins.\n\nI've always been moved by how an international director presents a film on a universal subject or issue, and it's unlike anything I've seen from any American filmmaker. An example is the Canadian film \"Mommy,\" directed by Xavier Dolan and shown at the festival in 2015. It takes on mental illness, showing a teenage boy with a severe case of ADHD and a violent streak, and his mother's struggle trying to educate and care for him.\n\nWatching \"Mommy\" proved to be difficult, because the cinematography shows those things in a different and compelling way. Lana Del Ray's song \"Born to Die\" plays as the tragic ending unfolds, and I always think of the film's ending when it plays on the radio.\n\nUsually, the audience is talkative after a film. But that day, the audience was almost silent in the lobby of the Annenberg Theater, looking somber after what they just saw.\n\nOne category the Palm Springs film festival excels in is documentaries, and on an international scale, there is fascinating subject matter. One in particular that I remember is \"Sherpa\" from 2016. It follows Phurba Tashi Sherpa, who at the time had successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest 21 times and was going for 22. The sherpas are hired by companies to help their wealthy western clients reach the top of the summit, and, for many, it's how they support their families in Nepal.\n\n\"Sherpa\" showed the dark side of that industry — how oftentimes they are disrespected by their clients and how many of them never make it down the mountain. It also discussed safety concerns and showed the 2014 avalanche on Everest that killed 16 sherpas.\n\nIf I leave the theater feeling like I've gotten to see something that has left an impact on me, as these three films did, or if I find myself exploring more titles from Turkey or Iran, I feel like the festival has gone beyond just watching a movie from another country.\n\nWhen I'm asked for suggestions related to the film festival, here's what I always say: Pick films from countries you know nothing about in the genres you're familiar with. Always stick around for the Q&A if there is one, and go into each film with an open mind.\n\nKeanu Reeves said, \"The whole aspect of cinema and film festivals should be a moment to come together and celebrate art and humanity. It would be a shame if there was such a divide.\"\n\nAn international film festival offers an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the unfamiliar, see things you normally wouldn't, and challenge your perception of the world.\n\nDesert Sun reporter Brian Blueskye covers arts and entertainment.

Jackson, who has starred in many Tarantino movies including \"Django Unchained,\" has long defended his co-collaborator for sticking to his creative process. \"You can’t just tell a writer he can’t talk, write the words, put the words in the mouths of the people from their ethnicities, the way that they use their words,\" he told Esquire in 2019. \"You cannot do that, because then it becomes an untruth; it’s not honest.

I'm so fragile about my legacy.'\"\n\nTarantino, who previously said he planned to retire after his 10th film, told Deadline in 2023 that the film was set in California in 1977 and based on a real-life film critic who wrote \"movie reviews for a porno rag.\" Brad Pitt, who won an Oscar for his role in Tarantino's 2019 film \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" was reportedly in talks to star in the film.\n\nTarantino said the film started as a limited, eight-episode series. While the \"Pulp Fiction\" director was satisfied with the show's script, he later decided to adapt it into a film format: \"No one's waiting for this thing, per se. I mean, I can do it whenever I want. I mean, it's already written. So OK, let me just not start it right now.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"Let me try writing it as a movie and let me see if it's better that way. ... And I was like, 'Oh, OK. No, I think this is going to be the movie.' And then it wasn't,\" Tarantino continued. \"I pulled the plug on it. And the reason I pulled the plug is a little crazy.\"\n\nThroughout his nearly four-decade career, Tarantino has become an icon of cinema thanks to his colorful neo-noir style, which often includes graphic violence and frequent references to popular culture. Some of his best-known films are \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Pulp Fiction\" the \"Kill Bill\" franchise, and \"Inglourious Basterds.\"\n\nWhy Quentin Tarantino didn't move forward with 'The Movie Critic'\n\nWhen it comes to movie magic, Tarantino isn't one to repeat himself.\n\nThe director told \"Church of Tarantino\" host Reverend Scott K. that he gave himself a \"challenge\" with the subject of \"The Movie Critic,\" which fueled much of his creative interest in the film.\n\n\"Can I take the most boring profession in the world and make it an interesting movie?\" Tarantino said. \"Who wants to see a movie called 'The Movie Critic'? ... If I can actually make a movie or a TV show about somebody who watches movies interesting, that is an accomplishment.\"\n\nAnd while Tarantino felt he met that goal, he said the film's production process bore too many similarities to \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" which is also set in a retro period of Los Angeles.\n\n\"I wasn't really that excited about dramatizing what I wrote when I was in pre-production,\" Tarantino said. \"There was nothing to figure out 'cause I already kind of knew, more or less, how to turn LA into an older time. So, it was too much like the last one.\"\n\nAs for what the future holds, Tarantino shared that his upcoming projects include an untitled play and \"The Adventures of Cliff Booth,\" a sequel to \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" written and co-produced by Tarantino, directed by David Fincher, and starring Pitt as the title character.\n\n\"I won't be on the set every day and everything, but I'll be around if they need me to do something,\" said Tarantino, adding with a laugh: \"It's a little more like I've given David a gigantic novel written in screenplay form, and it's his job.\"\n\nContributing: Brendan Morrow, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/02/24/oscar-quotes/1943687/", "title": "They said what?: Oscar edition", "text": "Jayme Deerwester, USA TODAY\n\nNo song unsung, no wine untasted: Anne Hathaway may have a golden statuette, but she isn't about to assume life will be a bed of roses professionally going forward. \"This is spectacular,\" she said. \"But you're always looking for the next job and you're thinking no one's going to hire you again. My practical approach is gotta work, gotta work, gotta work.\" She said she still can't watch her award-winning Les Mis performance and see Oscar brilliance: \"I'm impressed by my make up, my costume, the set, the song, the score, but all I hear are the notes I couldn't hit.\" She adds that, \"playing Fantine, having to connect with the darkness of life and the unnecessary suffering human beings inflict on each other, I would have loved to have gone home and forgotten about it each day, but I couldn't. Being in this movie made me more compassionate.\"\n\nThat was bang-on: At what point did the Argo producers start to feel like things might go their way? \"Michelle Obama,\" George Clooney jokes backstage. Affleck is a bit more cautious: \"When they gave us the trophies, I was confident we'd win.\" Speaking of the first lady, how did it feel to have her announce the best picture winner? Affleck admits, \"I was sort of hallucinating while that was happening. Honestly, I was just asking those two guys (co-producers Clooney and Grant Heslov) outside, 'Was that Michelle Obama?'\" After being assured that his imagination wasn't running away with him, Affleck called her participation \"an enormous honor. It was very cool.\" Adds Heslov, \"And I'm a big fan of the bangs.\"\n\nFirst question goes to the highest bidder: \"This isn't like an auction, right?\" asked Jennifer Lawrence as she came backstage to see reporters holding numbered signs. Naturally, the next question was about her on-stage spill. \"I tried to walk up the stairs in this dress,\" she explains. \"They wax the stairs.\" As to what went through her mind when she fell? \"A bad word that I can't say,\" she says, laughing.\n\nNot bad for his first 3-D movie: \"Here's the thing,\" best director winner Ang Lee said backstage. \"I think it's a miracle I could make this movie. I carried the anxiety for a very long time. For four years. It's a philosophical movie and an expensive one.\" Would he do another 3-D movie? \"Absolutely.\" Lee also points out that both his best-picture losses were announced by Jack Nicholson, recalling Brokeback Mountain losing to Crash. \"But this time you expected it. Everybody expected Argo to win.\"\n\nSing 'em out, Seth (and Kristin Chenoweth): \"Now the real performance starts with fake smiles at the ball. Here's to the losers, bless them all.\"\n\nBen's big night: \"Anyone who had anything to do with this movie gets thanks,\" says a visibly shaken Ben Affleck after Argo wins best picture. \"I want to thank Canada, I want to thank our friends in Iran who are living in terrible circumstances right now. I want to thank my wife, who I don't normally associate with Iran.\" Recalling his first Oscar win for co-writing Good Will Hunting, Affleck adds, \"I was here years ago and I had no idea what I was doing, standing out here in front of you all. I really was just a kid. I never thought that I'd be back here and I am because of so many you here tonight.\"\n\nWill the real Daniel Day-Lewis please stand up: The Method actor, who's known for staying in character throughout movie shoots (hence his comment about all the strange men his wife has lived with), assures the press room that he was being himself tonight. \"I'm definitely out of character at this moment.\" Then he pauses and adds, \"But if I slip back in, can you do the Heimlich or something? Get me out of it?\"\n\nAn EGOT for Adele? Now that she's got Grammys and an Oscar, reporters asked if the British songstress would try to capture an Emmy and/or Tony. \"Oh, maybe I'll do HBO special like Beyonce did ... But a Tony? I don't know ... A musical? No, I don't think so.\"\n\n\n\nWe would so watch that: Best actor winner Daniel Day-Lewis shares Hollywood casting history with the crowd. \"Three years ago before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually committed to play Margaret Thatcher and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. I'd like to see that version.\" (It's going on our Netflix list with the sock puppet version of Flight.)\n\n\"Entrapment\": That's how Tommy Lee Jones described the setup for Seth MacFarlane's attempt to make him laugh, explaining that he'd had a camera in his face for 30 minutes waiting to get that shot. Overall, though, he liked MacFarlane's performance and gave props to the orchestra for playing off a long-winded acceptance speech with the theme from Jaws.\n\nAnd many more: After almost eating it on her way up the stairs to accept the best-actress Oscar, a breathless Jennifer Lawrence acknowledges the audience's reaction: \"You're all standing up because you feel bad because I fell and that's really embarrassing.\" As she leaves the stage, she even remembers to say, \"Happy birthday, Emmanuelle!\" (Fellow nominee Riva turns 86 today.)\n\nJust teasing: \"Coming up, the best actress award,\" MacFarlane says as the show goes to commercial. \"Will it be Quvenzhané Wallis, who is nine, or Emmanuelle Riva, who was nine when this show started?\"\n\nThe ever-quotable Quentin Tarantino: \"I like to think that my movies will live on because of the characters I create,\" the Django Unchained writer/director says as he admires his second original-screenplay Oscar. \"I have to cast the right people to make these characters come alive, and boy did i get it right this time.\"\n\nYes, 'Good Will Hunting' was that long ago: Adapted screenplay winner Chris Terrio points to his director and role model, saying \"Ben, 15 years ago, you were up here with the first screenplay you got made, and now you've made this\" ... He goes on to thank Ken Taylor and John Sheardown, the Canadian diplomats who sheltered the American escapees until CIA agent Tony Mendez snuck them out of Iran.\n\nFeeling no Ang-st:Life of Pi director Ang Lee's assessment of the ceremony, about two-thirds through it: \"So far, so good.\"\n\nRainbow flag on that play: \"Tonight marks the 10th anniversary of Chicago winning best picture,\" MacFarlane reminds the audience. \"We now want to bring out the stars of that game-changing musical because we're concerned that tonight's show isn't gay enough.\"\n\nWhatever you do, don't fall: Director Malik Bendjellouil, recalling what was going through his mind when his documentary, Searching for Sugar Man, won: \"It's crazy. It's like the whole world goes in slow motion. You think, 'I should not fall right now.' Because it's kind of slippery on those steps.\"\n\nThey'll take a tie: Per Hallberg, co-winner with Karen Baker Landers for sound editing for Skyfall, tied with Zero Dark Thirty, a rarity that's only happened six times in Oscar history: \"Any time that you get involved in history making, it's good, and also Paul (Ottosson of Thirty) is a friend of ours, so that's nice.\"\n\nThis moment brought to you by Rosetta Stone: MacFarlane, introducing presenter Salma Hayek: \"We've reached the part of the ceremony where Salma Hayek, Penelope Cruz or Javier Bardem come out and we don't understand a word they say, but we don't care because they're so attractive.\"\n\nLt. Van Buren approves: Longtime Law & Order star S. Epatha Merkerson is at the Oscars for her first time. Asked to judge Seth MacFarlane's hosting talents, she replies, \"He's charming. But the highlight for me was Shirley Bassey.\"\n\nBless you: MacFarlane introduces Hawk Koch, the president of the Motion Picture Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: \"Now welcome a man so respected that it doesn't matter that his name sounds like a Russian man sneezing: Hawk Koch!\"\n\n\n\nHathaway's hope: The Les Mis star and newly minted supporting-actress Oscar winner wishes, \"Perhaps, someday in the not-so-distant future, the misfortune of Fantine will only be in stories, not in real life.\"\n\nProps from Plummer: \"I look forward to working with any of these ladies in my next 30 films,\" last year's supporting actor winner, 83, says as he introduces the supporting-actress nominees.\n\nMacFarlane's feet are plan-Ted on the ground: \"You guys made some beautiful, inspiring movies,\" the host tells the audience. \"I made Ted.\"\n\nAlways check the teleprompter: \"You really want to do this one?\" MacFarlane asks after spotting a joke on the prompter he thought had been cut. \"The first time I saw Ben Affleck with all that facial hair,\" he says, \"I thought the Kardashians had made the jump to film.\"\n\nKudos from Christoph: Austrian native Waltz thanked his Django Unchained writer/director, Quentin Tarantino, for guiding him to his second supporting actor win. \"We participated in a hero's journey, with hero of the year being Quentin, and you scaled the mountain because you are not afraid of it, you slayed the dragon because you're not afraid of it, you crossed through fire because it's worth it. I borrowed my character's words, sorry, I couldn't resist.\"\n\nOh myyyy: George Takei posts this to Facebook after seeing his Star Trek co-star counseling the first-time Oscar host from the future: \"Bill Shatner, Seth MacFarlane, the Gay Men's Chorus of L.A. and a musical number about boobs. This is epic.\"\n\nHow to pick up Sally Field: \"I've got a bottle of wine and some Boniva!\"\n\nObligatory 'Argo' joke: \"Argo is the story of a classified CIA mission to rescue American diplomats from Iran. In fact, the project was so secret that the director is unknown to the academy.\" Acknowledging Ben Affleck, who won the Director's Guild award and the Golden Globe but missed out on an Oscar nomination, MacFarlane tells him, \"They know they screwed up.\"\n\nSeth's opening shot: \"The quest to make Tommy Lee Jones laugh starts now.\"\n\nCocoa, not corsets: Despite being an Oscar winner and fashion icon, Nicole Kidman confesses that her favorite Oscars have been spent \"sitting in my pajamas, drinking hot chocolate.\"\n\n\"Boo!\": Best actress nominee Quvenzhané Wallis, greeting reporters as she popped out from behind her publicist. Her mother, following behind, conceded that the 9-year-old's bed time would be pushed back -- \"a lot later tonight, trust me.\"\n\nSinatra was right -- it was a very good year: Last year's winner for best supporting actor, Christopher Plummer, declared 2012 a \"great year for the movies. I have favorites, but I'm not going to tell you!\" Zero Dark Thirty's Jason Clarke concurs: \"This year so many films were not only so good, but were seen by so many people.\"\n\nSimmer down, Sherri: View co-host Sherri Shepherd is feeling faint on the red carpet. \"I'm about to pass out, \"she said, looking over at Channing Tatum. \"He is so beautiful. I need to be taken care of right now.\"\n\nIt helps to know the host: Everyone on the Oscar red carpet knows the deal: be sure to talk up whoever dressed you. That rule even extends to host Seth MacFarlane's dad, Ron. \"This was a birthday present from my daughter,\" he told USA TODAY, pointing to his kilt. (Should a breeze blow down the red carpet and up that kilt, you might just get a glimpse of his Family Guy underwear.) Asked what kind of seats the first-time Oscar emcee had scored, MacFarlane's sister Rachel replied, \"We have curiously good seats, Robert Downey Jr.-level seatage.\"\n\nRobin Roberts, ready to go: The Good Morning America host only returned to the anchor desk a few days ago following her bone marrow transplant, but that didn't stop her from flying cross-country to cover the Oscars and make a couple of predictions. She believes Anne Hathaway will win supporting actress and hopes that best picture underdog Life of Pi pulls off the win. On her way into the theater, she runs into Jimmy Kimmel Live security guard/sidekick Guillermo Diaz, decked out in a glittering gold jacket. \"You look like an Oscar,\" she tells him.\n\nYou call that Oscar food? When Wolfgang Puck stopped to talk to the Kimmel crew, Diaz presented the chef with a brown bag lunch. Unimpressed, he dumped its contents (including crackers, applesauce and Lunchables) on the ground and instructed Diaz, \"Tell Jimmy to give you more money so you can come eat in our restaurant and get some good food.\"\n\nSomebody show him how to tie a bow tie: Benh Zeitlin, a directing nominee for Beasts of the Southern Wild, is breathing a sigh of relief, glad to be at the awards season's \"finish line.\" But Oscar day was not without its challenges: he spent a good portion of the day \"trying to figure out how to tie a bowtie.

Follow him on Twitter @GeneSeymour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThese have been hard times for bad guys. Not “bad” bad guys. There are still plenty of those around in real life. I mean the “good” bad guys: movie actors who were so gifted at being hard, tough and occasionally junkyard-dog mean that they’re not always as easy to hate. It may say something about the brutality of Summer 2022 that it has taken away so many gifted actors known for brute-force roles.\n\nGene Seymour Jeremy Freeman/CNN\n\nJust this week, for instance, we lost both David Warner, at 80, and Paul Sorvino, at 83. However different their backgrounds (Warner was a Manchester, England native while Sorvino was born and bred in the Beautiful Borough of Brooklyn, New York), both men had long, distinguished and valued careers as character actors. Both frequently played imposing-to-intimidating men who even in relative repose conveyed implied threats.\n\nOn balance, Warner, whose breakthrough came in the title role of “Morgan!” (1966) as a lovesick London artist, had more credits than Sorvino as an out-and-out villain, whether it was as Jack the Ripper eluding H.G. Wells through future decades in “Time After Time” (1979), the slimy tech executive mutating into an even slimier digital program in “TRON” (1982), a Klingon high official in “Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country” (1991) and the baleful, glowering hatchet man to Kate Winslet’s dodgy, leering fiancé in “Titanic” (1997). In addition to these, there were dozens of credits on television and as cartoon voices where he was so reliably sinister that he had his own coterie of fans who appreciated his durability, professionalism and the strains of ruined dignity he managed to evoke in even the most malign of his villains.\n\nSorvino was even more beloved, though what many have called his signature film role, mob boss Paulie Cicero in “GoodFellas” (1990), wasn’t exactly warm and fuzzy. Sorvino’s Paulie loomed over finks, cops and colleagues alike with a frostiness thick enough to keep steaks in the next room from spoiling. In a salon teeming with motor-mouthed wise guys, Paulie was the one who just kept staring silently at the others.\n\nScary – and yet at one point in “GoodFellas,” you see an unexpected side of Paulie. It’s when, with intense concentration and an attention to detail, he uses a razor blade to slice off the thinnest possible layer off a garlic clove. Upon first seeing this in a theater, one images a thought bubble illuminating the darkness over everyone’s head saying, “Why didn’t I think of that?” This interlude somehow seemed close to the real-life Sorvino, whose eclectic activities off-screen included figurative sculpture.\n\nThis summer of transition among wise guys of the big and small screen all but started with the May 26 death of Sorvino’s “GoodFellas” co-star Ray Liotta at 67. Since then, we’ve also had to bid farewell to Tony Sirico, who played Peter Paul “Paulie Walnuts” Gualteri on HBO’s “The Sopranos.” Sirico, who died July 8 at 79, played Paulie Walnuts, one of the more volatile of Jersey capo Tony Soprano’s lieutenants who maintained a ferocious sense of justice and duty to his calling. Nothing icy or aloof about Sirico’s Paulie in comparison to Sorvino’s. If anything linked them both, it was a rough-hewn charm that almost – one stresses “almost” – made them lovable.\n\nLast (so far), but certainly not least was the passage of James Caan, whose name became a household word for playing the hot-tempered Sonny, eldest of the three star-crossed sons of Marlon Brando’s Don Vito Corleone in 1972’s “The Godfather.” Caan, who died July 6 at 82, had before “Godfather” been a promising young actor who’d distinguished himself in films by such directors as Howard Hawks and Robert Altman and as the doomed Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the 1971 TV movie, “Brian’s Song.”\n\nWhen Caan died, one couldn’t find a single obituary that didn’t place Sonny Corleone front-and-center among the actor’s body of work. I guess that’s as it should have been, given its impact on Caan’s career. But I also think it’s kind of an irony since, in many ways, Sonny was among the least interesting or multi-dimensional of Caan’s roles. Given how things turned out over time for Sonny’s brothers Michael (Al Pacino) and Fredo (John Cazale), he wasn’t even the most interesting Corleone.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn fact, among the criminals Caan played, the cooler, tougher and, thus, most intriguing was in Michael Mann’s 1981 heist thriller, “Thief,” in which Caan’s Frank was a veteran safecracker and ex-convict who conveyed both a serene confidence in his abilities and a touchy guardedness that sheathed his personality like a force field. I don’t remember his Frank saying, “Don’t mess with me, or else,” at any time in the movie because he didn’t have to.\n\nNow that is what it really means to be a “bad” man – in the best sense.", "authors": ["Gene Seymour"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/oscars/2020/02/09/oscars-2020-brad-pitts-impeachment-comment-explained-very-serious/4710474002/", "title": "Oscars 2020: Brad Pitt's Trump impeachment comment explained", "text": "LOS ANGELES – Brad Pitt has been the picture of appreciation and wisecracks during his many award season speeches.\n\nBut at the Oscars, Pitt surprisingly veered into politics during his best supporting actor acceptance speech for \"Once Upon a Time In Hollywood.\"\n\n\"They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week,\" said Pitt, referencing the former national security adviser who was not allowed to testify by the Senate during the proceedings that acquitted President Donald Trump.\n\nPitt, 56, joked that his \"Hollywood\" director Quentin Tarantino might do a feature on the controversial hearings.\n\nNeed a break?

South Korean director Bong Joon-ho said in his speech that once viewers get over the \"barrier\" of subtitles, \"you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\"\n\n\"Chernobyl\" won a pair of Globes, best limited series and supporting actor for Stellan Skarsgard. Among the limited series categories, \"Fosse/Verdon\" star Michelle Williams won lead actress while Russell Crowe received lead actor honors for \"The Loudest Voice.\" Patricia Arquette won for TV supporting actress for \"The Act,\" and \"Ramy\" star Ramy Youssef was a big surprise for lead actor in a comedy.\n\n\"I know you guys haven't seen my show,\" the self-deprecating Youssef said. \"My mom also was rooting for Michael Douglas.\"\n\nCharlize Theron presented Tom Hanks with the Cecil B.

Profiles will continue each day through March, which is National Women's History Month.\n\nThe lives and work of these women span more than two centuries and represent a wide range of achievements and occupations.\n\nSome of them are well known, such as Abigail Scott Duniway, who fought for women's suffrage and published a weekly newspaper in Portland.\n\nOthers are more obscure, such as Fern Hobbs, the personal secretary to Gov. Oswald West who was sent to decree martial law in the rowdy mining town of Copperfield.\n\nTheir contributions have been diverse and historic:\n\nThe first female doctor in the West: Bethenia Owens-Adair.\n\nThe first U.S. congresswoman from Oregon: Nan Wood Honeyman.\n\nThe first female steamboat captain West of the Mississippi: Minnie Hill.\n\nThe first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics: Thelma Payne.\n\nThe first female police officer in the United States: Lola Greene Baldwin.\n\nMany of these women overcame obstacles to make a difference and secure their place in Oregon herstory. They helped make this state what it is today.\n\nTabitha Moffat Brown\n\nBorn: May 1, 1780, in Brimfield, Mass.\n\nDied: May 4, 1858, in Salem. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery.\n\nFacts: Brown was a social reformer and educator who traveled the Oregon Trail and assisted in the founding of Tualatin Academy, which became Pacific University in Forest Grove. She turned to teaching to support four children after her husband, a minister, died. She was 66 when she crossed the plains in 1846 with her son and suffered much hardship. At one point on the journey, she was left alone on the trail in the bitter cold with her ailing 77-year-old brother-in-law. She pulled them through, despite being near starvation. Once in Oregon, she traveled between Oregon City and her daughter's home in Salem, and eventually settled in Forest Grove. Her first job was sewing gloves to sell. She later helped start a home and school for orphan children and became affectionately known as \"Grandma Brown.\" The log church she used for the school was officially established as Tualatin Academy in 1848, and the following year became what is now Pacific University.\n\nNotable: Honored in 1987 by the Oregon Legislature as the \"Mother of Oregon.\"\n\nQuotable: \"I rode through (the Umpqua Mountains) in three days at the risk of my life, on horseback, having lost my wagon and all that I had but the horse I was on.\"\n\nSOURCES: Pacific University, Salem Online History, RootsWeb.com, The Brown Family History II\n\nAbigail Scott Duniway\n\nBorn: Oct. 22, 1834, near Groveland, Ill.\n\nDied: Oct. 11, 1915. She is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: Duniway was a novelist, newspaper publisher, teacher, pioneer, milliner and suffragist. She came to Oregon in 1852 and wrote a novel based on the overland experience. Her mother and brother died during the grueling trek. Her family settled near Lafayette, where she began a career as a schoolteacher. She married Benjamin Duniway, and they had four children spaced less than two years apart. She endured the loss of their Yamhill County farm because of her husband's faulty business decisions. Later, he became an invalid. In order to support the family, she returned to teaching as well as running a hat shop in Albany. Her experiences convinced her that women needed the right to vote. She campaigned for suffrage throughout the Northwest, and in 1871, started a newspaper in Portland called The New Northwest. She masterminded the suffrage campaigns in Idaho and Washington, but her efforts to win the right to vote in her home state proved more demanding. From 1884 to 1910, Oregon's male voters defeated suffrage five times at the polls. Finally, in 1912, the initiative passed. She was the first woman to register to vote in Multnomah County.\n\nNotable: Duniway was the first woman to speak before the Oregon Legislature and the state's first woman publisher.\n\nQuotable: \"The young women of today, free to study, to speak, to write, to choose their occupation, should remember that every inch of this freedom was bought for them at a great price. It is for them to show their gratitude by helping onward the reforms of their own times, by spreading the light of freedom and of truth still wider.

She is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Warrenton.\n\nFacts: A physician, teacher, feminist and social reformer, she was the first woman west of the Mississippi to hold a medical degree. Her family crossed the Oregon Trail in 1843, and she did not begin her formal education until she was 12. She was married at 14 to one of her father's farm hands but divorced her abusive husband by 16. She turned to millinery to earn her living and raise her son, George, who also became a doctor. Her business was successful, but after six years she decided to pursue a career in medicine. She attended an eclectic school in Philadelphia and then University of Michigan Medical School, finishing her degree in 1880, at age 40. She returned to Portland the following year and became the first woman to practice in Oregon. She married Col. John Adair in 1884, and the couple moved to Astoria, where she continued to practice medicine and help with the family farm.\n\nNotable: She thought insanity and criminal action were hereditary and argued for mandatory sterilization of the criminally insane. Her famous work on the subject, \"Human Sterilization: Its Social and Legislative Aspects,\" was published in 1922. Three years later, the sterilization statute was adopted as state law in Oregon.\n\nQuotable: She was not afraid to drive great distances alone in her carriage to reach a patient. \"At no time did I ever refuse a call, day or night, rain or shine.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Findagrave.com, Dameron-Damron family newsletter\n\nLola Greene Baldwin\n\nBorn: 1860\n\nDied: June 22, 1957. Buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: On April 1, 1908, she was sworn in as the first female police officer in the United States. Her primary mission was to protect young women from prostitution. She began this type of work in 1905 as an employee of Portland's branch of the Traveler's Aid organization during the Lewis and Clark Exposition. The goal of the organization was to encourage women who flocked to the city to avoid the pitfalls of prostitution. Her unit with the Portland Police Bureau, the Women's Protection Division, made a priority of protecting women from the effects of vice, rather than punishing them for it. She reportedly maintained an office away from the police department and declined to work in uniform. She also was involved in organizing a juvenile court in Portland. On May 1, 1922, she resigned her commission after influencing local, regional and national women's policing activities for 17 years, 14 of them as a paid municipal officer.\n\nNotable: To learn about Baldwin, read \"A Municipal Mother,\" by Gloria E. Myers. A Portland-based foundation that helps women who are recovering from prostitution is named in her honor.\n\nQuotable: Baldwin's goal was \"to make the path safe for the feet of the girl who desired to lead a clean, honest, useful life.\"\n\nSources: Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation, \"A Municipal Mother\"\n\nMercedes Deiz\n\nBorn: 1917\n\nDied: Oct. 5, 2005, in Portland\n\nFacts: She became the first black female lawyer in Oregon when she was admitted to the bar in 1960. She attended Northwestern School of Law at night while married and raising three children and working as a legal assistant. She finished fourth in her class and years later credited her husband with taking a large part in raising their children. \"I am not a dependent woman,\" she said. \"But I could not have done the things I did without Carl.\" In November 1969, then-Gov. Tom McCall appointed her as a district court judge, making her the first woman of color to become a judge in Oregon. The following May, in the primary, Multnomah County voters elected her to the post outright and she became the first black woman to be elected to the bench in Oregon. Oregon Women Lawyers give an annual award in her name to someone who makes an outstanding contribution to promoting women and minorities in the legal profession and in the community.\n\nNotable: In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of her admission to the bar, she was recognized with the Award of Merit, the Oregon State Bar's highest honor.\n\nQuotable: \"Black has nothing to do with the color of the skin; it's a question of ethnicity. You are your race. A person has roots to whatever he or she comes from in one's ancestry. And I am a black lady.\"\n\nSources: Oregon State Bar Bulletin, Oregon Women Lawyers\n\nAnna Hayward Duerksen\n\nBorn: May 6, 1886.\n\nDied: July 27, 1972. Buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Duerksen was one of the founders of Deaconess Hospital, a predecessor of Salem Hospital. A group of Mennonites came to Salem in 1916 and opened a 12-bed hospital in an old hotel on Winter Street. Sister Anna, a graduate of Evangelical Deaconess Hospital School of Nursing in St. Louis, Mo., was one of four Mennonite sisters on the Board of Trustees. The sisters worked 20-hour days and received no salary until Social Security was launched in 1935. To them, it was a calling, not a job. Duerksen served as the hospital's only anesthetist. She lived in the basement and not only cared for patients, but cooked and did housekeeping. She married the hospital's gardener and worked at the hospital into the 1950s. In 1947, the Mennonites turned the hospital over to a board of Salem citizens, and the name was changed to Salem Memorial Hospital. It merged in 1969 with Salem General Hospital to create the hospital that exists today.\n\nNotable: In 1957, Duerksen was recognized by the Oregon Nurses Association with a life membership for her long leadership in providing health care.\n\nQuotable: Her legacy is well-documented in the annals of Salem Hospital. Ted Stang, a longtime local hospital administrator, met Duerksen after he came to Salem in 1968. She was in her 80s. He also heard many stories from the grandson of Deaconess Hospital's first administrator. \"She was diminutive, quiet, unassuming,\" Stang said. \"But boy, was she a powerhouse. People listened to what Sister Anna had to say, even though she was not the administrator. Sister Anna carried a lot of weight at that institution.\"\n\nSources: Salem History Online, Oregon Statesman, Salem Hospital\n\nSarah Winnemucca\n\nBorn: About 1844\n\nDied: Oct. 17, 1891\n\nFacts: Historians have referred to Winnemucca as the most famous Native American woman on the Pacific Coast. She used her language skills to try to be a peacemaker and was the first Native American woman to publish in English. Her book, \"Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims,\" is an autobiographical account of her people and their contact with explorers and settlers. She was born and raised in Nevada but spent much of her life in southeastern Oregon as an interpreter for an agent at Malheur Reservation and as a scout and mediator for the Army during the Bannock War. She learned to read and write when her grandfather placed her in the home of a white family in Nevada. By the time she was 14, she could speak three Indian dialects, English and Spanish. She married at least twice, to an Army lieutenant and then an Indian Department employee. After the Bannock War, she received national attention by campaigning for Native American education programs and reservation reform — making more than 400 speeches. She even pleaded her cause to President Rutherford B. Hayes in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly received promises that were later broken. Winnemucca also opened and ran the first school in the West where Native American children could remain with their families and were not forced to stop speaking their native language.\n\nNotable: On March 9, 2005, a bronze statue of her representing Nevada was unveiled in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. A town in Nevada carries her family name.\n\nQuotable: \"I would place all the Indians of Nevada on ships in our harbor, take them to New York and land them there as immigrants, that they might be received with open arms ...\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Wikipedia, \"Native Peoples\"\n\nChloe Clarke Willson\n\nBorn: April 16, 1818, in Connecticut.\n\nDied: July 2, 1874. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Willson was the first teacher at the Oregon Institute, which was founded by Methodist missionaries and later became Willamette University. She devoted her life to bringing religion and education to Oregon, and particularly to educating the young women of Salem. She traveled with about 50 new missionary recruits to the Oregon Territory in 1839. The following year, at a new mission outpost in the Puget Sound, she met her husband, William H. Willson. In 1844, the couple was asked to move to the settlement called Chemeketa Plains, which would become Salem. Chloe had been chosen to open the Oregon Institute.\n\nShe was both teacher and housemother for five primary-grade students and remained the only teacher the first two years. The board of the institute chartered \"Wallamet University\" in 1853 and began offering higher education. Chloe left Salem for a time after her husband died, but she returned in 1863 to serve as Governess of the Ladies Department at Willamette University, the equivalent of Dean of Women.\n\nNotable: Her husband is remembered as the founder of Salem because he filed the first plat of the city and held the original title to the land that now comprises Willamette University, the state Capitol and downtown Salem. Their name lives on today in Willson Park, directly west of the Capitol.\n\nQuotable: \"I feel the weight of responsibility which rests upon me in giving character to this infant institution,\" she wrote on Aug. 13, 1844, the first day of classes at the Oregon Institute. \"O my Father ... thou seest the desire of my heart for the prosperity of this institution, but without thy blessing it can never prosper.\"\n\nSources: Salem Online History, \"Journals of Brewer and Clarke\"\n\nHallie Parrish Hinges\n\nBorn: Jan. 30, 1868.\n\nDied: Jan. 25, 1950. She is buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Hinges was a vocal performer in Oregon for nearly 60 years, most famous for her performance during President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Salem on May 21, 1903. Roosevelt called her the \"Oregon Nightingale\" when he heard her sing, and the nickname stuck. She studied music at Willamette University, graduating from the Willamette Conservatory when she was 18. She also studied in New York for a year. Music always was a big part of her life. She performed at her first public concert when she was 6, in the basement of First Methodist Church. Her audiences later expanded to political dignitaries. In 1891, she sang for President Benjamin Harrison, and in 1900, she performed for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. But her biggest moment came when Roosevelt visited Salem. Thousands gathered at Willson Park to see the president. Before he spoke, the 35-year-old soprano sang the national anthem. Roosevelt told Gov. George Chamberlain that Hinges had one of the most beautiful voices he had ever heard and asked if she would sing again. Hinges responded with a favorite of the time, \"The Flag Without a Stain,\" and witnesses claimed that the president wiped tears from his eyes.\n\nQuotable: \"Truly, she is the Oregon Nightingale,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nNotable: Hinges' grandfather was Methodist missionary Josiah L. Parrish, whom Parrish Middle School is named after.\n\nSource: The Statesman Journal, Salem Online History, \"Marion County History,\" Volume XV\n\nThelma Payne Sanborn\n\nBorn: July 18, 1896, in Silverton\n\nDied: Sept. 7, 1988, in Los Angeles\n\nFacts: She was the first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics and the first to win a medal. She won the bronze in the 3-meter springboard diving competition at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. swept the medals in that event, with Payne missing silver by seven-tenths of a point. She was the U.S. women's springboard champion in 1918, 1919 and 1920, and trained at Multnomah Athletic Club in Portland. She reportedly incorporated ballet into her training regimen. After competing in the Olympics, she was a longtime swimming and diving coach at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. She taught the children of several famous people to swim, including John Wayne and Bing Crosby. Payne was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of fame in 1983, among one of the early classes that included Bobby Doerr, Mel Renfro and Steve Prefontaine.\n\nNotable: Sanborn said in a 1987 interview that she was one of the models for the red-suited diving girl introduced by Jantzen in 1920 and later plastered on billboards.\n\nQuotable: \"In those days, we had nothing to go by. We had to actually see someone perform a dive and then try to do it ourselves. It was the only way.\"\n\nSources: Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, The Associated Press, Oregon Sports Hall of Fame\n\nCornelia Marvin Pierce\n\nBorn: Dec. 26, 1873, in Monticello, Iowa\n\nDied: Feb. 12, 1957\n\nFacts: Marvin was the leader of the Oregon State Library for 24 years, almost singlehandedly building one of the finest state library systems in the nation. She came to Oregon in 1905 for the position of secretary of the Oregon Library Commission, which later became the State Library. She instituted many innovative programs, including the first books-by-mail service in the country. In a day when many Oregonians lived isolated lives without telephones, newspapers and other regular sources of information, her innovation was a lifeline for thousands of rural Oregonians, particularly women. She resigned as State Librarian in 1928 to marry Gov. Walter M. Pierce. He was elected in 1932 to Congress, and she became his secretary, researcher and speech writer. Their political partnership was one he readily recognized, often reminding his constituents that they had two representatives for the price of one.\n\nQuotable: \"The only thing I have ever done to make the world a better place to live is to promote libraries.\"\n\nNotable: At the end of her life, she bequeathed most of her estate to Reed College, a private Portland liberal-arts school. The $300,000 gift still supports a Cornelia Marvin Pierce chairmanship in American history at Reed.\n\nSources: \"Cornelia Marvin Pierce: Pioneer in Library Extension,\" \"Library Trends,\" Oregon State Library\n\nMaurine Brown Neuberger\n\nBorn: Jan. 9, 1907, in Cloverdale, Tillamook County.\n\nDied: Feb. 22, 2000, in Portland.\n\nFacts: She remains the first and only woman from Oregon to serve in the U.S. Senate. She and her husband, Richard, were known as a political team. They gained notice in 1951 as the first married couple in the nation to serve together in a legislature — he in the Oregon Senate and she in the House. He won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1954, and she served as his aide. When he died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1960, she won a special election to fill the vacancy and then the general election to serve the next term. She focused on environmental and health issues, including sponsorship of one of the first bills to require warning labels on cigarette packaging. Back home, she took on Oregon's then-powerful dairy industry about a law forbidding the sale of yellow margarine. She donned a striped apron, pulled out a mixing bowl and showed her colleagues in the House — all men — just how much work it took to mix food coloring into the lard-white butter substitute. The ban was lifted, and her demonstration became part of the state's political lore.\n\nQuotable: \"Before she puts her name on the ballot, she encounters prejudice and people saying, 'A women's place is in the home.' She has to walk a very tight wire in conducting her campaign. She can't be too pussyfooting or mousy. Also, she can't go to the other extreme — belligerent, coarse, nasty.\"\n\nNotable: After serving in the U.S. Senate, she taught at Boston University and Radcliffe and was part of the social and academic circle surrounding the Kennedy family.\n\nSources: Oregon History Project, Harvard Square Library\n\nMercedes Bates\n\nBorn: 1916\n\nDied: Aug. 16, 1997, in Minneapolis\n\nFacts: Bates is one of the most important women to graduate from Oregon State University. She is credited with helping make Betty Crocker a household name. She was a vice president of the General Mills food company, in charge of the Betty Crocker division. The fictional character was created in 1921 and evolved into an American cultural icon under Bates' direction. After graduating from Oregon State in 1936 with a degree in food and nutrition, Bates began working at the Southern California Gas Co. and became supervisor of home service. She then moved to the Globe Mills food company before opening her own business in Hollywood as an advertising food consultant. She later joined the staff of McCall's magazine as food editor before moving to General Mills in 1964 as director of the Betty Crocker kitchens. Two years later, she rose through the ranks to become vice president and the first female corporate officer of General Mills. She held that title until retiring in 1983.\n\nNotable: She donated $3 million to Oregon State in the early 1990s, helping establish a nationally renowned Bates Family Study Center on campus. At that time, it was the largest one-time donation ever made to OSU. The facility opened in 1992 and was the first of its kind in the United States. It houses programs of research, instruction and outreach designed to benefit individuals and families.\n\nSources: Oregon State University, OSU Alumni Association\n\nNan Wood Honeyman\n\nBorn: July 15, 1881.\n\nDied: Dec. 10, 1970. She is interred at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: Honeyman was the first woman elected to the U.S. Congress from Oregon in 1937. She married David Honeyman in 1908, raised three children and was active in civic and humanitarian organizations before becoming involved in politics. She served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933, which ratified the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, repealing prohibition. She was a state representative from 1935 to 1937 before being elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Congress. Her bids for re-election in 1938 and election in 1940 failed. While working in the Pacific Coast office of the U.S. Price Administration, the Multnomah County commissioners appointed Honeyman to the Oregon Senate in 1941 to fill a vacancy, and she served until her resignation in 1942. She was U.S. collector of customs in Portland from 1942 to 1953.\n\nNotable: After graduating in 1898 from St. Helens Hall (later incorporated in the Oregon Episcopal School), she continued her education at the Finch School in New York City, where she began a lifelong friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nCarolyn Shelton\n\nBorn: Around 1877.\n\nDied: Unknown.\n\nFacts: Shelton was governor for a day in 1909, according to the Capital Journal. The newspaper ran a banner headline proclaiming her head of state Feb. 27, 1909, following the resignation of Gov. George E. Chamberlain and the delay in swearing in Secretary of State Frank W. Benson, the next in line. Chamberlain resigned his seat after being elected to the U.S. Senate. In a hurry to get to Washington, D.C., he left his resignation with his private secretary, Shelton, about 9 a.m. that Saturday. The papers weren't to be filed until 4 p.m. Monday, and Benson couldn't be sworn in right away, so there effectively was no governor except Shelton. The Capital Journal pronounced her \"the first woman to govern any state.\" The newspaper reported Sunday that Benson assumed control at 10:10 a.m. Nowhere in state records is Shelton mentioned as governor. Barbara Roberts officially would become the first female governor of Oregon when she was elected and served from 1991 to 1995.\n\nQuotable: \"I want to fill the governor's shoes, and he really has a small foot,\" Shelton was quoted as saying in the Capital Journal. \"I fear the principal trouble will be in trying to fill his hat.\"\n\nNotable: \"Time\" magazine reported July 26, 1926, that Chamberlain, 72, married Carolyn B.

The Native American woman, who married a white settler named Frank Riddle, was rewarded a government pension of $25 per month for helping save lives during the Modoc War of 1872-73. She and her husband acted as interpreters, messengers and mediators between her people and the U.S. Army. She is perhaps best known for having warned Gen. Edward Canby about the Modoc plot to kill him during peace negotiations. The general ignored the advice and was killed April 11, 1873. On the same day, Winema was credited for saving the life of Alfred Meacham, a Methodist minister and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon. Meacham was wounded and about to be scalped when Winema yelled that the soldiers were coming, sending the Modoc warriors running. Meacham was the one who pressed Congress to give her a pension, which she received until she died.\n\nNotable: The Winema National Forest in Southern Oregon was established in 1961 and named after her.\n\nSources: Trover Studio collection, courtesy of the Oregon State Library\n\nElizabeth Lord and Edith Schryver\n\nElizabeth Lord\n\nBorn: Nov. 12, 1887, in Salem.\n\nDied: Oct. 9, 1976.

Schryver grew up in New York and attended the Lowthrope School of Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts, where Lord also studied. A few years after Schryver graduated, she set sail for a garden tour of Europe, where she met Lord. The friends traveled and studied together for several months and then Lord brought Schryver to Salem. Two of their most notable imprints on Salem are the gardens at Historic Deepwood Estate and Bush's Pasture Park.\n\nQuotable: \"We were free-swinging career girls, and nobody ever questioned us,\" Schryver told the Statesman Journal in 1980.\n\nNotable: The Lord & Schryver Conservancy works to preserve and interpret the legacy of the two women.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Lord & Schryver Conservancy\n\nMinnie Hill\n\nBorn: 1863 in Albany.\n\nDied: January 1946 in San Francisco.\n\nFacts: Hill was the first female steamboat captain west of the Mississippi. On Dec. 1, 1886, at age 23, she was granted a master's and pilot's license. She had been working with her husband, Charles O. Hill, on various boats for several years and became \"thoroughly conversant with the steamboat business,\" according to \"Lewis & Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest.\" When Charles and Minnie bought the 112-foot Governor Newell in 1889, Charles went down into the engine room while Minnie took the pilothouse wheel. They specialized in moving scows laden with jetty stone from a quarry east of Vancouver, Wash., downstream to meet a U.S. Army Engineer tow boat, which took the loads to Astoria. The stone was used to build the south jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Minnie was a captain for 14 years. At least two movie producers supposedly tried to get her to consent to filming her life story, but she refused.\n\nNotable: She reportedly was the only woman on the Pacific Coast licensed to command a steamer until 1907, when a second-class master's and pilot's license was granted to a woman in the Puget Sound area.\n\nQuotable: Her son, Herbert W.

She was editor of The Advocate, an African-American newspaper published in Portland between 1903 and 1936, regularly challenging racial discrimination and becoming the unofficial spokeswoman for the city's small black community. She helped found the Portland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, known as the NAACP, and craft the state's first civil-rights legislation, which would have mandated full access to public accommodations without regard to race. Although that piece of legislation failed, in 1925 she worked on the successful campaign to repeal Oregon's notorious exclusion laws, which prohibited African Americans from settling in the state.\n\nQuotable: \"Not even the pulpit has been as effective for the advancement of our group, and for justice, as the press.\"\n\nNotable: She ran for state representative in May 1932 but was not elected. She later moved to Los Angeles and entered the real estate brokerage business.\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Stanford University's Women's Legal History Web site, Association for African American Historical Research and Preservation\n\nEdith Green\n\nBorn: Jan. 17, 1910, in Trent, S.D.\n\nDied: April 21, 1987, in Portland. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Corbett.\n\nFacts: Green was a Democrat in the United States Congress who helped push through legislation that led to Title IX. A former school teacher, radio commentator and lobbyist, she became an important figure in Oregon politics when she was elected to Congress in 1955. She served 10 terms and focused on women's issues, education and social reforms. In her first term, she proposed the Equal Pay Act to ensure that men and women were paid equally for equal work. The bill was signed into law eight years later. She is most noted for her work developing the legislation that was to become Title IX, which prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. She introduced a higher-education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on that bill, together with significant input from Rep. Patsy Mink and Sen. Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of Title IX in 1972.\n\nQuotable: Sen. Mark Hatfield called Green \"the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress.\"\n\nNotable: Linfield College annually presents the Edith Green Distinguished Professor award to a faculty member who has demonstrated outstanding performance in teaching and related faculty roles.

Among the 6,000 or so students who sat in her classes were current teachers and politicians, including retired U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield. She was a strong role model for a generation of up-and-coming women including Norma Paulus, who praised Eyre's work for equal rights for women, open government meetings and the preservation of historic buildings. Eyre came to Salem in 1904, when she was 6. She graduated from Willamette University in 1918 and began her teaching career in Salem in 1922. She taught history and government, economics and sociology, retiring in 1962. In addition to her contributions as an educator, she was involved in local government. She was a precinct committee member and president of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for the state Senate in 1962.\n\nQuotable: She said she ran for the legislative office because she \"wanted to try out some of the things I had been teaching over the years.\"\n\nNotable: The Salem-Keizer School District named an elementary school in her honor in 1977. Mary Eyre Elementary is in Southeast Salem.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Salem Online History\n\nFern Hobbs\n\nBorn: May 8, 1883\n\nDied: April 10, 1964\n\nFacts: Hobbs was sent by Gov. Oswald West in January 1914 to declare martial law in Copperfield, perhaps Oregon's most notorious \"bad\" town. Copperfield was established in 1908 to house the mining and railroad crews working at Snake River. It had three saloons, including one owned by the mayor and another by a city councilman, and a population of 84 when Hobbs was dispatched. West had vowed personally to clean up the vice-ridden town but was warned that he would be shot if he tried, so he sent his private secretary. Described as a diminutive woman — 5-foot-3 and less than 100 pounds — Hobbs arrived with a small National Guard contingent and read the governor's orders to close the saloons and resign from city council. The orders were refused, Hobbs left town that afternoon and the National Guard placed the town under martial law. More troops eventually arrived and confiscated liquor and gambling devices. The town, about 75 miles northeast of Baker City, later was destroyed by fire and today is known as Oxbow.\n\nSources: Oregon State Archives, The Oregon Journal, The Oregon Statesman\n\nMarie Dorion\n\nBorn: Unknown\n\nDied: Sept. 5, 1850. She was reportedly buried at St. Louis Catholic Church in Gervais.\n\nFacts: She was the only woman among the overland expedition financed by John Jacob Astor in 1811-12 to establish a fur-trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River. The courageous Native American accompanied her husband and two small children on the journey. Like her predecessor on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacagawea, Dorion earned respect from the men. She never complained about the hardships along the journey and kept pace despite caring for two children and giving birth to a third. The epitome of Dorion's courage was noted after the expedition had reached what would later be named Astoria. She and her family returned with a trapping party to the Snake River, where Indians attacked and killed all but her and her two sons. They escaped by hiding in the brush. In the wake of the tragedy, including the death of her husband, she and the boys survived more than 50 days in the bitter cold of the Blue Mountains.\n\nQuotable: Roger Howard, who lives near the church in Gervais, on the legend of Marie Dorion: \"She should be as famous as Sacagawea.\"\n\nSource: Statesman Journal\n\nBetty Roberts\n\nBorn: Feb. 5, 1923.\n\nNow: June 25, 2011.\n\nFacts: Roberts was the first woman appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals (1977) and the first woman appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court (1982). She was married and raising four children in the 1950s, when she signed up for college courses and graduated from Portland State University in 1958. She taught high school and by 1962 had a master's degree in political science from the University of Oregon. She then enrolled in the night program at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College, continued to teach and was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. She graduated from law school in 1966, the same year one daughter graduated from Stanford University and a son from high school. She married a lawyer and legislative colleague two years later, and they established a successful legal practice. She then became the lone woman in the Oregon Senate and in 1974, ran a strong statewide campaign for governor but was narrowly defeated in the primary. The Democratic Party named her to fill a vacancy on the ballot for the general election against U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, and again she was narrowly defeated. The Oregon Women's Political Caucus named her the 1975 \"Woman of the Year\" for setting a precedent for other women to run for statewide office.\n\nNotable: She helped found Women's Investment Network-PAC to recruit and support women to run for the Legislature and Oregon Women Lawyers to promote women and minorities in the profession.

She was active in her neighborhood association and the local transit district board before running for office. She defeated two sitting city councilors (one man and one woman) in the primary and then went on to serve three terms. Being the first female mayor didn't seem like a big deal at the time, perhaps because Norma Paulus had laid the groundwork for women to become political leaders in Salem. Paulus served in the Oregon Legislature before becoming the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. \"If Norma hadn't been so successful,\" Miller said, \"it would have been a lot harder. She had kind of tilled that ground for others to follow, and I've always thanked her for that.\" As mayor, Miller was most noted for her work in helping the city purchase 22 acres of waterfront property on the Willamette River, which today is Riverfront Park.\n\nQuotable: \"It was an amazing privilege to be mayor of Salem. I will always be indebted to the people who allowed me to do that.\"\n\nNotable: She helped start Abiqua School, a private Salem elementary school that opened in 1993.\n\nSources: Sue Miller, Salem Online History\n\nMaj.

A native Oregonian, she was among the first women to enlist in the military in 1942, in what was called the Women's Army Corps (WAC). She started as an Army truck driver but soon became an officer. She spent most of World War II training thousands of WACs. She left active duty after the war and went to Lewis & Clark College in her hometown of Portland. She then returned to active duty and joined the Air Force. She was the war plans officer at one of the major bases in Europe during the Berlin Airlift and began her rise through the ranks. She was Director of Women in the Air Force from 1965 to 1973. She was promoted to brigadier general in 1971, the first woman to be appointed to that grade in the Air Force. Two years later, she became the first woman in any branch of service to reach the rank of major general, or two-star general. She retired in 1975 after a 33-year career in the Air Force and went on to serve as Special Assistant on women's issues for President Gerald Ford. She also held positions during the Carter and Reagan administrations and is recognized as a driving force behind women achieving opportunities and equal rights in the military.\n\nNotable: Holm authored three books.\n\nQuotable: \"There was an enormous desire to be part of the war effort.

She served two terms and instituted the first vote-by-mail system in the nation. Her three decades as an elected official began in 1970, when she served in the Oregon Legislature. She sponsored environmental legislation, civil rights and ethical changes. She was the Republican candidate for governor in 1986, but lost in a closely-contested race to Neil Goldschmidt. Four years later, Paulus was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction and led a comprehensive restructuring of the state's public school system. She spearheaded work to set rigorous academic standards for all students and to increase accountability with state testing standards. In 1996, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley named her to the National Assessment Governing Board. A New York Times profile described Paulus' work in Oregon as the most cutting-edge school reform in the country.\n\nQuotable: \"I know I have made government more accountable. It's been a really rewarding experience to be involved in Oregon's state government because in our state, one person can still make a difference.\"\n\nNotable: Paulus never went to college. She was admitted to Willamette Law School in 1956, based on her test scores and the personal recommendation of State Supreme Court Justice Earl C. Latourette. She was his private secretary, and he encouraged her to apply.

The descendant of Oregon Trail pioneers and a fourth-generation Oregonian, she began her career in public service as an advocate for the educational rights of her autistic son. Her efforts resulted in one of the nation's first special-education laws and propelled her rise in politics to the governorship. She served on the Parkrose School Board, the Mt. Hood Community College Board and the Multnomah County Commission before her election to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1981. During her second term, she became Oregon's first woman House majority leader. In 1984, she was elected secretary of state, the first Democrat elected to that post in more than 100 years. She was re-elected in 1988. She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for governor in 1990, and was elected to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. During her four-year term, Roberts was recognized as an advocate for public education, human rights and services, environmental management and streamlining state government.\n\nQuotable: \"You are looking at a woman who raised two children - one of them autistic - by herself. You are looking at a person who struggled for years to make ends meet. You are looking at a part-time student still working and committed to earning my college degree.

Her first climbing lesson was on a 50-foot Douglas fir on the Corvallis campus, and she was hooked. She tackled rocks first, then mountains. She was part of the first successful women's ascent of Ama Dablam in 1983. From the summit, she could see the rising crest of Everest and set her sights on the world's tallest mountain. Her first attempt was unsuccessful because of a snowstorm that left the climbing party trapped in a snow cave for five days. But the following year, in 1988, she was triumphant. On Sept. 29, at the age of 29, after 29 days on the mountain, she made history by becoming the first American woman to stand on top of the 29,035-foot mountain. She went on to lead a successful expedition in 1993 at K2, the world's second tallest mountain.\n\nQuotable: \"Climbing has inspired me, shaped my life, and changed it.

He could quote every episode of “The Flash,” idolized the superhero Green Arrow and often sported a Naruto-inspired headband he insisted helped him run faster in track meets. He looked forward all year to a trip his family and friends planned for the Dream Con comic book convention the following summer.\n\nThree months into the school year, just before Thanksgiving, the 17-year-old died by suicide. His parents were shocked, grieving and baffled. James, who lived in Streetsboro, Ohio, had not struggled with mental health, they said.\n\nWhen police looked through James’ phone, they discovered he had fallen victim to financial sextortion, a crime that occurs when a predator threatens to distribute private material or harm a victim if they don’t comply with the predator's financial demands. The scam is the fastest-growing cybercrime targeting children in North America and most commonly exploits young men, particularly boys ages 13 to 17.\n\nSextortion has been connected to at least 30 deaths of teen boys by suicide since 2021, according to a tally of private cases and the latest FBI numbers from cybersecurity experts.\n\nIn more than a dozen interviews, male sextortion victims and the parents of teenage boys who died by suicide described how predators established a false sense of trust before blackmailing their victims. All of the parents USA TODAY spoke with said their teens died by suicide within 24 hours of being threatened − though the window was often shorter.\n\nJames’ predators falsely told him he would face jail time for sending nude photographs, that his parents would stop loving him, and that he would never be able to run track again or go to college. In the next 19 hours, they would send James more than 200 messages, a technique predators use to instill a sense of urgency and prevent giving the victim time to think or reach out for help.\n\n“They eliminated his desire for a future,” says his mother, Tamia Woods. “I don't think that James knew he was a victim.”\n\n'Your pics are really cute haha'\n\nThe messages often begin innocuously and come from someone who appears to be a teenage girl.\n\n\"Hey, I found your page through suggested friends,\" a cybercriminal wrote in one exchange reviewed by USA TODAY. \"Your pics are really cute haha.\"\n\nPredators establish trust and quickly steer the conversation toward sexual topics or send unsolicited nudes. They typically move the conversation to a second app such as Snapchat, WhatsApp or private text message.\n\nThe blackmail starts minutes later. Predators isolate the teens by threatening to send their nude photos to their contacts or friends on social media if they don’t pay a sum of money − creating fear and humiliation and discouraging them from telling a trusted adult. The blackmailers also accuse teens of being criminals for exposing themselves and warn they will be put on sex offender lists.\n\nThe night of March 24, 2022, 17-year-old Jordan DeMay was at home in Marquette, Michigan, when he received an Instagram message from a pretty girl his age. She said she was from Texas but was going to school in Georgia. They shared a mutual friend, she wrote.\n\nThey exchanged intimate photos, and the conversation immediately changed.\n\nThe criminals behind the account threatened to release the images, demanding money. Jordan sent his predators the $300 he saved for a car payment. When he told the blackmailers he was suicidal after they asked for more money, they responded, “We’re going to watch you die a miserable death.”\n\nWhen he told them he was intent on killing himself, they replied: “Good. Do that fast, or I’ll make you do it. I swear to God.”\n\nAt 3:45 a.m., less than six hours after he received the initial message, Jordan died by suicide.\n\nThe teenage girl who messaged him was really a group of cybercriminals that included Samuel Ogoshi and Samson Ogoshi, Nigerian brothers who in September 2024 were sentenced to 17½ years in prison and extradited to the U.S. The group of predators targeted Jordan and more than 100 others, including at least 11 minors.\n\n'I am only 15. Why are you doing this to me?'\n\nThe day before 15-year-old Braden Markus received unsolicited sexual messages on Instagram, he was “literally on cloud nine” from his coach’s praise at their Friday and Saturday football games, recalls his mother, Jennifer Argiro-Markus. The teen from Columbus, Ohio, spent Saturday night playing XBox with his cousins and eating his favorite Japanese takeout.\n\nAt 11:01 on Sunday morning, a predator posing as a teenage girl contacted Braden and persuaded him to send nude images. He died by suicide less than 30 minutes later.\n\nIn the final five minutes of Braden’s life, he told the predator over and over: “I am only 15. Why are you doing this to me? I am only 15, you will ruin my life.”\n\nIn these moments, teens are often actually communicating with a group of three to four foreign cybercriminals who simultaneously contact the victim, handle a money transfer, and conduct research to find their family members, contacts and school.\n\nSouth Carolina state Rep. Brandon Guffey had never heard of sextortion before it happened to his 17-year-old son, Gavin, who died by suicide in July 2022. In the months after Gavin’s death, his sextortionist continued to reach out to family members from new accounts on Instagram.\n\nWhile Guffey and his wife were on a weekend trip to Myrtle Beach in August, trying to take a break to sort through their own trauma, Guffey got a message from the scammer: “Did I tell you your son begged for his life?”\n\nGuffey championed Gavin's Law in South Carolina. Passed in 2023, the legislation makes sextortion a felony offense and an aggravated felony if the victim is underage or a vulnerable adult or suffers bodily injury or death related to the crime. Local school districts are required to teach the law.\n\nFinancial sextortion is on the rise in the U.S.\n\nThe majority of sextortion attempts are traced to predators in West African countries including Nigeria and Ivory Coast and Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines, according to the FBI, which makes it challenging to track down criminals.\n\nIn 2022, the FBI issued a public safety alert about \"an explosion\" of sextortion schemes that targeted more than 3,000 minors that year. From 2021 to 2023, tips received by NCMEC’s CyberTipline increased by more than 300%. The recently tabulated 2024 numbers reached an all-time high, the organization says.\n\nThe rise in financial sextortion coincides with a youth mental health crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which left teenagers isolated. In 2021, suicide was the third-leading cause of death among 14- to 18-year-olds, according to the CDC. The same year, more than 42% of high school students reported experiencing persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness.\n\n'He was so afraid of the trauma of what would come'\n\nResearch shows that a variety of risk factors can increase the chance a child or teen may take their life. Mental health disorders including anxiety, depression and substance abuse are correlated with higher suicidal ideation. Environmental factors − such as access to firearms and drugs, or life events like experiencing a parent’s divorce − also affect suicide rates, in addition to historical factors such as family history of suicide, childhood trauma and generational trauma.\n\nBoys also die by suicide at three to four times the rate of girls.\n\nMary Rodee, whose son Riley Basford took his own life in 2021 six hours after he was sextorted, says her son had “a mom and dad who he knew would do anything for him.”\n\nRodee and other parents say their teens made “a permanent decision for a temporary problem.”\n\n“The thing that made Riley the life of the party is also that the thing that makes a 15-year-old do what Riley did,” says Rodee, of Canton, New York. “It's impulsivity, it's wanting to be liked and funny, and he was so afraid of the trauma of what would come.”\n\nTeenagers’ executive functioning, abstract thinking and decision-making skills continue to develop through age 25. Teens often focus more on the “here and now” than future orientation and are at higher risk for attention and hyperactivity problems, which can contribute to impulsive suicide attempts, according to Jill Harkavy-Friedman, senior vice president of research for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\n“That's part of what might lead teens to act more quickly on something, to not really weigh all the risks and jump right into something that seems appealing,” Harkavy-Friedman says.\n\nParents, experts have a message: Talk to your teens\n\nThe night before 16-year-old Carter Bremseth died by suicide after he was sextorted, he was volunteering as an altar server at church. He had downloaded Snapchat only six months earlier.\n\nHis mother, Jaime Bremseth, a licensed mental health counselor, had “lengthy conversations” with Carter about the harm of sending nudes, but she says adults are behind the curve on understanding social media and online platforms.\n\n“I really wonder if he felt like he was safer sending his picture out to somebody that wasn't really a real person in his life, or so he thought,” Bremseth says.\n\n“They just shamed him. They made him feel like he was a terrible person.”\n\nIn sextortion-related suicide cases, the short window of time between a predator’s initial contact with a victim and the teen’s death made it nearly impossible for parents to notice a change in their teen’s demeanor.\n\nThe timing, investigators say, is how predators succeed in extortion. They don't give their victims time to talk to anyone, to have a break without a barrage of messages, to look away. They bank on victims becoming consumed in the moment.\n\nCybersecurity experts and parents recommend having conversations about sextortion and internet safety early on, which can help build trust and confidence over time.\n\n“We can't bank on the hope that we will see something changing in them as a signal that they need help,” says Melissa Stroebel, vice president of research and insights at the technology nonprofit Thorn. Stroebel encourages parents to help their teens develop a “stop, drop and roll” plan.\n\n“Make sure that they've got that in their back pocket so they don't have to come up with a plan in the heat of the moment,\" Stroebel says.\n\nSextortion can happen to anyone: Here's what to do about it.\n\nExperts say telling teens to avoid social media platforms or not engage with strangers online is outdated advice given the sheer scale of the problem.\n\nThe narrative of how parents discuss nude imagery and exploitation has to evolve with the rise in new technology threats, says Lauren Coffren, executive director of the Exploited Children Division at at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC. The rise of generative artificial intelligence tools has enabled scammers to create highly realistic deepfake images and videos. In some cases, children and teens were blackmailed even when they didn’t send a nude image. Roughly 1 of 10 reports Thorn reviewed involved artificially generated content.\n\n“We've seen so much shaming of teen boys who may have shared imagery, and then it kind of gets flipped around, like, ‘Well, if you just don't share, you won't be in this circumstance,’” Coffren says. “I contend that's not really true anymore.”\n\nParents USA TODAY interviewed say it’s most important for teens to know there are open doors waiting for them, even if they make a mistake. Parents should create an amnesty policy that allows teens to turn to them for help in a dangerous situation, regardless of what happened, suggests Dr. Katie Hurley, senior director of clinical advising at The Jed Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on emotional health and suicide prevention for teens and young adults.\n\nUltimately, the most crucial message teens need to know is that the blackmailer is to blame − not them. Even if they regret their choice, it’s the predator who committed a crime. Victims experiencing sextortion should tell a trusted adult. Those in need of immediate mental health assistance can call or text the 988 suicide hotline.\n\n“You may feel humiliated, but life will go on,” says Jordan DeMay’s mother, Jennifer Butta. “It is so much better to seek out that help, because it's a situation that you're not prepared to handle on your own.\"\n\nExperts say parents and communities should work together to share information and talk openly about online safety. Hurley emphasized that it's not just parents who need to be ready to have these kinds of conversations. Teens often wind up confiding in another adult they trust.\n\nThat's the situation one 73-year-old Colorado grandmother found herself in last summer when her 17-year-old grandson told her he was being sextorted.\n\nShe encouraged him to tell his parents and coached him on what to say. When the teen realized his father was supportive, he “immediately relaxed,\" recalls Kathy, who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her grandson's privacy.\n\n“It's critical that (teens) have someone that they can trust and know that there won't be judgment,” Kathy says. “We need to attack this from all sides.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

For Nigerian Iyeneobong “Iyene” Essien, that moment came when she was just five years old. She remembers the day her dad took her to a golf course in Abuja, where she saw a boy teeing off. Intrigued by the sight, she asked her dad if she could pursue the sport.\n\n“(My father) was pretty surprised by my question,” she said. “He asked me if I really wanted to play this sport and I said, ‘yes,’ and he got me a coach and I started playing golf.”\n\nThe rest was history.\n\nEssien entered her first competition the same year and proved to be a natural, placing first in her age group. “I found that really cool,” she said.\n\nBy age 11, the golfer was representing Nigeria at international competitions across the US, UK, and Africa including Morocco, Botswana, and South Africa. Now 16, she is the No.1 ranked junior girls’ golfer in Nigeria and has won more than a dozen trophies after placing in various competitions.\n\nEssien represented Nigeria at the R&A Junior Open in Monifieth, Scotland. Imeh Okon\n\n“I’m really proud of representing my country because I’m making a name for myself and for my country,” she said.\n\nIn late July, Essien clinched second place in the Under 19 Girls division at the Champion of Champions World Championship in Northern Ireland. “It was a really good experience for me,” she said. Finishing five strokes behind first, Essein says she is proud of how she played.\n\n“Everything happens for a reason – even though you come second or third, it means that you’re getting closer and closer to first,” she said, noting the experience of playing on a world-renowned course was a win in itself. “The fact that I could play on the same course as Rory Mcllroy played on and be in the same vicinity of all that history was really very important to me.”\n\nRelated: Nigeria’s golden girl Tobi Amusan causes stir after world record win at World Athletics Championships\n\nAs she continues to make a name for herself and her country, Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari is taking notice. Following the tournament, the president’s adviser released a statement saying Buhari, “joins all Nigerians in celebrating this great teenager who is doing so much for the country.”\n\n“It was really unexpected, and I appreciate it,” Essien told CNN in response.\n\nFollowing her dreams\n\nTime and time again, Essien has proven she isn’t afraid of a challenge. While she often finds herself competing against older players, she says it actually “gives me even more motivation just to do better.”\n\nShe says her positivity and drive is inspired by one of her greatest role models, Tiger Woods.\n\n“He has shown a lot of resilience in the game,” she said, noting his efforts to push through a series of injuries and career setbacks. “He just keeps playing golf and he really loves the sport, even though he’s not winning.”\n\nAs we take a look at some of the most talented prodigies in the history of golf, where better to start than Tiger Woods: Six junior world championships to his name, the only player to win three US junior championships in a row, and a three-peat winner of the US amateur from 1994 to 1996. Woods turned pro in August 1996. Within a year, he'd scooped three PGA Tour events, become the youngest winner of The Masters at 21, and become the fastest player to reach No. 1 after turning professional, just 290 days into his pro career.

Cuban/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Following a series of wins in Canadian amateur events, Brooke Henderson became the youngest-ever winner of the KPMG Women's PGA Championship (at the Sahalee Country Club, pictured) when she won her first major aged 18 in 2016. Henderson has since racked up eight wins on the LPGA Tour, her most recent coming at the LA Open in April 2021.\n\nScott Halleran / Getty Images After becoming the youngest player to win the British Amateur Championship in 2009 (at Formby Golf Club, pictured) and make the cut at The Masters as a 16-year-old the following year, Italy's Matteo Manassero burst onto the pro scene, becoming the first teenager to win three times on the European Tour. Victories at the Castello Masters, Malaysian Open, and the BMW PGA Championship suggested the arrival of a new superstar, but Manassero has since endured a difficult spell. He hasn't won on the European Tour since 2013, though 7th and 8th Tour finishes already in 2022 have made for a solid start to the year for the Italian. Richard Heathcote / Getty Images The youngest-ever known winner of a professional golf tour event, 14-year-old Atthaya Thitikul made headlines around the world when she triumphed at the Ladies European Thailand Championship in 2017. A string of amateur titles followed before Thitikul turned pro in 2020, and the Thai prodigy's meteoric rise continued with three more Ladies European Tour wins by September 2021. She won her first LPGA Tour event in March 2022 at the JTBC Classic in Southern California (pictured), and in May, rose to No. 4 in the world rankings. Donald Miralle / Getty Images Continuing Thailand's recent trend of golf prodigies, Ratchanon \"TK\" Chantananuwat narrowly missed out on besting compatriot Thitikul's record when he became the youngest male player to win on a major Tour aged 15 years and 37 days. Victory at the Trust Golf Asian Mixed Cup in April 2022 (pictured) set a new peak in the schoolboy's amateur career, having already become the youngest player to make the cut in the history of the All Thailand Golf Tour in 2020, aged 13 years and four months. Orange Pictures/BSR Agency/Getty Images Having already won on the ALPG Tour earlier that year, New Zealand's Lydia Ko became the youngest golfer to win on the LPGA Tour when -- at 15 years old -- she triumphed at the CN Canadian Women's Open in August 2012 (pictured). After turning pro in October 2013, Ko has gone from strength to strength with an already-glittering trophy cabinet. At 17 years old, she was the youngest golfer to reach the No. 1 ranking in 2015, and today boasts 17 victories on the LPGA Tour. Harry How / Getty Images Arguably the greatest golfer never to go pro, Bobby Jones is one of the sport's most influential figures. A prodigious young talent with a string of wins by the age of 14, it took longer than expected for Jones to win his first major, triumphing at the US Open in 1923, aged 21. He soon added three more and three British Open titles before retiring at just 28. He proceeded to found and help design the course at Augusta National Golf Club, where The Masters -- then known as the Augusta National Invitational -- was first hosted in 1934.\n\nTopical Press Agency / Hulton Archive / Getty Images One of the most famed golf prodigies in recent history, a 10-year-old Michelle Wie became the youngest player to qualify for a USGA amateur Championship in 2000.

With a professional career marred by injury, victory at the US Women's Open in 2014 has proven to be the career peak for Wie, who told CNN she had been considering retirement before the birth of her daughter in 2020. Jonathan Ferrey / Getty Images Golf's greatest-ever prodigies Prev Next\n\nEssien is not the first Nigerian golfer to have to look elsewhere for role models. Georgia Ohoh, the first Nigerian to play in the Ladies European Tour, previously told CNN she had to turn to tennis to find inspirational athletes.\n\nThat’s in part because golf is far from the most popular sport in Nigeria. According to the Nigerian Golf Federation, there are only 58 courses in the country. In 2012, it was estimated there were only about 200,000 golfers out of a population of than 200 million people (by comparison, more than 25 million Americans played golf that same year).\n\nRelated: Former Super Bowl champion Osi Umenyiora is creating a new path for African talent to make it to the NFL\n\nEssien says the absence of a more established golfing program has been challenging, particularly when it comes to financing.\n\nShe says her family has been “instrumental” in funding her career, but it’s been a “struggle” and believes, “if I had a huge pot to work with, I would have done more competitions over the years than I did and won more trophies.”\n\nWanting to pursue more opportunities, Essien, who was born in the state of New York but raised in Nigeria, moved back to the US in 2021 to enroll in the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut.\n\nEssien attended the British Open to watch her role model, Tiger Woods, compete in the tournament. Imeh Okon\n\n“The competition is high (in the US),” Essien said. On an average day, the teenager says she typically practices for three hours after class, and it can be difficult to navigate the delicate dance between pursuing a professional career and being an “average” teen.\n\n“Sometimes I actually really want to go hang out my friends and just relax and be a teenager basically. But there are also priorities. I have to remember that if I want to be in a higher place in golf or in school then I have to put in the time in the work,” she said.\n\nInspiring the next generation\n\nIn addition to becoming a golf pro, Essien wants to pursue a degree in engineering with a specialization in artificial intelligence.\n\n“I hope to get a golf scholarship to a (top) university… and if it becomes possible, I hope to play in the LPGA,” she said.\n\nRelated: What it’s like to circumnavigate Lesotho on foot – in 16 days\n\nWith a budding career ahead, she also hopes to pave the way for other Nigerians for follow in her footsteps.\n\n“I hope my achievements and where I am right now in golf can actually motivate Nigerians who want to play golf,” she said, leaving aspiring golfers with this piece of advice: “work hard and keep a good mentality because everything happens for a reason and in due time, everything will go your way.”", "authors": ["Jackie Prager"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/arts/2022/04/22/sarasota-ballet-principal-victoria-hulland-takes-final-curtsy/7354934001/", "title": "Sarasota Ballet principal Victoria Hulland takes a final curtsy", "text": "Carrie Seidman\n\nSpecial to the Herald-Tribune\n\nWhen Sarasota Ballet takes the Sarasota Opera House stage this weekend for its season-ending “Serendipitous Movement” program, it will be the joyful culmination of a successful rebound following the pandemic and a time to look forward to a well-deserved summer break with anticipation of the recently announced program lineup for the 2022-2023 season.\n\nBut for Victoria Hulland, the moment will be “bittersweet.” The principal dancer recently announced her retirement from the company that has been her home for virtually her entire professional career, in order to focus on her 2-year-old daughter with her husband, British actor Edward French. After 15 years, she will make her final appearances in George Balanchine’s “Serenade” and Kenneth MacMillan’s “Elite Syncopations” on a triple bill that also includes the company premiere of Mark Morris’ “The Letter V.”\n\n“I started dancing when I was 4 and decided to be serious at about 12 and then joined the company at 19,” said Hulland in a recent Zoom interview. “Ballet has been the main thing in my life for almost my whole life and I’ve been with the company almost half my life, which is huge. It was always my top priority but now, obviously, my daughter is, so my decisions aren’t career-based anymore.”\n\nHulland is, at 34, “too young to retire” in the eyes of Sarasota Ballet’s assistant director, Margaret Barbieri, who adds “but as a mother, I understand.” Hulland said the extreme physical demands of a professional ballet career have taken their toll and were also a consideration in her decision.\n\n“Age is a part of it too,” says the dancer, who sat out most of the 2019-2020 season when she was pregnant. “You feel the aches and pains more the older you get. Little injuries creep up from wear and tear on the body and, after having my daughter, I’ve never felt like my back has been the same. Of course, that’s only part of it, but if not this year, it only gets harder the older you get.”\n\nMoreover, Hulland said she has no regrets or unfinished chapters in a career that exceeded her aspirations and expectations.\n\n“There isn’t anything I wish I’d done, which is why I know it’s the right decision for me at this time,” she said. “I feel so grateful and satisfied with my career, which was bigger and better than anything I imagined as a student. So I feel satisfied, I feel it’s complete. If I wasn’t, I wouldn’t be able to stop.”\n\nThe first step\n\nIt all began in 2007, not long after Sarasota Ballet director Iain Webb was selected to take over the helm of the company. Hulland was among the dozens of dancers at a crowded Sarasota Ballet audition at the Alvin Ailey studios in New York, where Webb and Barbieri hand-selected dancers for their new venture. Hulland, then a Boston Ballet trainee, had heeded the advice of her teacher at the time, who knew of Webb and Barbieri and said, “if you’re going to audition anywhere, make this your No. 1.”\n\nWith her delicate Romantic ballerina looks, demure demeanor and elegant technique, Hulland made an immediate impression.\n\n“You could see there was something very sensitive, very pure about her, and something we felt we could really invest in,” Webb recalled. “We knew some of the ballets we were hoping to do and we could see where she would fit in. We just felt that there was something about her ... not an ‘English rose,’ but something very nice and pleasing we could help mold.”\n\n“She had a radiance,” echoed Barbieri. “It wasn’t, ‘Oh, she’s star quality.’ But there was something very special about her you don’t often see when you’re looking at dancers at an audition. I was certain with Victoria we got it right.”\n\nIn addition to Hulland, three other dancers who were at that audition – each with a distinctly different style – also became familiar faces on the Sarasota stage. Principals Danielle Brown and Ricardo Rhodes remain; Amy Wood retired in 2019. But it was Hulland, hired as corps de ballet and promoted to principal just two years later, who was given the coveted title role when the company mounted the ultimate Romantic classic, “Giselle,” in 2009. She danced the role again in 2019 and a third time last December; it remains one of her career milestones.\n\n“I feel like most female dancers, that’s their dream role to dance and to do it as my first principal role in my first year as a principal and at such a young age was an amazing experience,” she said.\n\nAmong the “so many highlights” of her tenure, Hulland also points to her repeat appearances as the Young Girl in Frederick Ashton’s “The Two Pigeons” and especially dancing it, most recently, with former American Ballet Theatre star Marcelo Gomes, who spent much of the 2018-2019 season with the Sarasota Ballet.\n\n“I remember having this poster on my wall as a young girl that had Marcelo on it, so getting to dance with him was just insane,” she said. “I never imagined that would be possible.”\n\nBarbieri also points to “Two Pigeons” as one of Hulland’s standout roles, but adds another, less expected – “Marguerite and Armand,” a ballet Ashton originally created for the iconic May-December partnership of Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. Like Ashton, Barbieri originally believed that ballet should never be danced by any other couple. Hulland changed her mind.\n\n“I always thought no one should do it but Margot and Rudi,” Barbieri said. “But Victoria just made it her own and was sensational in her role. That’s what has been so wonderful working with her and what makes it so heartbreaking that she’s leaving. I have all these wonderful memories of her I shall keep in my heart always.”\n\nHulland credits Webb and Barbieri with providing her “a thorough education in English ballet history” by bringing in so many historic ballets – especially Ashton’s, previously rarely seen in the U.S. – as well as storied ballet figures like Sir Anthony Dowell, one of the great danseurs nobles of the 20th century, who visited Sarasota to set Ashton’s “The Dream.” (Dowell originated the role of Oberon.) Hulland was always the go-to girl for the most traditional classical roles, but said she never felt stereotyped or restricted in her casting.\n\n“Those roles kind of fit my personality and I liked doing them,” she said. “I never felt limited. I was just so happy here, doing these ballets that aren’t offered at other places in the country, getting to work with so many experts on these ballets. I never thought of going elsewhere. Why change a good thing?”\n\nShe also contributes her contentment, in part, to the environment Webb and Barbieri set within the company, by refusing to countenance backbiting, infighting or competitive divisiveness. As in Barbieri’s day, more mature dancers are expected to share their knowledge and experience with those less seasoned and to support their growth – even when a corps dancer may be cast in a principal role.\n\n“It’s so easy for dancers to get jealous, but if they see competition going on, it’s quickly nipped in the bud here,” Hulland said. “That’s what makes it so great to go to work every day, to be with friends who support you and not to have to deal with that negative energy. Even with all the turnover we’ve had, it’s still that kind of atmosphere.”\n\nAmong the decisions that lie ahead for Hulland is where she and her family will live. A move away from Sarasota is in the works, but whether it will be within the U.S. (Hulland’s parents live in Ruskin) or in the U.K., where French’s family resides, remains to be seen.\n\n“My daughter is the main factor now and we’re trying to decide where we want to raise her,” said Hulland, who became involved with French after he after was cast as the Narrator in Will Tuckett’s “The Secret Garden” in 2014. “We know we’ll eventually be moving, but we haven’t figured out where yet.”\n\nAt the moment, she’s not looking past her final performances this weekend. She’ll be reprising her role as the “Waltz Girl” in “Serenade” – one of George Balanchine’s earliest and most beloved and beautiful ballets – and dancing the featured “Bethena” girl role in Kenneth Macmillan’s jazzy ragtime “Elite Syncopations,” which the company hasn’t performed since 2008, Hulland’s first season.\n\n“I’m excited to finish with this season because it’s such a great program,” she said. “I learned the Bethena girl my first season, but performed in the corps de ballet. So now in my last season, I’ve come full circle.”\n\nWebb says if he’d had more warning of Hulland’s departure, he might have created a program just to feature her, which would surely have finished with “The Two Pigeons.” Still, he said, this program will allow local audiences an opportunity to “acknowledge 15 years of 100 percent dedication and amazing artistry” and to “sit back and remember all those amazing moments and wish Victoria all the best.”\n\n“Yes,” Barbieri agrees, nodding. She pauses for a moment looking nostalgic before a wry smile crosses her lips.\n\n“Of course,” she adds, “there’s always a comeback ...”\n\n‘Serendipitous Movement’\n\nSarasota Ballet at the Sarasota Opera House, April 29-30, featuring “Serenade” by George Balanchine; the company premiere of “The Letter V” by Mark Morris; and Kenneth MacMillan’s “Elite Syncopations.” For more information, go to sarasotaballet.org or call 941-359-0099.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/technology/961534/alexandr-wang-profile", "title": "Alexandr Wang: how world's youngest self-made billionaire is ...", "text": "Co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence company Scale AI, Alexandr Wang became the \"youngest self-made\" billionaire in the world in 2022, when he was just 25.

Fresh from a huge injection of investment, Scale AI is now valued at close to $14 billion, and Wang has an \"estimated 14% stake\".\n\nWho is Alexandr Wang?\n\nWang's \"privileged upbringing\" was crucial in giving him \"a solid foundation in science and technology\", said Mashable. Born in New Mexico, his Chinese immigrant parents \"both worked as physicists on projects for the US Air Force and the military\" and the future tech CEO \"clearly had a brilliant mind passed down from his parents\".

Several rounds of investment followed, culminating in 2021 when the company was valued \"north of $7 billion\". It had taken Wang \"just five years to become the youngest self-made billionaire in the world\".\n\nWhat is Scale AI?\n\nScale AI is a \"labour-intensive operation\", with more than 100,000 contract workers performing the \"grunt work that powers the modern AI boom\", said the WSJ.\n\n\"Unlike its biggest customers\", which include Meta, OpenAI and Microsoft, Wang's company \"is not building its own generative AI models\". But it is able to provide \"enormous volumes of accurately labelled data\" to train AI tools, and so give itself a \"central position in the booming sector\", said the FT.\n\n\"Behind even the most impressive AI system are people,\" said The Verge, and any AI company trying to be competitive requires \"huge numbers of people labelling data to train it, and clarifying data when it gets confused\".\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAn army of outsourced workers around the world are employed by Scale's data annotation subsidiaries Remotasks and Outlier AI, which Wang describes as \"very, very important to the process of building powerful AI systems\".\n\nBut Scale's mass use of contractors to fulfil its data-labelling tasks is not without controversy. It is facing a class-action lawsuit from some workers, and is accused of \"fostering an 'extremely predatory' relationship\" with contractors, said the Inc. site. Allegations include \"partially or unpaid work, and chronic mismanagement\" at Scale's subsidiaries. Wang is named as a defendant in the case, accused of knowingly breaking work laws, along with other Scale executives.\n\nWhy is Wang so influential?\n\nWang has shown himself to be a \"crafty opportunist\" since starting Scale, said Cory Weinberg on The Information. He has \"cemented himself in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley, partly through his knack for getting into the right rooms and securing the high-powered connections that can propel a young founder's fortunes\". He also has a knack for \"shifting Scale toward fresh pools of revenue when old ones dried up\".\n\nWang's influence extends beyond California, too. His \"deep connections in Washington\" make him \"stand out in the California-centric tech industry\", said Louise Matsakis in the Semafor Technology newsletter. One lawmaker even called Wang a \"real friend\" – which is \"a real compliment in DC\".\n\nWang often speaks to legislators about his \"hawkish views\" on China, which he describes as \"the greatest geopolitical competitor\" to the US. He's twice briefed the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, with Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi praising him as \"very insightful and at the same time personable\".\n\nAlthough OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman is the industry figure who \"has been dominating the spotlight\", Wang is \"increasingly influencing how the industry is perceived\" by regulators, said Matsakis.

Titles can be removed from school curriculums or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials that a book can go from challenged to banned in a school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is true only for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society.\n\n'All Boys Aren’t Blue' by George M. Johnson\n\nWe’re failing young queer readers, specifically Black and young people of color, if a book like activist George M. Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” stays on banned-book lists. Published in 2020, this memoir-manifesto follows the author’s journey of growing up a queer Black person and is an indispensable piece of literature for high school readers. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence and college years while revisiting traumatic and transformative experiences and weaves in important statistics about the LGBTQ community. Johnson candidly – and some might think, explicitly – explores their sexuality and unpacks their experiences with sexual assault in a way that’s necessary for readers to heal. The American Library Association listed the book No. 3 on its list of the 10 most-challenged books of 2021. Both a primer for teens looking to be allies to the LGBTQ community and a YA book meant to make young queer readers feel seen, Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a force to be reckoned with. – Pamela Avila\n\n'Gender Queer' by Maia Kobabe\n\nWhy do we tell teens to shave their legs if we resent having been told to ourselves? This question, among so many others, has been haunting me since I read “Gender Queer,” Maia Kobabe’s autobiographical graphic novel that explores the author's experience coming out as nonbinary and asexual. Through the novel, Kobabe vividly unravels small personal moments common to so many young people, exploring the discomfort inherent in everyday experiences like routine Pap smears. Kobabe raises a lot of excellent questions about the social mores of gender and the avidity with which society feels compelled to assign gender even though it is unique to individuals. Reading “Gender Queer” for the first time was like experiencing a jolt of adrenaline. It’s a book about Kobabe’s journey, but it allowed me to reframe mine, offering me the space to excavate my past and challenge my own self-concept. “Gender Queer” encourages growth and self-acceptance, and its removal from libraries is a huge disservice to teens. – Madison Durham\n\n'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas\n\nOne of the most challenged books in the country is this award-winning, bestselling middle-grade novel. Since the book’s release in 2017, it has been no stranger to controversy. The book’s critics say there’s too much sex and profanity. Some said it breeds contempt for police. The crux of the story, however, is systemic racism. Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter loses her best friend, Khalil, after he is shot and killed by a police officer. It’s a familiar story: Khalil, a Black kid, was unarmed when the white officer shot him. Khalil’s death becomes national news. Protests ensue. And a narrative forms, painting Khalil as a troublemaker and drug lord. Starr is caught between two worlds: her poor neighborhood and the rich prep school she attends. It’s the same story many Black children have lived. After Khalil’s death, Starr finds her voice of activism and pride in her Black identity. The banning of Thomas’ book is another reminder many people are uncomfortable with the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. – Tracee Herbaugh\n\n‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli\n\nSixteen-year-old Simon Spier has a crush on an anonymous gay classmate who goes by the name Blue online, and with whom he has been exchanging increasingly flirtatious emails. One problem: Neither knows the other’s real identity. Another problem: Simon is still closeted. But when a nosey classmate finds Simon’s emails and threatens to out him, cautious Simon needs to step outside his comfort zone before he’s pushed out. What’s so welcome about Albertalli’s tale of high school high jinks, secret crushes and fraught friend-group dynamics is how ordinary and familiar it is. This sweet and funny high school story is light on trauma and big on laughs, and a balm to queer readers who want to see themselves reflected in happy coming-out stories. (It also has a rather good film adaptation, “Love, Simon,” starring Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner.) – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami\n\nThis is one of the most hauntingly, mind-bendingly beautiful books I've ever read. The surreal novel weaves two parallel plots that meld music and metaphysics, time and fate, and loss and alienation as it follows the young Kafka Tamura, who is fleeing an Oedipal curse, and Satoru Nakata, an old man with a knack for talking to cats. \"Kafka on the Shore\" is an imaginative literary puzzle sure to challenge students and their conceptions of what a novel could, or should, be. Chock-full of surreal happenings, nothing is clearly defined in this book. Murakami leaves the story open-ended for readers, giving them space to decide what to draw from it – a level of freedom they may not often be afforded when dissecting more “classic” novels typically included in curriculums. In a setting where students are often instructed to find \"the right answer,\" \"Kafka on the Shore\" is a breath of fresh air that can stretch their imaginations. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I snuck into my sister’s room and grabbed a copy of \"Twilight.\" It was just before the \"Breaking Dawn – Part 1\" movie release, and \"Twilight\" fever had hit my school. The story of Bella, Edward, vampires and forbidden love features all the hallmarks of coming-of-age literature and introduced me to themes I hadn’t seen in media yet. \"Twilight\" brought me together with my peers to talk about reading, giving me new worlds to explore and new friends to talk about them with. Banning \"Twilight\" severely limits the opportunity for students to take reading into their own hands and enjoy a coming-of-age story full of fantasy and imagination. – Chris Panella\n\n'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' by Erika L. Sanchez\n\nFor young women struggling with mental health struggles, the loss of a loved one, the loss of innocence and outdated expectations that often come with growing up in a Latino household, Sanchez’s 2017 YA novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” can be a lifeline. In August, Madison County Schools in Mississippi removed 10 books from general library circulation, including Sanchez’s. High school is a tough time, and young people in particular pick up a book to escape reality or to make sense of the changing world around them – reading makes them feel safe enough to express how they’re feeling. And making a book like Sanchez’s inaccessible hinders the representation young Latino readers need. – Avila\n\n'The Odyssey' by Homer\n\nOdysseus’ 10-year journey after the Trojan War back home to Ithaca to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, has a lot going on – a lot dark going on. Witches, slavery, tricks, betrayal, Cyclopses, grim and gory deaths, cannibal giants, varied monsters, murderous guests and mass slaughter all feature in the epic (in the original sense) tale from the eighth century BCE. It’s a wild ride with bad role models, and there couldn’t be a more classic example of the Books by Dead White Men vein of literature. That being said: “The Odyssey,” both the book itself and the themes it explores, are so deeply woven into the fabric of our modern culture that the name itself is a genre. Knowing \"The Odyssey\" is like getting a peek into the source code of innumerable (truly) works of literature spanning 28 centuries, giving any reader a deeper, more nuanced understanding of not just countless works of art but of culture itself. (And as it happens, it’s a fantastic, gripping story that’s a joy to read in its own right.) – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nIt's funny that \"Speak\" is so challenged, considering I was in high school when I read it. Apparently, it \"exposes children to immorality\" – reasoning you don't know whether to laugh or cry at. Adults who think teenagers aren't already exposed to everything probably don't remember what it was like being a teenager. Sexual assault, unhappy families and the nuances of high school life are real-world issues that teens are already aware of. Kids need books that start difficult conversations, that demonstrate the importance of using your voice and having someone who listens, that show you can rise above adversity. \"Speak\" is beautiful in its spare prose and simplicity. Many can relate to, and laugh with, Melinda's dry humor and cynical voice. It's a necessary story that gives permission to students whose voices are silenced to take up space – and speak. – Nusrat Sultana\n\n'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Picoult\n\nI was in eighth grade when the Columbine shooting happened, back when the concept of a school shooting was new. Children and teens today live in a very different reality, with active shooter drills and school shootings as part of their everyday life and consciousness. Parents have challenged this book because of its depictions of a school shooting; the bullying and romantic partner violence that led up to it; and the trauma and suicides that came after. Children are bullied. Teenagers are in abusive relationships. They get pregnant and grapple with decisions about abortion. Adolescents struggle to define their sexuality. Young people contemplate suicide and kill themselves. Banning books about these topics doesn’t make them cease to exist. The story, so beautifully told, touches on all of these topics because these are the traumas teens battle, some of which have directly contributed to violence in schools. If we’re unwilling to let young people read about, think about, process and dissect the very traumas they experience all around them, how can ever hope to solve these problems? – Katie Wedell\n\n'Blubber' by Judy Blume\n\nI read “Blubber” in fifth grade, and it's the most pivotal book of my youth. The book’s main character is a young fifth grader, Jill, who joins the more popular kids in the class to ostracize Linda, a girl nicknamed Blubber because of her size. The main reason the book has been banned is because nothing happens to Jill and her fellow bullies. That is precisely why I needed this book. In the fifth grade, I was Linda. “Blubber” was inspired by an incident in the author’s daughter’s own fifth grade class, and what Blume saw was not the exception but often the rule. In real life, bullies often get away with their behavior. While the similarity between myself and Blubber stung, it also provided solace. I was not alone. This was not something that happened only to me. Others knew how I felt. And that meant everything. It is always satisfying to read stories with happy endings, but it is just as important to read ones that don’t. Because in life, there are bullies and unresolved endings, and that is something that every fifth grader should know. – Mary Cadden\n\n'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding\n\nGolding uses preteen boys to show readers how a group of people will mistreat those they simply don’t like and even beat a child to death out of fear arising from a conspiracy theory. The use of boys as main characters may make it easier for some to understand the forces that can erode a society, or may make readers feel alarmed about the “end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.” Either way, this book can prompt young readers think deeply about governance and societal leadership in a way that will inform them throughout their lives. – Erin Mansfield\n\n'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" revolves around the friendship between two migrant workers during the Great Depression. I remember reading the book for my high school English class and thinking about loneliness as well as companionship. The two protagonists are brought together by a shared dream of purchasing land that's eventually shattered by the predatory social environment for migrant workers at that time. With this book, school-age readers have the opportunity to examine the conflict between reality and the American dream, in addition to human friendships. – Rayna Song\n\n'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein\n\nSilverstein’s collections of poetic nonsense was a classic on our living room bookshelf. His fantastical black-and-white sketches begged a wild imagination and a healthy sense of humor. They posed impossible scenarios, built as much for wordplay as they were for plot. \"A Light in the Attic\" has been banned in some schools over claims it promotes disrespect and violence. To argue this is to argue that children are unable to understand hyperbole. I am a deep believer that adolescent minds should be taken seriously, that they always understand more than we think and that they grow best when we overestimate them. The greatest children’s authors know this. I want the next generation to learn just as I did from Silverstein the joy of twisting words in different ways, of laughing at themselves, and of finding poetry and humor in everyday life. – Anna Kaufman\n\n'Eleanor & Park' by Rainbow Rowell\n\nRowell’s novel captures what it means to be a misfit teenage girl in a world that wants to cast you aside. As a teenager, this book made me feel seen as it keys into the nuances of being an outcast while coming into your own. This book has been banned for coarse language and sexuality, but it covers difficult topics such as racism, domestic abuse and body image that are enlightening for teen and adult readers alike. With high school years being a turbulent time for many, \"Eleanor & Park\" provides a much-needed perspective on surviving your teenage years in the face of adversity. – Samantha Mangino\n\n'Two Boys Kissing' by David Levithan\n\nI revisited “Two Boys Kissing” almost 10 years after first reading it, and – in the best possible way – it was more of a gut-punch than I'd recalled. The narration by a Greek chorus of men who died of AIDS is an emotional reminder of the strong bonds of chosen family. This book feels especially timely as progress on LGBTQ rights faces renewed political backlash and as monkeypox spreads mainly through our community. Reading “Two Boys Kissing” today shows how much has changed in the past decade while highlighting what work there still is to be done – and what we may be in danger of losing if we become complacent about our progress. The young characters remind us what is at stake and who most needs to hear these stories and feel a community’s love today. – Zach Wichter\n\n'Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice' by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, Ann Hazzard\n\nAs this book follows a Black family and a white family discussing the police shooting of a Black man, its first page reads, “the grown-ups didn’t think the kids knew about it.” Amid nationwide conversations about race, many parents assume children are in the dark or unable to have meaningful discussions about racism. But children hear the murmurings and have questions. Shutting those down means lost opportunities for learning. A growing body of research shows children begin to notice race years before adults want to talk about it with them. Delaying these conversations and ignoring the realities of racism could make children more susceptible to racist beliefs. After all, it’s the adult’s responsibility to help children make sense of their social world. “Something Happened” approaches these conversations with care and includes child-friendly discussion guides curated by child psychologists to help encourage vital parent-child conversations about race. – Fernando\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky\n\nEvery person I’ve spoken to who read “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” when they were in high school remembers it as a teenagehood-defining book. Chbosky writes beautifully and timelessly from the mind of high school freshman Charlie, an introvert who gets taken under the wing of a group of upperclassmen and learns the value of letting others into his life. Some of the content throughout can be intense or inappropriate for younger readers – topics include alcohol, drugs, sex, abortion, mental health struggles, suicide and sexual abuse. But these are all things high schoolers can and often do experience, and blocking them from a story that explores them in a thoughtful, empathetic way doesn’t do anyone any good. More, it holds teenage readers back from discovering a story that may guide them through a tumultuous period. Years later, I count myself one of the lucky many to have found this story when I did. – Hannah Yasharoff\n\n'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' by Maya Angelou\n\nAngelou’s beautifully written autobiographical novel touches on two important and painful subjects that often get it banned from schools: rape and racism. While they may not be the most comfortable topics, they’re still as prevalent in 2022 as they were in 1969, when the book was published. It features some graphic depictions, but the sad truth is these topics are not new to many young adults, and reading about Angelou’s healing journey is instrumental in letting them know they’re not alone. Simply banning a book that depicts rape and racism doesn’t shield readers from facing them in their lives; it just removes another resource that may help them move forward. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The House on Mango Street' by Sandra Cisneros\n\nThere are some novels that read like poetry, and \"The House on Mango Street\" is on that list. Cisneros uses short vignettes to show key moments in the life of Esperanza, a 12-year-old Latina girl growing up in Chicago, poised in the awkward time between childhood and adolescence. The writing is truly lovely, and the use of vignettes creates a feeling of being inside someone’s memories. Through Esperanza, Cisneros creates a portrait of a community, both the love and support as well as the restrictive and painful aspects. The latter includes moments of domestic and sexual abuse, and as Esperanza ages within the novel, her understanding and descriptions of those situations become more explicit, although never graphic. It is easy to understand why the book has won multiple awards, as Cisneros plays with narrative form and storytelling, and questions what it means to belong in a fascinating and wonderful way. – Rebecca Viser\n\n'Maus' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. Though \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. –VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was assigned only one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for one another helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that about 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming-out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and it provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten: disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired bythe magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then – about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixth graders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local newspaper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He already had tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it had been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones The Man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran, but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted people, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyonce once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they fear for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming of age, Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That shortsightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affects those who fight. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions. Through a more contemporary lens, readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body, much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later tries to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries), the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is good only behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ people, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of World War II, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid\\'s Tale' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in The New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s, and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Wedell\n\n'1984' by George Orwell\n\nI read \"1984,\" one of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. The book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games' (series), by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have beenoutrageously dystopian when Collins published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime,\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger – themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent comments. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over, as they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2013/10/24/sylvia-likens/3178393/", "title": "Sylvia Likens: The 1965 torture and murder of the 16-year-old girl", "text": "Dawn Mitchell@Indystar.com\n\nIt has been the most enduring nightmare in Indianapolis True Crime history — the Oct. 26, 1965, torture-murder of 16-year-old Sylvia Likens.\n\nOther crimes have involved a greater number of victims, often including children, but the villains in those stories were hardened criminals or madmen, and their acts of violence played out rapidly within a span of minutes or hours. In the aftermath of grief and anger, good people could at least comprehend the chain of events that had just unfolded.\n\nOn the surface, the Likens murder is not much different from any number of heinous crimes. It was a Cinderella story without the happy ending — a teenage girl left under the care of a strict authoritarian whose idea of discipline is physical abuse that escalates until the abuse victim dies. If that was the extent of it, this case would likely have been lost to history long ago like so many other long-forgotten murders.\n\nThis case was somehow more disturbing than other crimes, perhaps because:\n\n* The abuse was carried out not just by the caregiver — the notorious Gertrude Baniszewski — but also by her own children, some as young as 10, and by other children in the neighborhood. For weeks, even months, the torture of Sylvia Likens was casual entertainment, something to do in the afternoon before dinner and favorite TV shows. At least a dozen children participated or at least watched, and none felt sufficiently disturbed to tell their own parents.\n\n* Other adults occasionally came to the Baniszewski house for various reasons and saw Sylvia's battered appearance. None pushed to be sure she was safe.\n\n* Sylvia herself and her younger sister Jenny had opportunities to tell adults at school or church — they even had adult relatives living nearby. Neither said a word because, as Jenny would later explain, they thought it would only make things worse. Neither could conceive of the possibility that authorities would move to protect them, remove them from the house or arrest their tormentors.\n\nArrests did come, but only after it was over.\n\nOn Oct. 26, 1965, Indianapolis police were called to 3850 E. New York St. where Sylvia's body lay on a mattress. Baniszewski told them the girl had been attacked by a gang of boys and she even produced a note written in Sylvia's own hand that seemed to confirm that story. But the cops could tell by the condition of the victim that this had been no single incident.\n\nSylvia's body was malnourished and covered with sores, burns and bruises, many of them old. She had been branded in one spot by a hot metal object, and the words \"I am a prostitute\" had been etched on her stomach.\n\nHow it began:\n\nSylvia came from a large, poor family from southern Boone County, just northwest of Indianapolis. Her father, Lester Likens, had only an eighth-grade education and worked a lot of different jobs to make a living. He'd had a laundry route, worked in factories and had even owned a small restaurant, though unsuccessfully. He had also traveled with carnivals selling food from a concession cart, and it was to this work to which he and his wife decided to return in the summer of 1965.\n\nThat meant finding someone to watch four of their children. The oldest, Diana, was grown and married. The two boys, Danny and Bennie, were placed with their grandparents, and that left the girls, Sylvia and Jenny.\n\nJenny was shy, insecure and limped from childhood polio. Sylvia was outwardly more confident and went by the nickname \"Cookie.\" She was pretty but always kept her mouth closed when she smiled because she had a missing front tooth.\n\nA mutual friend introduced the Likens to Gertrude Baniszewski (then briefly going by the name Gertrude Wright), who lived in a big rented house at the corner of East New York and Denny and was willing to look after Jenny and Sylvia for $20 a week.\n\nGertrude was already caring for seven of her own children: Paula, 17; John, 12; Stephanie, 15; Marie, 11; Shirley, 10; and James and Dennis, 18 months. The six oldest children all had the last name Baniszewski because their father was Gertrude's ex-husband, John Baniszewski. The youngest child, Dennis, had the last name of his father, Dennis Wright. Gertrude said he was in Germany serving in the Army.\n\nFrom the beginning, there was a clash between Sylvia and Gertrude's 17-year-old daughter, Paula, and this was the seed of what grew in that house during the months of July through October 1965.\n\nThen one day the money order from Sylvia's parents didn't show up on the day Gertrude was expecting it. Jenny later testified Gertrude \"took us upstairs … and she slapped me, and said, 'Well, I took care of you two b___ for a week for nothing.\" The money order arrived the next day, but the key had been turned.\n\nGertrude was frail and underweight, but she had two weapons she used for corporal punishment: a fraternity-style paddle and a thick leather belt left behind by her ex-husband, John Baniszewski, an Indianapolis police officer.\n\nGertrude began using the paddle on Sylvia and Jenny for various offenses such as exchanging soft drink bottles for change at a nearby grocery. When she suspected Sylvia of stealing she used matches to burn the girl's fingers. Sometimes Gertrude felt too weak from her asthma to discipline the girls properly so 17-year-old Paula helped.\n\nNeighborhood children began to crowd the home to participate in the torture. The children took turns practicing their judo on Sylvia, hurling her against a wall. Some began kicking and beating her. Others extinguished their cigarettes on her skin. As Gertrude and a gang of teenagers watched, Sylvia was forced to undress in the living room and insert an empty Coke bottle into her vagina.\n\nAfter the beatings, Sylvia was forced into a scalding hot bath so she would be \"cleansed of her sins.\" She was severely beaten and burned for wetting her mattress while asleep and Gertrude decided that Sylvia was no longer fit to live with her children.\n\nNear the end, Sylvia was no longer permitted to leave the house. She was thrown down the cellar stairs and locked in, given crackers for food and refused the right to use a bathroom. Gertrude Baniszewski announced to her children that Sylvia was a \"prostitute, and she's proud of it; so we'll just put it on her stomach.\" She took a large needle and began to carve the words \"I'm a prostitute and proud of it!\" into Sylvia's stomach. Richard Hobbs, a neighbor boy, finished the etching.\n\nRetro Indy: Heinous crimes of serial killers in Indiana\n\nWhen Baniszewski realized Sylvia might be dying, she forced her to write a note saying a gang of boys beat her. The plan was to blindfold her and dump her in nearby woods with the note. Sylvia tried to escape but Gertrude and one of the boys stopped her, beating her again and throwing her back into the basement.\n\nSylvia Likens died Oct. 26, 1965. Cause of death was determined to be brain swelling, internal hemorrhaging of the brain and shock induced by Sylvia's extensive skin damage. Sylvia also suffered from extreme malnutrition. She was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Lebanon.\n\nThe Baniszewski trial, May 1966\n\nAt her trial the following year, Baniszewski denied any knowledge of the torture, claiming the children must have done it all. She entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nOn May 19, 1966, a jury found Baniszewski guilty of first-degree murder while Paula Baniszewski was found guilty of second-degree murder. Hobbs, along with Baniszewski's son John and another neighborhood boy, Coy Hubbard, were convicted of manslaughter. Gertrude and Paula Baniszewski were sentenced to life terms at the Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis. The boys were sentenced to two-to-21-year terms at the Indiana State Reformatory in Pendleton.\n\nIn 1971, the Indiana Supreme Court granted Gertrude and Paula Baniszewski a new trial due to \"prejudicial atmosphere,\" but Gertrude was again convicted of first-degree murder on Aug. 5, 1971. Paula pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and served about two years in prison. The three boys were released on parole for good behavior in 1968, after serving about two years each of their sentences.\n\nIn Decemb 1985, Gertrude Baniszewski was released on parole. She changed her name to Nadine Van Fossan and moved to Iowa where she lived in obscurity until her death from lung cancer on June 16, 1990. Paula married and moved to a farm in Iowa.\n\nJohn became a lay minister in Texas and counseled children of divorced parents.\n\nHobbs died of cancer at the age of 21, four years after being released from the reformatory. Hubbard has had several brushes with the law. Lester and Betty Likens divorced. Betty remarried and died in 1998 at age 71. Jenny Likens Wade died in 2004 at age 54.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/05/paris-olympics-live-updates-results/74190961007/", "title": "Paris Olympics highlights: Lyles wins 200 heat; US wins discus gold", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nSimone Biles added yet another medal to her collection on the final day of gymnastics at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Norway took out the USA in straight sets, 21-16, 21-14.\n\nIn Tokyo three years ago, Mol and Sorum became the youngest duo to win the Olympic gold at 23 and 24 years old, respectively. The Americans gave them their best shot but the Norwegians were simply better.\n\nBudinger and Evans played solid defense early to stay in the first set. The former NBA player’s presence at the net was a factor, as he had two blocks and forced an attack error within the first 10 points. Norway went on a 3-0 run to force a USA timeout at 14-11 and it controlled the rest of the set, with Mol dialing up his own block (six block points), to keep the U.S. off balance.\n\nThe Americans enjoyed a 3-1 lead to start the second set, but they quickly saw that evaporate to a 8-4 deficit. An ace from Mol made it 12-7 and created a mountain too tall for the U.S. to climb. By the end of the match, sand stuck to the entire right side of Evans' body. He recorded nine digs and had 12 attack points. Budinger finished with four block points and eight points on attack. Both Norwegians finished with 11 attack points apiece.\n\nEvans and Budinger advanced to the knockout round by winning their \"lucky losers\" match two days earlier, as they won one of their three group play matches (the first). — Chris Bumbaca\n\nAmerican Emma Hunt makes finals in climbing\n\nEmma Hunt of the United States is on to the speed finals at the Paris Games.

The result was a score of 13.100. The 21-year-old appeared frustrated as she re-mounted the beam and finished her routine after the fall, and as she walked away afterwards. But then she started to gradually lighten after talking with her coach, Jess Graba, and Biles. Within moments, Lee was smiling and laughing again, perhaps remembering the breadth of what she's already achieved in Paris. After returning from a pair of kidney ailments, Lee won a second consecutive all-around Olympic medal – this time a bronze – to go with team gold and another bronze on uneven bars Sunday. — Nancy Armour, Tom Schad\n\nAmericans struggle for tops in boulder qualification of sport climbing\n\nSport climbing is officially underway at Le Bourget.

The White House's youngest press secretary", "text": "White House's youngest press secretary Karoline Leavitt made her debut in the briefing room on Tuesday, saying that \"the golden age of America has most definitely begun.\"\n\n\"As you have seen during the past week, President Trump is hard at work fulfilling the promises that he made to the American people on the campaign trail,\" Leavitt said as she stepped into the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room shortly after 1 p.m. ET.\n\nDuring the briefing, Leavitt said that she plans to hold briefings frequently and said that Trump and the White House would be available to all media outlets as well as \"new media voices who produce related content\" such as \"independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers and content creators.\"\n\n“I can assure you that you’ll be hearing from both him and me as much as possible,” she said.\n\nHere's what to know about Leavitt, who, at 27 years old, is the youngest White House press secretary in U.S. history.\n\nWho is Karoline Leavitt? Age, hometown\n\nLeavitt is a 27-year-old New Hampshire native, who previously served as a spokesperson for the Trump 2024 presidential campaign. She was one of the early hires for the campaign, which had multiple spokespeople. Leavitt, who recently had a baby, was the most visible on television.\n\nLeavitt replaces Ronald Ziegler, who was previously the youngest press secretary at 29, when he took the position in 1969 under Richard Nixon’s administration.\n\nWhat does the White House press secretary do?\n\nThe White House press secretary serves as the public face of the administration and historically has held daily briefings for the press corps.\n\nSean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Stephanie Grisham and Kayleigh McEnany had previously served as Trump's press secretaries during his first administration.\n\nWhat did Trump say about Karoline Leavitt?\n\nWhile announcing Leavitt as the press secretary back in November, Trump in a statement, had described her as \"smart, tough,\" and \"a highly effective communicator.\"\n\n\"I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again,\" Trump had said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt career\n\nDuring Trump's first administration, Leavitt interned at the White House and joined Trump's team after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in politics and communication from Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. At the White House, Leavitt worked as a presidential writer and assistant press secretary under McEnany.\n\nIn 2022, Leavitt ran for Congress in New Hampshire. She won the GOP primary at the age of 25, but lost to the Democratic incumbent, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nLeavitt was the first Republican from Gen Z to win a House primary. Before running for Congress, she worked for Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican and Trump's UN Ambassador nominee.\n\nKaroline Leavitt family\n\nLeavitt shares a son, Nicholas Robert, who was born last year in July amid the election campaign with her husband Nick, a self-employed businessman. Leavitt told The Conservateur magazine that she jumped back to work four days after giving birth because she \"felt compelled to be present in this historic moment.”\n\n“The president literally put his life on the line to win this election,\" Leavitt told the magazine. \"The least I could do is get back to work quickly.”\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson, USA TODAY\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

While Australia swam to gold, the U.S. women took silver – and Ledecky made Olympic history in the process. But Team USA did not leave the Olympic pool Thursday without hearing the national anthem. Kate Douglass won the women's 200-meter breaststroke for her first Olympic gold medal.\n\nFencing continued to be a successful sport at these Olympics for Team USA. After winning gold and silver, respectively, earlier this week, in women's individual foil, Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs led the U.S. squad to gold in women's team foil. And the day kicked off with a celebration on the water as Team USA rowers earned the first gold medal in men's four since the 1960 Olympics.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports has a recap of all the results from Thursday, as well as the highlights, medal count, and more.\n\nOlympic surfing: American Carissa Moore, who won gold in Tokyo, eliminated\n\nThere will be a new gold medalist in women’s surfing after 2020 Tokyo Olympics winner Carissa Moore was knocked out in the quarterfinals.\n\nMoore wasn’t able to put up any spectacular waves against France’s Johanne Defay, who had herself a remarkable round that made it difficult to defeat. Defay advances to the semifinals and will next face American Caroline Marks, the last American – woman or man – remaining in the surfing competition being held in Teahupoʻo on the southeastern coast of the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia.\n\nThis will be the last competition for Moore, the decorated surfer out of Hawaii. She plans to step away from surfing and focus on starting a family. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOlympic surfing: American Caroline Marks advances to women’s semifinals\n\nThe U.S. will have at least one surfer in the women’s semifinals after Caroline Marks won her quarterfinal matchup against Tyler Wright of Australia. Olympic surfing is being held in Teahupoʻo on the southeastern coast of the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia.\n\nThe two surfers had solid best waves in the first half of the matchup, with Marks having just a slight lead. But in the second half, Marks was able to keep up her performance, while Wright struggled to get a spectacular wave to propel her to first. Marks won by more than two points.\n\nMarks' win means thre could be an American vs. American semifinal. She’ll await the winner of the quarerfinal between teammate Carissa Moore and France’s Johanne Defay. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nU.S. men’s 3x3 basketball team stunned, still seeking first win\n\nThe American men’s 3x3 basketball team has hit a new low.\n\nThe U.S. team was two points away from victory against 2020 Olympics gold winner Latvia, but the defending gold medalist went on a 6-0 run to win 21-19 and provide another devastating loss to Team USA. The U.S. team was up 19-15 with two minutes left, but Latvia completed the comeback in the next 100 seconds as Team USA missed its final four shot attempts.\n\nIt was a golden chance for the team to pick up momentum as it has an uphill battle to make the knockout round. The loss keeps the U.S. as the only winless team at 0-4. In last place out of eight teams, the top six teams advance to knockout play, and Team USA will likely need to win its final three games to advance. Meanwhile, Latvia is the only undefeated team at 4-0. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOlympic beach volleyball: U.S. women's team of Nuss and Kloth stay undefeated\n\nPARIS – Nothing has been able to stop the United States women’s beach volleyball tandem of Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nNot the rain or lightning that filled the skies around them Thursday night at Eiffel Tower Stadium. Not the 75-minute delay at the most pivotal point in the match when they had battled back from one set down. And definitely not any of the three teams they played during pool play to open the Games.\n\nNuss and Kloth are now off to the Round of 16 unblemished following an eventful three-set victory over China’s Xinyi Xia and Chen Xue – a gritty, come-from-behind victory for the young Americans with LeBron James in the stands. (“King James” did indeed wait out the weather.)\n\nAfter dropping the first set 21-15, the U.S. won the last two sets, 21-16, 15-12.\n\nOfficials called the match temporarily at 3-2 in the third. The teams traded points to 9-9 when a Chinese error gave the Americans a 10-9 lead. Nuss put it away for the final point of the game to complete the comeback.\n\nKloth had 21 attack points and recorded two blocks. Nuss had 11 digs and 14 attack points.\n\nIn the first set, the Americans could not find their footing and trailed 13-8 at the first timeout. China went on another 3-1 run to up the lead. An ace to make it 18-13 sealed the set and China took it 21-15. f\n\nIn the second, Nuss started running around like a Tasmanian devil in human form and mostly refused to let the ball hit the ground. She started feeling herself with the celebrations as the U.S. raced out to a 17-12 lead and secured the set, 21-16 – but not before China cut the deficit to two. Nuss drilled an ace to thwart any threat of a Chinese comeback in the frame.\n\nThe crowd began reacting with screams of “U” on the first hit, “S” on the second bump and “A” on the knock over the net.\n\nThen the rain started to fall. Lightning struck in the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Play continued. Nuss and Kloth only became stronger with the elements.\n\nThat was until the match was postponed. But it didn’t matter. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nOlympic golf: Tokyo gold medalist Xander Schauffele remains in winning form\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – The last time Xander Schauffele teed it up in an Olympics, he won a gold medal for Team USA. But it says something about how special Thursday was that Schauffele walked of the golf course saying, “It feels like I’m here (in the Olympics) for the first time.”\n\n“For me, Tokyo was really special, obviously. But there were no fans,” said Schauffele, referencing the games of three years ago defined by COVID-19 restrictions. “The city was closed. I was stuck in my hotel room. … (This) was an awesome atmosphere.”\n\nSchauffele, fresh off major victories at The PGA Championship and The Open Championship, is enjoying a bit of a moment right now. When those happen, you can shoot a 6-under-par 65 in the opening round of the Paris Olympics – and be 5 under at the turn – and then afterward bemoan your “clanky start.”\n\nYou could say that Schauffele stole the show Thursday, along with Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama (8 under), the lone player ahead of him entering Round 2. — Gentry Estes\n\nOlympic beach volleyball: Thunderstorms halt U.S. pair's match as crowds seek sheleter\n\nPARIS – The USA women’s beach volleyball team of Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth were in the beginning of the third set of their match against China’s Xinyi Xia and Chen Xue when severe weather forced everybody to shelter.\n\nLeading 3-2 in the decisive game (to 15 points), officials called the match despite the players forging through rain and lightning in the distance – the lightning as the background, the Eiffel Tower being the foreground for the Thursday evening, pro-U.S. crowd.\n\nBut as the storm approached over Eiffel Tower Stadium, heavy, cold rain, along with continued lightning and booms of thunder, sent the masses scattering.\n\nThe match is expected to resume at some point but that might be a while. China took the first set, 21-15, while Nuss and Kloth stormed back in the second to take it 21-16.\n\nThe start of the U.S. men's 3x3 basketball match vs. Latvia was also delayed because of the storm. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nU.S. women's basketball team wins again, unbeaten in Olympic Games since 1992\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team continued their road to another Olympic gold medal today against Belgium in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games group stage. The United States won 87-74, backed by Breanna Stewart's game-high 26 points.\n\nTwo-time WNBA MVP A'ja Wilson was a massive factor in Thursday's win as well, racking up 23 points and 13 rebounds. Wilson could very well be on pace for tournament MVP, should the United States win their eighth straight gold medal.\n\nBelgium entered the Olympics as Team USA's biggest threat in Group C as FIBA ranks Belgium No. 6 in the world. But they lost the first matchup of group play to Germany 83-69. Emma Meesseman had a game-high 25 points in the loss and Washington Mystics guard Julie Vanloo had 18 points and six assists.\n\nWith America's win, Team USA has clinched a spot in the quarterfinals and continue their journey to another gold. The U.S. women's team has not lost since the semifinals of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. — Jack McKessy\n\nRead more here from Lindsay Schnell: Why US women's basketball welcomed close, tough battle with Belgium\n\nOlympic golf: American Wyndham Clark struggles in opening round\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – The thing about Wyndham Clark is he’s a streaky golfer.\n\nWhen he’s right, he’s as good as anybody. You remember, right? He won the 2023 U.S. Open. Earlier this year, he shot a 60 to win a shortened event at Pebble Beach. He was second at Bay Hill, tied for second at The Players.\n\nClark has demonstrated why he deserved to be one of only four Americans who qualified for these Paris Olympics.\n\nHe just hasn’t shown it lately.\n\nAnd that includes Thursday’s Olympics first round at Le Golf National. While most of the 60-player field took advantage of ideal scoring conditions on Day 1, Clark opened with a 4-over 75. His first three holes: bogey, double bogey, bogey. Though he stabilized from there, he closed with another double on No. 15.\n\nClark is tied for 56th, one stroke above dead last. He's one of only 13 players over par. Were there a cut in this tournament, he’d surely miss it. Unless Clark gets real hot, real fast – Pebble Beach-style – the number of Americans golfers in realistic medal contention at these Olympics is already down from four to three. — Gentry Estes\n\nUSA women’s 3x3 basketball team finally wins after opening 0-3\n\nFinally, a Team USA 3x3 basketball team won at the Paris Olympics.\n\nIn its fourth game in Paris, the U.S. women became the first to snap a streak of six total winless efforts between themselves and the equally floundering men's team. They defeated Spain, 17-11, on Thursday.\n\nHailey van Lith and Rhyne Howard each scored five points (and one two-pointer apiece) in the victory. The team has two more games in pool play before the knockout stage begins. And if they don’t figure it out soon, they won’t last long once that begins.\n\nHoward finally showed some of her shooting capabilities by drilling four two-pointers on six attempts from deep to keep the U.S. in the game. The Americans pulled away in the final minute to secure the all-important first win with one more game to play before the knockout round begins. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nKatie Ledecky makes history as Team USA 4x200 relay squad secures silver\n\nHistory in the pool: Australia wins gold in the women’s 4x200 freestyle relay. USA, with Katie Ledecky, gets silver.\n\nThat’s Ledecky’s 13th Olympic medal. She has now won the most medals by a female American Olympian, in any sport, ever. China finished out the podium, finishing third. – Christine Brennan\n\nTeam USA men's doubles tennis team ends Andy Murray's career\n\nPARIS — The great Andy Murray’s tennis career ended on Suzanne Lenglen Court on Thursday evening, as Americans Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul took out Murray and his partner Dan Evans, 6-2, 6-4.\n\nMurray, arguably the greatest British sportsman in history, announced he would be leaving tennis after the Olympics due to the cumulative toll of numerous injuries.\n\nMurray will best be remembered for twice winning Wimbledon, ending a 77-year drought of British men winning the event. But in many ways, his career is uniquely linked with the Olympics. – Dan Wolken\n\nOlympic fencing: Team USA women's foil team wins gold\n\nPARIS — The United States is fast becoming a world power in women’s team foil, and now it has the hardware to prove it.\n\nThe U.S. beat top-seeded Italy for its first-ever gold medal in the event Thursday at the Grand Palais, 45-39, capping a brilliant Olympics that also saw fencers Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs win individual gold and silver.\n\nThree years after losing to the Italians, 45-23, in a lopsided bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics, the American women were the early aggressors on their way to their second medal in women's team foil's 64-year Olympic history.\n\nThe U.S. won silver in the event in 2008, but with less individual success than the team enjoyed this summer. Kiefer beat Scruggs in the individual final, 15-6, marking the first time the country has gone 1-2 in the sport in the Olympics. – Dave Birkett\n\nKate Douglass wins 200-meter breastsroke final, sets American record\n\nNANTERRE, France — Team USA’s Kate Douglass is officially an Olympic champion, winning the women’s 200-meter breaststroke final Thursday with a time of 2:19. 24 – a new American record.\n\nIt’s the 22-year-old two-time Olympian’s third medal overall and second at the Paris Olympics after winning silver in the women’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay.\n\nDouglass out-touched defending Olympic champion Tatjana Smith of South Africa, who won silver with a time of 2:19.60. Smith won the gold in the women's 100-meter breaststroke. The Netherlands' Tes Schouten took bronze in 2:21.05. Team USA three-time Olympian Lilly King finished eighth in 2:25.91. – Michelle R.

She suffered an Achilles injury during her round of 16 match in Tokyo, but was healthy as she took the court Thursday.\n\nMoreover, she entered the Paris Olympics with the hope of becoming the first American to win an Olympic medal in badminton. The dream still was alive with the score in the third set against Marin locked at 15-15.\n\nAlas, Zhang she noted Marin’s experience in high-stakes matches when asked about the final outcome of their badminton battle. – Josh Peter\n\nNovak Djokovic dealing with knee injury in matchup vs. Tsitsipas\n\nSerbia's Novak Djokovic is aiming to win his second Olympic medal, but he may have to fight through an injury to get there.\n\nDuring his matchup with Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, trainers took a look at Djokovic's surgically repaired knee. Djokovic did not withdraw, and headed to a third set vs. Tsitsipas.\n\nHow high can Simone Biles jump?\n\nAt the U.S. Olympic Trials in June, the top of Biles’ head got as high as 12 feet above the surface on one of the jumps during her floor exercise routine, NBC Sports calculated.\n\nJust like Simone Biles flying through the air on vault, NBC’s viewership numbers for the women’s gymnastics team final at the Paris Olympics were through the roof.\n\nNBC’s live daytime broadcast of the women’s gymnastics team final averaged 12.7 million viewers across NBC and Peacock, marking the event as one of the network’s top weekday daytime events in Olympic history.\n\nThis meant that more people tuned in live to watch Team USA’s gold medal-winning performance than for any single game of the 2024 NBA Finals or the first round of the 2024 NFL draft. – Carrie McDonald\n\nPair of U.S. boxers defeated\n\nAmerican boxers Jennifer Lozano and Morelle McCane both missed out on opportunities to advance for medals on Thursday.\n\nLozano (50kg) fell to Finnish fighter Pihla Kaivo-Oja, who won the fight on judge's scorecards in all three rounds.\n\nIn the women's 66kg division, McCane faced Uzbekistan's Navbakhor Khamidova. Judges awarded the fight to Khamidova on a 3-2 split decision.\n\nTeam USA men's 3x3 basketball loses third straight to open group play\n\nPARIS — The U.S. men’s basketball 3x3 team cannot get off the schneid.\n\nWithout Jimmer Fredette, who is dealing with a right leg injury that prevented him from playing, the U.S. lost its third straight game to open pool play of the Olympics, as Lithuania pulled away late from the U.S. to win 20-18.\n\nCanyon Barry picked up the slack in Fredette’s stead and had nine points. Kareem Maddox finished with five. Barry had a chance to tie it at the buzzer following a defensive stop but his attempt from 2-point land clanked off the front rim.\n\nFans clapped for Fredette as the in-house emcees noted his absence from the contest. – Chris Bumbaca\n\nTeam USA women's field hockey squad remains winless\n\nIt's not the trip to Paris that the U.S. women's field hockey team envisioned.\n\nThrough four matches in Pool B, Team USA is still search for its first victory after losing 5-2 to Great Britain on Thursday.\n\nThe Americans were tight at the half, trailing a goal to Great Britain, but a dominant second half by the Brits put the game away.\n\nThe U.S. is in fifth place in Pool B and close out group play on Saturday, Aug. 3 at 1:15 p.m. vs. South Africa, who is also winless.\n\nJake Paul, an honorary coach of the U.S. Olympic boxing team, sounded off on Thursday.\n\nPaul, the social media influencer and pro boxer, joined a chorus of objectors following an Olympic women’s boxing match that included an Algerian fighter whose gender eligibility has come under question.\n\nThe Algerian, Imane Khelif, won her opening bout Thursday after landing a single punch – on the nose of Italy’s Angela Carini.\n\nSoon after, Carini quit − 46 seconds into the bout. She wept in the ring and during interviews with reporters.\n\n“This is sickening,’’ Paul wrote on his verified X account. \"This is a travesty. Doesn’t matter what you believe. This is wrong and dangerous.’’ – Josh Peter\n\nTeam USA men's beach volleyball squad makes coaching change\n\nAmidst their quest for a medal, the men's beach volleyball squad of Miles Partain and Andy Benesh have decided to make a coaching change, dismissing bench boss Mike Plasek on Thursday.\n\nThe decision was somewhat surprising.\n\n“There was a team meeting and a team decision to not move forward with their coach,” NBC beach volleyball broadcaster Dain Blanton reported during the opening set of the match. – Mark Giannotto\n\nSimone Biles goes for gold in women's gymnastics all-around final\n\nSimone Biles is looking to extend her Olympic gymnastics record medal count on Thursday when she competes in the gymnastics all-around final. USA TODAY Sports is providing live updates, highlights and more from the events.\n\nOlympic golf: Play again suspended due to lightning\n\nAfter a brief restart of play in Round 1, the Olympic golf tournament was again halted due to lightning in the area. Rain has played into the blueprint for Thursday's Games, with drizzles expected to hit the area until early evening.\n\nOlympic golf: Play resumes after brief weather stoppage\n\nAfter lightning halted Round 1 of the Olympic golf tourney, play resumed at 11:05 a.m. ET (5:05 p.m. local). Xander Schauffele looks to finish his round strong as the top American on the leaderboard.\n\nOlympic golf: Lightning suspends first round of play\n\nThe threat of lightning has suspended the first round of play in the 2024 Olympic golf tournament. At the time of suspension, Japan's Hideki Matsuyama sat at the top of the heap at 8-under. American Xander Schauffele and Mexican Carlos Ortiz are tied at 2-under.\n\nU.S. men's doubles tennis to play for gold\n\nDespite the quick turnaround from their men's doubles win over Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal, the American team of Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek cruised through their semifinal Thursday afternoon and will play for a gold medal.\n\nRam/Krajicek defeated Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlasek of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-2, needing only 61 minutes to get the job done.\n\nRam and Krajicek are two of the most accomplished doubles players in the world, who prepared for the Paris Olympics by playing together in Davis Cup competitions the last two years.\n\nRam, 40, won a silver medal in Rio eight years ago in the mixed doubles alongside Venus Williams. He has won four Grand Slam titles in men's doubles.\n\nKrajicek, 34, was ranked No. 1 for a time last year after winning the French Open doubles, his first major.\n\nInterestingly, it could be an All-American final if Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul beat Andy Murray and Dan Evans of Great Britain later Thursday afternoon.\n\nThis is the last professional tournament for Murray, a two-time gold medalist in singles and three-time Grand Slam champion, who has struggled with injuries for several years. – Dan Wolken\n\nAmericans off to strong start in Olympic golf\n\nAmericans Xander Schauffele and Scottie Scheffler are off to good starts in the first round of Olympic golf at Golf National in Paris. Schauffle, who won the 2024 PGA Championship and 2024 British Open, trails Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (-8) by one stroke through 14 holes.\n\nMeanwhile, Scheffler, the World's No. 1 golfer and 2024 Masters champion, carded a -4 and currently sits tied for 10th place.\n\nThe 60 contenders will all play four rounds in a stroke play format, with the medalists taking the fewest number of shots to complete the 72 holes.\n\nPARIS — The queen of Roland Garros was dethroned Thursday in the Olympic semifinals – by a different kind of queen.\n\nNo. 6 Qinwen Zheng – or QUEEN-wen, as she enjoys being called around the WTA Tour – took out No. 1 Iga Swiatek, 6-2, 7-5, in a stunner that will give China a chance to win its first gold medal in tennis on Saturday.\n\nSwiatek, a four-time French Open champion at this venue, hadn't lost a match at Roland Garros since the 2021 quarterfinals. She came into the Olympics as a massive favorite, but perhaps felt a different kind of pressure trying to win gold for Poland, her home country.\n\nInstead, she'll have to settle at best for the bronze medal.\n\nZheng will play either Donna Vekic of Croatia or Anna-Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia for the gold medal. − Dan Wolken\n\nMichael Phelps leading Team U-S-A chants at Olympic golf\n\nMichael Phelps, who is serving as a commentator for NBC during the Games, is taking in the first round of Olympic golf at Golf National in Paris. The a 23-time gold medalist is at the first tee cheering on the Americans in front of a raucous crowd.\n\nIf you recall, Phelps and rapper Snoop Dogg, who's also a commentator for NBC, entered the pool in a segment on Tuesday.\n\nSmith, Bacon advance to semis in women's 200m backstroke\n\nPARIS - American swimmers Regan Smith and Phoebe Bacon advanced to the semifinals of the women's 200-meter backstroke early Thursday morning at Paris La Defense Arena.\n\nBacon, in her first race of the Paris 2024 Olympics, finished fourth in a time of 2:09. Smith (2:09.61) was sixth.\n\nThe top 16 racers move on to the semis. − Dave Birkett\n\nWorld No. 1 women's archer upset\n\nWorld No. 1 archer Casey Kaufhold of the United States was upset 7-3 by Lei Chien-Ying of Taiwan on Thursday, knocking Kaufhold out of the women's individual archery competition in the second round.\n\nKaufhold's opponent shot three perfect 10s in the final set to slam the door on Kaufhold's individual medal hopes in the 20-year-old's second Olympics.\n\nShe still has a shot for a medal alongside Team USA's Brady Ellison in the mixed competition on Friday. − Gentry Estes\n\nPARIS – So far, not a good start for the reigning champion 3x3 women’s basketball team. Not good at all.\n\nThe Americans dropped their third straight game to open pool play at the tournament, this one a 17-15 loss to Australia on Thursday. The team has two more games in pool play before the knockout stage begins. And if they don’t figure it out soon, they won’t last long once that begins.\n\nNow it’s back to the drawing board – again – for the USA. Frustrations are mounting.\n\n“Everybody’s got the same refs,” Cierra Burdick said. “I don’t worry about things that are out of my control. Some people get good calls, some people get bad calls, that’s basketball.”\n\nAfter the opening loss to Germany two days ago, Hailey van Lith said the team’s intensity needed to improve.\n\n“I think the effort was a little bit better,” Burdick said. “But we got to find another gear to tap into. Because we’re not getting it done.”\n\nThe improvement would come during group play, the Americans have been saying. But for Burdick, it hasn’t come quickly enough.\n\n“I think we’re getting a little bit better, but not at the pace that I’d like,” she said. “But we gotta find our way.” − Chris Bumbaca\n\nPARIS – Algeria's Imane Khelif, one of two female Olympic boxers disqualified from the 2023 world championships after failing gender eligibility tests, entered the ring Thursday at the Paris Games.\n\nIt ended in abrupt and bizarre fashion.\n\nKhelif prevailed when Italy’s Angela Carini stopped fighting 46 seconds into the bout. The fight in the welterweight division at 66 kg (146 pounds) was scheduled for three three-minute rounds.\n\nThe issue of gender eligibility criteria surfaced at the 2023 world championships when Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan both won medals in the women’s competition before tournament officials announced the boxers had failed gender eligibility tests. They were stripped of their medals. − Josh Peter\n\nTeam USA advances to the semis in women's team foil\n\nPARIS - Lee Kiefer is going for gold again, and this time she's bringing the rest of the U.S. women's foil team with her.\n\nKiefer, who beat teammate Lauren Scruggs for gold in individual foil on Sunday, and Team USA advanced to the semifinals in women's team foil Thursday with a 45-37 win over China in its table of eight match.\n\nThe U.S. women will face the winner of Canada-France in its semifinal match. Italy and Japan meet in the other semifinal.\n\nKiefer has won gold in individual foil at the past two Olympics, while Scruggs, a 21-year-old student at Harvard, won her first Olympic medal Sunday.\n\nJacqueline Dubrovich, a two-time Olympian, is the third member of the foil team. −Dave Birkett\n\nVAIRES-SUR-MARNE, France − Team USA rowers Nick Mead, Justin Best, Michael Grady and Liam Corrigan won a gold medal Thursday at the Paris Olympics in the finals of the men's four competition.

Ellison defeated Abdullah Yildirmis of Turkey 6-2 in the first round and Kao Wenchao of China by the same score in the second round. The final four rounds of the men's archery competition will play out Sunday.\n\nA five-time Olympian, Ellison has long been considered one of the world’s best. He has three medals in his past − but no gold medals.\n\nMen's 50-meter rifle results\n\nLiu Yukun extended China's gold medal lead by winning the men's 50-meter rifle 3 positions event, with a total score of 463.6. Serhiy Kulish secured Ukraine's second medal of these Games, claiming silver with a score of 461.3. India's Swapnil Kusale took the bronze with a score of 451.4.\n\nOlympic track predictions\n\nWho will be the big winners in track and field at the Paris Olympics? USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon predicts the podium for every event.\n\nMen's race walk results\n\nIt's quite early in the United States, but medals are already being awarded in Paris.\n\nBrian Daniel Pintado of Ecuador won the gold medal in the men's 20K race walk, crossing the line first with a time of 1:18:55. Caio Bonfim of Brazil took second (1:19:09) and Spain's Alvaro Martin placed third (1:19:11).\n\nOlympics schedule today\n\nHere are some Olympic schedule highlights.
