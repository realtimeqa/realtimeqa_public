But here's the deal: You can see it only by being shot in the eye with a laser.\n\nScientists at the University of California, Berkeley, who have witnessed the new color they dubbed \"olo\" described it as a deep, rich blue-greenish hue that can't be seen with the naked human eye.\n\n\"It's a variation of a blue-green, teal or peacock green color, all of those could be considered as accurate descriptions,\" Ren Ng, an electrical engineer and computer science professor at Berkeley, told USA TODAY. \"But I think it's deeper than that because of the saturation level. I'd describe it and say it's the most intense teal you can see in the world. It's that striking.\"\n\nThe researchers published their study in the journal Science Advances on April 18. But how does it work? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWavelengths in your eyes\n\nThere are three types of cone cells in the eye – S, L, and M – each one sensitive to different wavelengths of the colors blue, red and green.\n\nThe researchers' study said that in normal vision, \"any light that stimulates an M cone cell must also stimulate its neighboring L and/or S cones\" because its function overlaps with them.\n\nBut in their study, a laser stimulated only M cones, \"which in principle would send a color signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision,\" the researchers wrote. Seeing the color olo needed specific stimulation to push the vision beyond its normal limits.\n\nFive human subjects were able to see the color, including Berkeley researcher Hannah Doyle and Austin Roorda, an optometry and vision science professor who was also on the research team.\n\nTwo participants were University of Washington scientists who weren't aware of the experiment's purpose.\n\nThe doses of laser lights individually controlled up to 1,000 photoreceptors in the human eye at once, according to the research. Participants also were asked to try to match olo using a controllable color, coming closest with a shade of teal.\n\nBeyond a new color\n\nNg and fellow researchers said they spent four years experimenting – but they believe their research goes beyond presenting a novel new color.\n\nThe researchers told USA TODAY they hope the technology could create new ways to help those who suffer from color-blindness and allow scientists to better interpret how a person's brain perceives color through the distinctions between the cone cells in your eyes.\n\nDoyle, a fourth-year graduate student, told USA TODAY there's also interest in using the technology for studying retinal diseases such as cone cell loss, which could lead to decreased color perception and increased sensitivity to light, and other diseases that could lead to blindness.\n\n\"This will definitely lead to lots of opportunities for follow-up research,\" she said.\n\nKids' eyesight is getting worse: Special contact lenses may be the answer.\n\n\"Overcoming optical limitations with adaptive optics has allowed us to make new discoveries in vision science, from mapping the trichromatic cone mosaic for the first time ever, to learning how human visual acuity responds to an aberration correction,\" Roorda said, referencing the three kinds of cone cells in eyes and remedying certain kinds of problems in the human eye.\n\nThe research raised questions for some experts. John Barbur, a vision scientist at City St George’s, University of London, told the Guardian he doesn't believe the discovery is necessarily a new color.\n\n“It’s a more saturated green that can only be produced in a subject with normal red-green chromatic mechanism when the only input comes from M cones,” he told the outlet.\n\nAnd don't expect olo to appear as a paint or paper color or get its own crayon anytime soon, Ng said. Though there is a vision for others to see it on a virtual reality headset, the researchers will continue to \"purify and perfect\" more versions of olo.\n\n\"Olo is a starting point, not an ending point,\" Ng said. \"We want to make sure this cell-by-cell display is working correctly.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/04/23/new-snake-species-four-foot-black-tree-snake/83209923007/", "title": "Meet the coal black tree snake, a newly discovered species", "text": "A new species of snake was recently discovered after scientists spotted it taking on a hawk on a Papua New Guinea island.\n\nMeasuring as long as 4 feet, 8 inches, the Dendrelaphis anthracina, or coal black tree snake, was identified by scientist Fred Kraus while visiting Sudest Island (also called Vanatinai and Tagula Island).\n\nIn a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Zootaxa on April 4, Kraus described his trip to four different islands, each of which housed a not-yet-classified species of reptile. He was seeking to study groups of tree-dwelling snakes known as the Dendrelaphis genus, a group Kraus described in his research as \"confusing\" and \"poorly understood.\"\n\nOn Sudest, he observed a shiny, large species of snake notable for its jet-black color, black eyes and white chin. While studying the species, which he spotted in ecologically diverse areas on the island from \"rainforest to villages and gardens established by humans,\" Kraus witnessed the snake turn its predator, a hawk, into prey.\n\nOne of six of the elusive creatures that Kraus managed to track down was found wrapped around a goshawk (a hawk with a wingspan of up to 46 inches) that had apparently tried to attack, rendering it \"immobile by the snake’s enveloping defensive reaction.”\n\nSo far, the snake, named for the Latin word that roughly means \"coal black,\" has only been found on Sudest Island, though the study notes it could possibly exist on nearby small islands.\n\nThree other new snake species identified\n\nKraus also identified new snake species endemic to three other Papua New Guinea islands: Misima Island, Rossel Island and Woodlark Island.\n\nOn Misima Island, he found more large snakes with white chins, black eyes and black coloring, though these slightly smaller 4-foot, 1-inch reptiles lacked the same lustrous sheen as the coal black tree snakes of Sudest.\n\nNamed Dendrelaphis atra, or the atra tree snake, after the Latin word for black, these snakes are described as having a \"matte black\" color that develops in adulthood. Before they reach maturity, says Kraus' study, they sport a more \"gray brown” hue.\n\nAlso found in villages, gardens and rainforest ridges, the species was at first confused with the one found on Sudest before unique elements such as its size, color and scale pattern were studied. Uniquely, atra tree snakes were found in areas heavily developed by humans, such as on a mining site and near buildings.\n\nAs with the coal black tree snake, the atra tree snake has thus far only been found on its initial island of discovery, Misima.\n\nAnother new snake species has orange eyes\n\nOn Rossel Island, Kraus found Dendrelaphis melanarkys, or the black net tree snake. This 4-foot, 11-inch reptile is easier to differentiate thanks to its orange eyes, smooth dark scales with a net-like pattern and dark tongue color.\n\nNamed after the Greek words for “black” and “net,\" the species was again found to inhabit both the local rainforest and human-made facilities on the island, including the abandoned site of the former village of Bibikea. The species also has only been found on one island.\n\nThe Dendrelaphis roseni, or Rosen’s tree snake, found on Woodlark Island, is the smallest of the newly discovered species, measuring only about 3 feet, 5 inches. Found only on Woodlark Island, the snake was named after Kraus' \"late friend, snake ecologist and conservationist\" Clark Rosen, said the study.\n\nLike the atra tree snake, Rosen's tree snake is a lighter color in adolescence before developing its black pattern in adulthood. Also like the other species on nearby islands, the Rosen's tree snake is found in the rainforest, villages and gardens tended by humans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/03/capitojoppa-wasp-found-amazon-rainforest/71003766007/", "title": "New wasp species discovered by Amazon rainforest scientists: What ...", "text": "Scientists have discovered a new wasp species in the Amazon rain forests of Peru.\n\nAccording to a newly published study in ZooKeys Journal, the discovery was made at the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve by scientists from the University of Turku in Finland who have researched biodiversity in the area for over 20 years.\n\nThe new wasp genus called amazonica Capitojoppa is one of several species unknown to science which were discovered in what is often described as the most biodiverse rainforest on Earth, said Brandon Claridge from Utah State University in a news release. Claridge also adds that more newly discovered species will be described in future studies. He also states that wasps belonging to the subfamily Ichneumoninae are usually large and colorful, “especially in the tropics,” and each genus’ name often describes the species’ characteristics or range.\n\n“The wasps of the (Capitojoppa) genus have a large head, which is reflected in the capito part of the name,” Claridge explained. “The joppa part of the name refers to the wasp genus Joppa that the Capitojoppa resembles.\"\n\nShrinking bodies, growing wings: Climate change having odd effect on birds, study finds\n\nExploring the Amazon rainforest: How many countries does it include? How big is it?\n\nThe Amazon is shared by eight countries — Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname — as well as the overseas territory of French Guiana, making it the world’s largest tropical rainforest, according to the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF). The Amazon Biome is twice the size of India — spanning 1.6 billion acres — and encompasses a variety of cultures, landscapes and ecosystems, including rainforests, floodplain forests, savanna and rivers, according to WWF.\n\nAccording to Audubon, the Peruvian Amazon encompasses almost 60 percent of the country and is second only to the Brazilian Amazon in size.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is home to far more species of birds and more species per unit area than any other biome on Earth, and the Allpahuayo-Mishana is a part of it that has an “unprecedented abundance of species,” study co-author Ilari Sääksjärvi — a Professor of Biodiversity Research at the University of Turku, said in the release.\n\nThe wonder and diversity of the Amazon rainforest\n\nA 2017 World Wide Fund For Nature and Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development report found that a new animal or plant species is discovered in the Amazon every two days. The report states that this is “the fastest rate to be observed this century.”\n\n“Due to the region's complex geological history, there are several different types of rainforest growing in the Reserve,” Sääksjärvi said.\n\nAmerican botanist Alwyn Gentry first flung Allpahuyao-Mishana into the spotlight in the late 1980s after documenting the highest number of tree species at a single locality known to date, according to the news release. In recent decades, scientists have also discovered several new bird species from the region.\n\nWhile the biodiversity hotspot has gained prominence in the scientific community and is recognized for its critical role in maintaining climate function globally, the land and all inhabitants have undergone significant changes due to humans, according to Sääksjärvi.

Tarantulas tend to exhibit less iridescence but maintain the ability to reflect the hue in a specific narrow band of wavelengths.\n\nIn order to appear blue, the tarantula has to absorb very small amounts of energy while reflecting high-energy blue light, according to an article from EurekAlert!\n\nThe electric blue color comes from the presence of two types of hair found on the arachnid, metallic blue and violet specifically.\n\nThe hairs are present on various parts of the body, including the legs, chelicera, carapace. But how the color is distributed on the body depends on the sex of the spider, the journal states.\n\n“The secret behind the vivid blue coloration of our tarantula lies not in the presence of blue pigments, but rather in the unique structure of their hair, which incorporates nanostructures that manipulate light to create this striking blue appearance,” lead scientist Dr. Narin Chomphuphuang of Khon Kaen University in Thailand wrote.\n\nHow did they find the electric blue spider?\n\nAfter scientists discovered a different tarantula species living amidst the bamboo stalks last year, Chomphuphuang and a team of researchers decided to venture out into the jungle one more time to see what they could find, the EurekAlert! stated.\n\n“Thanks to this discovery, we were inspired to rejoin the team for a fantastic expedition, during which we encountered a captivating new species of electric blue tarantula,” Chomphuphuang wrote.\n\nThe first electric blue spider the expedition team found was on a tree in the mangrove forest.\n\nSince they live in hollow trees, the only way scientists could lure the spider out of the tree was by climbing it. They only managed to collect two spiders despite the search occurring in the evening and at night in low tide.\n\nWhat makes this find so special?\n\nWhat makes this find particularly remarkable is that no documentation prior to this discovery noted its distinctive features or natural habitat. The species was only previously seen on the commercial tarantula market.\n\nThe electric blue tarantula demonstrates remarkable adaptability. These tarantulas can thrive in arboreal as well as terrestrial burrows in evergreen forests. However, when it comes to mangrove forests, their habitat is restricted to residing inside tree hollows due to the influence of tides,” according to Chomphuphuang.\n\nIt is one of the world’s rarest tarantulas.\n\nSince the electric blue tarantula’s natural environment could face deforestation, Chomphuphuang has said preservation and conservation projects are essential in preventing further declines in the tarantula populations and to protect future generations.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/31/aurora-borealis-new-aurora-dunes-discovered-finland/4623284002/", "title": "Aurora borealis: New aurora, -- the 'dunes' -- discovered in Finland", "text": "The dunes appear as thin ribbons of green light in the sky.\n\nResearchers suspect the dunes are visible manifestations of air undulations called atmospheric waves.\n\nAt about 60 miles in altitude, this region of the atmosphere is notoriously difficult to study.\n\nAmateur photographers in Finland have discovered a new form of aurora, scientists announced in a new study published this week.\n\nNicknamed \"the dunes,\" the aurora is helping scientists better understand a mysterious layer of Earth's atmosphere.\n\n“For the first time we can actually observe atmospheric waves through the aurora – this is something that hasn’t been done before,” said Minna Palmroth, a space physicist at the University of Helsinki and lead author of the new study.\n\nThe aurora – nighttime light displays in the atmosphere near Earth’s poles – take on various shapes and forms, the American Geophysical Union said. They often appear as rippling curtains of green, red, or purple light.\n\nBut in October 2018, amateur auroral photographers in Finland discovered a new auroral form that resemble a striped veil of clouds or dunes on a sandy beach.\n\nThe dunes appear as thin ribbons of green light in the sky, extending toward the equator for hundreds of miles. Most auroral light displays are oriented vertically, like curtains hanging down from the sky, but the dunes are arranged horizontally, like fingers reaching toward the horizon.\n\nAccording to the study, the researchers suspect the dunes are visible manifestations of air undulations called atmospheric waves. If their theory proves correct, the dunes could provide a way to understand a part of Earth’s upper atmosphere that is notoriously difficult to study.\n\nAt about 60 miles in altitude, this region of the atmosphere is too high for balloons and planes to reach, but too low for satellites and spacecraft to directly observe, the American Geophysical Union said.\n\n\"Collaborations with citizen scientists are getting increasingly important because they can become 'mobile sensors' that chase interesting aurora easily and catch new features that scientists didn't notice before,\" Toshi Nishimura, a research associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Boston University's Center for Space Physics, who was not part of the study, told Space.com.\n\nFor centuries, the aurora borealis, aka the northern lights, have fascinated skywatchers. It forms when particles flowing from the sun get caught up in the Earth's magnetic field. The particles then interact with molecules of atmospheric gases to cause the famed glowing red and green colors of the aurora.\n\nThe lights are visible in both the far northern and southern parts of the world.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFar beneath the waves surrounding the Maldives, there’s a living rainbow in the ocean’s “twilight zone.” Say hello to the rose-veiled fairy wrasse, a colorful species of fish that’s new to science.\n\nThe fish, which bears the scientific name Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa, was found living at depths ranging from 131 to 229 feet (40 to 70 meters) beneath the ocean’s surface.\n\nThe name honors the fish’s stunning pink hues, as well as the pink rose, the national flower of the Maldives. “Finifenmaa” means “rose” in the local Dhivehi language.\n\nThe waters of the Maldives are home to a hundreds of species of fish. Claudia Rocha © California Academy of Sciences\n\nWhile hundreds of species thrive in the waters near and surrounding the archipelago nation, this is the first fish to be described by a Maldivian scientist – Ahmed Najeeb. A study describing the fish published Tuesday in the journal ZooKeys.\n\n“It has always been foreign scientists who have described species found in the Maldives without much involvement from local scientists, even those that are endemic to the Maldives,” said study coauthor Najeeb, a biologist at the Maldives Marine Research Institute, in a statement.\n\n“This time it is different and getting to be part of something for the first time has been really exciting, especially having the opportunity to work alongside top ichthyologists on such an elegant and beautiful species.”\n\nA fish by any other name\n\nThe fish has a history of mistaken identity. Researchers first found it in the 1990s, but they thought it was an adult belonging to Cirrhilabrus rubrisquamis, or the red velvet fairy wrasse. This different species had only been described from a single juvenile fish found 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) south of the Maldives in the Chagos Archipelago.\n\nWrasses, a family of largely bright colored fishes, have been known to change in color as they transition from juveniles to adults, said senior study author Luiz Rocha, the California Academy of Sciences curator of ichthyology, in an email.\n\nWhile the juveniles of many species look alike, it’s the adults who carry distinguishing characteristics, he said.\n\nThe scientific name Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa is a nod to the pink rose, the Maldivian national flower. © Yi-Kai Tea\n\n“A few months ago, Yi-Kai Tea (our first author) received (remotely operated vehicle) footage from Chagos showing adults, which were very different from the adults from the Maldives,” Rocha said. “That’s when we decided that the species from the Maldives was new and different from C. rubrisquamis.”\n\nIn their study, the researchers focused on the details of adults and juveniles, analyzing the height of the spines supporting their dorsal fins, counting scales and cataloging the colors of the adult males.\n\nThe rose-veiled fairy wrasse adult males have a unique color pattern including bright magenta, peach, orange-pink and dark purplish-red.\n\nDiscovering that finifenmaa and rubrisquamis were two separate species can help scientists understand the range of these fish, which becomes especially important when trying to protect them.\n\n(From left) Ahmed Najeeb and Luiz Rocha inspect some fish they collected during a recent expedition in the Maldives. Claudia Rocha © California Academy of Sciences\n\n“What we previously thought was one widespread species of fish, is actually two different species, each with a potentially much more restricted distribution,” said lead author Yi-Kai Tea, a University of Sydney doctoral student, in a statement. “This exemplifies why describing new species, and taxonomy in general, is important for conservation and biodiversity management.”\n\nThe name may be new, but the rose-veiled fairy wrasse is already a target of the aquarium hobby trade.\n\n“Though the species is quite abundant and therefore not currently at a high risk of overexploitation, it’s still unsettling when a fish is already being commercialized before it even has a scientific name,” said Rocha, also a codirector of the California Academy of Sciences Hope for Reefs initiative. “It speaks to how much biodiversity there is still left to be described from coral reef ecosystems.”\n\nExploring ‘twilight zone’ reefs\n\nThe Hope for Reefs initiative aims to research and restore coral reef systems. Last month, researchers from Hope for Reefs and the Maldives Marine Research Institute surveyed some of the Maldives’ twilight zone reefs.\n\nThese reefs can be 160 to 500 feet (50 to 150 meters) beneath the ocean’s surface and provide a unique environment for fish like fairy wrasses.\n\n“It’s a really different environment: It’s darker (because the water functions as a filter absorbing light, so the deeper you go, the darker it gets) and colder,” Rocha said. “There are much fewer corals, and almost no algae (because of the lack of light), so the fish community is very different and most fish at this depth feed on plankton (tiny marine invertebrates that live in the water column).”\n\nThe recent dives, funded by an award from Rolex, show just how difficult it is to survey the largely unexplored twilight zone reefs – located below recreational diving limits. The divers must use rebreathers and helium mixed into the gas they breathe to avoid the negative effects of breathing oxygen under so much pressure, in addition to using an abundance of gear that requires a lot of training, Rocha said.\n\nBut it’s well worth it, according to the researchers.\n\n“Diving there is like visiting another planet,” Rocha said. “We are always the first ones to see those reefs, and always find new species. It is very challenging, but also very exciting!”\n\nDivers prepare to explore the twilight zone reefs of the Maldives during a recent expedition. Claudia Rocha © California Academy of Sciences\n\nDuring the recent surveys, the research team found more of the rose-veiled fairy wrasse as well as at least eight potential new species of fish.\n\nThe California Academy of Sciences and the Maldives Marine Research Institute are continuing their partnership to explore more Maldivian reefs in the future.\n\n“Our partnership will help us better understand the unexplored depths of our marine ecosystems and their inhabitants,” Najeeb said. “The more we understand and the more compelling scientific evidence we can gather, the better we can protect them.”\n\n“We hope to collect a few more specimens of the other eight new species we recently found,” Rocha said. “Additionally, we are closely working with our Maldivian partners to keep using Maldivian names in our species.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/18/bastetodon-syrtos-egypt-video/79067961007/", "title": "Watch scientists uncover skull of 30-million-year-old apex predator", "text": "In a rare find, a team of scientists in Egypt uncovered a nearly complete skull that offers insight into a not-before-discovered apex predator species that lived 30 million years ago.\n\nPublished on Monday in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the results of the desert dig painted the picture of a fearsome, big-cat creature with a strong jaw and sharp teeth that occupied the spot at the top of the food chain during the Oligocene Epoch era. Discovered in Fayum, Egypt, the powerful predator would have lived in a then-tropical rainforest environment.\n\nThe newly-discovered species, named Bastetodon syrtos, is part of the Hyaenodonta family, an extinct species of carnivore that evolved long before modern cats, dogs and hyenas but resembled early versions of modern big cats. This lineage once ruled the food chain in the time after dinosaurs went extinct, preying on primates, early hippos, early elephants and hyraxes, but were later wiped out themselves.\n\nIn life, the Bastetodon was leopard-sized with a short, cat-like snout, hyena-like teeth and a dog-like body.\n\nA 'dream' discovery\n\nThe discovery of the most complete skull ever found belonging to the hyaenodonta subfamily hyainailourinae almost didn't happen, according to paleontologist and lead author Shorouq Al-Ashqar from Mansoura University and the American University in Cairo.\n\n\"Just as we were about to conclude our work, a team member spotted something remarkable —a set of large teeth sticking out of the ground,\" she said in a statement. \"His excited shout brought the team together, marking the beginning of an extraordinary discovery: a nearly complete skull of an ancient apex carnivore, a dream for any vertebrate paleontologist.”\n\nThe team, called Sallam Lab, made the find while digging in the Fayum Depression, a basin in the desert known as one of the most significant fossil deposits in Africa. They chose to name the newly-found species after the ancient Egyptian goddess Bastet, the cat-headed symbol of protection, pleasure and good health.\n\nNew skull may help solve extinction riddle\n\nThe discovery also prompted Sallam Lab scientists to re-visit the findings on a separate lion-sized Hyaenodont species discovered more than 120 years ago. The team constructed the genus of Sekhmetop, named after the lion-headed goddess of wrath and war Sekhmet, and found that it, like the Bastetodon, originated in Africa and not Europe as 1904 scientists originally thought.\n\nThis finding gives scientists some more insight into what exactly happened to the once-fierce king of the jungle and its kin.\n\nHyaenodonts lived in Asia, Europe, India and North America - the new study demonstrates that Bastetodon and Sekhmetop likely spread from Africa to these regions in waves. The team theorized that \"cataclysmic\" changes in global climate and tectonic shifts made way for the distant relatives of modern cats, dogs and hyenas to begin evolving. As the environment and therefore its prey changed, hyaendodonts diminished in diversity and eventually went extinct.\n\n\"The discovery of Bastetodon is a significant achievement in understanding the diversity and evolution of hyaenodonts and their global distribution,” Al-Ashqa's statement continued. “We are eager to continue our research to unravel the intricate relationships between these ancient predators and their environments over time and across continents.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/27/new-florida-mosquito-species/11548708002/", "title": "New mosquito in Florida discovered and it is concerning scientists", "text": "Researchers don't know the mosquitoes' potential to spread deadly diseases.\n\nAbout 90 mosquito species live in Florida, and the list is growing, researchers of a new study say.\n\nThe increase of new, nonnative mosquito species in Florida can be linked to climate change.\n\nVIERA, Fl. — Meet Culex lactator, the mosquito species native to Central and South America that's making a new home in the Sunshine State.\n\nThis Culex may look like every other mosquito that has annoyed you over the years, but scientists say it's risk to human health and wildlife is not yet known.\n\n“Introductions of new mosquito species like this are concerning because many of our greatest mosquito-related challenges are the result of nonnative mosquitoes,\" said Lawrence Reeves, lead author of a new study published in the Journal of Medical Entomology by faculty at the UF/IFAS Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach. \"In a case like this, it’s difficult to anticipate what to expect when we know so little about a mosquito species.”\n\nBirds can harbor diseases such as the West Nile virus and and St. Louis encephalitis that Culex could spread by feeding off both birds and humans, however, scientists don't know /if the news species is a bird feeder and how it will contribute to virus transmissions.

Since then, it's been thriving in Miami-Dade, Collier and Lee counties, though it may have also spread elsewhere in the state, Reeves added.\n\nThe mosquito is the latest to establish in Florida as the state's climate changes to be more hospitable to Southern Hemisphere critters, according to Reeves.

After two decades of research, the team has proven the scientific theories behind the northern lights, or aurora Borealis, according to a study published this week inNature Communications.\n\n\"To be the first person to discover a new phenomenon, or to show definitively how nature works, is an unforgettable experience,\" said study co-author and UI professor Greg Howes, via email, on the advice he would give to young scientists. \"And given the importance of space to our modern technological culture — where we depend on satellites for everything from communication to TV to GPS navigation — helping to develop a deeper understanding of the physics of space certainly satisfies the desire to help our community and the world.\"\n\nJust like on Earth, but to a far greater extent, there's weather in space. Violent events on the sun, like solar flares, trigger \"geomagnetic storms,\" which create rippling effects just like thunder or rain. Geomagnetic storms tug on the earth's magnetic field and generate \"Alfvén waves\" that speed through space along the magnetic field.\n\nThose waves are integral to understanding the northern lights. They accelerate electrons to 45 million mph, as together they bound toward Earth. Eventually, the electrons collide with oxygen, nitrogen and other molecules in the Earth's upper atmosphere and emit light.\n\nThe lights can be viewed at higher-altitude places across Earth, including Iowa.\n\nWhat questions could the study help solve?\n\nThe study has generated a media buzz that is not typical for physicists like Howes. He has been interviewed by NPR, CNN and other national outlets this week, a sign of the fascination the topic holds.\n\nThe study's findings could also give scientists fodder for answering other major questions in astrophysics by way of better understanding the heating and acceleration of particles. The research could inform discoveries about, for example, damage to the satellites humans depend on for GPS navigation and daily communication, which is caused by the acceleration of high-energy protons and electrons in Earth's Van Allen radiation belts (which are named after Iowa native and former UI physics professor James Van Allen).\n\nIt could also feed discoveries on \"magnetic reconnection,\" or solar flare-caused explosions that send harmful radiation barreling toward satellites and manned space missions.\n\nPhysicists have been gathering nuggets of information about the reasons for the northern lights for decades. The theory that electrons are excited by the Alfvén waves dates to 1946, via the work of Russian physicist Lev Landau. Findings from spacecraft missions have also supported the theory that the waves are in fact heading toward Earth, likely carrying electrons along with them.\n\nBut it wasn't until now that the theory has been proven. The research began about 20 years ago by Craig Kletzing, a study co-author and professor at the University of Iowa.\n\nPhysicists simulated conditions in space at a testing site: the University of California-Los Angeles' Basic Plasma Science Facility.\n\nThe team initially thought the process would take around three years, Howes said. But it turned out to be far more complicated. It required generating Alfvén waves on Earth, rather than out in space, and measuring a small population of electrons accelerated by the waves via uber-specialized equipment. All that came before even figuring out how to put all the measurements together.\n\nThe waves simulated in the lab reached about 10 feet long. In space, the actual waves would stretch 310 miles.\n\n\"Our results here — settling the 40-year-old question of whether Alfvén waves can accelerate auroral electrons — serve an important proof of principle for this new technique that combines electric field measurements with particle measurements to determine the mechanisms that accelerate and heat particles,\" Howes said via email.\n\nThree of the researchers named on the study work at the University of Iowa: Howes, Kletzing and Frederick Skiff. James Schroeder, the lead author of the study, is a professor of physics at Wheaton College. Troy Carter and Stephen Vincena work at UCLA and Seth Dorfman works at the Space Science Institute.\n\nThe research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy and NASA.\n\nCleo Krejci covers education for the Iowa City Press-Citizen.

Published earlier this year in the journal Royal Society Open Science, researchers say the discovery opens the door to more questions about hybridization.\n\nSeparate hummingbird species are genetically distinct and typically don’t interbreed with each other, according to a press release about the study from Chicago’s Field Museum, but “hybrids break that rule.” How common hummingbird hybrids are is unknown to researchers, but they might be a driver behind color change.\n\n“It’s not clear how common hummingbird hybrids like the one in this study are, but the researchers speculate that hybrids like this one might contribute to the diversity of structural colors found across the hummingbird family tree.”\n\nBoth the Pink-throated Brilliant hummingbird and the Rufous-webbed Brilliant hummingbird have bright pink throats, so researchers wanted to understand how the two combined would produce a gold-throated hummingbird.\n\nAccording to the press release, it’s rare in the hummingbird family for members of the same species to have dramatically different throat colors, which is why scientists were puzzled when the birds' DNA matched.\n\n“Sometimes hybrids are weird one-offs or are sterile, like mules; in other cases, hybrids can form new species,” the statement reads.\n\nUsing the speed of color evolution seen in hummingbirds, researchers estimated it would take 6-10 million years for this drastic pink-gold color shift to evolve in a single species.\n\n“I looked at the bird and said to myself, ‘This thing doesn’t look like anything else.’ My first thought was, it was a new species,” said John Bates, the senior author of the study and curator of birds at Field Museum.\n\nSo, how did this unusual bird come to be? The answer has to do with the \"complex ways in which iridescent feather colors are determined,\" according to the Field Museum.\n\nSwarms of birds will fly over the US: Explore BirdCast's new fall migration tool to help you prepare.\n\nHow do hummingbirds get their coloring? ‘It’s like cooking.’\n\nAccording to the Field Museum, feathers get their base color from pigment, like melanin (black) and carotidnoids (red and yellow), but a hummingbirds’ are iridescent, meaning their color depends on how light is bent and filtered as it hits the feather cells at different angles. Color-shifting iridescence is a result of structural color, which is when light interacts with the micro- or nano-structures on a creature.\n\n“It’s a little like cooking: if you mix salt and water, you kind of know what you're gonna get, but mixing two complex recipes together might give more unpredictable results,” said Field Museum senior research scientist Chad Eliason.\n\n“This hybrid is a mix of two complex recipes for a feather from its two parent species.”\n\n10 facts about hummingbirds\n\nHundreds of species: There are currently 363 recognized species, but that number continues to grow as new species are identified, according to the Hattiesburg American, part of USA TODAY Network.\n\nThere are currently 363 recognized species, but that number continues to grow as new species are identified, according to the Hattiesburg American, part of USA TODAY Network.

Hormonal birth control, shots and pills, on the other hand, have long since been considered treatments for women and women alone to consider.\n\nThis could soon change, however, according to a study published last month.\n\nResearchers shared the most recent findings in the development of a hormonal option for male birth control, a gel that is applied topically, following a successful clinical trial with more than 300 participants.\n\nResearchers called the existence of such a method an \"unmet need,” a sentiment that seems to be shared among American men. In fact, a 2017 survey of 1,500 men living in the U.S. found that 85% of participants wanted to prevent their partner from getting pregnant and taking responsibility for birth control was the key reason for wanting a new male contraceptive method.\n\nStill, we are a ways away from a commercial product. Why has it taken so long? Or rather, how did we get from sheep intestines to pills and hormonal gels? Here's a brief overview of male birth control through the centuries.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe latest invention, a hormonal gel, could be coming soon\n\nLast month, researchers with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published a study detailing the workings of a novel male contraceptive gel that has been under testing since 2005.\n\nMade with a combination of hormones called segesterone acetate (called nestorone) and testosterone, the gel is rubbed on the shoulder once daily and works by suppressing sperm production.\n\nThe nestorone in the gel inhibits the production of testosterone in the testes themselves, lowering sperm count to the desired level of 1 million or fewer sperm per milliliter of semen.\n\nThis suppression happened more quickly than in past studies, with 86% of the 222 men participating reaching the desired count by week 15. Of those men, a midpoint of sperm suppression was reached in less than 8 weeks, compared to prior studies which took between 9 and 15 weeks.\n\nTestosterone does more for the body than simply control sperm production, however, meaning the suppression of the hormone for birth control has some limitations.\n\n“The development of a safe, highly effective and reliably reversible contraceptive method for men is an unmet need,” said senior researcher Diana Blithe, Ph.D., chief of the Contraceptive Development Program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in a press statement. “While studies have shown that some hormonal agents may be effective for male contraception, the slow onset of spermatogenic suppression is a limitation.”\n\nStudies are ongoing to test the contraceptive’s effectiveness, safety, acceptability and reversibility of contraception after treatment stops.\n\nPast attempts at new birth control methods for men\n\nThe new gel is not the first foray doctors and scientists have made into developing a hormonal form of male birth control.\n\nIn 2016, a study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism found that a form of male birth control studied between 2008 and 2023 was nearly 96% effective. The method entailed a series of injections that lowered sperm count and resulted in only four pregnancies out of the 266 men who participated.\n\nHowever, the study was eventually ended early after men taking it reported unfavorable side effects that made them no longer want to participate, including mood swings, an altered libido and acne. Reports at the time noted that these symptoms are typical of the hormonal birth control women take every day and have for decades.\n\nIn 2019, a male birth control pill passed early safety tests performed by the nonprofit LABioMed and the University of Washington in Seattle. The drug, called 11-beta-MNTDC, \"greatly\" reduced hormones needed for sperm production in an early study, though researchers told USA TODAY it would likely take 10 years for it to become available in its final, marketable form.\n\nIn February 2023, researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine tested a non-hormonal drug that could be taken orally or via injection that made male mice temporarily infertile. The study found that the mice’s fertility returned with minimal side effects hours after stopping the medication, meaning this pill could be taken by men only \"as needed.\"\n\nIn Indonesia, a similarly-acting, plant-derived form of male birth control was studied in the 2010s and found to be 99% effective. The plant, called gendarussa, contains enzymes that perform a similar temporary inhibiting function as the drugs mentioned above.\n\nTraditional forms of male birth control\n\nWithdrawal and fertility tracking\n\nPerhaps the oldest form of birth control out there, the \"pull-out\" or \"withdrawal\" method entails withdrawal before ejaculation occurs, presumably preventing sperm from entering a woman and fertilizing an egg.\n\nSuch an act is even mentioned in the bible, where in Genesis 38:9, it is said Onan “spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring.”\n\nThis method has often been used in conjunction with fertility tracking. Couples may abstain from intercourse when a woman is ovulating or at a point in her cycle of high fertility to enhance the effectiveness of birth control through withdrawal.\n\nHowever, the method, which some studies suggest may remain one of the most popular, does not offer any protection against STIs and has a high failure rate of about 22 out of 100 people becoming unintentionally pregnant or about 1 in 5, according to the U.S. Office of Women's Health.\n\nCondoms\n\nMale condoms, which work as a physical barrier to keep bodily fluids contained, are about 98% effective at protecting against STIs and pregnancy.\n\nCondoms, made of animal intestines, usually sheep, calves, or goats, have been around since at least medieval times, according to research published by medical historian Vern Bullough, but may have existed even earlier.\n\nIt wasn't until the 16th century that condoms were widely suggested by doctors for protection against venereal disease, and the rubber condom wasn't produced until 1855, according to Case Western Reserve University.\n\nThe rubber vulcanization process, patented by Charles Goodyear in 1844, entailed wrapping raw rubber around an appropriately shaped mold and applying a chemical solution to then cure the rubber. In 1920, the more modern latex condom was invented and grew in popularity thanks to both being more effective and easier to produce.\n\nVasectomy\n\nThe most permanent form of birth control men currently have available to them is vasectomy.\n\nThe outpatient procedure, which is typically performed in about half an hour, entails the cutting and sealing of tubes called the vas deferens, blocking the passage of sperm from the testicles to the urethra and stopping the sperm from being released during ejaculation.\n\nThis serves as a permanent form of birth control with an almost 100% success rate. The procedure is considered safe and effective and is performed on about 500,000 men per year in the U.S., according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nThe first vasectomy on record was performed on a dog in 1823 by Sir Astley Cooper as an alternative to complete castration. In humans, it was initially used as a means of symptom relief for an enlarged prostate, and the literature reflected over 100 vasectomies done for this purpose by 1900, according to the William P. Didusch Center for Urologic History.\n\nIn the U.S., vasectomies as a form of family planning were first promoted in the 1950s and by the mid-1960s, roughly 40,000 were performed each year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/20/health/extending-fertility-aging-life-itself-wellness/index.html", "title": "Lengthening a woman's fertility may extend her life as well, research ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne organ in a woman’s body ages more than twice as fast as all other tissues, wreaking havoc with both fertility and long-term health.\n\n“Ovaries are very strange, very odd in terms of the rest of the human body. We can think about them like an accelerated model for human aging,” said Jennifer Garrison, an assistant professor at California’s Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the world’s first biomedical research institution devoted exclusively to the science of aging.\n\n“When a woman is in her late 20s or early 30s, the rest of her tissue is functioning at peak performance, but her ovaries are already showing overt signs of aging,” Garrison told an audience at Life Itself, a health and wellness event presented this year in partnership with CNN.\n\n“Yet most women learn about their ovaries and ovarian function when they go to use them for the first time and find out they’re geriatric,” she added.\n\nThe consequences of aged ovaries extend beyond fertility, especially during menopause, the period of time when a person stops having a menstrual cycle.\n\n“When the ovaries stop working due to menopause, they stop making a cocktail of hormones important for general health,” Garrison told CNN. “Even in healthy women, it dramatically increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, cognitive decline, insomnia, osteoporosis, weight gain, arthritis – those are medically established facts.”\n\nThere’s more. The age of menopause is also tied to longevity. The average age of natural menopause in the United States is 51, according to the North American Menopause Society.\n\n“Studies show women who have later menopause tend to live longer and have an enhanced ability to repair their DNA,” Garrison said. “But women with natural menopause before the age of 40 are twice as likely to die (early) compared with women going through natural menopause between the ages 50 to 54.”\n\nWhat if science could learn to slow the rate of aging in ovaries?\n\n“It would be a game changer, right? Women would have parity and options in their reproductive choices and be empowered with control over their lives,” Garrison said. “And at the same time, we could delay the onset of these age-related diseases and hopefully extend life.”\n\nAn egg in your grandmother’s womb\n\nWrap your brain around this: You are a product of an oocyte (an immature egg) that was growing in your grandmother’s womb. Here’s how:\n\nBy the time a female fetus reaches 20 weeks gestation, there are between 6 million and 7 million oocytes in those tiny, developing ovaries. You came from one of those – which means that when your grandmother was about five months pregnant, you were a spec of a possibility inside her womb.\n\nOvaries age more than twice as fast as all other tissues and organs, experts say. JACOPIN/BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\n“This is why there’s multigenerational impacts for any environmental exposures a woman may have when she’s pregnant. Not only does it affect the woman and fetus, but it then extends across generations,” said reproductive researcher Francesca Duncan, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nBy the time your mother was born, however, her infantile ovaries only carried 1 million to 2 million eggs, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The massive loss of oocytes in utero occurs throughout much of the animal kingdom. Some researchers think it could be a normal step in fetal growth or development.\n\nBy the time people hit puberty they only have about 300,000 to 400,000 immature eggs left. “The ovary is probably the only organ who loses its function prior to its first use,” Duncan said.\n\nThe decline escalates with age. For 95% of people, only 12% of their eggs will be available at age 30 and only 3% at age 40, according to a January 2010 analysis.\n\nWhy does accelerated aging occur?\n\nWhy do humans develop senile ovaries by age 30? Science doesn’t know, Garrison said, “and learning about how little we know about why that happens infuriated me actually.”\n\nOne reason: A historical lack of funding for reproductive research, she said. Then there’s the fact that research studies generally ignored women: “Females were considered to be confounds (confusion) in the data – their cycles are noisy and mess up the data.”\n\nToday that’s changed. In 2017, the National Institutes of Health issued an amendment to its policies on enrolling women and minorities in clinical trials – the new language mandates study results are reported by sex/gender and race/ethnicity. In 2020, the NIH issued its first research grant on sex and gender, calling it a “milestone achievement.”\n\nWhile extending fertility will be one outcome of the research in the field, scientists aren’t trying to help people get pregnant naturally in their 50s, 60s and 70s, said Dr. Kara Goldman, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n“That would be a completely irresponsible goal and ultimately a shortsighted one. We’re thinking about the bigger picture: The best way to prevent the health impact of menopause is to prolong the ovaries’ natural functioning,” Goldman said.\n\nBasic questions need answers\n\nWith the help of investors, Garrison has launched the Global Consortium for Reproductive Longevity and Equality. The center is funding research to accelerate the pace of discovery on the underlying causes of accelerated aging in the ovaries.\n\nSince science knows so little about the female reproductive cycle, research is forced to start with the basics, Garrison said.\n\n“What’s the fundamental cause of this decline in egg quality and quantity with age? We don’t know the answer to that,” she said. “The age of natural menopause is really variable at the individual level, and we don’t know why.”\n\nIn fact, science doesn’t even understand why humans go through menopause at all. Only four other mammals – killer whales (orcas), short-finned pilot whales, beluga whales and narwhals – end their menstrual cycles and have a post-reproductive life span.\n\n“Why does a woman’s reproductive span correlate with her overall life span? Even brothers of women who go through menopause later tend to live longer,” Garrison added. “There’s a genetic component there that’s clearly very important, and we don’t understand it at all.”\n\nIf basic questions about the ovaries could be answered, “we would have this thing cracked,” Garrison said.\n\n“It’s not a moon shot – a moon shot would be to get rid of menopause altogether,” she said. “But understanding what causes it and figuring out interventions that would extend it a little bit by one year, two years, five years, 10 years – that is very achievable.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the name of the consortium launched by Jennifer Garrison.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/03/21/ozempic-pregnancy-weight-loss-drugs-fertility/73032645007/", "title": "Can Ozempic make you fertile, pregnant?

Baby boy is due in June,” one person commented on a TikTok. “My surprise Ozempic baby is almost 4 months old and thankfully very healthy!” another wrote.\n\nDeb Oliviara, 32, started taking Ozempic the day after Thanksgiving to lose excess weight that had been affecting her mental health. She wasn’t consistent with taking her birth control pill, but that didn’t concern her much because she has a history of unidentified fertility issues that has made it difficult to get pregnant.\n\nJust two months after starting the medication, and the same week she hit her goal weight, Oliviara learned she was pregnant. “We were open to the idea, but definitely not trying,” she said. “It was very much a surprise and the only pregnancy, aside from my first, that didn’t come after a loss.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThis is Oliviara’s sixth pregnancy with only two living children. She has had a first trimester loss, second trimester loss and a stillbirth. Now 10 weeks along, Oliviara and her baby are healthy.\n\nReproductive and obesity medicine experts told USA TODAY that they’re also noticing the trend in their offices, which they say is likely happening for two reasons. First, weight loss is correcting hormonal imbalances caused by obesity and metabolic disorders and thus boosting fertility. Second, certain drugs may be reducing the efficacy of birth control pills, increasing the chances of pregnancy.\n\nYet, under no circumstances should women use weight loss drugs to get pregnant, experts warn. Studies on rats, rabbits and monkeys showed that these medications, if taken while pregnant, can lead to miscarriage and birth defects. (No studies have been done on humans.) Drug manufacturers recommend women stop taking weight loss drugs at least two months before a planned pregnancy.\n\n“It’s true that, from a scientific perspective, these medications may make it easier for people to get pregnant,” said Dr. Allison Rodgers, an OB-GYN and reproductive endocrinologist at Fertility Centers of Illinois. “But people need to be careful because there could be dangerous consequences if taken while pregnant given the drugs can linger in your system.”\n\nWhy weight loss drugs may boost fertility\n\nDecades of research have established strong connections between obesity, metabolic disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and fertility issues, so it isn't too surprising to see that weight loss medications — which can help some people drop up to 20% of their body weight — are helping many women with these conditions get pregnant, said Dr. Utsavi Shah, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology specializing in obesity medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\n“These weight loss medications are game changers for women with PCOS or infertility, but there’s nothing about them specifically that’s making people more fertile, aside from their interaction with birth control pills,” Shah said. “It’s their effect on weight loss that’s helping regulate their menstrual cycles, thereby increasing their chances of getting pregnant.”\n\nHayley Glatfelter, a 27-year-old from Texas, got pregnant in November four months after beginning semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic). She started taking the drug to lose weight and treat her insulin resistance associated with PCOS — a hormonal disorder that causes weight gain, irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth, and in some cases, fertility problems.\n\nAlthough Glatfelter wasn’t on birth control, she said her positive pregnancy test was still surprising because she has had problems getting pregnant before, which is what led to her PCOS diagnosis in 2019. At that time, her doctor prescribed her a different diabetes drug called metformin, which is often used to help with PCOS-related insulin resistance. The drug helped Glatfelter get pregnant with her first son.\n\n“I was told it was a miracle,” Glatfelter said.\n\nFat cells release estrogen, so the more a person gains, the more estrogen they’ll have, Shah said. Excess estrogen can prevent regular menstruation and ovulation, which can make it hard to get pregnant.\n\nObesity causes insulin resistance as well, which can lead to high levels of male sex hormones like testosterone that don’t support pregnancy and affect egg quality, Shah said.\n\nSome weight loss drugs can make your birth control pill less effective\n\nStudies done in test tubes have found that tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound — reduces the efficacy of oral contraception, aka the birth control pill, according to the drugs’ labels.\n\nMounjaro and Zepbound “delay gastric emptying,” meaning the stomach takes longer to clear out, which can affect how oral medications are absorbed in the body. The delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes over time.\n\nShah advises her patients taking these drugs and birth control pills to use a backup option, like condoms.\n\nSemaglutide (Ozempic and WeGovy) doesn’t have as strong of an effect on gastric emptying, so its drug label doesn't contain warnings about oral contraceptives.\n\nThese drugs affect each person’s body differently, so risks vary, said Dr. Marina Kurian, a bariatric surgeon and president of the American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery.\n\n“The birth control pill is still getting digested, the absorption rate may just be different in people, which would make its impact on the ovaries different too,” Kurian said.\n\nThat said, there’s always a small likelihood with any contraceptive that you can get pregnant, Shah said. But there’s no need to panic either.\n\n“I know that there are stories out there that get escalated in the media, but if you're using effective birth control and on these weight loss medications, the risk of unintended pregnancy is quite low,” Shah said.\n\nOnly take weight loss medications if you meet criteria for its use, experts say. Zepbound and WeGovy, for example, are approved for weight management in adults who have obesity or are overweight with at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure or Type 2 diabetes.\n\nAnd if you suspect you’re pregnant while taking a weight loss drug, stop it immediately, Rodgers said, then follow up with your obstetrician.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/21"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/960789/the-pros-and-cons-of-getting-a-vasectomy", "title": "The pros and cons of getting a vasectomy | The Week", "text": "Interest in vasectomies, or male sterilisation, as a contraceptive method is growing worldwide, particularly in the US where the overturning of Roe v.

The Week takes a look at some of the main pros and cons of the procedure.\n\n1. Pro: safer than reported\n\nA vasectomy is a surgical procedure to cut or block the tubes that carry a man’s sperm from the testicles to the penis, in order to “permanently prevent pregnancy”, according to the NHS.\n\nVasectomies are “much safer than reported”, said a team of UK doctors who checked 94,000 procedures for complications. At the European Association of Eurology medical conference last month, the team said “serious risks are extremely rare”, according to BBC News.\n\nOnly about two in every 1,000 (0.2%) men experienced extreme scrotal pain, which contradicts a “commonly used” patient information leaflet that puts the figure at up to one in 20, it said. Rates of infection were just over 1%.\n\n“Vasectomy is a very reliable and safe contraception method,” said senior NHS registrar Julian Peacock, who headed the review. He pointed out that the risk information on patient leaflets is from the 1980s, and is now outdated.\n\nVasectomies do not cause any increased risk of developing prostate cancer, according to two US studies published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2016.\n\nVasectomies do not affect sexual performance, sex drive, increase risk of heart disease or cause severe pain, said the Mayo Clinic.\n\n2. Con: some risks and pain\n\n“Your ball sack (scrotum) may become bruised, swollen or painful,” according to the NHS. “Some men have ongoing pain in their testicles.”\n\nThere is “a low risk of complications or side effects”, said the Mayo Clinic, but possible side effects can include bleeding or a scrotal blood clot, blood in the semen, infection and in rare cases, fluid build-up or an abnormal cyst in the testicle.\n\nHowever, there are two types of vasectomy: a conventional procedure using a scalpel (surgical knife) and a so-called no-scalpel, or “blood-free” or snipless vasectomy. A no-scalpel vasectomy is associated with far fewer risks and pain.\n\nLast week, a no-scalpel vasectomy passed a preliminary clinical test in the US, reported MedPage Today, achieving a decrease in sperm of almost 100% after 30 days, and causing no serious side effects.\n\n3. Pro: quick and simple\n\n“Once perceived as drastic and irreversible, vasectomy surgeries are now simple, routine and relatively painless,” according to The Guardian. “Urologists advertise ‘no needle, no scalpel’ procedures.”\n\nThe procedure involves “a small cut or puncture in the skin of the scrotum, which can be closed with dissolving stitches”, BBC News said. A day or two of rest is recommended, and sport, heavy lifting and sex should be avoided for at least a week.\n\n“It’s usually carried out under local anaesthetic, where you’re awake but don’t feel any pain, and takes about 15 minutes,” NHS guidance said.\n\n4. Con: not always reversible\n\nAccording to the American Urological Assocation, between 3 and 6% of the 300,000 vasectomy patients each year in the US want to reverse the procedure.\n\nVasectomies “should be thought of as a permanent procedure for those considering it”, said Science Focus.\n\nThe success rates of a reversal are “not high”, according to Science Focus – about 75% “if done within three years of the original procedure, falling to around 55% up to eight years, and 40% up to 14 years”.\n\n“A reversal to restore fertility will not always work,” said BBC News, “and is likely to have to be carried out privately, which could cost thousands of pounds.”\n\nReversal works by rejoining the tubes that carry sperm from the testes to the penis. There are two techniques: macroscopic vasovasostomy, performed with the naked eye; and microscopic vasovasostomy, using strong magnification.\n\nA review published in the SN Comprehensive Clinical Medicine in 2021 showed a higher success rate of reversal with the microscopic procedure: 91.4% patency (being open or unobstructed) after the operation, compared with 80.5% for the macroscopic procedure.\n\nA non-surgical vasectomy, called RISUG (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance) is also under development in India. It involves injecting a gel into the vas deferens to block sperm, rather than cutting or tying it. A shot can then break down the gel. Vasagel, the US equivalent, is currently in clinical trials, reported Healthline.\n\n5. Pro: reliable and effective\n\n“The most reliable means of contraception for men – and one that cannot fail or be forgone in the heat of the moment – is a vasectomy,” said The Economist.\n\nVasectomy has a 0.15% failure rate at preventing pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making it highly effective compared with other forms of contraception.\n\n“It usually succeeds,” said Michelle Roberts, digital health editor for the BBC, “but doctors advise using contraception for a few months as some sperm can still be present.”\n\n6. Con: not always accessible or affordable\n\n“In most parts of the UK, a vasectomy is available free of charge from the NHS,” said official guidance. “But waiting lists can be several months, depending on where you live.”\n\nDoctors could also refuse to refer you for the procedure.\n\n“If you’re under 30, you’ll find many surgeons are reluctant to do it”, the NHS said. “You may be more likely to be accepted for a vasectomy if you’re over 30 and have had children.”\n\nCost in England “may be becoming an issue”, said The Guardian in 2016. “At a time of increasing financial pressure on the NHS, some clinical commissioning groups are considering reducing the number of vasectomies they will pay for, or dropping them altogether.”\n\nIn the US, a vasectomy can cost up to $1,000, according to Planned Parenthood, although they can be free depending on health insurance or government programs like Medicaid. But a vasectomy “usually ends up saving you money in the long run,” the guidance adds.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Theara Coleman", "Devika Rao", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/10/24/bee-pollen-breast-growth-anaphylaxis-menstruation/71297342007/", "title": "Bee pollen for breast growth causing anaphylaxis and period changes", "text": "On the hunt for bigger breasts, women on TikTok this summer buzzed over bee pollen: a mixture of plant and flower pollen, as well nectar and bee saliva, that accumulates on the insects’ bodies and is used for honey production. After a handful of content creators suggested it could boost estrogen levels, dozens of women began tossing it in their smoothies and yogurts with the hopes of increasing their cup size.\n\nNow, about four months after the trend dominated women’s #FYP, videos detailing mild to severe allergic reactions and changes to menstruation, such as heavier bleeding and more painful cramps, are springing up online. These unintended consequences, experts say, serve as a reminder that “natural” isn’t always safe.\n\n“I've seen this over and over again: an influencer with no scientific or medical background speaks to something that they're doing or something they're being paid to talk about, yet none of it is based on science,” said Dr. Allison Rodgers, an OB-GYN and reproductive endocrinologist at Fertility Centers of Illinois.\n\nBee pollen has been used for centuries as a natural medicine. Ancient Egyptians used to call it a “life-giving dust,” as it contains vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, polyphenols and other active compounds that have been associated with immune system benefits and even “anti-allergy” properties. Today, jars of bee pollen can be bought online for about $25, with most brands recommending a serving size of one teaspoon.\n\nBut studies have yet to analyze how or if bee pollen can affect breast growth or menstruation.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nJanna Kim, 23, decided to try bee pollen to help alleviate “unbearable” symptoms that began after she stopped taking her birth control pill, such as hot flashes and lack of appetite. Kim heard from people on TikTok that the supplement might help, so she gave it a shot. Bigger breasts, Kim said, wasn't what she was after but would be a plus.\n\nShe was adding half a teaspoon of bee pollen to her morning smoothies for a month before experiencing a severe allergic reaction that landed her in the hospital.\n\n“I was sipping on my smoothie while doing my eyebrows when I noticed my eyes were super-glossy and warm,” said Kim, a graduate student and dermatology medical assistant in Arizona. Within minutes, her symptoms progressed and she rushed to the emergency room. “I tried to drink water in the car and it would pool in the back of my closed throat. I started to see stars because I couldn’t breathe.”\n\nHospital staff admitted Kim right away. It wasn’t long before she began to vomit and was given an epinephrine injection to reverse what doctors told her was an anaphylactic reaction. It came as a shock to Kim, who has never had a severe reaction to anything.\n\n“Nowadays, we’re all leaning away from Western medicine, trying more holistic naturopathic methods to help our bodies, especially women,” said Kim, who didn’t receive any relief from her symptoms while eating bee pollen. “People should just do their research because I thought I was fine for a month, then all of a sudden my body decided to fight back.”\n\nHere’s what science says about bee pollen’s effect on breast growth and menstruation, as well as its role as an allergen.\n\nBee pollen can’t make breasts grow\n\nDespite purported success stories, bee pollen cannot help your breasts grow, according to Dr. Allison Rodgers, an OB-GYN and reproductive endocrinologist at Fertility Centers of Illinois.\n\nSome people on TikTok have said that bee pollen contains phytoestrogens: compounds from plants that mimic estrogen by binding to its receptors like a lock and key. Estrogen is involved in breast growth, so many people have assumed that bee pollen would increase their body’s natural supply of the hormone, thus increasing their cup size.\n\nBut research has found that’s not true. When tested in yeast and human cells, bee pollen did not interact with estrogen receptors.\n\n“Bee pollen is not a phytoestrogen, and unfortunately is not going to be a natural way to increase breast size,” Rodgers said, adding that the only way to naturally grow bigger breasts is to gain weight or get pregnant. Some birth control options could cause a temporary increase in breast size because estrogen can lead to weight gain or fluid retention.\n\nCan bee pollen affect menstruation?\n\nThere’s no evidence to support claims that bee pollen can cause changes in menstruation, such as worsening cramps, heavier bleeding, tender breasts, new acne and early or late periods. Similarly, there’s no science that shows bee pollen can alleviate these symptoms.\n\nAli Velas believes otherwise. After coming off the birth control pill earlier this year, the 28-year-old from Ohio had no complaints until July when she noticed her period was two weeks late (she wasn’t pregnant). Inspired by other women’s stories, Velas told USA TODAY she began adding bee pollen to her yogurt every morning. Five days later, her period returned.\n\nPeriods can be irregular for many reasons besides pregnancy, including extreme exercise, stress, obesity, chronic illness, thyroid conditions and conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which occurs when your body produces too much of the male sex hormone androgen.\n\nVelas was diagnosed with PCOS three years ago but has been dealing with it since she was at least 19. The condition could help explain why her period was late, but Rodgers said the probability that bee pollen was responsible for bringing it back is low given there’s no evidence it interacts with estrogen receptors in the body.\n\n“Lots of people have late periods,” Rodgers said. “I don't think we can say that this has any correlation.”\n\nResearch published in 2015 in the journal Molecular and Clinical Oncology found that bee pollen mixed with honey helped reduce menopause-type symptoms such as hot flashes, sleep problems and pain during sex. But the study examined only 46 participants, all of whom were breast cancer patients undergoing treatment to lower estrogen's effects on the body. (Estrogen is known to stimulate breast cancer cell growth.) The placebo treatment − honey alone − produced effects similar to those from pollen.\n\nAnother study published in 2019 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology Science found that bee propolis − a sticky compound bees produce by mixing their saliva and beeswax with sap from trees − reduced premenstrual cramps. Many people on social media have referenced this research to support their claims, but bee propolis is not the same as bee pollen.\n\nIt’s possible bee pollen might affect the immune system in a way that influences how uterine lining is shed during menstruation, but Rodgers said that possibility has not been studied.\n\nBee pollen is a tricky allergen\n\nYou don’t have to be allergic to bees or bee products to experience an allergic reaction to bee pollen, said Dr. Brian Schroer, pediatric allergist at Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital.\n\nPollen from wind-pollinated plants like birch and ragweed, which bees normally don’t visit, sometimes hitchhike on the insects’ bodies as they fly. So if you’re allergic to those or other pollen, you may experience typical seasonal allergy symptoms like itchy eyes, nose and throat after consuming bee pollen.\n\nIt happened to Alexia Erkman, 20, who, after a week of eating half a teaspoon of bee pollen every day, developed chest pain, nasal congestion, headache, sore throat and itchy eyes. She told USA TODAY it took a week to recover.\n\nBee pollen is also no stranger to cross-reactivity − when proteins in one substance are similar to proteins in another, making you sensitive to both, Schroer said. Pollen from ragweed, for example, is known to cross-react with pollen from dandelion, which is frequently found in bee pollen. So if you have a ragweed allergy, you could experience an allergic reaction after consuming bee pollen.\n\nSchroer said many people who have pollen allergies aren’t aware they have them because symptoms aren’t bothersome enough to notice. But the risk for anaphylaxis in this case is “very clear” and can happen anytime, he said.\n\nMost allergic reactions to bee pollen are likely to occur the first time someone consumes it, but in some cases the immune system may need more time to develop a sensitivity to it, Schroer said.\n\nDosage matters, too. “If you eat one teaspoon you might be fine, but if you eat two or three teaspoons, you can experience anaphylaxis,” he said. “Everybody's threshold for reactions are different,” which also depends on factors like whether you recently exercised or drank alcohol.\n\nSchroer suspects that bee pollen allergies may become more common as more people use it, and he warned that supplements aren’t approved by the FDA for safety and effectiveness before hitting the market − so consume with caution.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/15/millionth-decorated-dog-tv-set-mystery-washington-mural-news-around-states/39962651/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A man who traveled to all 50 states to mow lawns for free says he’s traveling cross-country again to bring together police officers and the community. Rodney Smith Jr. tweeted Monday to announce his “Mowing with Cops” tour started Wednesday in Apopka, Florida. Smith says on his website that he wants to mow at least one lawn in each state for the elderly, disabled, single parents or veterans, and he’s inviting police officers to mow with him. He had a special police-themed mower made. His website shows it’s painted black and white and has emergency lights. Smith was inspired to begin a free yard mowing service in 2015 after seeing an elderly man cutting his lawn. Individual and corporate donations have helped pay for hotel rooms and other expenses.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Scientists say the chances of a polar bear encounter have increased, with the bears arriving on shore earlier and staying on land longer. Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey found changes in sea ice habitat have coincided with evidence that polar bears’ use of land is increasing, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The bears come to land from the Beaufort Sea during the ice-melt season, the average duration of which has increased by 36 days since the late 1990s, researchers said. The bears are arriving “a little bit ahead of schedule,” said Todd Atwood, a research wildlife biologist leading the U.S. Geological Survey’s polar bear research program. Polar bears usually come to shore in mid-August, but residents have reported sightings as early as May in Kaktovik, a small town about 640 miles north of Anchorage, biologists said.\n\nArizona\n\nAjo: A humanitarian organization that provides aid to border crossers says it is opening an office to welcome visitors for a few hours on Thursday afternoons and Saturday mornings in the southern Arizona desert community of Ajo. The Ajo Samaritarans say they will first open the office in the border town Thursday to provide information about their work. The group says Ajo residents have provided water and other aid to travelers in the Sonora desert for generations. The office will be staffed from 4 to 6 p.m. Thursdays and from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturdays. Border volunteer Scott Warren, who is set to be retried in November on two felony counts of harboring migrants in the U.S. without permission, lives in the community and volunteers with the Ajo Samaritans.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A baby raccoon with a brain injury that hinders her mobility is walking again with the help of a wheelchair. Walkin’ Pets, which makes wheelchairs for animals, says the source of Vittles’ injury is unknown, but it prevented her from balancing and supporting herself. Susan Curtis is a wildlife rehabilitation specialist who helps the state’s bats and raccoons. The company says Curtis found Vittles when she was 8 weeks old. Walkin’ Pets project manager Jennifer Pratt says the wheelchair will adjust as Vittles grows. The company says Vittles can use the wheelchair to sharpen her balance and stability so she can walk on her own. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the company says it’s unlikely Vittles will make a full recovery. But early intervention sparks hope.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The city’s school board voted Tuesday to preserve but cover up a public high school mural depicting slavery and the killing of a Native American. After a public outcry, the board voted 4-3 to reverse its June vote to paint over the “Life of Washington” mural at George Washington High School. Instead, staff were directed to work out alternatives to cover the mural with panels or other materials depicting “the heroism of people of color in America” and their fight against racism and poverty, said board President Stevon Cook, who made the proposal. The cover-up will require an environmental review, and the mural will remain on display at least until then. The 1936 work painted directly on the school walls depicts the life of George Washington. Sections of the 1,600-square-foot work were intended to show the darker side of that history.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s child abuse hotline will not change its policy to accept tips via social media, email or text. The Colorado Sun reports the recommendation came from a statewide task force that determined the hotline is set up to take tips only via phone. The review occurred after an internal memo a year ago raised concerns the child welfare division was not being responsive to texts, social media messages and emails about possible abuse and neglect. Officials say an email account for submitting reports went unchecked for more than four years. Officials determined five cases of possible neglect that were undiscovered until May needed immediate attention. The task force recommended caseworkers receiving written tips should record a report via the phone line before forwarding the written information to the hotline center.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: The new president of the University of Connecticut has begun implementing a plan he hopes will double research spending in the next decade, but he warns that unfunded pension liability could hurt the school’s ability to attract and keep top researchers. Thomas Katsouleas began his tenure at the state’s flagship school Aug. 1 and spoke Wednesday at his first Board of Trustees meeting. Elevating UConn’s status as a top research institution is among his top priorities, he said. He hopes to increase the school’s research money from about $265 million to more than $500 million in federal grants and other funding within a decade. But he also warned that UConn and its medical arm, UConn Health, are handicapped by an unfunded pension liability, which is estimated at $52 million this fiscal year.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The governor has signed into law a package of bills aimed at making it easier for formerly incarcerated people to get professional licenses in some trade fields. Delaware State News reports Gov. John Carney signed three bills Monday that supporters say they hope will improve employment access by removing roadblocks for ex-convicts facing reentry challenges after prison. The bills are designed to help job-seekers obtain licenses in trade fields as plumbers, electricians and massage therapists. The bills modify the impact of criminal history on applicants’ license eligibility by allowing the massage board and electrical examining board to grant waivers for people with certain felony convictions to obtain licenses. It also prohibits the boards from considering some convictions that are more than 10 years old.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new survey from FutureBrand rates the District of Columbia as the No. 4 city in the world, WUSA-TV reports. The study examined culture, business, tourism, quality of life and value systems. It also noted tolerance and environmental friendliness. According to FutureBrand’s site, it unites global experts in strategy, design and innovation to future-proof businesses through brand experiences that drive profitable, long-term growth.\n\nFlorida\n\nKissimmee: A homeowner association says it’s against the rules for an Army veteran to fly a Puerto Rican flag outside her home. The Rolling Hills Estates HOA in Kissimmee recently told Frances Santiago that flags other than a U.S. flag, a military flag or a sports flag aren’t permitted. Santiago tells Orlando television station WFTV-TV that she and her husband, Efrain, decided to fly the flag to support protesters demanding the governor’s resignation in the U.S. territory. Three weeks later, she got a violation notice from the association in the Orlando suburb. The couple says it may be time for the HOA to revisit its rules, especially with Kissimmee’s growing Puerto Rican population. They’ve hired a lawyer and say they have no intention of lowering their flag.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Sports Illustrated is celebrating college football’s 150th season by ranking the top 10 all-time greatest mascots, putting the University of Georgia’s bulldog in first place. The magazine includes both real and costumed mascots in this week’s edition. Following Uga is the Duck at the University of Oregon, Mike the tiger at Louisiana State University, Bevo the longhorn bull at the University of Texas and Stanford University’s Tree. The University of Colorado’s 1,200-pound live buffalo named Ralphie, University of South Carolina’s costumed gamecock named Cocky, Western Kentucky University’s Big Red, Syracuse University’s orange named Otto and University of Tennessee’s bluetick coonhound named Smokey closed the list. The latest Uga is the 10th iteration of the mascot, which the magazine says has been a staple since 1956.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Supreme Court has ruled Hawaii’s constitution requires reasonable access to Hawaiian language immersion programs. Hawaii News Now reports the justices ruled the programs are a necessary component in restoring Hawaiian language and culture. The case brought by the parent of two schoolchildren on Lanai says the island’s only public school did not offer a Hawaiian language immersion program. In a 4-to-1 decision, justices ruled that access to a Hawaiian language class only a few times per week was not sufficient. The ruling says steps must be taken to build an immersion program. In a written dissent, Justice Paula Nakayama says the state should provide “as many students as possible” with access to immersion programs but disagrees that the state constitution requires it.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Forest Service says $25,000 is being used for a federal-state project in eastern Idaho to identify road-killed animals in a major wildlife migration corridor to determine collision hotspots and potential locations for wildlife crossing structures. The agency says 75% of historical migration routes for elk, bison and pronghorn have been lost in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Freemont County has many of the remaining migration routes but a high rate of wildlife-vehicle collisions. The project started earlier this summer and uses volunteers to identify dead animals on U.S. Highway 20 and State Highway 87. Officials say the information can help the Idaho Transportation Department better understand wildlife-road conflicts through the Caribou-Targhee National Forest.\n\nIllinois\n\nAlton: A marker will be placed at the site where the state’s first soybeans were planted. Officials of the Illinois State Historical Society will join Lewis and Clark Community College representatives when the marker is dedicated Aug. 23 in Alton. The Telegraph reports Dr. Benjamin Franklin Edwards traveled to San Francisco in 1849 and helped shipwreck survivors from Japan. They reportedly showed Edwards their appreciation with a gift of “Japanese peas.” Edwards returned to Alton in April 1851 and gave six of the peas to a friend, who planted them in his home garden. The U.S. Agriculture Department reports Illinois’ 2018 soybean production totaled 688 million bushels. Alton Mayor Brant Walker says commemorating the soybean planting adds a new chapter to the city’s history.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The city’s police chief says a budget proposal dedicating $1.2 million toward officer body cameras doesn’t mean they’re coming quickly. A city spending plan released Monday by Mayor Joe Hogsett includes the body camera funding boost as the police department is in the midst of a pilot program in which some officers are using such cameras from three companies. Police Chief Bryan Roach says a decision on how to proceed with the cameras for the department’s some 1,100 street officers is months away. Roach says the $1.2 million would be enough to start a body camera program but estimates that’s about half of what would be needed each year. The fatal police shooting of a man earlier this month involved Indianapolis officers without body cameras.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds held a news conference at the Iowa State Fair on Wednesday to make a special request of towns: Show the world your hometown pride for an opportunity to win a custom water tower. The “Home Town Water Tower Contest” encourages towns throughout the state to submit their own two-minute video that features a “water element” in their community. The winner of the contest will receive a new water tower complete with a one-of-a-kind design from a local artist. Video submissions will be accepted through Sept. 30. A public vote to be held Oct. 1-11 will determine the winning video. Iowans take a great deal of pride in their unique water towers. The “Ol’ Smiley” water tower in Adair has long been a roadside icon. Last year, Sioux City spent thousands painting the phrase “Home of Sioux City Sue” on their water tower.\n\nKansas\n\nRiverton: A Route 66 destination in southeast Kansas is receiving a cost-share grant from a federal preservation program that is expected to end this fall. The Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program awarded Nelson’s Old Riverton Store a $2,500 matching grant to upgrade its exterior. The Joplin Globe reports the Riverton store opened in 1925, one year before U.S. 66 was designated. Originally intended to last 10 years, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program was extended for another decade in 2009. It is set to expire in October. Bill Thomas, chairman of the Road Ahead board of directors, says supporters are working to ensure the passage of federal legislation to designate Route 66 as a National Historic Trail and to ensure the National Park Service oversees the trail.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: University of Louisville trustees have approved the school’s purchase of a financially struggling hospital under a plan that would include a $50 million state loan. UofL trustees approved the transaction at a meeting on campus Wednesday. The deal will significantly increase UofL’s footprint in the medical sector of Kentucky’s largest city. Under the deal, UofL would purchase the greater Louisville market assets of KentuckyOne Health Inc., which includes Jewish Hospital. The deal includes the promise of state support though a $50 million loan. Half of the loan would be forgivable if job retention and other conditions are met. Trustees authorized UofL President Neeli Bendapudi to negotiate and finalize the agreement.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Authorities have made an arrest in an attack on comedian Andy Dick outside a nightclub where he had performed. In a news release, New Orleans police spokesman Aaron Looney says 46-year-old David Hale was arrested early Wednesday and booked into jail on suspicion of second-degree battery and simple battery. Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office spokesman Philip Stelly said he did not know whether Hale had an attorney. Dick told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate someone punched him early Saturday, knocking him out for 15 minutes. Dick was outside the French Quarter club when he was punched. Robert Couvillion, who promoted the show, says the performer didn’t have any reason to expect to be attacked. The comedian and musician is known for his role in the 1990s NBC TV show “NewsRadio.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s wild blueberry industry could be looking at another difficult summer, as the crop is projected to remain much smaller than just a few years ago. The Pine Tree State is America’s sole commercial producer of the wild berries, which are smaller than the more ubiquitous cultivated blueberries often seen in grocery stores. Maine’s crop exceeded 100 million pounds every year from 2014 to 2016 before plummeting to 50.4 million pounds last year. Horticulturist David Yarborough, emeritus wild blueberry specialist with the University of Maine, says a cold winter and wet and cold spring are likely to blame for the lower projections. He says the total harvest might again be only about 50 million pounds. The state’s wild blueberry industry is also struggling with Canadian competition and somewhat low prices to farmers.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A teachers union is calling for fans to be donated to schools as sweltering heat pushes classroom temperatures into the triple digits, but the district says electrical infrastructure may not be equipped to handle it. The Baltimore Sun reports the union hopes to hand out 500 fans in response to a lack of functional air conditioning in city schools, some of which have none at all. But Baltimore Schools Chief Operations Officer Lynette Washington is warning against it, saying the buildings don’t have the electrical load to withstand it. The union is pushing back. President Diamonte Brown is quoted by the paper as responding: “If you’re so concerned about the electricity being overloaded, then fix it.” The paper reports the district has an almost $3 billion maintenance backlog from decades of underfunding.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: It’s a sight for sore eyes for commuters on the MBTA’s Orange Line. The first new trains in decades – six of them initially – are going into service Wednesday on the transit line, which runs from the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston to Oak Grove station in Malden. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority eventually plans to replace the entire existing Orange Line fleet with 152 new trains by 2022. The new vehicles are being built by the Chinese-owned company CRRC at a manufacturing plant in Springfield. The T says the new trains will have more spacious interiors, along with wider doors, more handrails, better lighting, and safety features including audio and visual warnings that the doors on the train are opening or closing.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Rapper Big Sean’s philanthropic foundation is hosting another weekend of events aimed at helping youth in his hometown. The 2nd annual Detroit’s On Now Weekend kicks off Saturday with the unveiling of the Sean Anderson Production Studio in the Dauch Campus Boys and Girls Club. It’s part of an effort to help Detroit children launch careers in the entertainment industry. Big Sean will host a discussion Sunday that focuses on mental health and the stigma around it in the black community. Scheduled guests include psychiatrist Jessica Clemons and sociologist and author Michael Eric Dyson. Other planned events include live performances, health screenings, apprenticeship opportunities and carnival rides, as well as free food, haircuts and braiding. The nonprofit Sean Anderson Foundation was organized in 2012.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A record number of prison inmates in the state were placed in solitary confinement last year. The Minnesota Department of Corrections placed inmates in solitary more than 8,000 times in 2018. Minnesota Public Radio News reports the number of solitary sentences has been going up steadily for the past two years. Last session, the Legislature passed a law requiring mental health screening for inmates being placed in solitary. Republican Rep. Nick Zerwas of Elk River, one of the sponsors, says he’s concerned about the numbers. In June, the Corrections Department implemented new regulations that increase the maximum time allowed in solitary from 90 days to a year. Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell says that ultimately, the department wants to provide incentives to help people get back into the general prison population.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: One of the four tests that the state’s public school students take in high school may be going away. A testing task force is recommending the state Board of Education scrap a now-required U.S. history test. Students formerly had to pass that test, plus exams in English, algebra and biology, to graduate. Now there are alternate routes to graduate, but some Mississippi students still don’t earn a diploma. Teacher groups and others who say Mississippi students take too many tests are pushing for change. The history test also counts in the grading system under which high schools and districts are assigned A-to-F grades. The recommendation will be considered next week by the state’s accreditation commission. If that group agrees, the state Board of Education would likely seek public comment before voting.\n\nMissouri\n\nChesterfield: The little girl from suburban St. Louis who became the inspiration behind the St. Louis Blues’ improbable run to the Stanley Cup championship is back in school for the first time in two years. Laila Anderson has a rare autoimmune disease that forced her to miss two school years. Until Tuesday. In a video posted by the Parkway School District, Laila says she hopes to inspire as many people as she can. She also jokes that as much as she loves her parents, “I need a break from their faces.” Laila had a bone marrow transplant in January, just as the Blues began their stunning worst-to-first turnaround. She was such a fan that the team flew her to playoff games and made her part of the victory celebration in June.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is looking to support the U.S. Forest Service in fighting off a lawsuit challenging a wildfire mitigation project. The Independent Record reports state Attorney General Tim Fox filed a request Monday to intervene in the litigation over the Ten Mile-South Helena Project. The project calls for forest thinning, logging and burning on more than 27 square miles in the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest. Helena Hunters and Anglers and the Montana Wildlife Federation filed a lawsuit earlier this year over concerns about the impact of mechanized logging on wildlife. The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Native Ecosystems Council also filed a lawsuit, contending the federal agency erred in its environmental analysis for the project. The lawsuits have been consolidated into one case.\n\nNebraska\n\nCrete: A private university in this state where pot remains broadly illegal plans to offer an online program this fall that will cover the science, cultivation, processing and regulation of marijuana and hemp. Doane University in Crete will offer the three-course program. Chemistry professor Andrea Holmes will help teach the certificate program, and she told the Omaha World-Herald that the industry is growing rapidly. She cited jobs across the country for cultivators, technicians, scientists, geneticists, administrators, salespeople, marketers and advertisers. Nebraska bars recreational and medicinal marijuana, but lawmakers cleared the way this spring for a limited number of farmers to grow hemp, a low-THC version of the cannabis plant. THC is the compound that gives marijuana its high.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled against the state in a battle with the U.S. government over its secret shipment of weapons-grade plutonium to a site near Las Vegas, but the state’s attorney general says the fight isn’t over yet. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the state’s appeal after a judge refused to block any future shipments to Nevada. The court in San Francisco said the matter is moot because the Energy Department already sent the radioactive material and has promised that no more will be hauled there. “The remedy Nevada sought – stopping the government from shipping plutonium from South Carolina to Nevada under the proposed action – is no longer available,” the court wrote. Nevada also wanted the court to order the government to remove the plutonium it shipped last year but didn’t reveal had arrived there until January.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A state survey says 24% of high school-age youth reported having used electronic cigarettes and cigars, vaping and hookah devices in a 30-day period, compared to the national average of 13%. The data is from the 2017 New Hampshire Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Tricia Tilley, the state Health Department’s deputy director for its Division of Public Health Services, says the increase puts a new generation at risk for nicotine addiction. She notes a new state law that updates the definitions of electronic smoking devices and liquids and clarifies that all tobacco-related product devices are prohibited in any public education facility or grounds.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: For two days this fall, “Sopranos” fans can immerse themselves in the world of the hit show at SopranosCon. The convention, to be Nov. 23-24 at the Meadowlands Expo in Secaucus, will be an “interactive, street festival themed fan experience,” according to the event website. In the midst of the show’s 20-year anniversary and upcoming prequel, super fans will have the chance to meet cast members and even go to an official after-party. Exhibits, screenings, Q&As with cast members, trivia and costume contests are just some of the activities on the itinerary for the event. The layout of the convention will be inspired by the Feast of St Elzear and will celebrate Italian culture in New Jersey with food, drink, art, music, comedy and some show-related businesses, according to the website.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: Some Navajo Nation officials are seeking to ask the state to rename a U.S. highway after one of the longest-serving Native American lawmakers in U.S. history. A Navajo legislative committee is requesting New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham name U.S. Highway 491 in honor of the late state Sen. John Pinto, who died in May at the age of 94 and had long sought to turn the deadly U.S. 666 into a four-lane highway and to change its name to U.S. 491. U.S. Highway 491 stretches about 194 miles from Gallup, New Mexico, through Colorado to Monticello, Utah. Pinto was a World War II Navajo code talker and served over four decades in the New Mexico Legislature.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Who’s a good dog? The American Kennel Club says there are now a million of them. The club announced Wednesday that a Bernese mountain dog named Fiona recently became its 1 millionth “canine good citizen,” including dogs past and present. Fiona and owner Nora Pavone had a special reason for pursuing the club’s mark of canine comportment: Fiona spends her days comforting people at the Pavone family’s Brooklyn funeral home. “We wanted her to have proper manners when she’s meeting with so many different people … for her to just be polite and gentle and always in control,” Pavone says. “To gently go up to someone and nudge their hand when they just need her to be next to them.” The club introduced the canine good citizen title in 1989 to promote polite doggy behavior and responsible pet ownership.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The trial is underway in a lawsuit that accuses novelist Nicholas Sparks of defaming the former headmaster of a private Christian school he founded in the state. Saul Hillel Benjamin accuses Sparks of telling Epiphany School parents, a job recruiter and others that Benjamin suffered from mental illness. The jury in the trial that began Wednesday in Raleigh will decide whether the private K-12 school in Spark’s hometown of New Bern, the author and the foundation Sparks created to support the school should pay damages. Benjamin’s lawsuit alleges that the author of “Message in a Bottle” and “The Notebook” defamed him and violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. Benjamin was in the headmaster’s position for less than five months and says he was forced out.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Traffic at the state’s eight commercial service airports is up 12% in July compared to last year. The state Aeronautics Commission says more than 110,000 people boarded planes at the airports in Bismarck, Minot, Williston, Dickinson, Grand Forks, Fargo, Devils Lake and Jamestown during the month. The Bismarck Tribune says Williston had the highest percentage increase, at nearly 27%. Year-to-date boardings for the eight airports are up more than 10%, to nearly 691,000 passengers. Travelers can reach nine nonstop destinations from North Dakota, though two are seasonal.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Amid concern about the use of facial-recognition capabilities, Ohio’s attorney general says the state database of driver’s license and law enforcement photos hasn’t been used improperly for mass surveillance or broad dragnets. Even so, Republican Attorney General Dave Yost says he’s ordering training requirements for officers who use the facial-recognition system. He’s also requiring that requests for such searches be handled by the state crime lab until those requirements are met. Concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse as federal investigators have searched such databases unbeknownst to drivers whose photos were scanned. Yost says he’ll appoint advisers to help ensure Ohio’s system is an effective law-enforcement tool that also protects people’s privacy and rights.\n\nOklahoma\n\nMedford: No injuries were reported after a 3.4 magnitude earthquake shook a sparsely populated area of northern Oklahoma. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake was recorded about 2:40 p.m. Tuesday about 8 miles south-southeast of Medford and at a depth of about 4 miles. No damage was immediately reported. Geologists say damage is unlikely in temblors below magnitude 4.0. Thousands of earthquakes in Oklahoma have been linked to underground injection of wastewater from oil and gas production. The USGS reports the number of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes is on pace to decline for the fourth straight year after state regulators began directing producers to close some wells and reduce volumes in others.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A new law curbing use of the death penalty in the state now appears to go further than supporters intended, after a recent ruling that a former death row inmate cannot be sentenced to death upon retrial. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that the state’s prosecutors are working to determine how many murder cases might be affected. Meanwhile, lawmakers behind the new law said Tuesday that they were surprised and would seek a fix as soon as possible – even asking the governor to call a one-day special session next month. In passing Senate Bill 1013 this year, lawmakers limited use of capital punishment to a narrow set of circumstances, including terrorist acts and murders of children or law enforcement officers. But officials also appeared to take pains to ensure those changes would apply to sentences moving forward.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State officials have announced plans to close two centers for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities over the next three years. The Department of Human Services says public meetings will be held next month to gather comment on the plans to close the Polk State Center in Venango County in western Pennsylvania and the White Haven State Center in northeastern Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County. The Polk center currently serves 194 residents and the White Haven center 112. Officials say the commonwealth has steadily closed most state centers since the 1960s, “when best practices turned toward community-based settings and away from institutions.” Fifty years ago, the department served more than 13,000 people with intellectual disabilities in state-operated facilities, but today fewer than 720 receive care in such facilities.\n\nRhode Island\n\nLincoln: Twin River Casino says it is feeling the competitive bite from a new resort casino in neighboring Massachusetts. Twin River said Tuesday that it could be forced to lay off up to 30 table game supervisors to reflect the loss in business. The casino in Lincoln says revenue from table games dipped 34% in July compared to the same month the prior year. July was the first full month of operation for the Wynn Resorts-owned Encore Boston Harbor casino in Everett. Twin River said the impact of the competition was greater than it had expected, and it’s exploring the possibility of voluntarily reducing hours to avoid some layoffs – and also hopes business will pick up enough after Labor Day to allow some workers to be rehired.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The mayor says affordable housing must be included in a $1billion redevelopment project near the city’s trendy downtown area. Mayor Knox White told a meeting last week that he considers affordable housing to be “non-negotiable.” Greenville’s city center is considered a model for revitalization, and officials are looking at a proposal to spend $1 billion on a redevelopment project within walking distance of the area. As many as 1,500 apartments would be built under the current plan, and White says that must include a mix of housing types. The area that’s being redeveloped doesn’t currently include housing, but it’s beside one of the city’s oldest African American communities. Rising home prices are raising concerns about what will happen to area residents.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYankton: A county commissioner has been banned from entering Yankton City Hall for a year. Yankton County Commissioner Gary Swensen was sent a letter by Yankton’s city attorney outlining the ban. KYNT-AM obtained a copy of the letter, dated Aug. 12. In the letter, City Attorney Ross Den Herder says Swensen’s recent social media posts are “perceived as threatening to City staff and its elected officials.” The Yankton Daily Press & Dakotan reports Yankton Mayor Nathan Johnson appeared before the commission last week about Swensen’s posting of a cartoon on social media. The cartoon shows a priest telling a woman who confessed to killing a politician that he is “here to listen to your sins, not your community service work.” Swensen has apologized for the cartoon.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The producers of the Hallmark Channel’s made-in-Memphis “Graceland” movies are selling off three films’ worth of props, wardrobe items, Christmas decorations and Elvis memorabilia. The sale does not signal the end of the Hallmark-Graceland relationship – in fact, more Elvis-connected feature-film romances are planned. In addition to Christmas items, the extraneous inventory includes clothes worn by actors in the three Memphis-based Hallmark Channel movies, “Christmas at Graceland” and “Wedding at Graceland,” with Kellie Pickler and Wes Brown, and the upcoming “Christmas at Graceland 2,” now officially titled “Christmas at Graceland: Home for the Holidays,” with Adrian Grenier and Kaitlin Doubleday, which finished shooting last week. The cash-only sale will take place Aug. 22-23 at 1910 Nonconnah Blvd., Suite 106.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: An archaeological dig at the Alamo to help preserve the historic Texas mission has unearthed musket balls that experts say could date to the 1800s. The San Antonio Express-News reports the survey of the mission-era west wall of the Long Barrack is meant to help determine how best to protect the oldest component of the Alamo. Crews are digging four pits to help expose the 1700s limestone wall to its foundation in an effort to fight moisture. Archaeologist Kristi Nichols says workers so far have recovered musket balls, a mid-1800s bottle and tin-glazed majolica from the Spanish colonial period. The survey began nearly a month ago. Preservation of the Alamo is part of a wider $450 million development plan for the area.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Wildlife officials say they have found and put to death a bear that bit a 13-year-old boy on his ear and cheek at a campground in eastern Utah. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources said Tuesday in a news release that officials found the black bear Friday night within a mile of the riverside campground where the incident occurred on Aug. 9 east of Moab. Wildlife officials euthanized the bear after determining it matched the size, color and tracks of the bear that attacked the boy. The boy was treated and released from the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The campground was reopened Monday. This is the second bear attack in Utah this summer. A bear was captured and killed in June after it scratched a boy camping in northern Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has launched a website that shows the results of lead testing in water at the state’s schools and child care facilities. The testing is being done at approximately 440 schools and more than 1,200 child care facilities. It’s required under a new law in which schools and child care centers also must make fixes or take outlets, such as drinking fountains, out of service if the results show lead above 4 parts per billion. Officials said Wednesday that the fixes, such as replacing fixtures, are relatively inexpensive. The state is covering the cost of the testing and up to a certain amount of the remediation. Nearly 300 child care facilities and five schools have been tested. The website shows the test results at institutions and if action has been taken.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Police say more than 50 television sets have been mysteriously placed on front porches in a neighborhood outside the city. Henrico County police Lt. Matt Pecka said residents found older model televisions outside their front doors Sunday morning. He told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that video from one doorbell camera showed a person wearing TV-shaped headgear while dropping off a TV set. Police believe more than one person is responsible. A similar incident occurred in a nearby neighborhood last year. It’s unclear if the incident is a crime. Pecka said that dropping off the televisions on front porches is “at most” illegal dumping. Most of the TVs will be recycled. But a couple of residents indicated they would keep their televisions for now.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has thwarted a rare veto by Mayor Jenny Durkan by voting for a second time to create a special fund for the city’s soda-tax revenue. The Seattle Times reports the new tax raised about $22 million last year, more than initially predicted, and the mayor and councilmembers disagree on how to spend it. When the council passed the tax in 2017, it indicated the money should be used to boost healthful-food and early-education programs serving low-income communities of color that are targeted by soda marketing. But when the mayor drew up this year’s budget, she used about $6 million from the soda tax to supplant baseline allocations for food banks, a parent-child program and other services that previously had been supported by the city’s general fund. The maneuver freed up $6 million for her other priorities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBethany: Bethany College in West Virginia is asking people who like the outdoors to volunteer to help clean up its trail system next month. Projects will include brush cleaning, trail restoration, rubbish removal and outdoor classroom repair. Volunteers should wear work clothes, preferably long pants and sturdy shoes or boots. The school will provide water, bug spray, gloves and tools. The trail system is an asset of Parkinson Forest, which was deeded to the school in 1914. The system includes a waterfall, numerous hiking spots and the outdoor classroom. The cleanup is set for Sept. 15.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: GOP lawmakers in the state found themselves in the unusual position Wednesday of breaking with anti-abortion groups and advocating for a bill that broadens birth control access, an area where Democrats typically lead. Republicans could undermine a key Democratic campaign issue by passing the bill, but they also find themselves in conflict with groups that are typically their allies. Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Family Action, a leading anti-abortion group, oppose the measure on moral and ethical grounds, saying increasing access encourages premarital sex and the odds of unintended pregnancies and abortions. Only doctors can prescribe hormonal birth control under current state law. The bill would allow pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraceptive patches and birth control pills, with some caveats.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Officials say a firework rocket that was launched during a show for the Pyrotechnics Guild International convention landed in a home and sparked a small fire. The Gillette News Record reports the rocket broke through the roof of the Gillette home about 2 miles from the event center where the fireworks display was taking place Sunday. The Campbell County Fire Department says the flames were extinguished before firefighters got to the house. No one was injured. Guild spokesman Tom Sklebar says the organization will pay for the damages. He says a rocket “took an errant trajectory” after it was launched and hit the house. The fireworks convention started last Saturday and runs through Friday. It features fireworks shows on four nights.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/15"}]}

We don’t know whether … they even know that they won a prize. So I encourage everybody to check your ticket,” Illinois Lottery Director Harold Mays told reporters Saturday morning in Chicago.\n\nThe jackpot rose to $1.337 billion late Friday, up from an earlier estimate of $1.28 billion, lottery operators said.\n\nIf the holder chooses a lump-sum cash option, the ticket will yield a one-time payment of about $780 million. Otherwise, the nearly $1.34 billion prize will be spread over an initial payment and 29 annual payments.\n\nFriday night’s winning numbers were 13, 36, 45, 57, 67 and a Mega Ball of 14.\n\nThe Speedway convenience store in Des Plaines will receive $500,000 for selling the winning ticket, Mays said.\n\nThe ticket holder has a year from the drawing to claim the prize, and can choose to withhold his or her name from the public, Mays said. In Illinois, winners of more than $250,000 can ask the lottery to keep their name and hometown confidential.\n\nThe largest ever Mega Millions jackpot of $1.537 billion was won by a single ticket sold in South Carolina in 2018. That’s the second-largest jackpot for any US lottery game, and it’s the world’s largest lottery prize won by just one ticket, according to Mega Millions.\n\nThe largest jackpot of any US lottery game was $1.586 billion – a Powerball prize from January 13, 2016, shared by winners in California, Florida and Tennessee.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback History of the lottery 01:23 - Source: CNN History of the lottery 01:23\n\nOther tickets win big prizes\n\nSome other ticket holders also won some sizable prizes Friday.\n\nTwenty-six tickets won a secondary prize of at least $1 million because they matched the first five numbers.\n\nSix of the 26 tickets won $2 million because the buyers matched not only the first five numbers, but also paid an additional $1 to activate the game’s “multiplier,” which elevates non-jackpot prizes.\n\nOne of the 26 tickets, sold in California, did not have the multiplier but still won more than $4.2 million, according to the state’s lottery officials. That’s because all prizes in California must be based on sales and number of winners instead of being a fixed amount.\n\nThe 20 “Match 5” winners without the multiplier were sold in California; Florida (two); Georgia (two); Illinois; Kentucky; Louisiana; Michigan; Minnesota (two); North Carolina (two); New Hampshire (two); New York; Oklahoma; Pennsylvania; Texas (two); and Wisconsin.\n\nThe six $2 million tickets were sold in Arizona; Florida (three); Iowa and Pennsylvania, according to Mega Millions.\n\nFirst MegaMillions jackpot win since April 15\n\nThe jackpot had been rising since mid-April, when the jackpot was hit on consecutive drawings on April 12 and April 15. Since then, no ticket in twice-weekly drawings matched all six numbers – which is tough. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350.\n\nThe Mega Millions website on Friday night became inaccessible for several minutes after the drawing. The lottery’s jackpots start at $20 million and grow based on game sales and interest rates, according to its website.\n\nThe next drawing will be Tuesday at 11 p.m. ET, at the $20 million starting point.\n\nMega Millions tickets are sold in 45 states, Washington, DC, and the US Virgin Islands, where drawings are on Tuesdays and Fridays at 11 p.m. ET. Tickets are sold online in Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and DC, but the purchaser must be in that state.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Keith Allen", "Jason Hanna", "Keith Allen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/entertainment/jay-leno-recovery/index.html", "title": "Jay Leno has undergone surgery for 'significant' burns, physician ...", "text": "1.

So much to digest, so much to dissect and so much to dance to. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nQueen Bey addresses the leak\n\nBefore we even get into the actual music, the singer had something to say about it leaking days before its scheduled release.\n\n“So, the album leaked, and you all actually waited until the proper release time so you all can enjoy it together,” she wrote in a statement posted to social media. “I’ve never seen anything like it. I can’t thank y’all enough for your love and protection.”\n\nMembers of The Hive, as her devoted fan base is known, swarmed social media to ask people to please not share or listen to the leaked files that were out there.\n\nShe thanked them for their “unwavering support” and “for being patient.”\n\n“I appreciate you for calling out anyone that was trying to sneak into the club early,” she wrote. “It means the world to me.”\n\nSpeaking of the club\n\nWe expected to dance, and “Renaissance” gives us house music and afro-beats and pays homage to jams of the past.\n\nChildren of the 1970s will be reminded of house parties their parents used to throw – complete with the Boone’s Farm wine and the couch moved to make room for a dance floor – with songs like “Summer Renaissance” (which finds her channeling Donna Summer) and “Cuff It” that harken back to the disco and roller-skating rinks.\n\nThe latter even features one of the architects of the sound of that era, Chic co-founder Nile Rodgers.\n\nOf course Beyoncé gives it her own interpretation, much like she did on the lead single “Break My Soul,” which samples the 1993 hit “Show Me Love” by house music legend Robin S.\n\nLove for the LGBTQ+ community\n\nBeyoncé pays tribute to her late Uncle Jonny, a gay man, with her latest project.\n\n“He was my godmother and the first person to expose me to a lot of the music and the culture that serve as an inspiration for this album,” she wrote in a note on her site. “Thank you to all of the pioneers who originate culture, to all of the fallen angels whose contributions have gone unrecognized for far too long. This is a celebration for you.”\n\nIn 2019 she talked about him during her and her husband Jay-Z’s acceptance speech for Vanguard Award at the 30th Annual GLAAD Media Awards held in Los Angeles.\n\nShe called her Uncle Jonny “the most fabulous gay man I’ve ever known and ever knew” and credited him with helping to raise her and her sister, Solange.\n\n“He lived his truth,” she said emotionally. “He was brave and unapologetic during a time when this country wasn’t as accepting. Witnessing his battle with HIV was one of the most painful experiences I’ve ever lived.”\n\nThe lyrics of “Heated” feature, “Uncle Johnny made my dress/That cheap spandex/She looks a mess.”\n\n“The album also features contributions from LGBTQ+ stars Big Freedia, TS Madison and transgender DJ and producer Honey Dijon.\n\nShe’s feeling herself and wants you to, as well\n\nQueen Bey also comes with her brand of empowered sexy, and with this album, she’s letting it all hang out.\n\nSex – or at the least the suggestion of it – factors in heavily on this album, with songs including “Heated,” “Alien Superstar” and “Pure/Honey.”\n\nOnly she could drop a track titled “America Has a Problem” and instead of delivering a message about the state of the country, she lets us know she “Can’t wait to back it up.”\n\n“I’m supplying my man/I’m in demand/As soon as I land,” she sings.\n\nBeyoncé the rapper\n\nWe see you dropping bars, Mrs. Carter!\n\nJay-Z is not the only rapper in the family, something we have known since Beyoncé jumped on Megan the Stallion’s “Savage” remix.\n\nBeyoncé cements her ability to go beyond just singing with songs like “Cozy” and “Church Girl,” in which she gives us a sample of her ability to spit a little bit.\n\nThis is just the beginning\n\nAccording to her, this new album is just “Act I” of three recorded over the pandemic.\n\nThe “Renaissance” has begun.", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/entertainment/hamilton-unauthorized-production-texas-church-cec/index.html", "title": "'Hamilton' team responds to Texas church's unauthorized ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Texas church performed “Hamilton” this weekend, but the team behind the Tony-award winning production says it shouldn’t have happened.\n\n“‘Hamilton’ does not grant amateur or professional licenses for any stage productions and did not grant one to The Door Church,” Shane Marshall Brown, a spokesperson for “Hamilton,” said in a statement to CNN on Monday.\n\nOfficials behind the musical were not aware of the “unauthorized staging” until the day after the church’s first of two scheduled performances and sent a cease-and-desist letter, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe Door, a church in McAllen, a town in South Texas, was allowed to continue with its planned second performance, with conditions, among them that the show would not be live streamed, recorded or shared on social media in photo or video form, according to the statement.\n\nThe Door performed “Hamilton” on Aug. 5 and 6 with edited content that included lyrical references to Jesus and Christianity throughout, according to footage of the production shared on social media. A sermon reportedly delivered to the audience also compared homosexuality to drug addiction, according to video.\n\nIn an additional statement provided to CNN late Monday, the spokesperson said they were not aware “of the extensive changes to the show or that there would be a sermon at the end” when they allowed Saturday’s performance to move forward.\n\n“We have reserved all of our rights and are considering how to proceed based upon what we’ve learned,” the spokesperson’s statement said. “The Hamilton family stands for tolerance, compassion, inclusivity and certainly LGBTQ+ rights.

It is not available for licensing to theater companies.\n\nPer copyright law, churches do have an exemption that allows them to perform copyrighted music during religious services but that exemption does not allow for streaming or distribution of those performances and does not extend to any other public performances outside of service.\n\nMuch of the footage from the church’s first “Hamilton” performance was scrubbed from The Door’s social media accounts, per the production’s cease-and-desist request. But some clips were preserved online and shared by Hemant Mehta, a writer and atheist advocate.\n\nIn one clip, a character appears to read from the Bible while Hamilton is in crisis.

She has over a decade of experience in EU energy policy. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nAs Russian troops remain camped across several of Ukraine’s frontiers, Europe and the United States are scrambling to prevent an incursion, with a flurry of diplomatic efforts and by bolstering their own troops in nearby NATO countries.\n\nSpeculation over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions have ramped up from mere threats to actual war, but officials and pundits in Europe are jittery about another threat as well: Moscow could reduce – or even stop – the flow of fossil gas that the continent so heavily relies on.\n\nThere has been much talk of what Russia is trying to achieve geopolitically by fostering this reliance – to break up NATO, to split the European Union or alienate the US from its Western allies – but these other concerns are also pressing.\n\nSoaring prices in a power crunch are driving millions of Europeans into energy poverty and the continent’s unfettered use of fossil gas is fueling the climate crisis. The solution should be self-evident – end our reliance on expensive, dirty, and overwhelmingly imported gas. This will require standing up to the powerful gas industry, and right now, far too few politicians seem willing to take this vital step.\n\nThis is by no means the first time Europe’s heavy reliance on Russian gas has been problematic. It was the same story during the last major flare-up with Ukraine in 2014, and Europe’s response – to simply find gas elsewhere – didn’t work then. It isn’t working now either.\n\nIn 2013, Russian imports accounted for around 27% of the European Union’s gas use. Instead of reducing reliance on Russia, nine years later, Europe remains more dependent on Russian gas than ever, with 38% of the EU’s supply now being piped from the country.\n\nEU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson has been holding urgent meetings with Azerbaijan and Qatar to boost the bloc’s gas supplies. Likewise, US President Joe Biden, a self-proclaimed climate champion, has been trying to ride to Europe’s rescue, and push his own ever-expanding plans for American liquefied natural gas exports.\n\nOn a practical level, it’s unlikely the US and its friends would be able to replace Russian gas in Europe quickly and effectively. Recent research by the Brussels-based think tank, Bruegel, concluded that in the event of a rupture in Russian gas, the EU would run short and have to start cutting gas use altogether.\n\nSo, if Europe can’t do without Russia for gas, the question must be asked: Why not do without the gas?\n\nEven if the US could bring a cavalry to Europe, more gas isn’t a long-term solution. The flag on the pipeline or ship is irrelevant – it’s Europe’s dependency on the fuel, regardless of where it’s from, that makes it so vulnerable to the vagaries of the global gas market.\n\nEurope’s addiction to gas, and indeed the world’s, will have a deep impact on the future of our planet. The idea peddled by many in the fossil fuel industry that gas can help tackle the climate crisis by replacing coal is false. The International Energy Agency has said that the world should stop adding more capacity for gas if it wants to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nIn the EU, gas is now responsible for more carbon emissions than coal. According to the European Commission’s own analysis, the continent must virtually eliminate fossil gas by 2050 to help keep global warming to 1.5C, although Global Witness believes it must be gone by 2035. Globally, between 2016 and 2019, fossil gas has been responsible for half of the increase in carbon dioxide emissions, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.\n\nMethane, which can leak from almost every step in the gas supply chain, has more than 80 times the global warming power than carbon-dioxide in the short term. Methane has driven more than a quarter of all global warming to date. Not to mention the health risks attached to gas exposure both for communities near infrastructure and even in homes. A recent study by Stanford University showed, stoves used for cooking often leak methane even when turned off.\n\nIt’s not just followers of geopolitical tensions or those in the climate movement that should be concerned with this gas addiction. A sharp rise in gas prices has forced households across Europe into the impossible choice between heating and eating. In the UK, 22 million have been told their energy bills will rise by about £700 ($950) a year, which will hit the poorest the hardest. Recent, but as yet unpublished, figures crunched by the Global Witness data team found that consumer gas prices in the Netherlands and Estonia over the past year have increased by a staggering 62% and 122%, respectively.\n\nAs European households suffer, it’s a very different picture for major fossil fuel firms. Shell recently announced its most profitable fourth quarter in almost a decade, posting almost $20 billion in profit for 2021. ExxonMobil and Chevron recorded a combined $38.6 billion in profits last year. With other oil and gas majors set to post similarly strong years in the coming days – including Russia’s own Gazprom, which saw record-breaking Q3 profits – it’s a pointer as to just why politicians continue to back gas, despite all its associated woes.\n\nEven with the tide turning against fossil fuels, many European lawmakers seem to continue to buy into the argument that the gas industry is vital for jobs and growth in their countries, even though the renovation and renewables sectors are already significant contributors to the economy with huge potential.\n\nThis is an industry that is directly benefiting from rising gas prices while ordinary citizens fall further into energy poverty and the climate crisis intensifies. It’s therefore no surprise that gas companies are pushing to keep gas locked in, using the two-pronged approach of lobbying and greenwashing. While announcing his company’s highest profits in eight years, the CEO of BP, Bernard Looney, called for even more investment into gas. And it’s clearly having the desired effect.\n\nIn December, the European Commission published its proposals to reform Europe’s gas market, in what could have been an opportunity to move towards the phaseout of gas. Worryingly, it chose to lock gas in for years to come, in line with calls from the gas industry.\n\nThe Commission’s proposals rest on the impossible assumption that fossil gas infrastructure – like pipelines – can eventually be used with substitutes by nascent technologies like hydrogen. In Europe’s existing networks, however, this would do little to reduce gas use, given most hydrogen is produced using fossil gas. There is little being done to challenge the power and influence of the fossil fuel companies at the heart of the gas market.\n\nAnother way is possible, but it requires a monumental shift. The huge political and financial support afforded to the fossil fuel industry needs to be redirected to give a much-needed boost for genuine solutions.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nModeling carried out by the Climate Action Network Europe and the European Environmental Bureau shows that the use of fossil gas could virtually be phased out by 2035. That would require accelerating deep renovations of Europe’s buildings, ramping up the deployment of renewable electricity technologies and the electrification of heating and transportation – all measures that are entirely realistic.\n\nThis includes accelerating the deployment of renewable energy, like wind and solar, so that we can replace gas with green electricity. Schemes to renovate large-scale buildings or to insulate homes and replace gas boilers with green heating solutions, like heat pumps and geothermal, would go a long way.\n\nBut, outrageously, the majority of the EU’s 27 member states still give more subsidies to fossil fuels than renewables.\n\nEurope’s deep gas dependency is impacting its citizens, the future of the planet and limiting its ability to shield from geopolitical threats. Already, rich big polluters in the gas industry – whether in Russia or elsewhere – are the only ones who stand to benefit from the status quo. European leaders should be putting in place plans to get Europe off gas as quickly as possible. This shouldn’t be a courageous act.

But multiple US and Western officials cautioned Monday’s move could serve as the opening salvo of a larger military operation targeting the country.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council Monday evening that Putin’s recognition of the pro-Moscow regions was an “attempt to create a pretext for a further invasion.”\n\nShe said his claim that Russian forces are entering those regions as “peacekeepers” is “nonsense.”\n\n“We know what they really are,” Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\nIn a fiery speech earlier Monday, Putin blasted Kyiv’s growing security ties with the West, and in lengthy remarks about the history of the USSR and the formation of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, appeared to cast doubt on Ukraine’s right to self-determination.\n\n“Ukraine has never had traditions of its own statehood,” he said, calling the eastern part of the country “ancient Russian lands.”\n\nThe decrees signed by Putin conveyed Moscow’s official recognition over two breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine – the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic (DPR and LPR). The decrees recognized them as independent states and guaranteed their security with Russian troops. The decrees said that Russian so-called peacekeeping forces would be deployed in the regions.\n\nA senior US administration official said the speech was meant to “justify war” to the Russian people and that it amounted to “an attack on the very idea of a sovereign and independent Ukraine” using “a number of false claims” meant to justify military action.\n\n“The human costs of a further Russian invasion and occupation will be devastating,” the official said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the nation early Tuesday saying Russia’s actions violate the country’s “national integrity and sovereignty” and Ukraine’s international borders will “remain as such.”\n\n“We are on our land. We are not afraid of anything and anyone. We don’t owe anything to anyone, and we will not give away anything to anyone. And we are confident of this,” Zelensky said in his video address.\n\nRussia says it’s protecting residents in Donbas\n\nSeparatists in eastern Ukraine have long had substantial backing from the Kremlin, with the US, NATO and Ukrainian officials saying Moscow supplies them with advisory support and intelligence, and embeds its own officers in their ranks. Russia has always denied having its own troops on the ground.\n\nMoscow has also distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in Donbas in recent years, with Putin attempting to establish facts on the ground by naturalizing Ukrainians as Russian citizens. Kyiv and the West maintain that the region is part of Ukrainian territory, although the Ukrainian government asserts the two regions have been in effect Russian-occupied since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began.\n\nRussian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia described Moscow’s actions to recognize the two regions as protecting Russian-speaking people living in Donetsk and Luhansk against what he characterized as Ukrainian aggression. In a translated statement to the UN Security Council, Nebenzia said recognition of those regions did not take place “suddenly.”\n\n“It should be remembered that the DPR and the LPR declared their independence from Ukraine back in 2014. But we only recognize them now, despite the high-level of support for doing so both in the republics themselves and in Russian society from the very beginning,” he said.\n\nHis Ukrainian counterpart Sergiy Kyslytsya demanded Russia cancel its recognition of the regions and return to the negotiating table, in comments made to the Security Council.\n\nEarlier Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Putin’s decision to recognize the breakaway regions “a clear attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty.” US President Joe Biden then signed an executive order prohibiting new investment, trade and financing by US persons to, from, and in the “so-called Donetsk People’s Republic or Luhansk People’s Republic regions.”\n\nThe order would also allow the US to impose sanctions on anyone operating in those areas.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has requested the European Union adopt targeted sanctions on Russia, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the United Kingdom will announce new sanctions on Russia Tuesday. “There will be severe economic consequences to its actions,” the UK’s ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward told the Security Council Monday.\n\nBiden said last month that “if any assembled Russian units move across Ukrainian border, that is an invasion” and would be met with a “severe and coordinated economic response.”\n\nPutin increases combative rhetoric\n\nOn Monday, Putin held a highly choreographed televised meeting with his top officials, accusing Kyiv of carrying out acts of aggression.\n\nPutin also accused the West of threats and blackmail during the previously unscheduled convening of the Russian security council that, in an unusually theatrical setting, was shown on television.\n\nThe broadcast aired hours after the White House announced that US President Joe Biden agreed “in principle” to French-brokered talks with Putin, as long as Russia does not further invade Ukraine. The Kremlin said earlier Monday that there were “no concrete plans” for a meeting.\n\nSpeaking about the possibility of talks with Biden, Putin – who held two lengthy phone calls with Macron on Sunday – hinted he was skeptical.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting of the Security Council on Monday.

It was an attack on the very idea of a sovereign and independent Ukraine.”\n\nBiden imposed limited economic sanctions Monday in response to Putin signing decrees Monday recognizing the Russian-backed eastern Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent. An executive order signed by Biden sanctions Americans who invest in the eastern Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nRussian troops continue to move closer to the Ukraine border “in what looks like plans for an invasion at any moment,” the official said, also pointing to new reports that Russia has ordered “peacekeeping” operations in the two separatist regions.\n\nYet it was unclear whether the latest actions would be met with full-fledged “severe” sanctions that Biden has threatened if Putin invades Ukraine.\n\nThe official said “Russian troops moving into Donbas by itself would not be a new step” because Russian forces have been in the region for eight years.

Additional measures related to what Psaki described as a \"blatant violation of Russia's international commitments\" are also expected.\n\nThe executive order is separate from the economic measures Biden and Western allies have vowed to impose on Moscow should Russia further invade Ukraine.\n\n\"We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately,\" Psaki said. \"We are continuing to closely consult with allies and partners, including Ukraine, on next steps and on Russia’s ongoing escalation along the border with Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden spoke with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelesnkyy on Monday afternoon as Putin delivered televised remarks justifying his decision to recognize the two Ukrainian provinces as independent states. Biden also convened a call with French President Emanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, according to the White House.\n\nBiden also met with members of his national security team at the White House on Monday. Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, were in attendance, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the meeting.\n\nBiden, who had nothing on his public schedule for Presidents Day, spent the holiday weekend meeting with members of his national security team as Russian troops ratcheted up military drills at Ukraine's borders.\n\nPutin lays blame on NATO\n\nPutin justified his decision in a far-reaching, pre-recorded speech blaming NATO for the current crisis and calling the U.S.-led alliance an existential threat to Russia.\n\nPutin directly threatened pro-democracy activists and civil servants who had led the pro-democracy push in the country after the 2014 revolution ousting a pro-Russian government.\n\n\"We know their names, and we will find them and bring them to justice,” he said.\n\nThe Russian president also claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine was preparing to develop its own nuclear weapons that could threaten Russia.\n\nUkraine had been an independent country and a member of various imperial blocs, including the Russian empire, for centuries before becoming a member state of the Soviet Union during the 20th century. Historians are in broad agreement that there has long been a linguistic and cultural Ukrainian identity distinct from Russia.\n\nA recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states has major implications. The Russian-backed rebels fighting the Ukrainian military there do not control all the territory they claim. Russian recognition of the full claim sets the groundwork for military support into Ukrainian territory.\n\nEU announces sanctions\n\nThe European Union’s top officials say the bloc will impose sanctions against those involved in Russia’s recognition of the two separatist regions amid fears of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel say in a joint statement that the recognition is “a blatant violation of international law.” The statement adds that the bloc “will react with sanctions” and “reiterates its unwavering support to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.”\n\nSullivan: Russian attack would be 'major'\n\nEarlier Monday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan again warned that Russian forces are mobilizing for an impending, bloody invasion of Ukraine. That came less than a day after Biden agreed \"in principle\" to meet with Putin should Russia not invade.\n\n“All signs look like President Putin and the Russians are proceeding with a plan to execute a major military invasion of Ukraine,\" Sullivan said Monday on ABC News. Over the past 24 hours, Russian forces have been \"getting in position to attack.”\n\nSullivan told NBC News' \"Today\" that the Biden administration is working on dual tracks, ready to \"respond decisively\" in case of invasion, yet ready \"to settle this peacefully.\n\nMacron tried to broker a summit between Biden and Putin in a series of calls over the weekend. His office said both leaders “accepted the principle of such a summit,” to be followed by a broader summit meeting involving other “relevant stakeholders to discuss security and strategic stability in Europe.” It added that the meetings “can only be held on the condition that Russia does not invade Ukraine.”\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Putin and Biden could meet if they consider it necessary, but he emphasized that “it’s premature to talk about specific plans for a summit.”\n\n\"When President Macron asked President Biden yesterday if he was prepared in principle to meet with President Putin if Russia did not invade, of course President Biden said yes,\" Sullivan said. “The meeting is possible if the leaders consider it feasible,” he said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow Matthew Brown online @mrbrownsir.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/10/07/trump-hits-biden-on-foreign-affairs-in-iowa-amid-attacks-in-israel/71069910007/", "title": "Donald Trump in Iowa says 'I'm the only one that will prevent World ...", "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Former President Donald Trump said in a pair of speeches Saturday that international conflicts in Israel and Ukraine \"would not have happened\" under his watch, touting his administration's presence on the world stage as he rallied support in Iowa.\n\nTrump, addressing supporters in Waterloo and Cedar Rapids with 100 days until the Iowa caucuses, declared that Hamas' weekend attack against Israel would not have taken place if he was president, calling it \"an act of savagery that must and will be crushed.\"\n\nAnd he repeated his claim that Vladimir Putin's Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he was in the White House, recounting a conversation in which he said they were \"good friends\" but that the U.S. would respond to Russia \"real hard.\"\n\nThe combination of the two military crises across the world, Trump said, created a tense global environment — and, he believes, just one person could resolve it.\n\n\"We are closer to World War III than we've ever been,\" he said in Cedar Rapids. \"And I'm the only one that will prevent World War III.\"\n\nTrump outlined his administration's approach to Israeli-Palestinian relations, recounting the passage of the Abraham Accords, a peace proposal between the two mediated by the U.S. His administration also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights region, the first country to do so (the international community regards it as Syrian territory occupied by Israel).\n\n\"Everybody said, 'When will you get the Nobel Peace Prize?'\" he said. \"And today, we have the exact opposite, a major attack on Israel. What a difference a president makes, right?\"\n\nTrump recounted several conversations he had with foreign leaders as president, acting out negotiations with China, Russia and other nations.\n\n\"He believed me 10%,\" Trump said of warnings he gave Putin about Ukraine. \"And that's all you needed. Same with President Xi (Jinping) and China.\"\n\nAnd he mocked President Joe Biden's approach to international affairs, including his remarks on the attack in Israel.\n\n\"It wasn't Winston Churchill, let me put it that way,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has made a series of trips to eastern Iowa over the last month, aiming to cement his lead ahead of the first-in-the-nation caucuses as he courts farmers, pushes new immigration proposals and criticizes both his Republican and Democratic challengers alike.\n\nThe former president remains the Republican frontrunner both in Iowa and nationally as he battles several ongoing court cases He continued to mock his legal battles Saturday, calling the four indictments against him \"fake,\" \"phony\" and \"political.\"\n\n\"You know Al Capone?\" Trump said. \"Has anybody ever heard of Alphonse Capone? He was a seriously vicious gangster. He didn't get indicted four times, only once.\"\n\nHe also reiterated his comments stand on abortion, saying you have to have the “three exceptions” in order to win — exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. And he again took credit for installing pro-life justices on the Supreme Court, paving the way for the overturn of Roe.\n\n“Some people say, Oh, Trump isn’t pro-life enough. Other people look and say I don't care what he's saying. That's the guy that got us here to talk in the first place.”\n\nLinda Tyler, a 76-year-old Waterloo resident and retired teacher, said she plans to caucus for Trump in January.\n\n“I think I liked mainly that he was personal with the people in the crowd,” Tyler said. “He brought up issues, like the abortion issue that, you know, is very controversial. And he took time to explain it and his viewpoint.”\n\nAnd Michael Hughes, a 73-year-old who lives in the Cedar Rapids area, said he liked a couple of other candidates in the field, like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, but hears \"a lot of false promises,\" and said he only trusts Trump to fulfill them.\n\n\"Actions speak louder than words,\" Hughes said. \"At the end of the day, I want to see something done.\"\n\nGalen Bacharier covers politics for the Register.

The United Kingdom, European Union, Canada, Australia and Japan also announced fresh sanctions on Russia.\n\nEarlier in the day, Germany said it halted certifying a $11 billion 750-mile pipeline that connects Russia directly to Germany. The Nord Stream 2 project was completed in September but has not yet received the final green light from German regulators.\n\nRussia sharply escalated its military campaign against Ukraine on Monday night, recognizing two pro-Russian breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine before ordering troops into the territories.\n\nMoscow has long maintained that it has no soldiers on the ground in eastern Ukraine.\n\nHowever NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Russia has had troops inside the regions – known as the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) – since they were self-declared in 2014.\n\nStoltenberg slammed the troop movement as a “further invasion of a country that has already been invaded.”\n\nPutin has not yet set a timeline for troops to move into the separatist regions, but in a speech Tuesday afternoon, Biden described events now underway in Ukraine as “the beginning of a Russian invasion.”\n\n“This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community,” Biden said.\n\nIn a national address on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was still pursuing diplomacy as a way out of the crisis. Reservists would be called up for military training, he said, but there will be no general mobilization of armed forces.\n\n“We desire peace and calm, but if we are quiet today then tomorrow we will disappear,” Zelensky said.\n\nThe Ukrainian President also referred to Putin’s announcement that the Minsk Agreements – designed to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine – no longer applied, saying that Ukraine remained committed to seeking its sovereignty and integrity.\n\nPutin, who has steadily amassed some 150,000 military personnel near Ukraine’s borders, appeared to cast doubt on the sovereignty of Russia’s neighbor in an angry speech on Monday.\n\n“Ukraine has never had traditions of its own statehood,” he said, seemingly calling into question the country’s right to exist as an independent nation, and referring to its eastern region as “ancient Russian lands.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the EU sanctioned 351 Russian lawmakers who voted to recognize the breakaway regions and the UK announced sanctions against five Russian banks and three Russian oligarchs.\n\nOther nations, including Australia and Japan, vowed to work in lockstep with the international community on sanctions.\n\nThe Baltic states – long fearful of Russian encirclement – watched Monday’s events with alarm.\n\n“Putin just put (Franz) Kafka & (George) Orwell to shame: No limits to dictator’s imagination, no lows too low, no lies too blatant, no red lines too red to cross,” the Prime Minister of Lithuania, Ingrida Šimonytė, wrote on Twitter.\n\n“What we witnessed tonight might seem surreal for democratic world. But the way we respond will define us for the generations to come,” she said.\n\nInternational condemnation\n\nAmid the clamor of countries condemning Russia’s planned incursion, some nations steered clear of criticizing Moscow.\n\nDuring an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council Monday evening, India called for “restraint on all sides,” stopping short of criticizing Russia.\n\nChina’s envoy to the United Nations on Monday called for “all parties” to exercise restraint and avoid “fueling tensions” in Ukraine, but stopped short of condemning the Kremlin’s recognition of independence for the DPR and LPR. China’s Foreign Ministry evaded more than a dozen questions regarding Ukraine at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nKenya’s envoy to the United Nations, however, delivered a blistering statement on Putin’s imperial ambitions in Ukraine. “We believe that all states formed from empires that have collapsed or retreated have many peoples in them yearning for integration with peoples in neighboring states. This is normal and understandable. After all, who does not want to be joined to their brethren and to make common purpose with them?” Martin Kimani said Monday, according to a readout of his remarks.\n\n“However, Kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force. We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of dominion and oppression,” he said, adding that Kenya rejected “expansion on any basis, including racial, ethnic, religious or cultural factors.”\n\nFor almost eight years, the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have seen a low-intensity conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces, which has left more than 14,000 people dead.\n\nMoscow has also distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in Donbas in recent years. Western officials and observers have accused Putin of attempting to establish facts on the ground by naturalizing Ukrainians as Russian citizens.\n\nKyiv and the West maintain that the region is part of Ukrainian territory, although the Ukrainian government asserts the two regions have been, in effect, Russian-occupied since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the date Nord Stream 2 was completed.", "authors": ["Tara John Tamara Qiblawi Nada Bashir", "Tara John", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Nada Bashir"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/09/04/nato-summit-wales/15056103/", "title": "Ukraine president, rebels hope for cease-fire deal", "text": "Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNEWPORT, Wales — Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko won NATO's support Thursday as he and pro-Russian rebels voiced hope they could reach a cease-fire agreement as early as Friday.\n\nPoroshenko said he was ready to order a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine if a deal is signed at peace talks scheduled in Minsk, Belarus. The rebels seek a political settlement for their mostly Russian-speaking region.\n\n\"Look, Ukraine is fighting for peace,\" Poroshenko said at a news conference during the opening day of the NATO summit here. \"It's Ukraine which pays the highest price every single day, losing lives of soldiers, innocent civilians.\" He expressed \"careful optimism\" about Friday's meeting.\n\nNATO issued a statement late Thursday saying the leaders and alliance \"stand united in our support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.\"\n\nA day earlier, Poroshenko said he talked with Russian President Vladimir Putin about an outline toward a possible peace deal. Putin sketched out a seven-point plan that included the pullback of Ukrainian armed forces from cities and villages in the disputed eastern Ukraine regions and an end to operations by separatists.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen remained cautious Thursday, saying, \"What matters is what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nTalk of a truce came as pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine stepped up attacks around the rebel-held city of Luhansk, and armored vehicles advanced on the port city of Mariupol, according to Ukrainian media reports.\n\nAt the two-day summit, Poroshenko met with several leaders of the 28-nation alliance, including President Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, seeking support in the months-long Ukraine crisis.\n\nA White House official said Obama and the other Western leaders expressed solidarity with Ukraine and agreed Russia should be punished for its conduct.\n\n\"The leaders reiterated their condemnation of Russia's continued flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and agreed on the need for Russia to face increased costs for its actions,\" U.S. deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said. \"The leaders also expressed their strong support for President Poroshenko's efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that Ukraine's expressed desire to join NATO is \"a blatant attempt to derail all efforts at initiating a dialogue of national reconciliation.\"\n\nNATO's charter says an attack on one member is an attack on the entire alliance, but the organization has made it clear that membership for Ukraine isn't in the cards anytime soon.\n\nNATO and the United States have criticized Russia for sending weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine. Russia denies it is involved in the fighting. More than 2,600 people have died in the clashes since April, according to a United Nations report.\n\nObama and Cameron set the tone for the NATO gathering by penning a joint opinion piece in Thursday's (London) Times that pressed the leaders to confront the \"brutal and poisonous\" Islamic State militant group attacking in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"Those who want to adopt an isolationist approach misunderstand the nature of security in the 21st century,\" they wrote. \"Developments in other parts of the world, particularly in Iraq and Syria, threaten our security at home.\"\n\nThe alliance made no specific pledges of action. Rasmussen said he believed the broader international community \"has an obligation to stop the Islamic State from advancing further\" and would seriously consider requests for assistance, particularly from the Iraqi government.\n\nObama and Cameron were more blunt in their editorial: \"If terrorists think we will weaken in the face of their threats, they could not be more wrong.

Tellingly, the Russian government has not acknowledged casualties in the sinking of the ship, a marked contrast to the very public discussion about the Kursk submarine disaster, which claimed the lives of 118 sailors in 2000.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN visited the Moskva in 2015.

US officials believe Putin is angry over the failures of his troops in Ukraine. They believe Putin’s advisers have not been telling him the full truth and did not prepare him for potential setbacks.\n\nThe warship fiasco comes just weeks after top Russian military officials announced a shift in the focus of the invasion after their offensive appeared to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve complete air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion.\n\nRussia was quick to strike back.\n\nUkraine’s Operational Command South said in a statement early Saturday that the situation in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions was “increasingly hostile.”\n\n“Desperately trying to gain a foothold and hold on to the positions of the southern front, the world’s most shameful army is pursuing civilians in Mykolayiv and Kherson regions.

It sent a diplomatic note to the State Department warning of “unpredictable consequences” should the support continue, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the document.\n\nSome Biden administration officials believe that the diplomatic note shows the Russians are hurting, one official said. The official explained that they believe the Russians would not have sent that message if they felt they were in a strong place on the battlefield.\n\nThe note, known as a demarche, was sent earlier this week as the US administration was preparing to announce that it would be sending a new military aid package worth $800 million to the Ukrainians. The EU has also approved an additional 500 million euros for military equipment for Ukraine.\n\nFor the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with high-power capabilities that some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago.\n\nThese include Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzers and 300 more Switchblade drones. These types of weapons are designed for the type of fighting that’s likely to take place in the Donbas region — open terrain rather than urban and wooded areas.\n\nThe US is also shipping 40,000 artillery rounds, but that amount could be expended within several days if fighting in the east grows heavier. During previous battles, Ukrainian forces fired thousands of artillery rounds in a day, a US official said Saturday.\n\nThere are growing concerns about the need to get more ammunition, in particular artillery ammunition, to Ukrainian forces more rapidly, a US official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Retired general: This key town needs to be on everyone's mind right now 02:43 - Source: CNN Retired general: This key town needs to be on everyone's mind right now 02:43\n\nThe Ukrainian military and regional officials have said Russian attacks have intensified in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east of the country as they prepare for a major ground offensive there.\n\nGoing forward, US officials believe the likely Russia strategy is to move weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine from their current positions just north and then encircle and cut off Ukraine forces that are there, the official said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley are conducting daily phone calls with counterparts in the region to encourage them to ship more weapons and supplies to Ukraine as soon as possible.\n\nSerhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk region military administration, has warned civilians who remain in Luhansk to leave the area. “It is extremely dangerous to stay in the cities now.

Ukrainian soldiers were removing bodies from the streets with caution.\n\nResidents of the town of Bucha said civilians were killed without apparent provocation.\n\nEU developing new Russia sanctions\n\nThe European Union will level new sanctions in the wake of killings of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, the president of the European Council said Sunday. Charles Michel, tweeting about \"haunting images\" out of Bucha, said \"further EU sanctions & support are on their way.\"\n\nSeveral other European leaders condemned the atrocities, and Germany’s defense minister even suggested the EU consider banning Russian gas imports, which many of the member countries depend on.\n\nThe EU is helping Ukraine and nongovernmental organizations gather evidence for investigations of Russia by international courts for its actions in Ukraine, he said. The U.N.'s International Court of Justice last month ruled that Russia should \"immediately suspend\" its military operations in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko is among the officials accusing Russia of war crimes, telling the German newspaper BILD: \"What happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide.''\n\nIn an interview published Saturday, the former chief prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes tribunals, Carla Del Ponte, called for an international arrest warrant to be issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Putin is a war criminal,” she told Swiss newspaper Le Temps.\n\n– Katie Wadington\n\n'A different kind of war': Intelligence secrets revealed as weapon against Putin\n\nIn the age of social media and widespread disinformation, a new weapon has emerged to counter aggression by a foreign power – the revelation of intelligence secrets.\n\nThe kind of assessments that were previously kept under wraps are now being shared by U.S. and British intelligence agencies in an effort to expose what is happening on the battlefield – and inside the Kremlin – during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEven before the war began Feb. 24, U.S. officials detailed Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans to attack Ukraine and create a false flag operation as a pretext for going to war. This past week, the U.S. publicized its findings that Putin was being misled by his military advisers, and Britain's spy chief said demoralized Russian troops were refusing to carry out orders and sabotaging their own equipment.\n\nMark Galeotti, a Russia expert at University College London, said the public intelligence campaign “reflects the fact that we now live in a different age, politically and internationally. And this is a different kind of war.”\n\nHike in gas prices comes with costlier cars as well\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine is widely blamed for a drastic increase rise in gas prices. The vehicles the fuel goes into are getting more expensive as well.\n\nThe global auto industry has yet to overcome the pandemic-induced shortage of computer chips and other vital parts that has shrunk production, slowed deliveries and sent prices for new and used cars soaring. Now it faces another major challenge.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine, a key producer of electrical wiring, has led to a scarcity of that vital component. And if Russian exportation of metals such as palladium for catalytic converters and nickel for electric vehicle batteries gets disrupted or halted, the cost of vehicles amid surging demand figures to continue rising.\n\nMark Fulthorpe, an executive director for S&P Global, expects a tight supply and high prices well into 2023.\n\n“Until inflationary pressures start to really erode consumer and business capabilities, it’s probably going to mean that those who have the inclination to buy a new vehicle, they’ll be prepared to pay top dollar,” Fulthorpe said.\n\nKirby mum on Belgorod attack responsibility\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby on Sunday dismissed questions surrounding Friday’s explosion at a Russian fuel depot in Belgorod. The attacked facility housed civilian-used petroleum.\n\nWhile the Russians have pinned the attack on Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declined to take responsibility for it. The attack was the first inside Russia since it invaded its neighbor Feb. 24.\n\nKirby, speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" also declined to attribute the attack to the Ukrainians: \"I’ll let (Zelenskyy) speak to the operations that they conduct, that’s the appropriate thing. We want to preserve as much of their operational security as we can.”\n\nThe Pentagon spokesman emphasized that the Ukrainians have a right to defend themselves and that the U.S. is focused on helping them do that. \"Russia is the aggressor and they are attacking inside Ukraine, very very brutally,\" Kirby said. \"It’s not just that they're hitting oil and weapons depots and airfields, I mean they’re hitting residential areas, they’re killing civilians.\"\n\n– Ana Faguy\n\nRussia targets Odesa fuel sites in new strikes\n\nRussian forces launched an airstrike Sunday on the Black Sea port of Odesa, in southern Ukraine, sending up clouds of dark smoke that veiled parts of the city. The Russian military said the targets were an oil processing plant and fuel depots around Odesa, which is Ukraine's largest port and home to its navy.\n\n\"I live in that eight-floor building. At 6 in the morning, Russia launched an attack, and this piece of rock reached my house,” said Maiesienko Ilia, who lives near one of the targeted facilities.\n\nThe Odesa city council said Ukraine’s air defense shot down some missiles before they hit the city. Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said there were no casualties from the attack.\n\nThe smaller port of Mariupol, located to the east on the Sea of Azov, remained cut off from the rest of the country as Russian and Ukrainian soldiers fought for control of the besieged city. About 100,000 civilians, less than a quarter of the prewar population of 430,000, are believed to be trapped there with little or no food, water, fuel and medicine.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nToo soon for Zelenskyy, Putin to meet, Russia indicates\n\nRussia's top negotiator in talks with Ukraine says it’s too early to talk about a meeting between the countries’ leaders.\n\nVladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation in Tuesday’s talks in Istanbul, said “there is still a lot of work to do” to finalize a draft agreement before Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could meet.\n\nIn remarks carried Sunday by the Interfax news agency, Medinsky reaffirmed that the parties reached a tentative agreement on the need for Ukraine to adopt a neutral status and refrain from holding foreign military bases in exchange for international security guarantees.\n\nThe Kremlin demands that Ukraine acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and recognize the independence of Russia-backed separatist regions in Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy: Troops shell retreating Russians\n\nUkraine has regained control over some areas of the Kyiv region as Russian forces pulled back over the last few days. But leaders warn this does not signal that Russia is giving up; rather, forces could be refueling and shifting their strategy to the Donbas region and the south of Ukraine.\n\nIn his nightly video address Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said troops were not allowing the Russians to retreat without a fight: “They are shelling them. They are destroying everyone they can.”\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said Saturday that the capital was \"liberated\" from invading Russian forces.\n\n\"Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from the invader,\" she said in a Facebook post.\n\nUS to facilitate transfer of Soviet-era tanks, reports say\n\nThe Biden administration intends to work with allies to provide Soviet-made tanks to Ukraine to help its defense in the eastern Donbas region, according to a report from The New York Times.\n\nCNN confirmed the report, citing unnamed officials who said the T-72 tanks would be delivered within \"days, not weeks.\"\n\nThe report, citing an unnamed U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity, says the move was requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who held an hourlong phone call with President Joe Biden this week.\n\nThe U.S. would act as an intermediary, according to the Times. The official said the tanks would allow Ukraine forces to conduct long-range artillery strikes on Russian targets in Donbas, which borders Russia.\n\nThe White House declined to comment to USA TODAY.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/russia-ukraine-joe-biden-news-conference/index.html", "title": "Russia 'will move in' to Ukraine, Biden predicts, but 'minor incursion ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday predicted Russia “will move in” to Ukraine, citing existential concerns by the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, even as he acknowledged disunity within NATO over how to respond to a “minor incursion.”\n\nThe candid assessment laid bare the struggle Biden faces in creating meaningful consequences and deterrents for Moscow, which remains closely intertwined economically with the United States’ top European partners.\n\nThe remark elicited near-immediate outcry in Kyiv, where officials have been meeting with Biden’s top diplomat as Russian troops amass on the country’s border. High-level attempts to clean-up the comment soon followed at the White House.\n\nWhile Biden vowed withering economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the frontier, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur.\n\n“It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do,” Biden told reporters at an East Room news conference. “But if they actually do what they’re capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine.”\n\nLater, asked to clarify what he meant by “minor incursion,” Biden said he drew the line at “Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters”\n\n“I think that changes everything,” the President said. “But it depends on what he does, to what extent we’ll get total unity on the NATO front.”\n\n“It’s very important that we keep everyone in NATO on the same page. That’s what I’m spending a lot of time doing, and there are differences,” he went on. “There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens.”\n\nThe candid assessment of NATO’s divisions – which have been well documented, even as US and Western officials seek to project unity amid the crisis – left Ukrainian officials aghast. One told CNN’s Matthew Chance he was “shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion” and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions.\n\n“This gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,” the official added, claiming he’d never heard any nuance like this from the US administration before.\n\n“Kyiv is stunned,” he said, referring to the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe White House sought to explain Biden’s remarks by pointing out a Russian attack in cyberspace or through paramilitary forces would prompt a reciprocal response compared to a scenario where Russian troops move from their positions into Ukraine.\n\n“President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,” press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement following Biden’s marathon news conference.\n\n“President Biden also knows from long experience that the Russians have an extensive playbook of aggression short of military action, including cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics,” Psaki went on. “And he affirmed today that those acts of Russian aggression will be met with a decisive, reciprocal, and united response.”\n\nA senior administration official said if Russian military forces tried to take Ukrainian territory by force and violated Ukrainian sovereignty – whether that was a “small portion or a large portion” of land – that would constitute an “invasion” by the Biden administration’s standards and would warrant severe penalties.\n\nAnd while the official acknowledged the US and NATO members likely will not have the “same list” of targets and details matching on every measure, the response would remain “highly unified” and “provide a force multiplier to actions we take.”\n\nBiden’s remarks came as the US entered what officials have deemed a dangerous period, when a Russian invasion could occur at any moment. The President, while acknowledging lingering uncertainty over Putin’s intentions, said Wednesday he believed the Russian leader would soon invade Ukraine.\n\n“I’m not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something,” Biden said, describing a leader searching for relevance in a post-Soviet world. “He is trying to find his place in the world between China and the west.”\n\nBiden’s prediction of an invasion was the firmest acknowledgment to date the United States fully expects Putin to move after amassing 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border.\n\nAfter speaking with Putin twice last month, Biden said he believed his Russian counterpart had a good understanding of the economic sanctions he was preparing to enact.\n\n“He’s never seen sanctions like the ones I promised will be imposed if he moves, number one,” he said, adding the level of punishment would depend on what Russia’s invasion looks like.\n\nThat includes limiting Russian transactions in US financial institutions – “anything that involves dollar denominations,” Biden said.\n\nThe President warned Russian lives would be lost in an invasion, along with potential Ukrainian casualties.\n\n“The cost of going into Ukraine in terms of physical loss of life for the Russians – they’ll be able to prevail over time but it’s going to be heavy,” he said. “It’s going to be real. It’s going to be consequential. Putin has a stark choice. Either de-escalation or diplomacy. Confrontation and consequences.”\n\n“This is not all just a cake walk for Russia,” he went on. “Militarily, they have overwhelming superiority. And as it relates to Ukraine, they’ll pay a stiff price immediately, near term, medium term and long term if they do it.”\n\nBiden speculated Putin was not seeking “any full-blown war,” but said he did believe he was looking for some type of confrontation: “Do I think he’ll test the west? Test the United States and NATO as significantly as he can? Yes, I think he will. But I think he’ll pay a serious and dear price for it.”\n\nBiden’s prediction came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday urged Ukrainians to not panic and to “calm down” over fears of a possible Russian invasion.\n\n“All our citizens, especially the elderly, need to understand this: Everyone needs to exhale. Calm down. Don’t run for emergency supplies like buckwheat and matches. To all the media: Remain as the media, not become a source of mass hysteria. Do not help the enemy in the pursuit of hype by reporting daily that war may happen tomorrow! This will definitely not stop it.”\n\n“What is new here? Is this not the reality for the past eight years? Didn’t the invasion begin in 2014? Did the threat of the war emerge just now?” he said.\n\nThe only reason for “panic is that after eight years we are still influenced by this panic,” he added.\n\nZelensky said Russia’s “aim is to weaken Ukraine” in order to force Kyiv to concede to Moscow and “to create such a background that our ‘no’ sounds weaker.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader said Moscow is “actively attacking your nerves, not our state. So that you have a constant feeling of panic.”\n\nThis story and its headline have been updated with additional reporting Wednesday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-thursday-intl/index.html", "title": "Peace in Europe 'shattered' as Russia invades Ukraine | CNN", "text": "Moscow and Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia has launched an unprecedented military assault on Ukraine by land, air and sea that has already left dozens dead, prompting Western leaders to condemn Moscow and vow unity with Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian ministers said the Kremlin had begun a “full-scale invasion” of their country, and the fighting appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s.

The Russian claim of a need to “denazify” Ukraine is one Putin has touted repeatedly over the years and is baseless.

At least seven people were killed and 17 were wounded in a missile attack on a military area northeast of the capital, Ukrainian authorities said.\n\nZelensky said Ukrainian forces were doing “exceptionally” in the Donbas region, and while Russian troops were slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region in Ukraine’s north, Ukrainian defenses were holding elsewhere. Russian forces did seize the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the scene of Europe’s worst nuclear disaster.\n\nUkraine’s borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service.

After months of ratcheting up tensions, the wide-scale military assault still came as a shock – especially in Kyiv, where residents had, until Wednesday, continued to go about their daily lives as foreign governments withdrew their diplomatic staff from the capital.\n\nA local resident sits in a car while preparing to leave Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.

I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war,” Zelensky told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview Sunday. But he warned that any failure of negotiation attempts fail could lead to “a third World War.”\n\nUkrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov weighed in on the possibility of Ukraine agreeing to neutral status during a media event in Moscow on Saturday.\n\n“After our operation in Ukraine ends, and I hope its ends with a signing of a comprehensive agreement on the issues I mentioned – security issues, Ukraine’s neutral status with the guarantees of its security as (Putin), a couple of months ago as I recall, commented at a news conference on our initiative of non-expansion of NATO, he said we understood every country needs guarantees of its security,” said Lavrov.\n\nBut details on negotiations remain scant with many NATO countries, including the US, remaining on the outside looking in when it comes to the secretive talks, with one European defense official calling negotiations “a bit of a dark avenue right now.”\n\nThe Biden administration still sees no indication that Putin is willing or ready to deescalate the conflict – making it difficult for US officials to be optimistic about the current state of negotiations, one source familiar with the situation said.\n\nBut at the same time, this source also said that the US is not pressuring Ukraine to accept or reject specific concessions and is not involved in the negotiation process.\n\nThe US National Security Council declined to comment.\n\nRussian demands\n\nSome of the terms Ukraine has said it may be willing to consider seem more feasible than others, but at the end of the day, NATO countries are still skeptical of Russia’s engagement.\n\n“It is very close hold, and no one really knows what’s going on,” the European defense official said. “Ukraine’s positions haven’t changed – ceasefire, withdrawal of troops and security guarantees.”\n\n“Anyone who says they know something about the status of the talks, (they) really don’t,” the official added.\n\nPutin laid out several issues to achieve a ceasefire with Ukraine in a Thursday phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to Turkish presidential spokesman İbrahim Kalin.\n\n“The first is Ukraine’s neutrality,” Kalin said in an interview with the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet published Saturday, adding that would mean Ukraine agreeing to not become a NATO member. “Second, disarmament and mutual security guarantees in the context of the Austrian model. Third, the process that the Russian side refers to as ‘de-Nazification.’ Fourth, removing obstacles to the widespread use of Russian language in Ukraine. It is understood that some progress has been made in the first four articles of the ongoing negotiations. It is too early to say that there is full agreement or that an agreement is about to be signed.”\n\nKalin said Putin had additional demands that were “the most difficult issues” – the recognition of the annexation of Crimea and the two so-called republics in Donbas. Kalin said these final two issues “are not acceptable demands for Ukraine and the international community.”\n\n“If a point is reached in the first four articles and an agreement is reached, there can be a discussion at the leaders’ level regarding the fifth and sixth articles,” Kalin said in the interview, adding that if the negotiations take place, “it may be possible to reach an agreement and end the war.”\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield on Sunday declined to set terms on what the US would or would not accept when it came to an agreement between Ukraine and Russia to end the fighting.\n\n“This is for the Ukrainians themselves to decide what is too much for them. It is not our decision on that and we support their efforts. So I can’t preview what they will end up coming up in their negotiations with the Russians,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”\n\nAsked by Tapper again, if the US would recognize Crimea or Donbas as a part of Russia should that be a part of the agreement, Thomas-Greenfield again declined to answer.\n\n“I can’t say that at the moment. We certainly have not recognized the independent Donbas regions just declared as independent. But I can’t review how we will respond to a negotiated settlement that the Ukrainians come up with the Russians to save the lives of their own people.”\n\nThe lack of clarity about the status of negotiations is raising additional questions about what Ukraine is willing to agree to and how Russia’s demands would be implemented if they ultimately reach some sort of agreement.\n\nZelenksky said Saturday there were “compromises” his country could not make in negotiations with Putin.\n\n“Any compromises related to our territorial integrity and our sovereignty and the Ukrainian people have spoken about it, they have not greeted Russian soldiers with a bunch of flowers, they have greeted them with bravery, they have greeted them with weapons in their hands,” he told CNN’s Zakaria when asked about the Russian demands.\n\n“You cannot just make a president of another country to recognize anything by the use of force,” he added.\n\nMany details of Russia’s demands, whether Ukraine would accept them and how Ukraine would even implement them remain unclear, a senior NATO official said. That includes what it would mean for Ukraine to adopt a “neutral” status with the West – a possibility that one congressional source told CNN has caused heartburn for US officials.\n\n“Does that mean they forswear NATO? Does that mean they forswear the (European Union)? Can they not have any other external assistance?” the NATO official said. “My sense is it’s going to be a very complex negotiation.”\n\nNeutrality policy\n\nA European diplomat told CNN last week that if Ukraine were to adopt a neutrality policy and also demilitarize, it would effectively be a surrender – calling such a move “Moscow-style neutrality.”\n\nThe Kremlin has floated the notion that Kyiv could adopt a Swedish or Austrian neutrality policy. However, a Swedish diplomat dismissed the notion of Swedish neutrality, saying the idea that their country is neutral is not true and attempts to try to frame it as such are consistent with longstanding Russian efforts to misrepresent Sweden’s national security policy.\n\n“Whenever the term ‘Austrian neutrality’ comes up, it has to be remembered that this is a model of an armed neutrality. This form of neutrality doesn’t mean that a country lies down its arms and hopes that nobody attacks it. It’s a neutrality where a country – at least in theory – is armed and ready to defend itself against all foreign belligerents,” said Martin Weiss, Austria’s ambassador to the US.\n\nThe NATO official added that it is unclear what kind of agreement Russia and Ukraine might come to about the territory Russia has taken control of since invading on February 24. The official said the “hope” expressed by both Russian and Ukrainian officials in recent days appears to be belied by the fact that “some pretty clear differences remain” between the parties.\n\n“I think we just need to be mindful that the Russians almost certainly will seek to continue to resupply and will probably continue to fight, up until the time that things are agreed,” the official said. “Whatever the solution, if there’s diplomatic resolution and there’s an agreement, it has to be clear and binding. And it has to be monitorable. … People will be looking to ensure that the Russians end the war conclusively. And there isn’t some lingering threat that remains.”\n\nWhile the source familiar with the Biden administration’s view of the talks told CNN that some of the terms Ukraine has said it may be willing to consider seem more feasible than others, the source also indicated that the US will be wary of Russia’s intentions until Putin shows some signs that he is ready to deescalate.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Natasha Bertrand Alex Marquardt", "Zachary Cohen", "Natasha Bertrand", "Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/03/20"}]}

But the rapid warming of the planet due to human emissions of heat-trapping gases is causing above average water temperatures, leading to stress events like mass bleaching.\n\nCoral bleaching tends to happen when water temperatures are much warmer than normal. But for the first time, this mass bleaching comes despite La Niña, a weather event which is characterized by cooler-than-normal temperatures across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, the Authority’s scientists said.\n\nThis picture taken on March 7 shows a diver swimming amongst the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of the Australian state of Queensland. Glenn Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe report surveyed a total of 719 reefs from a low flying aircraft during the Australian 2021-2022 summer season and found that 654 reefs, 91%, “exhibited some bleaching.”\n\n“The surveys confirm a mass bleaching event, with coral bleaching observed at multiple reefs in all regions. This is the fourth mass bleaching event since 2016 and the sixth to occur on the Great Barrier Reef since 1998,” the Australian Government’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said in its findings.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Drone footage captures thousands of turtles nesting 01:27 - Source: CNN Drone footage captures thousands of turtles nesting 01:27\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef’s waters started warming in December 2021 and exceeded “historical summer maximums.” It was hit by three distinct heat waves throughout the summer until early April 2022, which increased “thermal stress” throughout the reef’s central and northern areas, the report found.\n\nStressed coral ejects algae from within its tissue, depriving it of a food source. If conditions don’t improve, coral can starve and die, turning white as its carbonate skeleton is exposed.\n\n“Even the most robust corals require nearly a decade to recover,” Jodie Rummer, associate professor of Marine Biology at James Cook University in Townsville, told CNN in March.\n\n“So we’re really losing that window of recovery. We’re getting back-to-back bleaching events, back-to-back heat waves.

That event came just three years after back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. Previous bleaching occurred in 1998 and 2002.\n\nScientists say time is running out for the reefs to be able to recover and that governments urgently need to address the root cause: the climate crisis.\n\nThis picture taken on March 7 shows the current condition of coral on the Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of the Australian state of Queensland. Glenn Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“To give our reef a fighting chance, we must deal with the number one problem: climate change. No amount of funding will stop these bleaching events unless we drive down our emissions this decade,” said Amanda McKenzie, CEO of the Climate Council in March.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia’s national treasures, stretching some 1,400 miles (2,300km) down the Queensland coast, and attracting around three million tourists a year prior to the pandemic.\n\nThe Australian government has faced prolonged pressure from UNESCO to prove that it’s doing enough to save the reef and has been called out by global climate experts, among others, for not doing enough to transition Australia away from fossil fuels and slash greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe report’s publication comes after leading scientists called on the agency to release its findings before the federal election on May 21.", "authors": ["Hilary Whiteman Hannah Ritchie Helen Regan", "Hilary Whiteman", "Hannah Ritchie", "Helen Regan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/australia/great-barrier-reef-high-coral-report-australia-climate-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Parts of Great Barrier Reef record highest amount of coral in 36 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nParts of the Great Barrier Reef have recorded their highest amount of coral cover since the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) began monitoring 36 years ago, according to a report published Thursday.\n\nAn AIMS survey of 87 reefs found that between August 2021 and May 2022, average hard coral cover in the upper region and central areas of the reef increased by around one third.\n\nIt’s a rare piece of good news for the world-famous reef, which in March underwent its sixth mass bleaching event.\n\nAIMS CEO Dr. Paul Hardisty said the results in the north and central regions were a sign the reef could still recover from mass bleaching and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish that feed on coral.\n\nHowever, he emphasized that the loss of coral cover elsewhere in the reef suggests it is still susceptible to threats, like marine heatwaves. The report added that due to climate change, these disturbances that could reverse the progress in coral growth were likely to become more frequent and longer lasting.\n\nAIMS monitoring program team leader Dr. Mike Emslie said that most of the increase was driven by fast-growing Acropora corals which are “particularly vulnerable” to coral bleaching, wave damage caused by tropical cyclones and as prey for the starfish.\n\nCoral at Stanley Reef, about 130 kilometers off Townsville in Queensland, shows signs of bleaching. Australian Marine Conservation Society/Climate Council/Grumpy Turtle\n\n“This means that large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be negated by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate,” Emslie said.\n\nThe Australian Marine Conservation Society’s Great Barrier Reef Campaigner Cherry Muddle cautioned that while the report was a sign of progress, the reef remains at risk.\n\n“While this growth is positive and shows the reef is dynamic and can be resilient, it doesn’t discount the fact that the reef is under threat,” Muddle told CNN.\n\nA reef in danger\n\nFour of the reef’s six mass bleaching events have occurred since 2016. The most recent occurred in March this year, with 91% of the reefs surveyed impacted by bleaching, according to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA). That’s significantly more widespread than the time before, when about a quarter of the reef surveyed showed signs of severe bleaching in 2020.\n\nIn a May report, the GBRMPA warned that “events that cause disturbances on the reef are becoming more frequent.”\n\nBleaching is a result of warmer than normal water temperatures which triggers a stress reaction from the corals. However, according to GBRMPA scientists, this year’s coral bleaching was the first time it has occurred during La Niña, a weather event which is usually characterized by cooler-than-normal temperatures across the equatorial Pacific Ocean.\n\nAccording to Jodie Rummer, associate professor of Marine Biology at James Cook University in Townsville, the frequency of the mass bleaching events is cause for concern.\n\n“Even the most robust corals require nearly a decade to recover. So we’re really losing that window of recovery,” Rummer told CNN in March. “We’re getting back-to-back bleaching events, back-to-back heat waves. And, and the corals just aren’t adapting to these new conditions.”\n\nMany public figures, including “Aquaman” actor Jason Momoa and ocean explorer Philippe Cousteau, have called for UNESCO to add the natural wonder to its “in danger” list in hopes that it would incentivize action to save the reef.\n\nAustralia’s responsibility\n\nFor years, Australia has been criticized for its reliance on fossil fuels. However, the country’s new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has promised to take greater action to reduce emissions. On Thursday, Australia’s lower house passed a bill to enshrine the government’s commitment to reduce Australia’s emissions by 43% by 2030 in law, though it still needs the approval of the Senate.\n\nHowever, experts say that a 43% cut in emissions is still not enough to prevent the worsening effects of climate change and further damage to the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n“In Australia, to do our share, we really need to slash our emissions reductions by 75% by 2030 and that is to hold global warming to less than 1.5 degrees which is the critical threshold for the survival of coral reef as we know it,” Muddle told CNN.\n\n“We can create jobs, we can protect the reef, if we only embrace clean energy technology and stop all new coal and gas developments,” she added. “There’s momentum in the right direction but we need to see action, like bold action, and we need to see it now.”", "authors": ["Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 surge could peak later this month, expert says, but the next ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe current Covid-19 surge in the US, fueled by the Omicron variant, could peak later this month – but the next couple of weeks are critical, a health expert says.\n\nDr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, warns long-term planning is needed to avoid continued stress on the health care system, as hospitals become full, schools struggle to keep students in class and testing remains difficult to access.\n\n“We’re seeing two sets of things happening: A lot of vaccinated people getting infected. We’re doing fine. Largely avoiding getting particularly sick, avoiding the hospital; a lot of unvaccinated people and high-risk people who have not gotten boosted and they’re really filling up the hospitals, and so our hospital systems are under a lot of stress,” Jha told ABC’s “This Week.”\n\n“Then we have to start thinking about a long-term strategy for how do we manage this virus and not go from surge to surge feeling like we don’t really have a longer-termed approach,” said Jha.\n\nAccording to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services, about 24% of hospitals are reporting a “critical staffing shortage.”\n\nOf the approximately 5,000 hospitals that reported this data to HHS on Saturday, nearly 1,200 – about 1 in 4 – said they are currently experiencing a critical staffing shortage, the largest share of the entire pandemic. More than 100 other hospitals said they anticipate a shortage within the next week.\n\nThese staff shortages are growing as frontline health care workers are either infected or forced to quarantine due to exposure to Covid-19 just as the demand for treatment skyrockets: More than 138,000 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals as of Sunday, according to HHS. That’s not far from the all-time peak (about 142,200 in mid-January 2021) and an increase from around 45,000 in early November.\n\n“I expect this surge to peak in the next couple of weeks. It’ll peak in different places of America at different times, but once we get into February, I really do expect much, much lower case numbers,” Jha told ABC.\n\nOne of the tools critical to the fight against Covid-19 is testing, which is still hard to find in parts of the US.\n\nAs laboratories struggle to keep up with the increased demand for Covid-19 tests triggered by the surging Omicron variant, at least two health care providers have prioritized coronavirus testing for those who are exhibiting symptoms of the virus.\n\nLast week, multiple locations of the University of Washington health care system in Washington state started prioritizing testing solely for people “who have symptoms of respiratory illness or who have a known exposure to COVID-19,” spokesperson Susan Gregg told CNN. People without symptoms are not being tested, Gregg said, “due to the high volume of Omicron cases that are being processed in our laboratory.”\n\nThe University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill is facing a similar testing crush and is also restricting Covid-19 tests to those exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms, as well as university employees, and those requiring a test prior to a surgery, according to UNC Health director of news Alan M. Wolf.\n\nIn Georgia, the Department of Health announced the opening of two Covid-19 mega-testing sites Friday, as cases across the state continue to rise. Both sites, which are located just outside of Atlanta, are appointment-only. The state health department said it’s also in discussions to identify locations for additional testing sites.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, said testing is a major key to controlling the spread of Covid-19, including in schools, which are struggling to keep kids in classrooms in areas where transmission is high.\n\n“If you want to get kids and teachers back in schools, the way to do that is a multi-pronged approach, including flooding our schools with testing. Testing kids every week, testing teachers every week,” and requiring teachers and eligible students to be vaccinated, he told CNN’s Jim Acosta on Sunday.\n\nBalancing health and education\n\nChicago Public Schools, the nation’s third-largest school district, is among those struggling to balance health concerns with educational needs.\n\nClasses in the district were canceled again Monday for the fourth consecutive school day, after city officials and the Chicago Teachers Union failed to reach an agreement over the weekend on how to handle the city’s Covid-19 surge.\n\nThe union, citing concerns over Covid safety, wants a period of remote learning, while the city wants kids in classrooms.\n\nAtlanta schools returned to in-person classes Monday after four days of virtual learning.\n\nLisa Herring, superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools, told CNN twice-weekly mandatory testing for teachers has been extended to students whose parents consent to testing.\n\n“We want, for as much as we can, to keep our children inside of the brick and mortar, but we do need that data to be able to effectively support and ensure safety for everyone,” she said.\n\nOf approximately 50,000 students, they had received around 20,000 parental consent forms for testing, Herring said, and will continue to encourage more.\n\n“We have put in place several mitigation strategies that we are clear can help us keep children and staff in place when we’re able to identify positivity data. … But to be clear, we also recognize that in order to ensure health and wellness there will be times within schools or classrooms that pivoting to virtual may be necessary,” Herring said.\n\nLos Angeles Unified School District, the second-largest school district in the country, is requiring all students and employees to show a negative Covid-19 test result before returning to the classroom Tuesday.\n\nThe baseline test requirement was implemented at the beginning of the school year in August, and the district announced a week ago both the baseline test, along with required weekly testing for employees and students, would continue through January, given the current surge.\n\nTo help families meet this requirement, the district has been offering PCR testing at many school campuses over the past week. Take-home rapid antigen tests were also distributed, in line with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s announcement in late December that every California K-12 student would be provided with one.\n\nOn Monday, district data showed approximately 62,000 positive Covid-19 cases among students and staff, stopping them from entering school buildings Tuesday.\n\nDr. Richina Bicette-McCain, medical director at the Baylor College Medicine, told CNN on Sunday that schools were currently a higher-risk setting for Covid-19 because the tools to mitigate its spread were not being adequately employed.\n\nBicette-McCain said students needed access to testing and high-quality masks and said HEPA filters could be used in schools to increase ventilation.\n\n“Schools could potentially be very safe – we do have the tools to make in-person learning a safe situation. But when children went away for winter break we were seeing maybe about 120 pediatric cases of Covid in a single week, we were seeing overall in the United States about 170,000 cases per day,” she said. “Those numbers have increased exponentially. The environment that children are coming back to is not the same environment that they left from.”\n\nShe said protocols needed to change. “The numbers we’re seeing are likely a gross undercounting of the number of positive cases in the community right now.”\n\nSurge hitting hospitals\n\nHospitals continue to struggle with the number of cases.\n\nIn New York state, 40 hospitals have been required to stop non-essential, non-urgent elective surgeries for at least two weeks because of low patient bed capacity, the state’s health department said in a statement Saturday.\n\nIn late November, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order outlining a plan to address the Covid-19 winter surge. Part of that order requires that statewide hospital capacity is able to meet regional needs “while maintaining the long-term resiliency of the State’s healthcare infrastructure,” the statement says.\n\nIn some hospitals, up to 40% of patients with Covid-19 “are coming in not because they’re sick with Covid, but because they’re coming in with something else and have had Covid or the Omicron variant detected,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Sunday on Fox News.\n\nWalensky said the CDC has been screening “everybody who’s walking in the door” in many hospitals, and the breakdown of patients admitted with Covid-19 – as opposed to for Covid-19 – has differed by variant.\n\nBut Walensky also noted that while Omicron appears to be milder at the individual level, a large volume of cases could cause death rates to rise.\n\nPediatric cases of Covid-19 are also surging with more than 800 children being admitted to hospital with Covid-19 each day, and nearly 84,000 have been hospitalized since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest CDC data.\n\nAt Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, the positivity rate for children tested for Covid-19 has increased from 17.5% in December to 45% to date in January, according to CHLA Medical Director Dr. Michael Smit.\n\nCHLA currently has 41 patients in-house who have tested positive for Covid-19, and roughly a quarter of the children admitted to the facility with Covid-19 require admission to the pediatric ICU, with some requiring intubation, Smit told CNN on Saturday.\n\nChildren face a lower risk of Covid-19 hospitalization relative to other age groups, but “children aren’t supposed to die,” Walensky told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nThe “vast majority” of children who are hospitalized with Covid-19 are unvaccinated, and the best way to protect children from Covid-19 is to vaccinate everyone who is eligible, Walensky said.", "authors": ["Susannah Cullinane"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2024/04/07/maldives-coral-reefs-travelers-restore/73133403007/", "title": "How travelers to the Maldives can help restore its coral reefs", "text": "The coral fragment from the seafloor off the coast of the resort Siyam World Maldives in the Noonu Atoll had a stark contrast. One inch of the coral’s light brown tips was bumpy with living polyps, while the rest was dull white, resembling a dead tree branch.\n\nThis coral species, known as acropora hemprichii, grows in the shallow reefs of the Maldives in tapered branches which eventually look like a bush or dome as they grow.\n\nThat piece of coral I spotted broke off from its home likely due to a powerful wave or a careless snorkeler. Once it fell into the sand, it began to die off. To the untrained eye, it seemed like there was no hope for that little coral fragment.\n\nHowever, that fragment was far from dead, and the solution to reviving it was simple.\n\nCoral planting is a simple act of fastening a coral fragment to a metal frame and placing it in a safe, shallow area of the ocean. In mere months, the coral has the potential to flourish once again. As the corals regenerate, the reef becomes more habitable for fish, that swim through and make the frames part of their home. Over 25% of the world’s fish inhabit and get their food from coral reefs.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAs climate change and human activity continue to threaten coral reefs, tropical destinations such as the Maldives are turning to coral restoration initiatives, such as coral planting, to save the ocean, which they heavily rely on for tourism and the local way of life.\n\nResort guests are encouraged to get involved and protect the very ocean that drew them to the Maldives in the first place – and the call is being answered. According to Booking.com’s Sustainable Travel Report 2023, two-thirds of its 33,000 survey respondents said they “want to leave the places they visit better than when they arrived.”\n\n“Ninety-nine percent of people come to the Maldives for the ocean because they want to snorkel,” said Mariyam “Thuhu” Thuhufa, a marine biologist at Siyam World Maldives, which offers marine conservation activities for guests including coral planting and lagoon cleanups. “A lot of them do get very curious, a lot of them are keen to understand what they can see and how they can help.”\n\nNo one went to the Maldive 50 years ago: Now it's one of the hottest destinations.\n\nHow important are coral reefs to the Maldives?\n\nThe Maldives is an archipelago of over 1,000 islands sitting mere feet above sea level, which means the country is 99% ocean. And that’s where most of the natural diversity exists, from manta rays in the north to hammerhead sharks in the south.\n\n“Without the ocean, the Maldives just can’t exist,” said Thuhufa.\n\nAll Maldivians depend on the ocean in some way, 71% rely on it for their primary source of income. Maldivians get food from line fishing at coral reefs, such as snapper or emperor fish. Fishing for big game fish like tuna is also the second largest industry, following tourism.\n\nWithout healthy coral reefs, the islands wouldn’t even exist. “If you go to a local island, you’ll see a lot of the houses are built very close to the ocean, right next to the beach,” said Thuhufa. During monsoon season, from May to November, big swells wash away the beaches, but a healthy reef can break the wave energy before it reaches the island, she said.\n\nThe fate of coral reefs are in resorts’ hands\n\nTo Thuhufa, coral bleaching is one of the most pressing issues for the islands and “something the whole world is experiencing.” The last mass bleaching event, which occurred between 2014 and 2017, saw 15% of the world’s reefs die off. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts a fourth, even worse mass bleaching this year.\n\n\"It's looking like the entirety of the Southern Hemisphere is probably going to bleach this year,\" said ecologist Derek Manzello, the coordinator of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch which serves as the global monitoring authority on coral bleaching risk.\n\n“We are literally sitting on the cusp of the worst bleaching event in the history of the planet,” he said. Up to 90% of the world’s corals could be lost.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nThuhufa recalled an uninhabited island she visited for volunteer research work in high school. “The reef was so beautiful with so many vibrant colors,” she said. After the 2016 bleaching, she returned to the island to see how it was affected. “It was the most devastating thing I’ve seen,” she said. “Everything was bleached, everything was covered in algae.”\n\nWith tourism as the country’s biggest industry, resorts play a vital role in the protection of coral reefs.\n\nAlthough construction and increased human activity can damage the fragile ecosystems of reefs, many resorts in the Maldives are working to protect their house reefs by hiring in-house marine biologists and creating nurseries for coral planting. New resorts in the Maldives need to undergo an impact assessment before they can break ground (or sand in their case).\n\nA 2018 study analyzing the direct impact of seven luxury Maldivian resorts on coral reef health found that the amount of live coral and the size of colonies increased over time if the resort had conservation initiatives in place.\n\n“Your reef is protected in the sense that there’s no fishing, and guests are told not to touch corals,” Thuhufa said. “A lot more is put into the reefs to keep them healthy.”\n\nHowever, the study also revealed that resorts with poor management practices and more sedimentation and runoff can harm the reefs.\n\nWhat is it like to plant coral?\n\nI tried coral planting for the first time during my stay at Siyam World Maldives, and it was surprisingly easy and engaging.\n\nGuests can book the experience via the resort app, which they download during check-in, or their resort ambassador can arrange it.\n\nCoral planting is an emerging type of coral restoration, and since it’s only been done on a small scale, it doesn’t tackle the root of the problem of coral bleaching or warming temperatures. It can, however, help make a specific reef a bit more habitable and spread awareness of the condition of coral reefs.\n\nThe marine biology team met me on the beach with a hexagon-shaped metal frame and two containers filled with coral fragments they found. One by one, we attached the coral pieces to the frame using zip ties, ensuring they were flush with the metal. This way, the coral will merge and regrow over the frame.\n\nWe splashed water on the corals every half hour to ensure they didn’t dry out. When the frame was finished, we placed it in a shallow snorkeling area to join over 100 other coral frames. The marine biology team checked on the frames and removed any algae so the coral could breathe. The frames come in shapes like hearts or rays but remain open for fish to swim through.\n\nAlthough coral is sensitive, it’s also a resilient animal – yes, corals are technically considered tiny animals since, unlike plants, they don’t make their own food. Sometimes as small as a pencil tip, polyps make up the coral structure we see and attach to rocks, the seabed or in this case, a metal frame.\n\nDepending on the species of coral – and there are hundreds – the coral can take around five months to attach to the frame and then a few more months to regrow, according to Thuhufa.\n\nAs I dove underwater to explore the coral nursery, I noticed batfish, triggerfish and other colorful reef fish seamlessly swimming between anemones and among the coral frames.\n\nKathleen Wong is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Hawaii.

Perfect temperatures. A hum of bubbling saltwater.\n\nA team of marine biologists had done everything they could to set the stage for something akin to a romantic evening for a tank full of coral. As the anticipated hour arrived at the Florida Coral Rescue Center, the team hoped its efforts would induce the corals to spawn.\n\nThey did not disappoint. Over several evenings, more than 75% of the Center's brain coral colonies reproduced, creating nearly a half-million larvae.\n\nIn the ocean, fertilized larvae float for days or weeks before settling down to start life as a stone-producing member of society on the seafloor. These were scooped up for delivery to other restoration and research facilities, where they represent hope for the future of coral reefs in Florida and the Caribbean.\n\n“What we're doing here is basically preventing against extinction,” said Justin Zimmerman, a marine biologist at SeaWorld Orlando who oversees the rescue center and a recently added coral center in the theme park that simulates underwater conditions in the Florida Keys.\n\nHe's one of a cadre of marine biologists and scientists in dozens of organizations trying to preserve corals, more threatened than ever by disastrous marine heat waves and a deadly disease. The groups grow corals, preserve threatened and endangered species and build gene banks.\n\nReefs in Florida and the Caribbean struggled for years with pollution and rising temperatures. Then stony coral tissue loss disease arrived in 2014, decimating corals in a deadly wave along Florida's reefs. Over the past year, the reefs and Australia's Great Barrier Reef suffered massive losses during a global mass bleaching event brought on by record-setting marine heat waves.\n\nCorals, such as those under the coral center’s care, rescued as the disease advanced toward the southern end of the Keys, now hold the future in their gently waving polyps.\n\nIn a nondescript industrial complex, the center's large fiberglass aquariums each hold coral ecosystems, complete with small fish that provide critical nutrients, urchins and other sea life to simulate life underwater. A partnership among SeaWorld, Disney, the Florida Wildlife Foundation and others, the center houses 18 species in 524 corals. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums oversees a consortium that discusses coral care in a weekly teleconference.\n\nThey are among more than 30 organizations working with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to save the reefs that stretch more than 300 miles from north of Miami to the Dry Tortugas. Some propagate corals. Some transplant corals into ocean nurseries. Others tackle complex questions about genetics, cryopreservation and chemistry.\n\nTogether, they hope to one day produce enough healthy and genetically diverse corals to restore the reefs, if the rise in ocean temperatures can be stopped.\n\nA 'most complicated animal'\n\nGlobally, scientists are trying to unravel the mysteries of these creatures that form one of the planet’s most productive ecosystems. Corals cover about 1% of the world's seafloors, but support more than 25% of marine life in the oceans.\n\nAndy Stamper, Disney Conservation Science manager, has been a Disney veterinarian for years, at Animal Kingdom and at Living Seas in Epcot. Standing in the rescue center surrounded by corals, Stamper said they are \"the most complicated animal I’ve ever come across.”\n\n“They’re animal, vegetable and mineral, but then they also depend on bacteria, fungus and protozoa,” he said. “All of these organisms need to work together to make a healthy coral polyp.”\n\nHe sees parallels between the coral communities and the human collaboration needed to save them.\n\nRescue center staff learned to simulate natural periods of sunlight and moonlight with multicolored LED lights, and now spawning cycles are “very predictable,” Zimmerman said.\n\nMost spawning corals release bundles of eggs that resemble Dippin’ Dots ice cream. Surrounded by sperm inside a mucus shell, the pink bundles are no bigger than a piece of quinoa, Zimmerman said. The shell dissolves when bundles float to the surface, the sperm swim to find eggs from other colonies and fertilized eggs become larvae.\n\nBy early September, three other reef-building coral species had spawned – boulder coral, boulder star coral and mountainous star coral, he said. \"It’s very exciting to have all these years’ worth of work all come down to watching these corals do their thing.\"\n\nPropagating and replanting corals\n\nCoral science has advanced by leaps and bounds since Ken Nedimyer, who some consider the father of coral restoration, discovered how to farm corals in the Keys more than two decades ago, Stamper said.\n\nResearch projects range from high-tech and “really cool, sexy science” to the simplest of techniques volunteers can use, said Jessica Levy, director of restoration strategy at the Coral Restoration Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation enlists volunteers in Florida and the Caribbean to attach coral fragments to manufactured underwater “coral trees” and place them in coral nurseries along reefs.\n\nThey work with more than 20 species of coral, with a goal of “low-cost, high-reward projects” that get communities involved, Levy said. “The more diversity you have, the more resilience you have in your restoration efforts, because these corals, even within a single species, respond differently to different stress events.”\n\nCrossbreeding and cryopreservation\n\nIn the wild, Atlantic pillar corals suffered a 97% decline in Florida between 2015-2024, primarily from the stony coral disease. Only an estimated 24 living pillar coral colonies remain along the Keys.\n\nThe Florida Aquarium, which also spawns coral, is home to 170 endangered pillar coral colonies. Working with a team of international experts, they are developing cryopreservation techniques to preserve coral larvae in liquid nitrogen in a frozen but alive state.\n\nIf they can successfully raise larvae that have been frozen and thawed, it would be the first time scientists have cryogenically preserved coral larvae, then raised them, the aquarium said. If successful, larvae could be thawed decades or centuries from now.\n\nThe Aquarium, the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School and Mote Marine Laboratory are all working to crossbreed corals, especially the elkhorn and staghorn corals, which are designated as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and produce genetically enhanced corals more resilient to heat and disease.\n\nNOAA, the aquarium and dozens of other organizations also work with Secore International, a nonprofit dedicated to reef restoration that provides training on how to do sexual coral propagation.\n\nOnce the coral larvae are produced, the challenge is getting them to settle. Amy Wagoner Johnson, a professor at the University of Illinois’ Grainger College of Engineering, spearheads an international research collaboration to find design materials to make the ideal surface to attract and enhance the settling of coral larvae. She and colleagues take materials down to Curaçao's CARMABI research station for introduction to larvae.\n\nThe manufactured surface material is mortar-like, with additives that tweak the composition, then pressure-treated to carbonate and harden the materials, she said. When submerged in seawater, the substrates release ions that coral seem to respond to.\n\nWhy are corals important?\n\nReefs are a major part of the ocean food web, with nooks and crannies filled with worms, shrimps and other creatures. They provide habitat for fish that people rely on for food, they contribute millions to local tourism economies and provide important coastal protection from high waves during storms.\n\nCorals “underpin a way of life and are critical for millions around the world,\" said Alice Grainger, senior director of creative development for the restoration foundation.\n\n\"Even if we take a hit like we did last year, we can't abandon the communities that that rely on these ecosystems for their livelihoods and their and their way of life,\" she said. “If we lose these ecosystems, we see these coastal communities collapsing as well.\"\n\nWhat causes coral bleaching?\n\nThe reason corals serve as oases on the ocean floor is their relationship with the symbiotic algae, known as zooxanthellae, that live inside the polyps. The algae provides the rainbow of colors coral are known for, using energy from sunlight to create building blocks of sugars and proteins, and they help the corals remove waste.\n\nWhen water temperatures remain above 90 degrees for too long, the algae get stressed and release toxic byproducts, Stamper said. Then the coral polyps kick out the offending algae, and only the clear polyps and white limestone structures they’ve built remain, producing the “bleaching” effect.\n\nWhat's the future of coral restoration?\n\nProtecting and restoring coral reefs is “a really complicated problem,” said Wagoner Johnson. \"But it's far too early to give up hope.\"\n\nThe most important thing about the critical projects underway is the science being developed and how that will help buy time for coral restoration, said Bill Precht, a Miami-based scientist who wrote the first book on coral restoration in 2006.\n\n“We’ve made light-years of adjustment and progress,\" Precht said. \"Because of future advances in microbiology and genetics, we’re going to able to do things we can’t even imagine now.”\n\nPrecht and others question whether it’s futile to continue out-planting corals on the reef while climate change and greenhouse gas emissions still drive dramatic spikes in ocean temperatures. Even if humans do get a grip on global climate change, he fears it could take 50 to 100 years to bring ocean temperatures down enough for corals to thrive again.\n\nLike the collaborative ecosystems corals thrive in, Stamper said it’s going to take humans and all of these organizations “working together to bring these corals back.\" With our help, he said, “if any animal can do it, the corals can.”\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, has covered climate change, wildlife and the environment for decades.

According its report, those areas are improving after disturbances over the past decade, including mass bleaching.\n\nThe most recent coral bleaching took place in March, scientists reported.\n\nAmong the 87 reefs surveyed for the latest report, average hard coral cover in the north increased to 36%, up from 27% in 2021, and to 33% in the central reef from 26% last year.\n\nNews of the recovery in the reef’s northern and central parts was partly offset by the report’s finding a loss of coral cover in the southern region. There, scientists said, the reef fell prey to an outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish, which feed solely on live coral.\n\nThe Rio Grande went dry in Albuquerque for first time in 40 years.

During bleaching, the coral animal loses its algae and pigments, causing it to turn white and potentially die.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, heat waves triggered coral bleaching events so severe that scientists worried the reef would never look the same again.\n\nThe peak of the most recent bleaching event took place in March, Emslie said.\n\nGreat Barrier Reef trouble? UN says Great Barrier Reef is 'in danger,' but Australia disagrees\n\nLast year, UNESCO, the United Nations’ educational, scientific and cultural agency, said the reef may have to be added to a list of world heritage sites that are “in danger.”\n\nIn a draft report in June 2021, the committee said “there is no possible doubt” that the network of colorful corals was “facing ascertained danger.”\n\nA summer meeting to discuss the reef's health was canceled after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPotential coal mine could bring 'unacceptable impacts'\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday, Australia’s government announced plans to prevent development of a coal mine because of its possible effect on the reef.\n\nEnvironment Minister Tanya Plibersek said she plans to deny approval for the Central Queensland Coal Project to be excavated northwest of the Queensland state town of Rockhampton.\n\nThe minority Greens party has been pressing the government to refuse approvals of coal or gas projects to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“Based on the information available to me at this stage, I believe that the project would be likely to have unacceptable impacts to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and the values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and National Heritage Place,” Plibersek said in a statement.\n\nThe marine park manages the network of more than 2,500 reefs that cover 134,000 square miles of seabed.

The measure will next need to be passed by the Senate before it can go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. According to the measure, billions of dollars will be used to send military equipment and weapons from US stocks to Ukraine and to purchase weapons from contractors, among several other allocations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the “friends” of his country for approving the bill. This comes as Belarus, an ally of Russia, said it will deploy special forces to the border of Ukraine because “the United States and its allies continue to increase their military presence at the state borders,” a military official said.\n\n2.

The first few rounds of 2022 primaries have doubled as a proving ground for Trump’s ability to bend the Republican Party to his will. That theme will continue into next week’s slate, especially in Pennsylvania, where his endorsed Senate candidate is heading into a three-way race for the GOP nomination.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback King: This is why we have to cover Donald Trump 01:42 - Source: CNN King: This is why we have to cover Donald Trump 01:42\n\n3.

It was around the time temperatures soared to minus-12 degrees Celsius, more than 40 degrees warmer than normal, at the Concordia research station.\n\n“I don’t think there has been a shelf collapse like this in East Antarctica since we’ve been able to receive satellite data,” Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN. “Conger is a very small ice shelf which has been decreasing in size for many years and this was just the final step which caused it to collapse.”\n\nAntarctica is the coldest, iciest place on Earth, which makes the recent warming event particularly worrying for many scientists. Just a month ago, data showed Antarctica would set a record this year for lowest sea-ice extent — the area of ocean covered by sea ice around the continent.\n\nIce shelves like the Conger are extensions of land-based ice sheets and glaciers that jut out over the ocean. They help prevent those ice sheets from feeding ice unabated into the ocean.\n\nWhen a shelf collapses, there tends to be an increase in the ice that flows from the land into the ocean, which leads to sea level rise— a phenomenon that threatens coastal communities around the world.\n\nTed Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder and lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said the ice shelf’s collapse was likely a culmination of the record low sea ice conditions and the wave action hitting the shelf during the recent warm period, which was spurred by a strong winds from the warmer north.\n\nScambos said it could be a preview of what’s to come as the climate crisis eats away at the continent.\n\n“Antarctica as a whole has kind of been locked away in an icebox,” he told CNN. “It’s been used to being surrounded by this fringe of sea ice; it’s been used to temperatures that are below freezing; and so those are big steps in terms of the kind of energy or the kind of processes that can happen to take away the ice from the edge of the continent.”\n\n“And that’s what happened at Conger — and it’s an example of how Antarctica responds to these record events.”\n\nScambos said that for a long time the ice shelf had been wedged against an island, with the same effect as putting too much pressure on a piece of wood that later begins to splinter. Scambos said large rips had formed over time because of this pressure.\n\nScambos said the Conger’s collapse is another instance in which scientists get to observe what happens when an ice shelf is lost and a glacier is threatened.\n\n“It’s not a very large shelf,” Scambos said. “But every time we’ve seen a shelf that is braced against an offshore island or even the coast of a bay, the glaciers behind it sense that there’s a back pressure, that there’s a force that’s resisting outward flow. In other words, they thin rapidly and they flow faster when the shelf is removed.”\n\nLarter said that warming temperatures are making the collapse of ice shelves more likely. There has been a series of ice shelf collapses over the past 40 years, but those have mainly been in West Antarctica, which is warmer compared to the east.\n\nLast year, for example, researchers discovered that the ice shelf holding back the Thwaites Glacier — also known as the “Doomsday glacier” — could collapse within the next five years. From their camp in the middle of the Antarctic to their stations on the coast, Scambos and a team of researchers flew over the gargantuan Thwaites Glacier, the size of Idaho, for two hours.\n\nScambos told CNN they could see “massive cracks in this ice shelf, places where the ice is tearing apart,” a clear sign of the Earth’s changing climate.\n\nLarter said this happens less frequently in the East Antarctic because the ocean water there is much colder.\n\n“The trend in East Antarctica is that the ice sheet loses some ice around the edges and it gains some in the middle,” Larter said. “Overall, it isn’t out of balance, but some on the outskirts are at a loss.”\n\nA glacier that has been attracting scientists’ attention is the Totten Glacier, which could cause sea levels to rise by around 10 feet if its ice shelf collapsed.\n\nScambos said the recent record events in Antarctica are further proof of the speed at which the climate crisis is accelerating.\n\n“It’s something that’s very hard to stop once it gets going,” he warned. “If we don’t put the brakes on, if we don’t slow this process down, then we’re in for very rapid rates of sea level rise probably before the end of the century.”\n\nScambos noted that children alive right now would be the ones that face these repercussions.\n\n“And although I won’t be around to see it, there are people here with us today — they’re a little shorter than most of us — but they’re going to be there for that,” Scambos added. “And that means that we owe it to them to try to take care of this as soon as possible.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez Hafsa Khalil", "Rachel Ramirez", "Hafsa Khalil"], "publish_date": "2022/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/23/sea-dragons-human-compost-lego-dinosaurs-news-around-states/39507035/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nCullman: Country music star Hank Williams Jr. is offering a $6,000 reward for his grandfather’s missing shotgun.

The letter says he can’t locate the man’s old Remington Model 11-48 shotgun, which he wants to pass on. An attorney for Williams, Steve Smith, says the gun is believed to be lost, not stolen. The reward is being offered with no questions asked. Smith says the 16-gauge shotgun was likely last seen at a lake cabin or house near Cullman. He says the reward offer has generated a few tips. Williams sang about the man who owned the shotgun in his 1973 song “Grandpa Shepherd.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s fledgling commercial seaweed industry is growing, with producers excited about this year’s harvest. The Anchorage Daily News reports there were no commercial seaweed farmers in Alaska five years ago. An official with the Commercial Fisheries Division of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game says 16 aquatic farming operations now are permitted to culture species of seaweed. According to the World Aquaculture Society, seaweed worldwide is a $6 billion business. Most is harvested in Korea, Japan and China; dried; and used for seasoning. Blue Evolution, a California-based company, has worked with researchers at the University of Alaska Southeast on ways to commercially farm kelp rather than harvest wild kelp beds. The company sells seed stock to some Alaska kelp farmers and buys back mature kelp.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has banned prisoners from reading a book that discusses the impact of the criminal justice system on black men. The American Civil Liberties Union is calling on the Arizona Department of Corrections to rescind a ban on “Chokehold: Policing Black Men.” The book by former federal prosecutor Paul Butler examines the treatment of African American men by law enforcement and in mass incarceration. Butler says his publisher was notified of the ban in March. But it didn’t specify what led to the decision. The Georgetown University criminal law professor says he explicitly disavows violence in the book. Corrections spokesman Andrew Wilder said the department hadn’t yet received the ACLU’s letter asking for the ban to be reversed. ACLU attorney Emerson Sykes says it’s not uncommon for states to ban certain books.\n\nArkansas\n\nBella Vista: A property owner’s association is warning residents about the unhealthy air near an underground fire that’s been burning for 10 months at a former unlicensed dump in northwest Arkansas. Crews began fighting the fire Saturday at the Trafalgar Road site in Bella Vista, about 170 miles northwest of Little Rock. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that Bella Vista Property Owners Association’s chief operating officer Tom Judson says the goal is to quench the fire within 30 days. The fire that’s burning at least 70 feet underground was first reported in July. Some residents say smoke from the fire has caused respiratory and other health problems. The Legislature passed a bill in March appropriating $20 million to help clean up the fire.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLa Jolla: A Southern California aquarium has built what is believed to be one of the world’s largest habitats for sea dragons, the lesser-known cousin of the seahorse. The Birch Aquarium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego hopes the exhibit will lead to the leafy sea dragon being bred for the first time in captivity. The sea dragons’ native populations off Australia are threatened by pollution, warming oceans, and the illegal pet and alternative medicine trades. Few aquariums have sea dragons. There are only two types of sea dragons, the leafy and the weedy, and each represents its own genus. Both kinds are found only in a small area of temperate waters off the southern and western coasts of Australia. The California exhibit opened this month.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The City Council narrowly voted Tuesday against asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review its ban on women going topless in public, which lower courts have banned it from enforcing. The 4-3 vote still gives the city the option to seek the high court’s intervention if settlement agreements with Free the Nipple-Fort Collins break down. But the council majority hoped to drop the matter. “There’s some fatigue,” council member Kristin Stephens said. “We pursued this legal recourse, and it didn’t work out for us.” The city has been grappling with its ban on women knowingly exposing their breasts in public since 2015, when activist Brit Hoagland started protesting it. It led the council to update the public indecency ordinance, though it left in place the ban on women going topless in public, with certain exemptions. Hoagland and fellow activist Samantha Six sued the city in 2016.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Restaurants and caterers in the state would no longer be able to provide customers with single-use expanded polystyrene food containers under legislation that has cleared the House of Representatives. The proposed ban, which passed Tuesday on a 121-23 vote, would take effect July 1, 2021. It now awaits Senate action. Proponents say the legislation is needed to discourage the use of the containers and reduce litter, noting expanded polystyrene containers can take 200 years to break down in a landfill. Some noted that many restaurants, such as Dunkin’ Donuts, have already begun to swap out these products with greener options. The bill was narrowed to caterers and restaurants in permanent buildings following some concern it was too broad. There are exceptions for pre-packaged food, raw meat and seafood. Violators would face fines.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state has two of the best cities in the country for summer job opportunities, according to a new study from WalletHub. Dover ranked fourth and Wilmington ranked fifth on the list, which focused on 16- to 24-year-olds searching for part-time work or internship opportunities between school years. To create the ranking, WalletHub developed 21 criteria – ranging from availability of summer jobs and internships to its own lifestyle metrics – and divided them into two main categories, youth job market and social environment and affordability. Each criterion was given its own subjective weight and score on a scale of 0-100. The cumulative score after each criterion was weighted, determined the ranking. Dover and Wilmington rank near the top in both availability of internships and growth in summer employment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Board of Elections has approved a petition to recall a city councilman who used his position to solicit business from area lobbyists. The Washington Post reports the board unanimously voted Monday to approve the recall effort of Ward 2 Councilman Jack Evans. Volunteers now have roughly three months to collect about 5,200 Ward 2 signatures to unseat Evans, who is under federal investigation over his relationships with private legal and consulting clients. Email records show he pitched himself to lobbyists, arguing they should employ him because of his influence as the city’s longest-serving lawmaker and area transit board chair. The council formally reprimanded Evans in March and voted to remove him from several oversight positions. The transit agency has launched an internal investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nWesley Chapel: Authorities say a teen has been charged with threatening a school shooting in a postcard to Santa and signing a classmate’s name last fall. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the 15-year-old boy was arrested Monday and charged with making written threats to kill or do bodily harm. The Pasco County Sheriff’s Office says the holiday postcard was dropped off in November at a Wesley Chapel Macy’s. The note threatened at shooting at nearby Wiregrass Ranch High School. Detectives interviewed a female student whose name was signed to the postcard but ruled her out as a suspect. Authorities say fingerprints on the postcard led to the teen boy, who had a previous misdemeanor arrest.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A lawsuit challenging outdated voting machines and seeking statewide use of hand-marked paper ballots can move forward, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. The lawsuit argues that the paperless touchscreen voting machines Georgia has used since 2002 are unsecure, vulnerable to hacking and unable to be audited. The state’s voting system drew national scrutiny during last year’s midterm election in which Brian Kemp, a Republican who was the state’s chief election officer at the time, narrowly defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams to become Georgia’s governor. State lawyers had asked U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg to dismiss the lawsuit. Totenberg wrote in her order rejecting that request that the state’s arguments “completely ignore the reality faced by election officials across the country underscored by Plaintiffs’ allegations that electronic voting systems are under unceasing attack.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Honolulu County has closed a bay to prevent disruption of coral spawning that scientists predicted would occur over two days. West Hawaii Today reported Tuesday that county officials closed Kahaluu Bay to allow the spawning event that was expected Monday through Tuesday on the Big Island. Officials from the Kahaluu Bay Education Center’s ReefTeach program set up a tent at the bay entrance to inform visitors of the temporary closure. An official says the spawning is “critical” for the coral to reproduce and survive. A mass bleaching event in 2015 killed 95% of the cauliflower coral on West Hawaii reefs. Kahaluu Bay is the only park Honolulu County has closed to facilitate a spawning event. The area was also off limits for two half-days in 2018.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal administrative law judge has rejected a plan for public land grazing allotments in south-central Idaho that would have destroyed re-emerging sagebrush in favor of non-native plants to increase forage for cattle and sheep. The ruling last week directs the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set aside its final grazing decisions for about 80 square miles of allotments in Twin Falls County. The administrative law judge in the Interior Department’s Office of Hearings and Appeals concluded that destroying sagebrush and rabbitbrush to increase livestock forage on public lands couldn’t be justified. Wildlands Defense and Prairie Falcon Audubon in 2017 appealed the Bureau of Land Management’s decision involving 18 permittees on 21 allotments that would have destroyed native plants.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Lincoln Park Zoo says an eastern black rhinoceros named Kapuki has given birth to a calf. The zoo says Kapuki was pregnant for 15 months before the calf was born Sunday night. Zoo staff members monitored her labor and are watching the rhino and her calf remotely using cameras to give them privacy but are nearby. The zoo hasn’t named the calf or announced its sex, but officials say details will be announced once available. The animals won’t be visible to the public until further notice, but people can follow along on the zoo’s Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and at #RhinoWatch on Twitter. Zoo officials say the calf stood up at just 53 minutes of age.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A restored World War II naval vessel will move to a more prominent location along the Ohio River in the city in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The LST 325 troop landing ship will be docked at the former site of the Tropicana Evansville casino boat June 6-9. Free tours of the ship will be offered. The ship took part in the 1944 D-Day landings in France and was brought back to the U.S. from Greece in 2001 to be restored. City officials had hoped to have the ship permanently moved there by the D-Day anniversary, but a number of delays have postponed that from happening until the end of the year. The ship has been docked a few miles upriver since 2005.\n\nIowa\n\nYale: It was built in 1932 as the state’s first roundhouse of rebounds. Today, it’s one of Iowa’s most treasured historic buildings. The Yale High School Gymnasium, with its distinctive round architectural design, is now listed on the the National Register of Historic Places. In its heyday, it was home to the Yale Bulldogs boys and girls basketball teams and hosted band concerts, commencements, plays and banquets – even the Harlem Globetrotters – until 1961. The gymnasium’s historic significance is tied to its use for team sports (1932-1961) and its association with Halver R. Straight, who received a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois in 1907 and spent his career in the ceramics industry. An inventor as well as an engineer, he held 87 patents for tools and instruments used in clay manufacturing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has signed into law a bill that would allow profoundly ill people who have been unable to find relief with pharmaceutical medications to avoid prosecution for possessing certain blends of oil extracted from cannabis plants. The cannabidiol oils, also known as CBD, shielded by the Kansas bill could contain no more than 5% THC, the compound that gives marijuana its high. Known as “Claire and Lola’s Law,” it was pushed by Gwen and Scott Hartley, whose 12-year-old daughter, Lola, suffers from microcephaly, a medical condition in which a child’s brain doesn’t fully develop. The condition has already claimed the life of Lola’s older sister, Claire, who died in December 2018 at the age of 17. The law goes into effect July 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: With temperatures climbing and a holiday weekend coming up, many swimming pools and beaches at state parks are opening. The Parks Department says while lodge pools are reserved for lodge and cottage guests, community pools at several parks are open to the public for a fee – Greenbo Lake, Carter Caves, Levi Jackson, Blue Licks Battlefield, Cumberland Falls, E.P. “Tom” Sawyer, Kincaid Lake, Natural Bridge and Fort Boonesborough. Also, the park system’s 10 beaches are free and open to the public – Pennyrile Forest, Lake Barkley, Kentucky Dam Village, Barren River Lake, Buckhorn Lake, Rough River Dam, Lake Malone, Nolin Lake, Carr Creek and Green River Lake. Pool openings at Barren River Lake, E.P. “Tom” Sawyer, Levi Jackson and Lake Barkley will be delayed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is on track to create a new program that would certify veteran-owned businesses and create a database for consumers to search for them. The House-backed bill easily sped through the Senate commerce committee Wednesday, with Gov. John Bel Edwards, a former Army Ranger, testifying in support of the legislation. The governor says census data indicates Louisiana has 42,000 veteran-owned businesses. The proposal creates the Veterans First Business Initiative in the state’s economic development agency. The department will certify veteran-owned businesses, create an insignia for them to use and display a searchable database on its website for customers who want to find veteran vendors. The measure by Baton Rouge Republican Rep. Franklin Foil moves to the full Senate for debate, one step from final passage.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A legislative committee has voted against a bill to tax water bottler Poland Spring. The Portland Press Herald reports the House and Senate will now consider the legislation. The Legislature’s Taxation Committee voted Tuesday to reject a Democrat’s bill that would have charged Poland Spring 12 cents for every gallon of water extracted for bottling. The legislation is part of years-old unsuccessful efforts to tax the hundreds of millions of gallons that Poland Spring bottles in Maine. The bill targets Poland Spring, which would have paid roughly $115 million under the proposal based on the 960 million gallons extracted last year. Revenues from the tax would fund college tuition grants and Maine’s broadband internet network. Opponents include several Democrats and Republicans who say Poland Spring employs over 800 people in Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Scientists say the health of America’s largest estuary declined last year due to the effects of record-breaking precipitation. Researchers at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science gave the Chesapeake Bay an overall grade of 46% for 2018, down from 54% in 2017. All of the indicators factored into the bay’s health index declined or stayed flat last year. Its letter grade of “C” is unchanged. Last year’s heavy downpours increased runoff sediments, and more pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorous washed into the water. The Baltimore area was deluged with 72 inches of rain, roughly 175% above normal rates. Still, the annual report card released Tuesday stresses that overall trends show the Chesapeake improving significantly over years. Scientists say the bay’s long-term health trajectory remains positive.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A local nonprofit is voicing concern about the continued spread of HIV among residents struggling with opioid addiction. The Whittier Street Health Center said Tuesday that its outreach team identified two new cases of HIV in the notorious illegal drug market around Boston Medical Center in the city’s South End. Dr. Cyril Ubiem, director of infectious disease at the center, says he’s concerned the spread of HIV among Boston’s homeless and addicted population is getting worse, rather than better. The state Department of Public Health says it’s reviewing the center’s reported cases. In January, the agency urged Boston health providers to boost efforts to test patients for HIV after six people were newly diagnosed with the virus, which can lead to AIDS. Massachusetts reported 105 new HIV cases in 2017, up from 30 in 2014.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A new exhibit at the Detroit Historical Museum takes visitors through 150 years of life in the city’s Corktown neighborhood. Called “The Journey to Now,” the exhibit opened this month and is scheduled to run through July 7. The exhibit is hosted by the nonprofit organization Corktown Experience in conjunction with Wayne State University’s Anthropology Museum. It tells the story of the people who lived in the Workers’ Row House in Corktown and of the workers who helped build Detroit into an industrial and automotive powerhouse. This exhibit kicks off an effort by Corktown Experience to turn the Workers’ Row House and the surrounding property into a community hub and cultural center.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A major package of protections for the state’s elderly has cleared the Legislature and awaits Gov. Tim Walz’s signature. The House and Senate passed the final version of the bill late Sunday night. The most important component is a framework for licensing assisted living facilities that contains expanded enforcement powers. Minnesota is the last remaining state that doesn’t require licensing them. The bill also has other safeguards to protect older and vulnerable adults, including the right for assisted-living residents and their families to install hidden monitoring cameras for two weeks before being required to notify the facilities, a provision dubbed “granny cams.” It also includes a bill of rights for assisted-living residents and other stronger consumer protections, such as protections against retaliation for residents of care facilities.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: About 1 in 4 third graders in the state failed a toughened reading test on the first try this spring, leaving it unclear if they will advance to fourth grade. The Mississippi Department of Education released results Wednesday. Mississippi is one of 16 states that demand third grade students pass a reading score threshold or flunk. Mississippi raised its threshold this year, mandating students reach the middle of five scoring levels. Students had a second chance last week, although those results aren’t yet available. Students get a third chance later this summer. Officials predicted passing rates would drop from last year’s 93.8%, when students had to reach the second level. The Chickasaw County school district has the top share of passing third graders at 94%. Yazoo City was lowest at 32%.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Washington University will host a summit next year aimed at addressing growing concerns about climate change. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was in St. Louis last week to announce creation of the Midwest Collegiate Climate Summit. It will include representatives from universities, local governments, businesses and nonprofits. The summit will focus on several issues, including promoting solar energy and reducing harmful emissions. Bloomberg’s charitable organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, donated $2.5 million to St. Louis in October to help fund a carbon pollution-tracking program. The city has set a goal of generating 100% of its electricity from wind, solar and other renewable resources by 2035.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Montana Attorney General Tim Fox has announced his timeline for implementing legislation meant to improve communication and collaboration among the law enforcement agencies as they investigate missing persons cases. Fox said Tuesday that the state Department of Justice has posted the job description for a missing persons specialist. That person will coordinate with local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement agencies to improve reporting and searching for missing people. He hopes to have that person on board by July 1. Fox has also asked the state’s eight tribes for nominations for a new Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force, which is set to meet June 11. The group will be tasked with identifying and overcoming communication barriers to reporting and investigating cases of missing Native Americans.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials say they’re expanding a pilot program that stationed a mental health therapist in a city police precinct. The Omaha World-Herald reports that officials plan to place a therapist in each precinct within the next few years. The primary goal is to decrease the instances of officers taking into custody people struggling with mental health issues. Officials also hope to connect people to the services they require and reduce the number of times officers must respond to people and their mental health crises. The therapists, also known as co-responders, will head to incidents that may involve people suffering from mental illnesses. Once officers deem the situations safe, the co-responders can talk to the people and determine what help they need.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Nevada is now on the cusp of joining the nationwide push to elect the president purely by popular vote. The state Senate on Tuesday passed Assembly Bill 186, which would see the Silver State join a compact with 15 others that have agreed to award their presidential votes to the winner of the national popular vote. The divisive bill now heads to Gov. Steve Sisolak, who did not immediately return requests for comment on the measure. If adopted by enough states, the national popular vote compact would effectively neuter the electoral college, a constitutional creation that awards states one presidential vote for each of its congressional delegates. The roughly 200-year-old system has the effect of giving smaller states greater power to pick the president.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Edward Hopper’s final painting is on view at the Currier Museum of Art. “Two Comedians,” showing the artist and his wife taking a bow onstage, once belonged to singer Frank Sinatra. Hopper painted the work in 1966 at age 83, when he and his wife were seriously ill. He died the following year. Museum curator Kurt Sundstrom said it is a somber reflection of two people alone on a dark stage. “They have a presence, but it’s a presence of people who will soon disappear,” he said. “Two Comedians” will be on display at the Currier Museum until January 2020. It is accompanied by other works by Hopper and his contemporaries, on the theme of theater and life in the American city.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPoint Pleasant Beach: A mild winter and previously completed replenishment projects have left the state’s beloved beaches in great shape for the start of the summer tourism season. Coastal experts say most beaches are nice and wide as a result of years of replenishment by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that kicked into high gear after Superstorm Sandy devastated the coast in 2012. Places like Point Pleasant Beach and Ortley Beach have wider beaches than they’ve had in years. The replenishment projects pump sand ashore to widen beaches to provide space for recreation and help protect property. Jon Miller, a coastal expert with Stevens Institute of Technology, says even in spots where beaches have eroded somewhat, the sand that forms sand bars offshore helps blunt the force of incoming waves.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Military Museum has temporarily closed its indoor space to prepare for new exhibits commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War and women serving in World War I. The museum plans to reopen in July. Until then, the outdoor World War I exhibit, the vehicle and equipment park, and meditation gardens will remain open to the public. Officials say the closure also will allow for renovations. The New Mexico National Guard and the museum recently procured a traveling replica of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. It will be part of the new exhibit along with hundreds of photos from veterans’ private collections. The materials for the exhibit honoring women who served during World War I come from the American Medical Women’s Association.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation is launching its annual birdwatching challenge, with versions for beginners and experts alike. The “I Bird NY” beginner’s challenge is open to anyone 16 years old or younger. Participants must identify 10 common bird species listed on the challenge form available online. In the experienced birder challenge, participants must identify at least 10 of 50 species and enter sighting information on the challenge form. All will get a certificate, a bracelet and a chance to win birding accessories. The challenge is open through Sept. 16. Details are posted on DEC’s website.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A repeat effort to regulate popular fantasy sports games in North Carolina has advanced through a House panel two years after a similar effort failed. The House Commerce Committee voted Wednesday for the measure, which would require companies that operate fantasy sports to register with the state and abide by some rules. A 2017 bill failed to get enough support after social conservatives complained it would further legitimize gambling in the state. This year’s measure also contains the creation of a new state Gaming Commission that would consolidate oversight of the lottery, bingo and boxing in addition to the fantasy games. The fantasy sports industry has been seeking the state’s regulation, saying it would improve consumer protections. The bill must clear three more committees before reaching the House floor.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Police Department has launched a new program that aims to better connect officers with the community. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the department announced the Bismarck Community Oriented Policing Program on Monday. The program will divide the city into six community policing districts where officers will improve services and organize local meetings and events. It’ll also revive the Neighborhood Crime Watch and Business Watch programs to help neighbors look out for one another and bring attention to suspicious activity. Officers will conduct outreach through neighborhood canvassing, presentations, and home and business security surveys. Sgt. John Brocker says the program “is about reconnecting with the public” and “finding out what you have to say.” He says he felt there was a need for the department to be more transparent.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A strike in its third week at a hospital is putting a spotlight on concerns about forcing nurses to repeatedly work mandatory overtime. The strike also comes at a time when state lawmakers are debating legislation that would allow nurses to refuse mandatory overtime. About 2,200 workers, including nurses, paramedics and custodians, have been on strike since May 6 at Mercy Health St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo. Many nurses there say staffing shortages are forcing them to routinely work extra hours and be on-call day after day. Hospital officials have said the way they handle staffing is reasonable and common within the health care industry. They also say it ensures proper patient care. Nurses say forcing them to work long hours isn’t safe for them or their patients.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Legislature has approved a budget that for the first time includes millions of dollars in funding for anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. The Senate on Tuesday approved the $8.1 billion general appropriations bill for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The budget proposal now heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt, who is expected to sign it. The Oklahoman reports the $2 million for crisis pregnancy centers would be the state’s first anti-abortion funding since lawmakers passed the 2017 Choosing Childbirth Act. Proponent Rep. Jon Echols says the centers help pregnant women purchase maternity clothes, prenatal care and more. Critics say the money being apportioned to dissuade women from abortions could be used for other health care initiatives.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Environmental advocates have criticized a state plan to kill more than 1,000 ravens to help save the greater sage grouse. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Tuesday that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife applied for permits in 2018 to kill up to 500 ravens per year over a three-year period to reduce the number preying upon greater sage grouse eggs. Environmentalists say the strategy of putting poisoned chicken eggs in bait boxes in northeastern Oregon is flawed. A director at the Portland Audubon Society says the plan is part of an “unfortunate pattern” of agencies scapegoating a species without addressing primary causes of decline. The plan is opposed by numerous environmental groups including Oregon Wild, The Humane Society and the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJim Thorpe: Officials say one of the state’s most beloved and scenic hiking trails will remain closed to the public unless lawmakers pass Gov. Tom Wolf’s $4.5 billion infrastructure plan. The Democratic governor hiked to the base of the Glen Onoko Falls Trail on Tuesday to make the case for his plan to impose a severance tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas production to finance billions of dollars in projects. Wolf has called for a severance tax every year he’s been in office, but the GOP-controlled Legislature has so far rejected the idea. The Pennsylvania Game Commission closed the trail May 1, saying it had become too dangerous. The closure outraged hikers and nature lovers. State officials say they aren’t able to reopen it without an infusion of cash.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An effort is underway to replace the state’s distinctive “wave” license plates and more than double the cost of the new ones. The state Senate on Tuesday approved a measure by a 27-8 margin to start replacing them later this year. The bill would change the price of a license plate from $6, set 20 years ago, to $15. Sen. Louis DiPalma, one of the bill’s supporters, says some plates still on the road are so old and worn that they are difficult to read. The Middletown Democrat also estimates about 25,000 vehicles are using invalid plates, probably because they are unregistered, uninsured or uninspected. Some senators opposed the price hike, saying many people could not afford it, especially if they have multiple vehicles. There is no new design yet.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Legislators are giving the Carolina Panthers up to $120 million in tax breaks to move their practice fields and team headquarters into the state from North Carolina. The Senate voted 23-16 on Monday to approve a compromise smoothing over small differences in the bill. A few hours later, the House passed the bill 88-18. Gov. Henry McMaster was expected to quickly sign it into law. The bill exempts the Panthers from paying state income taxes for players, coaches and other employees for 15 years as long as they use the money to build their new complex near Rock Hill. Opponents say the state shouldn’t help a billionaire NFL owner. The team would continue to play games in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The family of an angler whose catfish held a state record for nearly 70 years is upset that state wildlife officials voided the record. Roy Groves caught the 55-pound fish in 1949. The fish originally was identified as a channel catfish, but South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks voided the record Friday, saying Groves actually caught a blue catfish, not a channel catfish. Groves’ great-grandson, James Labesky, says he had never heard about the record being disputed. Labesky says in a Facebook post that South Dakota wildlife officials are taking away the record because they don’t think it’s a channel catfish by looking at a picture. He says in the post that his great-grandfather “would know the difference.” State Fisheries Program Administrator Geno Adams says fish identification experts agreed the photo was of a blue catfish.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Researchers at the Memphis Zoo have been studying the smooth-sided toad’s reproduction abilities and have found techniques that could aid in the breeding and conservation of endangered toads around the world. Research conducted by the zoo’s conservation department showed that the quality of toad sperm could be increased with hormones, that the sperm could be successfully harvested, and that it could be frozen and thawed and remain viable. The study, recently published in the journal Cryobiology, has real-world applications that will be put into action this fall when the research team travels to Colombia and Ecuador to help amphibian researchers there in their work to preserve the rare and “very charismatic” Colombian giant toad, says Steve Reichling, zoo director of conservation and research.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport plans to build a sixth terminal that would open by 2025 and provide up to 24 new gates for U.S. and international flights. DFW airport CEO Sean Donohue announced plans for Terminal F on Monday. The airport currently has 164 gates spread across five terminals. DFW has been growing, inching closer to busier airports such as Atlanta. Donohue says DFW has more than doubled its passenger-carrying capacity to international destinations since 2010. DFW is American Airlines’ largest hub airport. The airline announced early this month that it opened 15 new gates at DFW. American said the gates that opened May 3 in Terminal E will let it add more than 100 daily flights on its American Eagle affiliate.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah Jazz owner and philanthropist Gail Miller says she never expected to be in the company of celebrities such as singer Mariah Carey and actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. But Miller will join their ranks in June when she receives the same congressional award honoring her work with young people. She says being named for the Horizon Award was an incredible recognition of her giving nature and strong community relationships. The award recognizes humanitarian leaders in the private sector, from the Congressional Award National Board of Directors. Miller has owned the family’s car dealerships, movie theaters and the National Basketball Association’s Utah Jazz franchise since the 2009 death of her husband Larry H. Miller. Forbes magazine estimates her net worth to be $1.5 billion.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Episcopal church has for the first time chosen an African American woman as its bishop. The Rev. Shannon MacVean-Brown was elected Saturday by representatives of Vermont’s 45 Episcopal congregations. MacVean-Brown will become the first black woman to hold the post in Vermont. She replaces Bishop Thomas Ely, who will be retiring after 18 years as Vermont’s Episcopal bishop. MacVean-Brown currently serves as the interim rector of St. Thomas Episcopal Church, of Franklin, Indiana. She is planning to move to Vermont with her family in August. Current plans call for her ordination as Vermont bishop on Sept. 28.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A Virginia man who founded the defunct airline People Express has been indicted on fraud and tax evasion charges. The Daily Press reports Michael D. Morisi was arrested Tuesday. He’s accused of defrauding creditors of nearly $448,000, using most of the money to pay himself and other airline executives months after the airline folded. An indictment says the former executive director of Newport News-Williamsburg International Airport, Ken Spirito, arranged for public funds to guarantee that airline a $5 million credit line in July 2014. The airline folded that September and stopped paying the $4.5 million it owed TowneBank under the credit line. The airport was left to foot the bill, which it then paid with those public funds. Spirito was arrested Monday and charged with violating federal finance laws.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee signed legislation Tuesday making the state the first to approve composting as an alternative to burying or cremating human remains. It allows licensed facilities to offer “natural organic reduction,” which turns a body, mixed with substances such as wood chips and straw, into about two wheelbarrows’ worth of soil in a span of several weeks. Loved ones are allowed to keep the soil to spread, just as they might spread the ashes of someone who has been cremated – or even use it to plant vegetables or a tree. Supporters say the method is an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation, which releases carbon dioxide and particulates into the air, and conventional burial, in which people are drained of their blood, pumped full of formaldehyde and other chemicals that can pollute groundwater, and placed in a nearly indestructible coffin, taking up land.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A bridge will now bear the name of longtime state lawmaker Frank Deem, who died in October at the age of 90. According to The Parkersburg News and Sentinel, about 100 people gathered Friday to see the dedication of the Juliana Street Bridge as the Senator J. Frank Deem Memorial Bridge. Deem served in the Navy before his election to the House in 1954. The retired businessman and oil and gas developer served on and off in the House and Senate over six decades, spending a total of 48 years as a lawmaker.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Lego dinosaurs are headed to the local zoo. This summer, the United Kingdom-based Brick Dinos exhibit is traveling to the United States for the first time and heading straight to the Milwaukee County Zoo. Guy Bagley, senior creative for Warren Elsmore Exhibitions, has made a career out of “playing with Legos” for the past 23 years. He traveled from Scotland to set up the exhibit in the special exhibits building at the zoo. That included shipping four life-size sculptures as well as 26 smaller scenes, then repairing any damage incurred during their voyage across the pond. While the exhibit is fun, it’s also educational. Bagley says his boss, Warren Elsmore, worked with a paleontologist to ensure the accuracy of everything from the color of the dinosaurs to the plants in their habitats.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state recorded the lowest number of births in 15 years in 2018. Wyoming’s population has been falling since the state’s energy industry went bust in 2015. That year, about 7,700 babies were born in Wyoming. The Wyoming Department of Health says last year’s tally was 6,551. Meanwhile, deaths of Wyoming residents are increasing as the state’s population ages. The Casper Star-Tribune reports Emma was the most popular name for baby girls in Wyoming last year, followed by Amelia, Elizabeth, Evelyn and Harper. Oliver topped the list for boys, followed by Jackson and Logan (which were tied), Wyatt and Theodore.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/23"}]}

It’s a very serious situation,” Fields said. “So we’ve come to an agreement to best protect our citizens and to protect the businesses of our county, we’re going to implement a curfew tonight.”\n\nA state of emergency went into effect at 4 p.m. Sunday as law enforcement, city and energy officials are investigating the incident and working to restore the two substations, authorities said. Law enforcement has also been providing security for the stations, according to the sheriff.\n\nThe power outage is being investigated as a “criminal occurrence” after crews found signs of potential vandalism at several locations, CNN previously reported.\n\nFields said multiple rounds were fired at the two substations. “It was targeted, it wasn’t random,” he said.\n\nNo suspects have been identified in connection with the incident. Fields would not say if the criminal activity was domestic terrorism.\n\n“The person, or persons, who did this knew exactly what they were doing,” Fields said. “We don’t have a clue why Moore County.”\n\nFields acknowledged a woman who posted on Facebook Sunday morning indicating she had been questioned by law enforcement in connection with the incident. Fields did not name the woman, but said she posted false information on social media claiming to have information behind the incident.\n\n“We don’t have anything,” Fields said, when asked about a possible motive. “No motivation, no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who [did] it.”\n\nA gate at one of the locations also appears to have been taken off its hinges, Mike Cameron of the Southern Pines Fire and Rescue Department told CNN on Sunday afternoon.\n\nCameron said the area is experiencing increased emergency calls due to the lack of power, adding that auto accidents have occurred because traffic lights are out. People who rely on oxygen have placed emergency calls, he said.\n\nMore than 37,000 customers were without power across the county Sunday evening, according to the Duke Energy outage map. According to poweroutage.us, about 38,000 customers had lost power in Moore County and neighboring Hoke County.\n\nMoore County Manager Wayne Vest said a shelter, running on a generator, opened Sunday afternoon at the Moore County Sports Complex in conjunction with the Red Cross.

This will be a multiday restoration for most customers, extending possibly to Thursday.”\n\nA local supermarket is distributing ice to impacted residents, according to a news release from grocery chain Harris Teeter.\n\nThe power outage has also led officials to cancel Monday classes for all schools in the county. “An announcement will be made tomorrow evening to inform parents and staff of the status of schools for Tuesday,” Moore County Schools said in a tweet Sunday afternoon.\n\nFBI has joined the investigation, congressman says\n\nMapbox\n\nSeveral communities across the county began experiencing power outages just after 7 p.m. Saturday, the Moore County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post.\n\n“As utility companies began responding to the different substations, evidence was discovered that indicated that intentional vandalism had occurred at multiple sites,” the office said.\n\nAt least two substations were vandalized “with criminal intent,” US Rep. Richard Hudson said Sunday morning in a release.\n\nThe North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the FBI are responding, according to Hudson. He said the motive remains unknown.\n\nHudson, whose congressional district includes Moore County, said the Southern Pines Police Department has opened a community center for residents to charge devices.\n\nCNN has reached out to Southern Pines police and the FBI.\n\nDuring the Sunday news conference, Fields addressed rumors circulating on social media that the attack was an attempt to thwart a local drag show.\n\nFields said law enforcement is working every angle, but “have not been able to tie anything back to the drag show,” which was scheduled for Saturday night in the nearby town of Southern Pines.\n\nOn its website, the Sunrise Theater advertised the “Downtown Divas!” drag show starting at 7 p.m. The power was cut shortly after that time, Fields said.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Sunrise Theater as well as the Southern Pines Police Department. CNN has also reached out to Sandhills Pride, the organization behind Saturday’s drag event.\n\n“This was a terrible act,” North Carolina State Senator Tom McInnis said during the news conference. “And it appears to be an intentional, willful and malicious act, and the perpetrator will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nCrews were experiencing “multiple equipment failures” that are affecting substations in Moore County, Duke Energy spokesperson Brooks told CNN affiliate WRAL.\n\n“We are also investigating signs of potential vandalism related to the outages,” Brooks said.\n\nDeputies and officers from other law enforcement agencies responded to the different sites to provide security, according to the sheriff’s office.\n\nGov.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nImagine a world where the World Series winner is not announced until nine months after it has taken place; a world where teams collect only the most rudimentary statistics, and then decide to report only a handful of them to the public.\n\nJeff Asher Gordon Glattenberg\n\nIt would be lunacy for a major sports league to collect and report data in this way, but it is essentially how Americans are supposed to respond to the largest one-year increase in murder ever recorded. Murder rose nearly 30% nationally in 2020, and the available data suggests a smaller percentage increase occurred last year. But what’s still missing from the picture is a national data infrastructure which could illuminate why things are getting better or worse.\n\nUnderstanding why murder rose so much in 2020 – and why murder may be falling in some places but not others – is literally a life-or-death problem which demands better data delivered faster. Learning why murder becomes more or less prevalent could help officials make better decisions about deploying police, regulating guns and designing, financing and providing social services. Instead, we get mostly anecdotes and informed opinions when explaining why murder is going up or down.\n\nFor example, while the number of murders has increased nationwide, both Dallas and St. Louis saw declines in 2021 – by 13% and 25%, respectively – following large increases in both cities in 2020. Police departments in both cities pointed to smarter policing as the primary cause for the drop. Local community leaders and activists in St. Louis, by contrast, credited “a renewed focus at the grassroots level to address and combat the issue,” rather than policing.\n\nEither explanation is certainly plausible, but neither argument has a clear evidentiary base supporting it yet. Murder often goes up or down in a city from one year to the next for complex reasons that lack obvious explanations. Sometimes murder goes up or down because of randomness in the share of shootings that proved to be fatal. Murder rose in both Atlanta and Hartford, Connecticut, for example, but the number of people who were shot in each city fell last year relative to 2020.\n\nMany of the challenges to gaining better insight into murder trends stem from a national crime data reporting system which is imprecise and woefully slow. Through the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report (UCR) program, local law enforcement agencies report data to state agencies which report it up to the FBI. The FBI collects the data, ensures it has been reported properly, and reports it to the public by the end of September for the most recently completed year.\n\nThe FBI does not require law enforcement agencies to collect and report data specifically on shootings where a person is injured but not killed, despite a record 77% of murders having been committed with a firearm in 2020, according to the FBI. This information is critical for evaluating the degree to which policing strategies, community interventions, or just plain luck contributed to changes in gun violence Some cities do publicly report shooting data, though the lack of standardized data collection on shootings at the national level is a major hurdle to a more informed understanding of changing murder patterns in most cities.\n\nThat national crime data is reported in September of the following year also makes it too late to catch trends for the country as a whole as they happen. The FBI attempted to address this problem in 2020 by reporting national crime estimates quarterly, providing an important first glimpse at the breadth of 2020’s murder rise.\n\nIn 2021, however, the FBI has not published quarterly crime estimates because too few local agencies are regularly reporting data to federal law enforcement. The problem appears to stem from the FBI’s switch in 2021 to the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). On the surface, NIBRS would seem like the program we need to get access to better data, and with that a better understanding of violent crime patterns. It’s designed to provide more specificity about crimes and arrests reported by law enforcement compared to the legacy system (known as the Summary Reporting System). NIBRS provides more nuanced details of reported crimes, though unfortunately this does not include specifically counting shootings as such.\n\nAgencies were required to submit data to the FBI only via NIBRS starting January 1, 2021, but many agencies have not yet transitioned to this new system. Nearly 40% of law enforcement agencies that reported data to the FBI in 2020 did so via the legacy system, and only 53% of agencies enrolled in UCR used NIBRS in 2020. No agencies in California and only a small minority of agencies in Illinois, New York, Maryland, and Pennsylvania reported data via NIBRS in 2020.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how many agencies submitted data to the FBI through NIBRS in 2021, but the FBI has set a threshold of 60% of eligible agencies for making quarterly crime estimates and it has so far fallen short of this threshold in each quarter of 2021. As a result, each quarterly data release of 2021 from the FBI has come with a frustrating disclaimer stating, “due to participation under the 60% threshold, data trends by region and aggregate population group will not be available.”\n\nThe available evidence points to a significant gap between the numbers of agencies that will report data in 2021 and the number of agencies that have reported data in previous years. Under 10,000 out of the roughly 16,000 local law enforcement agencies that submit crime data to the FBI each year reported data via NIBRS in 2020 leaving over 6,000 agencies were still using the legacy reporting system. Fewer than 1,500 local agencies switched to NIBRS from the legacy system in 2020, so there is a strong chance that there will be thousands of local agencies that previously reported crime data to the FBI but did not in 2021. Fewer agencies reporting data means that when the FBI makes its year end crime estimates, it will do so using several thousand fewer data points than in previous years which could decrease confidence in those estimates.\n\nOne possible workaround for this data desert would be for more law enforcement agencies to embrace 21st century data reporting systems. Many – though not all – large agencies collect shooting data, but only a handful of cities – like Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rochester, New York, – publish victim-level data in near real-time. Other agencies track it only internally or report aggregate shooting data, either of which could conceivably be reported publicly.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nDozens of cities publishing detailed data on gun violence in near real-time would overcome some of the deficiencies in the FBI’s data collection and reporting system. Interested citizens, government analysts and academic researchers would be able to identify emerging trends, evaluate community programs or changes in policing strategies, and compare gun violence patterns across numerous American cities.\n\nMurder rose at a historic pace in 2020 and the available evidence points to a smaller increase in 2021.

And if Covid-19 booster coverage reached 80% among school-age children by the end of the year, more than 50,000 hospitalizations could be averted.\n\nPreventing Covid-19 hospitalizations could help ease the strain on pediatric hospitals, which have been especially full for the past few weeks as the respiratory virus season – including flu, RSV and Covid-19 – sweeps the country earlier than usual. Fewer than 1 in 4 pediatric hospital beds is available nationwide, including fewer than 10% of beds in seven states, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“The overwhelmed health system means some families may not be able to get the care their child requires for a medical emergency,” Dr. Moira Szilagyi, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, wrote in a CNN Opinion article, calling the situation a “crisis.”\n\nCovid-19 transmission is significantly lower now than earlier in the year; less than 5% of the US population lives in a county considered to have a high Covid-19 community level, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But more than 2,400 children were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 last week – nearly three times higher than the week before, CDC data shows.\n\nThe new analysis also found that higher vaccination rates could help keep kids in school, a benefit that other research has found could have important effects on mental health and academic achievement.\n\nAssuming a five-day isolation period for children with mild illness and 10 days for those who are hospitalized or otherwise severely ill, bringing Covid-19 booster uptake in line with flu shots for children could prevent more than 22 million days of school absenteeism.\n\nBut the scenarios presented in the new analysis are quite unrealistic. So far, less than 5% of school-age children have their updated booster shot, according to CDC data.\n\nA record number of updated Covid-19 boosters were administered in the first week of November, and US officials say they’re planning to push this week for people to get boosted against Covid-19 in order to offer maximum protection around Thanksgiving, but overall uptake remains low. To get to 50% coverage by the end of the year, the pace of vaccination would have to be at least 10 times faster than it’s been in November.\n\nAnd Covid-19 vaccination rates among children have long lagged behind those for adults. Just 32% of children ages 5 to 11 and 61% of those ages 12 to 17 have competed their initial series of Covid-19 vaccination, compared with 78% of adults.\n\n“Accelerated vaccination campaigns that achieve high coverage across all ages have the potential to prevent a possible imminent surge in Covid-19, protecting children both directly and indirectly and providing them with additional stability in terms of school attendance and other social engagement,” the study authors wrote. “The cost of inaction could be steep: millions more days of school absenteeism and thousands of preventable hospitalizations for children.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor this analysis, the researchers did not factor in the possibility of a new immune-evasive coronavirus variant but did account for both naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity that would wane over time.", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/supreme-court-guns-second-amendment-new-york-bruen/index.html", "title": "New York gun law: Supreme Court says Constitution protects right to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago that places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home – an opinion marking the widest expansion of gun rights in a decade.\n\n“Because the State of New York issues public-carry licenses only when an applicant demonstrates a special need for self-defense, we conclude that the State’s licensing regime violates the Constitution,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court’s 6-3 majority.\n\nThe opinion changes the framework that lower courts will use going forward as they analyze other gun restrictions, which could include the proposals currently before Congress if they eventually become law.\n\n“The majority’s expansion of what the Second Amendment protects will have monumental ramifications far beyond carrying firearms in public – on everything from age restrictions to assault weapons bans to limits on high-capacity magazines,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.\n\n“We’re in for a whole new slew of litigation challenging any and every gun-control measure in light of the analysis in today’s ruling,” Vladeck said.\n\nCritics say the ruling will impair sensible solutions they think can curb gun violence.\n\nOnly about a half dozen states have similar laws to New York’s – California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey – have similar regulations, but those states are comprised of some of the most densely populated cities in the country.\n\nTwenty-five states generally allow people to carry concealed weapons in most public spaces without any permit, background check or safety training, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nIn his opinion, Thomas said that going forward the government “may not simply posit that the regulation promotes and important interest,” instead he said the judges must look to text and history when deciding whether a law passes muster.\n\n“Only if a firearm regulation is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition may a court conclude that the individual’s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment’s unqualified command,” Thomas said. “We too agree, and now hold, consistent with Heller and McDonald, that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual’s right to carry a hand- gun for self-defense outside the home.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who is working with Congress on gun control legislation, said he is “deeply disappointed” with the decision.\n\n“This ruling contradicts both common sense and the Constitution, and should deeply trouble us all,” Biden said in a statement. “In the wake of the horrific attacks in Buffalo and Uvalde, as well as the daily acts of gun violence that do not make national headlines, we must do more as a society – not less – to protect our fellow Americans.”\n\nDissents cite recent mass shootings\n\nIn a dissent joined by the other liberals, Justice Stephen Breyer noted the spate gun violence and said that the court, listing several recent shootings, including the massacre at the Buffalo grocery store earlier this year. Thursday’s ruling “severely burdens States’ efforts” to curb gun violence, Breyer wrote.\n\n“The primary difference between the Court’s view and mine is that I believe the Amendment allows States to take account of the serious problems posed by gun violence that I have just described,” Breyer wrote. “I fear that the Court’s interpretation ignores these significant dangers and leaves States without the ability to address them.”\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, in a concurring opinion, pushed back: “And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.”\n\nThe conservative justices also dismissed concerns defenders of New York’s gun law raised about how the law restricted the carrying of firearms into sensitive places.\n\n“It is true that people sometimes congregate in ‘sensitive places,’ and it is likewise true that law enforcement professionals are usually presumptively available in those locations. But expanding the category of ‘sensitive places’ simply to all places of public congregation that are not isolated from law enforcement defines the category of ‘sensitive places’ far too broadly,” Thomas wrote.\n\nFirst major ruling on guns in a decade\n\nSince handing down two major Second Amendment cases in 2008 and 2010, the court has largely dodged the issue but agreed to take up the dispute after Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived, highlighting her impact on the new conservative court.\n\nIn 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller, the court held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms at home for self-defense. Except for a follow-up decision two years later, the justices largely stayed away from the issue infuriating gun rights advocates and even some of the justices themselves.\n\nThomas and other conservatives have made clear they believe lower courts have been thumbing their noses at the Heller decision by upholding restrictions. “The Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court,” Thomas has previously said.\n\nThe case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, concerned a New York law governing licenses to carry concealed handguns in public for self-defense. It required a resident to obtain a license to carry a concealed pistol or revolver and demonstrate that “proper cause” exists for the permit. Residents must show that they have a great need for the license and that they face a “special or unique danger to their life.”\n\nThe law requires applicants who want to carry a handgun in public without restriction to show an “actual and articulable” self-defense need, as opposed to one that is “speculative or specious.”\n\nA panel of judges on the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals held that New York’s law did not violate the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Biden administration supported New York and told the Supreme Court in a brief that while the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, the right is “not absolute.”\n\nActing Solicitor General Brian Fletcher told the justices that the law was “firmly grounded” in the nation’s history.\n\nThe petitioners in the case were Robert Nash, Brandon Koch and the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association – an NRA affiliate. They were represented by Paul Clement, a George W. Bush-era solicitor general who argued that that the Second Amendment ensures a right not just to “keep arms,” but to bear them.\n\nNash and Koch had passed the required background checks and obtained licenses to carry guns for hunting and target practice, but they had not been able to establish a special need for self-defense that is required under the law to receive an unrestricted license.\n\nClement argued that the law makes it almost impossible for an ordinary individual to obtain a license because the “proper cause” standard is so demanding and left to the “broad discretion” of the licensing officer.\n\n“Good, even impeccable, moral character plus a simple desire to exercise a fundamental right is,” Clement said, “not sufficient.” “Nor is living or being employed in a high crime area.”\n\nNash, for instance, requested to carry a handgun for self-defense after a string of robberies in his neighborhood. But he was denied because he did not demonstrate a special need for self-defense. Koch wanted a similar license, and he was able to cite his experience of participating in safety training courses. He too was denied.\n\nReaction\n\nGun rights groups touted the ruling as a win for Second Amendment rights and individuals’ rights to protect themselves, while gun safety advocates argued that the ruling would result in more gun violence.\n\nSeveral New York Democrats decried the ruling, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who called the court’s decision “shocking” and “frightful in its scope of how they are setting back this nation and our ability to protect our citizens.”\n\n“Today the Supreme Court is sending us backwards in our efforts to protect families and prevent gun violence. And it’s particularly painful that this came down at this moment, when we’re still dealing with families in pain from mass shootings that have occurred – the loss of life, their beloved children and grandchildren,” Hochul told reporters Thursday.\n\nThe governor said she’s prepared to call the state legislature back into session in response to the ruling. She said state legislators have already been alerted and that they’re looking at possible dates for reconvening.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, said the decision on guns, “put simply,” will put New Yorkers “at further risk of gun violence” in a statement vowing specific action to mitigate the risks he says the decision will create.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said the ruling, “severely undermines public safety not just in New York City, but around the country.” Bragg says his office is “analyzing” the ruling and crafting gun safety legislation that will take steps to “mitigate the damage done today.”\n\nThe National Rifle Association, meanwhile, called the Supreme Court ruling a “watershed win.”\n\n“Today’s ruling is a watershed win for good men and women all across America and is the result of a decades-long fight the NRA has led,” NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said in a statement. “The right to self-defense and to defend your family and loved ones should not end at your home.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details and reaction.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/business/uk-strikes-nurses/index.html", "title": "UK strikes set to escalate as nurses prepare for 'unprecedented ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nNurses in the United Kingdom have reached breaking point.\n\nAs many as 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing will walk out across England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Thursday in the first of two days of strikes this month to protest poor pay and working conditions. They plan to walk out again on December 20. (Nurses in Scotland are negotiating a separate pay offer.)\n\nIt’s the first time in its 106-year history that the RCN — the UK’s biggest nursing union — has gone on strike in England. The action has been sparked by a cost-of-living crisis that has slashed nurses’ spending power nearly three years after the start of a pandemic that pushed many to their limits.\n\n“It is pretty unprecedented,” Billy Palmer, senior fellow at Nuffield Trust, a health research firm, told CNN. While small pockets of nursing staff have walked out before, the country’s National Health Service has seen “nothing of this scale until now,” he added.\n\nThat is partly because, for most of its history, the RCN had a “no strike” policy. In 1995, the union changed its rules, allowing strikes as long as they did not compromise patient care.\n\n“Patient safety is always paramount,” the RCN says on its website, adding that some nursing staff would continue to work through the strike. The RCN has promised to maintain critical services, including chemotherapy and dialysis treatments, during this month’s stoppages.\n\nThe nurses join hundreds of thousands of other British workers who are striking this December, including rail staff, postal workers and ambulance drivers. At the center of these disputes is pay, which is failing to keep pace with inflation that hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October.\n\nIt is the broadest wave of industrial unrest since the country’s infamous “winter of discontent” in the late 1970s, when huge numbers of workers, from truck drivers to gravediggers, went on strike.\n\nThe chaos has prompted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to warn that “tough” new laws restricting strike action are on their way.\n\n‘Enough is enough’\n\nEarlier this year, the RCN rejected an offer by the government to increase nurses’ pay by a minimum of £1,400 ($1,707) a year. The offer amounted to an average rise of 4.3%, well below the rate of inflation.\n\nPat Cullen, RCN general secretary and chief executive, said last month that “enough [was] enough,” and that nurses would “no longer tolerate a financial knife-edge at home and a raw deal at work.”\n\nThe union says it wants a 19% pay rise — a 5% uplift on inflation of 14%, as measured by October’s retail price index — and for the government to fill a record number of staff vacancies that, it argues, is jeopardizing patient safety.\n\nThe RCN knows that’s optimistic, Palmer said. Nurses are not “genuinely holding out” for such a increase, he said, but are simply using it as a starting point for negotiations.\n\nBut that demand is “not affordable,” Steve Barclay, the UK’s health secretary, told CNN in a statement. Each additional 1% pay rise for nursing staff would cost the government around £700 million ($854 million), he added.\n\nBarclay said on Twitter last month that industrial action would “inevitably” impact services, but that the NHS had “tried and tested plans in place to minimize disruption and ensure emergency services continue to operate.”\n\n‘Years of underinvestment’\n\nThe dispute has its roots in previous grievances. The 360,000 nurses who work for the NHS — the service’s largest professional group — have suffered from years of underinvestment, the RCN argues.\n\nIn 2010, the Conservative-led coalition government embarked on a decade of austerity to stabilize the country’s finances following the global financial crisis.\n\nNurses’ pay dropped 1.2% every year between 2010 and 2017 once inflation was taken into account, according to The Health Foundation, a UK charity that campaigns for better health and health care. For the first three of those years, their pay was frozen.\n\nDespite pay increases in the years since, the Nuffield Trust estimates that the typical nurse’s salary — around £40,000 ($49,000) for experienced nurses working full time — has fallen by almost 6% after inflation compared to a decade ago. That compares to a 0.6% rise in private sector pay over the same period.\n\nInternationally, it is hard to compare UK nurses’ pay, given health care systems differ significantly between countries, but it falls somewhere in the middle of the range of comparable economies, Palmer said.\n\n“Almost any way you cut it we’re pretty much in the middle, typically [we] look a bit worse than Germany but a bit better than France, and we certainly look worse than the Anglosphere, like Australia and the United States,” he said.\n\nThat is also true for overall spending on the NHS. While the government has increased funding in the past decade, the gains have been “marginal,” according to Palmer. Once inflation and demographic changes are factored in, spending in England has risen by just 0.4% per year since 2010, Nuffield Trust data shows.\n\n‘Emotionally draining’\n\nPay is not the only problem. Nurses are also burned out, partly because there are a record 47,000 vacancies in England.\n\nNuffield Trust data shows that 40,000 nurses in England, or about 11% of the total nursing workforce, quit their jobs in the year to June. A similar number joined — almost 45,000 — but it was not enough to fill the gaps.\n\nMost nurses left to retire, but the number citing work-life balance, the second most common reason to leave, is nearly four times higher than a decade ago.\n\nAnd more could quit if conditions don’t improve. An RCN survey of its members last December showed that 57% of respondents were considering leaving. Feeling undervalued and working under too much pressure were the main reasons given.\n\nSally Warren, director of policy at The King’s Fund, a think tank, told CNN that the past decade had been “challenging” as staff numbers had trailed behind demand. The pandemic only intensified those problems.\n\n“[Nurses were] having to manage the iPad call between someone who [couldn’t] be visited by relatives in their final hours,” Warren said. “[It was] really emotionally draining.”\n\n— Zahid Mahmood contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/tallahassee-hot-yoga-shooting-misogynistic-extremism-report/index.html", "title": "'Incels': Threat assessment experts highlight danger posed by ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn a Friday evening in November 2018, 40-year-old Scott Beierle signed up for a hot yoga class in Tallahassee, Florida, and told the receptionist he would wait outside.\n\nWhen the class began, Beierle grabbed his ear protection and a loaded gun, walked into the classroom and opened fire. He killed two women, injured four others and then turned the gun on himself.\n\nPolice, through the course of their investigation of the incident, discovered a long history of hatred toward women, sexual assault allegations, and homophobic and racist comments.\n\nNow, threat assessment experts with the US Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center are using the Tallahassee murder-suicide to bring greater understanding to the threat posed by so-called involuntarily celibate men, often referred to as “incels.”\n\n“The term ‘incel’ is often used to describe men who feel unable to obtain romantic or sexual relationships with women, to which they feel entitled,” according to researchers in a new case study report released Tuesday.\n\n“This attacker’s history highlights the specific threat posed by misogynistic extremism,” researchers wrote in the case study. “This gender-based ideology, sometimes referred to as ‘male supremacy’ has received increased attention in recent years from researchers, government agencies and advocacy groups due to its association with high-profile incidents of mass violence.”\n\nThe detailed review of Beierle’s history illustrated common behavioral patterns and highlights many opportunities for intervention.\n\n“The behavioral history of the Hot Yoga Tallahassee attacker illustrates many of the behavioral threat assessment themes identified through years of U.S. Secret Service research examining targeted violence,” the report states.\n\nThe Secret Service’s report showed Beierle had regularly written about and engaged in violence toward women. “The Hot Yoga Tallahassee attacker was motivated to carry out violence by his inability to develop or maintain relationships with women, along with his perception of women’s societal power over men,” said Steven Driscoll, the assistant director of the National Threat Assessment Center.\n\nBeierle’s behavioral history, the report said, “highlights the specific threat posed by misogynistic extremism.”\n\nOne theme the report points to is Beierle facing a lack of consequences. For example, the report notes that he had been charged multiple times with battery, but charges were dropped. Other behavior threat assessment themes the Secret Service identified included failed aspirations, lack of financial stability, bizarre behavior, harassment and homicidal ideations.\n\nThe number of mass casualty events such as school shootings and misogynistically motivated murders in recent years has prompted a dramatic increase in requests for training from the Secret Service, researchers said.\n\nLina Alathari, the chief of the National Threat Assessment Center, estimated the number of participants in threat assessment and targeted violence trainings topped 26,000 last year.\n\nResearchers noted that Beierle’s behavior was extreme and reflected a combination of misogyny and White supremacy, highlighting the need for more studies on male supremacy as a motivating ideology.\n\n“You often see a crossover between misogynistic views and White supremacy, far-right ideology, as well as in some cases far-left ideologies,” Driscoll said.\n\n“The body of research examining misogyny as an extreme ideology and incels specifically, as well as its intersection with other ideologies like White supremacy, as a field of research, is growing.”", "authors": ["Whitney Wild"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/us/children-of-incarcerated-women-study-reaj/index.html", "title": "Nearly half of US states lack data on incarcerated mothers, report ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNearly half of US states do not collect data on the number of incarcerated women with children making it difficult for some nonprofits to provide services to those youth, according to a new report released Wednesday.\n\nThe study, conducted between July and October of this year by the nonprofit Girls Embracing Mothers, found that only 11 states compile data on incarcerated mothers while 24 states do not collect that information. Nine states reported that they do compile the data directly from incarcerated women but called it “unreliable,” not helpful” “not routinely updated,” and “not factual,” according to the report. Six states did not respond to the study.\n\nGirls Embracing Mothers reached out to the Department of Corrections in all 50 states to gather this information.\n\nThe lack of reporting means an unknown number of children could be facing neglect and a host of socioeconomic challenges despite there being organizations that want to help, said Brittany Barnett, founder and president of Girls Embracing Mothers, a group focused on empowering young girls with mothers in prison.\n\nThe issue has a disproportionate impact on Black families given Black people are incarcerated at higher rates than other races, according to The Sentencing Project. The Sentencing Project attributes this disparity to biased practices and procedures in the criminal legal system and a disproportionate number of Black people living in poverty.\n\nWhile there are significantly more men behind bars than women, the Prison Policy Initiative found that the number of incarcerated women has grown at twice the rate of men. Between 1980 and 2020 the number of incarcerated women increased from 26,326 to 152,854, or 475%, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.\n\nMore than half (58%) of all women in prisons are mothers. Many are being held because they can’t afford bail and for non-violent offenses. Most incarcerated women are also the primary caretakers of their children.\n\nBarnett said children of incarcerated parents are at increased risk of behavioral issues, learning disabilities, depression and are more likely to enter the criminal justice system themselves.\n\nBarnett said the states that don’t believe imprisoned mothers would provide accurate information about children “dehumanizes women who are going through unimaginable circumstances.”\n\n“It’s very troubling,” Barnett said. “We have no idea the extent of the devastation caused by maternal incarceration. I feel we are only touching the surface of the number of children who have been impacted.”\n\nBut some advocates for incarcerated women say the lack of data on mothers and children is not surprising.\n\nLisa Monet Wayne, executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said most women who end up in the criminal justice system are already receiving government assistance such as social services, welfare or Medicare. State governments are therefore already aware of the family’s needs. Information about a woman’s children is also contained in the court records when she is sentenced, Wayne said.\n\n“We are talking about mostly women who have been tracked by the government for most of their adult lives and their children,” Wayne said.\n\nWayne said there are also privacy issues that come into play where incarcerated mothers may not want nonprofits gaining access to their children. She suggests that nonprofits offer their services when a woman is first arrested and charged. The groups, she said, could partner with public defender offices. Generally, that is when most mothers are trying to make provisions for their family, Wayne said.\n\n“At beginning of the case all she normally cares about is her children,” Wayne said. “If you can put them at ease at the front end… it allows those women to make intelligent choices about how they want to resolve their case.”\n\nBarnett said her organization has programs that look to enhance the relationship between the incarcerated parent and their children. Their programs also provide support for children and mothers that help reduce the trauma and mental anguish of the separation.\n\nAccording to the study, most children of incarcerated parents live with the other parent or another family member such as a grandparent. For this reason, Barnett said advocacy groups can’t rely on child social services to collect the information.\n\n“Nearly 50% of all incarcerated women are mothers,” Barnett said. “So I can only imagine the number of children out there that we have no idea the number, let alone who they are to be able to offer the support that they really need.”", "authors": ["Nicquel Terry Ellis"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/media/uvalde-shooting-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "'Urgent questions' about Uvalde massacre have not been answered ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nGovernment statements are not adding up. Gaps and discrepancies are raising alarms. Elected officials are failing to answer the public’s questions.\n\nThis is a moment when journalists are needed. And a moment when journalists have to get it right.\n\nUnfortunately the subject matter is utterly heartbreaking: The deaths of 19 children and 2 adults at Robb Elementary. How was the gunman able to murder so many people? Why wasn’t he stopped sooner? Who was responsible for the police response? Why were so many of the initial accounts incorrect, according to newer statements? What should we believe?\n\nQuestions about the police response were front and center all day Thursday, due in large part to parents who spoke up, backed up by amateur video clips of Tuesday’s chaotic crime scene. Most of their questions have not been answered. Frustrations have been boiling over. “We’ve been given a lot of bad information,” CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz said at Thursday afternoon’s press conference. “These parents deserve to know exactly what happened, minute by minute, to their children,” Anderson Cooper said to Prokupecz later in the day.\n\nThe questions have, of course, triggered discomfort and defensiveness. When I turned on “Fox & Friends” on Thursday morning, I heard Ainsley Earhardt saying “it’s easy for the media in New York or California to place judgment on what’s happening.” But her comment missed the point – members of the media on the ground in Texas are the relevant questioners. I checked in with Marc Duvoisin, editor of the San Antonio Express-News, the daily newspaper closest to Uvalde. He agreed with my perception that Thursday was a turning point in the coverage of the shooting.\n\n“Urgent questions about the police response to the massacre have not been answered with clarity or consistency, and residents’ frustration began to boil over on social media,” Duvoisin said in an email message Thursday night. “The information gap became a partisan talking point, and elected officials began to demand answers and an investigation.”\n\nLet me quote Duvoisin in full:\n\n“This afternoon’s briefing by an official of the Texas Department of Public Safety answered some questions about the police response, but left considerable confusion. Why was the door to the school unlocked that morning? Unknown.”\n\n“The day before, DPS officials had said a school police officer confronted the gunman before he entered the school. At today’s briefing, a DPS official said the opposite: the gunman entered the school without facing resistance. Police officers got there several minutes later. Why did it take an hour for a SWAT team to assemble and force its way inside: ‘That’s a tough question.’”\n\n“Information about the incident has been tightly controlled from the very beginning. Throughout the day Tuesday, Uvalde police were tightlipped about the casualty count. So were local hospitals. It wasn’t until late Tuesday afternoon that the scope of the carnage was made public – by the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott. In my experience, that is unusual. In a mass casualty event, I’m used to seeing the head of the principal responding agency brief the media, often several times a day.”\n\nDuvoisin helped direct coverage of the 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, and back then, reporters were briefed by the city’s police chief. “They did not have to wait on the governor of California to get the facts,” he said. “I think the shortage of information has created frustration, and that frustration was compounded on Wednesday when Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and others went to Uvalde to hold a news conference. Abbott praised the first responders, expressed sympathy for the victims and talked in general terms about the importance of mental healthcare. But he revealed very few details about what actually happened inside that school.”\n\nWhere is Abbott now?\n\nOn Wednesday, the Texas governor talked tough while confronted by Beto O’Rourke. On Thursday, Abbott was nowhere to be seen. Questions hung in Uvalde’s 90-degree air. Every possible explanation only made the pain worse. CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem’s words stuck with me: She hit on the fact that Texas authorities initially talked about how much “worse” the attack could have been. “We are hearing that things could have been worse, which is always true,” Kayyem wrote. “The question is whether things could have been less bad. And I fear the answer could be yes.”\n\nThat’s what journalists are figuring out, hour by hour, in Uvalde and beyond. I highly recommend this thread by Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of gun policy/politics site The Reload, who said “the more we learn about how the police handled this shooting, the more outrageous it becomes. I’ve done active shooter training with several groups. The first principle is always to act as quickly as possible. How could they possibly have waited so long?” When will the governor answer?\n\nMaybe on Friday. Abbott — who was scheduled to speak Friday at the first day of the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting — is canceling his in-person appearance to attend a Friday afternoon press conference in Uvalde. He will speak to the convention virtually instead.\n\n“The governor will be address the NRA through prerecorded video,” spokesman Mark Miner told the Dallas Morning News Thursday.\n\nErasing any chance at common ground\n\nAs WaPo media critic Erik Wemple tweeted, “TV news anchors always caution that preliminary reports about mass shootings can be wrong, in part because of incorrect information from authorities. But this is of another magnitude altogether.” Yes it is. Officials “have offered varied timelines and explanations of the massacre and law enforcement’s response,” WaPo’s Mark Berman wrote. “They have also made sometimes inconsistent or contradictory announcements about key details, such as how the shooter entered the school or how long he was inside. They have even withdrawn some claims outright.”\n\nI caught some flak on Twitter for saying that the immense confusion about the attack timeline will make it even harder to find any common ground because some people will stick with the original “facts;” others will believe the new info; others will tune it out; and others will disbelieve it all.\n\nI admit that common ground is all but impossible. But how about a relatively shared understanding of the most basic facts? This week’s confusion is causing a gaping void. Conspiracy theories about the attack are already spreading among folks who are inclined to believe mass shootings are gun-seizure plots. Claims about a massive coverup are already spreading among folks inclined to believe that. Journalists will get to the bottom of this, but by the time all the facts are assembled into a whole, the disinfo sphere may have won…\n\nFurther reading\n\n– NBC’s Mike Hixenbaugh: “What was happening inside that classroom for an *hour*?

Beyoncé has been nominated four times for her albums \"I Am…Sasha Fierce,\" \"Beyoncé,\" \"Lemonade\" and \"Renaissance.\"\n\nThis year also marks the first time a Black woman has been nominated in the pinnacle category for a country album. Ray Charles was nominated for album of the year for \"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\" in 1962.\n\nIn the history of the award show, no Black woman has ever won a Grammy for a country song. In 2020, Mickey Guyton became the first Black woman to be recognized in a country music category when her song \"Black Like Me\" was nominated.\n\nEarlier this year, the superstar's husband, hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, called out the Recording Academy for snubbing Beyoncé while accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award. Consequently, he sparked a larger conversation about exclusion within the music industry.\n\nIn the fall, Beyoncé made headlines when she was snubbed with zero nominations for the 2024 Country Music Association Awards despite her groundbreaking album. She was the leading nominee for the People's Choice Country Awards with a total of 12 nods. However, she didn't take home any awards.\n\nBeyoncé first announced her eighth studio album during a surprise Super Bowl commercial in February when she released singles \"16 Carriages\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em.\" The songs instantly took the internet by storm, as did the album once it was released. She has since broken many records and made history, and it's safe to say \"Cowboy Carter\" has been a huge catalyst for the recent spotlight on Black country artists and the genre's roots.\n\nPrior to releasing the project, Beyoncé got candid about her struggles within the industry and alluded to her 2016 performance at the CMA Awards with The Chicks.\n\n\"This album has been over five years in the making. It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed…and it was very clear that I wasn’t,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me. Act ii is a result of challenging myself and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work.\"\n\nThe Grammys will take place Feb. 2 at the Crypto Arena in Los Angeles.\n\nFollow Caché McClay, the USA TODAY Network's Beyoncé Knowles-Carter reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @cachemcclay.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/11/08/grammys-2025-nominations-beyonce-taylor-swift-billie-eilish-chappell-roan-sabrina-carpenter-kendrick/76131073007/", "title": "Grammys 2025: Here are the nominees for the 67th annual music ...", "text": "The nominations for the 67th Grammys, which are next year, were announced on Friday and Beyoncé leads with 11 nominations.\n\nThe Recording Academy announced contenders across a staggering 94 categories, by far the most of any major award show.

That means when many are Christmas shopping, I'm at the movie theater.\n\nThis year is no different, with major pictures from film-making legends like directors Martin Scorsese and Ang Lee, to highly-praised but little known movies like \"Moonlight\" and \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Here's a list of 10 movies set to be released in the last two months of 2016 that even a large December blizzard could keep me from seeing.\n\n'Loving,' in limited release now\n\nAcclaimed writer-director Jeff Nichols — his \"Midnight Special\" came out earlier this year and is still one of my favorites of the year — takes on the heart-wrenching historical tale of Richard and Ruth Loving, an interracial couple who in 1958 were arrested in Virginia for simply being a married interracial couple.\n\n\"Loving\" showcases how the couple, played by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga, met, married and raised a family all while taking their case to the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia, a case that established any laws against interracial marriage unconstitutional.\n\n'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,' Nov. 11\n\nBased on the 2012 novel by Ben Fountain, \"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk\" depicts a day in the life of Iraq War veteran Billy Lynn, a 19-year-old soldier whose squad barely survived a fierce firefight. Brought back to America to be celebrated, and take part in the Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day halftime show, the movie shows the disconnect of the glitz and glamour of a halftime show with the brutal actualities of war.\n\nDirected by Ang Lee, the film-making wizard who made visually astonishing movies like \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and \"Life of Pi,\" \"Billy Lynn\" promises to be a feast for the eyes.\n\n'Manchester by the Sea,' in theaters Nov. 18\n\nOne of the best reviewed movies of the year, \"Manchester by the Sea\" currently sports a 98 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.7 out of 10.\n\nThe film weaves a personal story of Lee (Casey Affleck), whose older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) suddenly dies. Lee is made legal guardian of Joe's son Patrick and is forced to move back to the blue-collar North Shore Massachusetts community to take care of his grieving nephew and come to terms with his separated wife Randi (Michelle Williams.)\n\n'Moonlight,' at FilmScene Nov. 18\n\nAnother human drama getting the highest of reviews — a 98 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 9 out of 10 — \"Moonlight\" is a movie in three acts that depicts a young black man named Chiron at three different points in his life. Each act depicts how he deals with his crack-addicted mom, played by Naomi Harris, how he falls into a drug-dealing life and he comes to grips with his homosexual urges.\n\nMichael Phillips, film critic for the Chicago Tribune, said it best in his review of \"Moonlight\": \"a tidal pull on your heartstrings\" that uses \"restraint, quiet honesty, fluid imagery and an observant, uncompromised way of imagining one outsider's world so that it becomes our own.\"\n\n'Moana' in theaters Nov. 23\n\nThough everyone who owns a television has already been bombarded with advertisement for Disney's latest animated film, \"Moana\" has me excited more than your average Disney cartoon does.\n\nThe music for this musical is written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the certified genius who wrote and stared-in \"Hamilton.\" Disney has been on a hot streak with its animated features of late with \"Zootopia\" and \"Frozen.\" Its story of Polynesian princess fighting to save her island-dwelling family alongside the demigod Maui, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, seems full of beautiful scenery and action. That's enough reason for me to brave a movie theater that will undoubtedly be populated by a whole bunch of kids who want to sing along with the whole movie.\n\n'Jackie' in theaters Dec. 2\n\n\"Jackie\" stars Oscar-winning Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the immediate days after the assassination of her husband President John F. Kennedy.\n\nFeaturing Peter Sarsgaard as Bobby Kennedy, and performances by Greta Gerwig and John Hurt, this drama will explore a piece of history that has been often ignored: how the First Lady grieved and carried on while a nation mourned the death of her husband. The film also marks the first major-American film directed by the award-winning Chilean director Pablo Larrain.\n\n'La La Land' in theaters Dec. 16\n\n\"La La Land\" looks and sounds like a love note to classic movie musicals from the 1940s. Set in modern day Los Angeles, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling star as two struggling artists chasing their dreams in Hollywood. Stone, a struggling actor, meets Gosling, a recently fired jazz pianist, and the two fall in love and propel each other's artistic ambitions.\n\nWritten and directed by Damien Chazelle, the man who created the jazz-obsessed Academy Award-winning film \"Whiplash,\" the movie features massive musical numbers sure to please anyone with a love for classic musicals.\n\n'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' in theaters Dec. 16\n\nYes, it's a massive blockbuster that belongs to the high-grossing movie series of all time, but \"Rogue One\" seems to be differentiating itself from the other beloved \"Star Wars\" films. Set in between the years of \"Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith\" and \"Star Wars IV: A New Hope,\" the movie shows how a group of rebels steal plans needed to destroy the Galactic Empire's new super weapon: the Death Star.\n\nFeaturing Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker as rebel, and Ben Mendelsohn as the evil head of the Empire's advanced weapon research, the film seems like a darker, gritter and war-obsessed version of the traditionally fun-loving Star Wars film franchise.\n\n'Silence' in limited release Dec. 23\n\nAny movie directed by Martin Scorsese, the man behind \"Goodfellas,\" \"The Departed\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" is going to be hotly anticipated by film fans. His latest film, \"Silence,\" looks far-flung from his traditional New York-centered or crime-obsessed movies.\n\nStarring Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver as Portuguese priests in 17th central Japan, the movie centers around the two trying to find their missionary mentor, played by Liam Neeson, in a country that is violently beheading anyone practicing Christianity.\n\nSome of Scorsese's most powerful movies have centered around religion, like the highly controversial \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" and his Dalai Lama biopic about \"Kundun,\" so \"Silence\" has some lofty expectations to live up to.\n\n'Fences' in theaters Dec. 25\n\nBased on the play that won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize winner for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Play, \"Fences\" features Denzel Washington both as the movie's star and director.\n\n\"Fences\" features Troy, a middle-aged man struggling to provide for his family in the 1950s. A former baseball player who never made it to the Major League Baseball's color barrier had yet to be shattered by Jackie Robinson, Troy struggles with his past and fears for his son's future of playing football, a sport that doesn't openly accept black men.\n\nFeaturing Viola Davis, the film will likely content for multiple Academy Award nominations.\n\nReach Zach Berg at 319-887-5412, zberg@press-citizen.com, or follow him on Twitter at @ZacharyBerg.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/08/09/d23-pixar-reveals-incredibles-3-toy-story-5/74733039007/", "title": "'Incredibles 3' announced at D23, Pixar teases 'Toy Story 5'", "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif. − Pixar revealed incredible news at D23 Fan Expo on Friday: The animation studio is making \"Incredibles 3.\"\n\nPixar chief creative officer Pete Docter dropped the bombshell in front of 12,000 fans, the largest crowd ever for the Disney fan convention.\n\n\"As you can see, we have some 'Incredibles' projects,\" Docter said at the end of his presentation, before adding, \"That's right, we're making 'Incredibles 3.' \"\n\nDocter told the audience that Brad Bird, the writer and director behind the Oscar-winning \"Incredibles\" and \"Incredibles 2,\" is developing the third movie.

He released concept art showing a child transfixed by a tablet under a blanket while the toys look on sadly.\n\n\"The toys' jobs get exponentially harder when our toy crew goes head-to-head with what kids are obsessed with today: electronics,\" said Stanton. \"There is serious competition with phones and tablets everywhere. So this time around, it's toys meet tech.\"\n\nStanton added that one \"considerable problem\" in the film is the technological specter of \"50 rogue commemorative Buzz Lightyear action figures stuck in toy mode.\"\n\n\"It's going to be so fun,\" Stanton added. \"Toy Story 5\" will be released in summer 2026.\n\n'Inside Out' gets TV series 'Dream Productions'\n\nDocter discussed Pixar's first TV series, inspired by the world of the \"Inside Out\" films, called \"Dream Productions.\" The series, which takes place between both \"Inside Out\" movies, will reveal how Riley's dreams are made each night − on budget and on time.\n\n\"It's set between 'Inside Out 1' and 'Inside Out 2.'

The project has coincided with considerable drama offscreen over the past year – a messy divorce from second wife Christine Baumgartner and an agonizingly drawn-out split from the \"Yellowstone\" franchise.\n\nSpeaking from his movie studio where he's editing his second epic, \"Chapter 2\" (due Aug. 16), Costner's stubbornly blond hair is disheveled and his quarter-zip sweater is unapologetically rumpled. Yet he's attentive and focused discussing the sprawling movie project he co-wrote, directed, produced, stars in and mortgaged his home to finance.\n\n\"Horizon: Chapter 1,\" which has taken shots by early critics, is finally going to the ultimate judge – the movie public.\n\nNeed a break?

Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\nThat is the $100 million question, the reported budget for the R-rated, 181-minute first chapter. Costner does not even appear until 66 minutes into the movie as Hayes Ellison., a mysterious gunslinger who crosses paths with a local courtesan, Marigold (Abbey Lee).\n\nThe duo's travails are just two of the myriad stories, with 170 speaking parts, in the often brutal tale of post-Civil War westward expansion.\n\n\"In the second feature, things get harder for them. And the third film, things don't change,\" says Costner. \"The West was hard.\"\n\nWhat's Costner's financial stake in 'Horizon'? 'I try not to let it keep me up at night'\n\nCostner first started dreaming about the story in 1988, imagining five films. Even cut down to four, it's a supremely ambitious project for which he's pieced together financing. He says the cost of the first two \"Horizon\" movies, required \"a lot more\" than the $38 million he copped to personally putting down in previous interviews.\n\n\"I try not to let it keep me up at night,\" says Costner. \"Entrepreneurially, I just figure out a way. Maybe I'm a mongoose playing with a cobra.\"\n\nThe principled and proudly stubborn Costner went through similar drama with predictions of doom for 1990's \"Dances with Wolves\" (a box-office hit that went on to win seven Oscars, including best picture and best director) and 1995's actually troubled \"Waterworld,\" which eventually eked out a profit. \"Horizon\" is a fourfold gamble.\n\n\"I can't ignore where my heart wants to go,\" says Costner of the \"Horizon\" spend. \"I'm not a fool, but it feels foolish. I don't honestly know why I do the things I do. I'm not hurting anybody, and it's my intention to bring a solid piece of entertainment.\"\n\nBy all accounts, Costner was outwardly unaffected by his burden during the 52-day shoot in picturesque Moab, Utah.\n\n\"I'm sure he was thinking about putting up his land to help finance it and other stuff he had going on,\" says Luke Wilson, who plays Matthew Van Weyden, the captain of a wagon train. \"But he just focused on the work. The guy is cool under pressure. I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nWhy Costner announced 'Yellowstone' departure after editing 'Horizon: Chapter 2'\n\nLeaving a \"Chapter 2\" editing session last week, Costner officially ended speculation about whether he'd return for the fifth and final \"Yellowstone\" season as rancher John Dutton.\n\nAfter a prolonged battle and negotiations with creator Taylor Sheridan and Paramount Studios over pay and shooting schedules, exacerbated by Costner's ambitious movies and Sheridan's TV universe, Costner put the nail in the return coffin in an impromptu June 20 video.\n\n\"I just said, 'Bring the camera over here a second.' I just wanted to get it done,\" says Costner, who spoke directly to \"Yellowstone\" fans, saying, \"I just wanted to let you know that I won't be returning.\n\nCostner knew fans wouldn't be happy with the news that came the same day Paramount announced the final season, shooting in Montana, will premiere Nov. 10. He equates it to a dad breaking the news to his kids \"that we're not going to Hawaii this year.\"\n\nBut officially announcing the \"Yellowstone\" departure after holding out hope for a return made it even clearer that Costner is putting all his energy and focus into his \"Horizon\" movie gamble. Costner ended the video by saying, \"See you at the movies.\" He hopes, and needs, \"Yellowstone\" fans to come along for the \"Horizon\" ride.\n\n\"I tried to honor that audience as much as I could when making 'Yellowstone,'\" says Costner. \"And I made this movie for people like that, not as a peacemaking moment but as a continuing relationship.\"\n\n\"Horizon\" certainly is the type of movie a maverick modern-day cattle rancher like John Dutton would make. And in the same hard-headed style.\n\n\"I could have used John Dutton to help me finance it,\" says Costner. \"Where's John Dutton when I need him?\"\n\nCostner has yet to complete 'Horizon: Chapter 3\" or \"Chapter 4\"\n\nThe sunglass-wearing Costner was back in superstar form attending Monday's Los Angeles premiere with his seven children, including son Hayes, 15, who stars in \"Horizon.\"\n\nStanding on the gold carpet, Costner spoke to USA TODAY about the hard-fought lessons he's learned making the first two chapters, which will carry him through finishing the third film (already underway) and the fourth.\n\n\"You can't stand still,\" he said. \"I've had a really blessed life, but it shouldn't come as a surprise that I bruise like anyone else. It's really what you do after that. You have to get up. I have children who are watching me.

Hint: Nope!) and the critically acclaimed The Place Beyond The Pines starring Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper. We also answered readers' questions about 50 Shades of Grey, The Evil Dead, The Devil in the White City and Jurassic Park 3D.\n\nJohn Elliot: Welcome to the USA TODAY Movie Forum!\n\nI'm John Elliot, online producer for USA TODAY Movies and I will serve as your moderator. Joining me today are USA TODAY movies reporter Susan Wloszczyna and film critic Claudia Puig\n\nHow this works - Each week we solicit questions, online, from our readers on the latest news from the world of film.\n\nThis week? The Croods, The Host and The Place Beyond the Pines\n\n\n\nIt's a \"THE\" heavy Forum this week!\n\nRemember: you can submit questions right here and now and we will tackle them later in the chat.\n\nSo let's get started!\n\nThe Croods, an animated comedy from DreamWorks featuring an all-star voice acting cast including Nicolas Cage, Ryan Reynolds and Emma Stone, won the box office this weekend with a solid opening of $43.6M. What is the state of DreamWorks Animation? Is this a sign of good things to come?\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Hey John -- It isn't a bad sign, but it isn't a resounding win, either. There is so many animated rivals to contend with today, something really has to stand out to make a non-sequel click with the public. The Croods was perfectly fine but it was basically Ice Age with humans meets Avatar, and we have sort of seen that family-oriented story before.\n\nBut don't give up on DreamWorks yet. I have higher hopes for Turbo, with Ryan Reynolds as a racing snail. A little more octane in that concept. Snails are also apparently hot in animated form: Epic from Fox has one, too, with the voice of Chris O'Dowd. But DreamWorks needs something to catch on like Shrek did, since their last non spinoff/sequel to catch fire was 2010's How to Train Your Dragon. I am looking forward to their new twist on a classic from my youth that arrives next year: Mr. Peabody and Sherman.\n\nClaudia Puig: Though this is no Shrek (which Croods star Nicolas Cage was offered!), I do think DreamWorks Animation's stock has risen (literally and figuratively) since the success this weekend of The Croods. It could be a sign of good things to come. It's a return from the disappointment that was Rise of the Guardians. I believe Its last major success was in 2010 with How to Train Your Dragon, which Croods director Chris Sanders also directed. So maybe what's to be learned from this is that DreamWorks needs to turn to Chris Sanders for a winning formula.\n\nJohn Elliot: Can DreamWorks Animation be considered on an equal with Disney/Pixar, in terms of storytelling, animation, box office draw, etc?\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: DreamWorks trumped Disney animation by have a mega-hit with Shrek in 2001, while the House of Mouse was still fiddling with handdrawn animation. But Pixar still remains the standard.\n\nClaudia Puig: Alas, not even close to Disney/Pixar in terms of the breadth of storytelling, animation or box office draw. With the minor exception of Cars 2, Pixar is in the rare position of batting it out of the park every time---whether with first time stories or sequels. It's really quite breathtaking.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: What DreamWorks has done with such hits as Kung Fu Panda and Dragon is to go beyond the joke-a-minute style of Shrek and be confident enough to go deeper and more serious occasionally. That shows up in The Croods, too.\n\nClaudia Puig: As much as I loved the first Shrek, and liked the second, and also really enjoyed How to Train Your Dragon, DreamWorks is not nearly as consistently good as Pixar.\n\nJohn Elliot: How much more will The Croods need to earn to warrant a sequel? Or is a sequel already in the bag?\n\nClaudia Puig: It cost $135 million to make--or at least that's what DreamWorks is copping to. So it still has a way to go to turn a profit. I don't think it takes all that much for the powers that be to decide to make a sequel--even if it goes straight to DVD however\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: I did not leave the theater with a crying need for more Croods time. Although I would enjoy Cloris Leachman's granny facing off with Wanda Sykes' oldster from the last Ice Age if two studios could ever merge like that.\n\nJohn Elliot: What other animated films should movie goers be on the look out for this spring and summer?\n\nClaudia Puig: I'm really looking forward to Monsters University, and also Despicable Me 2. Though both are sequels, the originals were so clever that it's hard not to want more.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna:Despicable Me 2 -- the Minions are like animated potato chips, you can never just settle for only one helping. And, yes, I have high hopes for Monster U -- I am hoping for a Pixar version of Animal House.\n\nJohn Elliot:The Host, opening this weekend, is the latest film from Twilight author Stephenie Meyer, adapted from her book of the same name. In the book world, The Host didn't post nearly the numbers that The Twilight Saga did…any reason to think the film version will rival Twilight's box office?\n\nClaudia Puig: I believe the book is aimed at a slightly older demographic than Twilight. It was considered her \"adult\" book. Be that as it may, I'm sure it was snapped up by Twi-hards more than fans of mature literature. As for the movie, I don't see it rivalling Twilight at all. I think that was a unique Meyer phenomenon. The first weekend may be high withTwilight fans showing up and due to the vague appeal of the ads and trailer, but I don't see this being a major blockbuster, ala either Twilight or Hunger Games.\n\nClaudia Puig: Susan, are you a Twi-fan?\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Am I a Twi-fan? More like a Try-fan. But the films followed the books in diminishing returns for me.\n\nThis always happens after a certain genre spawns a huge hit. First came Lord of the Rings, then followed Narnia, The Golden Compass, Eragon. None really had the same sort of magic and appeal. The first Hunger Games actually doubled the domestic box office of the first Twilight and it should grow to be a bigger success with each sequel.\n\nClaudia Puig: So true about the wannabe factor of Golden Compass and Eragon. I'm betting on Hunger Games' continued success, especially since Jennifer Lawrence is such an \"it girl\" now.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: But the studios will continue to try to capture Twilight's audience at the movies, with potential franchises with Divergent and The Mortal Instruments. But in the case of The Host, aliens are rarely as sexy as vampires -- unless they are Jeff Bridges.\n\nClaudia Puig: Well, I'm seeing The Host tonight so I'll report back about the sexiness of aliens....\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Good, someone has to ..\n\nJohn Elliot: There is was a pretty large void in the YA film market following the consecutive conclusions of the Harry Potter and Twilight series. Does any other series have a chance at stealing The Hunger Games crown? Or should we get very comfortable with the image of a bow sporting Jennifer Lawrence for the next few years?\n\nClaudia Puig: No, I don't think we'll be seeing a Beautiful Creatures franchise. Hunger Games seems to have the corner on the market for the foreseeable future.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna:The Hunger Games was different enough from Twilight but also had some of the same strong heroine/romance elements to appeal to even a broader audience, And so much better acting and writing. Effects wise, it definitely needs an upgrade, though.\n\nClaudia Puig: And of course the J-Law factor in that strong heroine. She can act circles around K-STew.\n\nJohn Elliot: Finally…The Place Beyond the Pines, starring Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Ray Liotta and Eva Mendes opens this weekend, and has being getting some great critical buzz.\n\nI haven't seen it yet, but the trailer looks great.\n\nHOWEVER you two have seen it! So let us know…what can we expect? Does it live up to the hype?\n\nClaudia Puig: I think this is a fantastic epic drama. For me, it definitely lives up to the hype. It's ambitious and sweeping and has a lot to say about father-son relationships and the reverberations of moral choices. The director, Derek Cianfrance, who did Blue Valentine, re-teams with Ryan Gosling and it's even better than their last collaboration. It's a long movie but you don't feel the length at all. It's my favorite movie of this year--so far.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: It is two hours and 20 minutes and it flew by. Gripping personified. One warning: Those expecting lots of sexy time between Gosling and co-star Eva Mendes given that his last collaboration with Cianfrance was the graphic Blue Valentine will be very disappointed. Also be aware that Gosling and Cooper barely cross paths, but when they do it is a very vital, tense scene.\n\nClaudia Puig: Even though Gosling and Mendes aren't on the screen together all that much, they do have chemistry to burn. The story has such depth an approaches a Greek tragedy. While I loved Drive, this is definitely NOT Drive on a motorcyle!\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Women will be happy watching Gosling and Cooper act their butts off. And men should enjoy Mendes' initial entrance where she clearly left her bra at home.\n\nClaudia Puig: And what about that long tracking shot as the movie opens with Gosling walking into the carnival? He looks amazing and is such a superb actor!\n\nJohn Elliot: Well, I , for one, am looking forward to seeing it.\n\nNow...time for reader questions!\n\nD-know from Tacoma, WA asks:\n\nDo you have an early review for Evil Dead?\n\nClaudia Puig: I have yet to see it, D-know. (Love that name!) Seeing it next week, so alas no early review or spoiler here!\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Lightning rarely strikes twice, especially when it is something so special as the first Evil Dead. Really, has any zombie film topped the first Night of the Living Dead.\n\nClaudia Puig: When it comes to zombie movies I still love 28 Days Later.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: I discount that one. A. They had a virus -- not the undead. B. I like my zombies shambling not zippy. Next question ....\n\nClaudia Puig: I personally dislike the shambling ones. So slow and predictable. I prefer Shaun of the Dead--the zombie take-offs.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Yes, but Shaun had shamblers. You could kill them with record albums.\n\nClaudia Puig: Readers, want to weigh in on your zombie faves?\n\nJohn Elliot: We got few questions/comments regarding our 50 Shades of Grey casting discussion from last week\n\nChris from Detroit asks:\n\nIs there any chance of an established actress being able to play Ana Steele without risking the credibility of their career? No offense, but when you hear the author and producers saying they want an NC-17 rating, porn films automatically come to mind. I think that's why Emma laughed at the reports, because she actually wants her career to last.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: An explicit role does not necessarily sink an actress's career. Think Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. But steamy sex is not as easy to pull off as one might think -- at least in a movie. It came come off as silly and campy, such as Showgirls. I am still haunted by those dolphin fountains in the pool. Then there is Madonna in Body of Evidence. I did not light any candles for a year. But Jane Fonda managed to survive Barbarella. I think the filmmaker and the storytelling is maybe as important if not more than the stars they pick.\n\nClaudia Puig: I think Chris's assessment is spot-on. Emma wants a lasting career and taking that role is a big risk. I guess it's posible it could catapult someone who's not a major name into the global consciousness, but then again the role could be this decade's Nomi from Showgirls\n\nSusan from San Diego says:\n\nThis series just has to be done right - another book cannot be ruined by someone totally mis-casting and changing the storyline too much.\n\nThe people cast have to become the character, have to be perfect, have to make us believe they are that person - this is a book read by millions.\n\nChristian has to have the kind of hair women run their fingers thourgh, he has to have the cold look, the soft look, all the looks that the book describes often.\n\nIt may work well for them to cast unknowns so that we are not recalling the actor/actress in some other role.\n\nClaudia Puig: Susan--from San Diego, not USA Today--it sounds like you should be a casting consultant!\n\nBut seriously, I think Susan is right that unknowns would probably be best. And hair that women can run their fingers through can't be too hard to find among young actors.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Perhaps the way to go is with a known actor -- obviously Susan will not abide by Vin Diesel or the Rock -- and unknown actress, just to add some mystery to it. It is easier to fantasize with an unknown in a role sometimes.\n\nEdward from Florida asks:\n\nWhat is currently going on with The Devil in the White City movie?\n\nAny film start date for this production? Anxious to see this movie.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Did a little research -- or what others call Googling -- and this fascinating project based on real-life facts surrounding the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago that mingles a master architect's dream and a nightmare situation created by the first American serial killer seems to be in a kind of production limbo. Leonardo Di Caprio's production company has the rights and he is itching to play the macabre murderer. But he also has about 20 other outstanding projects lined up. I think it will get made but it will cost a bit.\n\nCarrie from Indianapolis asks:\n\nI wanted to know how long Jurassic Park 3D will be in the theaters.\n\nClaudia Puig: Not sure specifically on Jurassic Park 3D, but as long as the studios can wring more money out of audiences, those 3D re-boots will keep re-surfacing. And sticking around.\n\nI don't know if length of time in theaters is something studios necessarily reveal. It all depends on the success of the film I believe.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Those who have seen it have said it is one of the better such dimensional transfers they have seen -- the action pops and even the sound is more resounding. But with the summer monsters around the corner, don't wait too long to see T-rex stomp around in the third dimension.\n\nJohn Elliot: Finally...we got our FIRST Forum comment via Facebook (yes, Forum fans you can submit questions there too!) from one Ted Nolan.\n\nTed Nolan says:\n\nMovie theaters should put shock collars on patrons. Any talking by anyone wearing the collar once inside the theater would result in a severe shock.\n\nJohn Elliot: Well, Ted, it doesn't seem ENTIRELY practical (or legal), but Claudia and Susan how do you deal with disruptive movie goers?\n\nClaudia Puig: Disruptive moviegoers are a true annoyance. As are chronic texters....I usually suffer in silence, with an occasional \"shhh!\" escaping my lips. But I will say I once shushed Larry King at a premiere. He insisted on talking loudly through a director's introduction to a film.\n\nIt didn't work, alas. He kept talking.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: I like that idea but fear sneezing or coughing might set it off, Ted. Luckily, I tend to get my own screenings often alone or I go in a crowd of respectful media types. But if forced to go to an actual paid-for showing, I tend to go where there will be less of a crowd, just in case i have to move away. Confrontation rarely works since the guilty parties tend to simply get defensive or ignore you. Now popcorn munchers and texters -- they deserve two collars.\n\nJohn Elliot: Unfortunately, it's time for us to wrap up\n\nThank you Claudia and Susan! And a VERY big thank you to all our readers who participated and submitted questions.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Farewell, one and all -- happy Passover, Easter and sneak in a movie if you can.\n\nClaudia Puig: Thanks to all our readers--on the site and on Facebook! Great questions! Now remember not to talk, text or munch loudly at the movies!\n\nJohn Elliot: Remember: you can submit your burning movie questions all week long, right here.\n\nThank you all for joining us for the USA TODAY Movie Forum!

Because right now nature is under assault.\"\n\nCameron discussed \"Super/Natural,\" surprise changes to the newly restored 2009 world box-office champion \"Avatar\" (in theaters Friday) and the first sequel, \"Avatar: Way of the Water\" (due Dec. 22).\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nQuestion: Explain your role in producing 'Super/Natural.\"\n\nAnswer: It's figuring out what areas we wanted to send teams. We had 80 shoots in 25 countries over two years. And as the cuts came in, it's telling the story clearly and kicking it in the (butt), not having it be too reverential or droning on. It's storytelling that's almost getting into the animal's head. And then putting on a layer of (visual effects). The camera can't see a bat's sound wave. We coupled ultra-high speed photography with this overlay to see the chirps going out and coming back – a subjective picture of what that looks like to the bat. For the first time, I really understood how bat sonar worked.\n\n\"Super/Natural\" claims the stunning shots of orcas hunting breeding devil rays hasn't been captured before. How did it happen?\n\nBesides the planning, to do a show like this requires that element of luck. And then being able to turn on a dime when it happens and get the shot. That luck is like a lightning strike. Put enough people in the field and they'll finally photograph things that were maybe only seen by some people.\n\nIn some cases, we saw things that nobody had ever even seen, like the little Anole lizard using his skin to convey air up to bubble on his head acting like a helmet diver to avoid a predatory bird. Nobody had even dreamed of that.\n\nMight there be an Anole lizard cameo in \"Avatar: Way of the Water\"?\n\nAs a filmmaker doing fictional stuff on an alien planet, I rely heavily on all the natural history photography, and am constantly using that as reference. Our conclusion, after 15 years of trying to design new amazing things for \"Avatar\" movies, nothing can compete with nature's imagination. Nature beats you to the punch every time. We're just ripping nature off left, right and center to make an amazing fantasy world.\n\nThe newly remastered, 4K \"Avatar\" hits screens again Friday. Will moviegoers notice the difference?\n\nI notice a big difference, but I know the film very well. It's brighter, clearer, sharper. The 3D is a little better, and it's 4K. Then there's the top sound format, 9.1 Atmos sound. But the really important thing is that there's a whole new generation of film fans that haven't had an opportunity to see \"Avatar\" in a movie theater. It's an opportunity to be reminded of the characters and this world going into the new film release.\n\nOnce you open \"Avatar\" up for a technical reboot, did you change any story content (as George Lucas did by making Greedo fire first in \"Star Wars\")?\n\nWe sort of gave ourselves the edict that we wouldn't change a frame. Then I decided to add one tiny Easter egg. Nothing earth-shaking, a little connection to the coming sequel. Plus we have a little audience surprise at the end of the film.\n\nCan you tell me just the Easter egg?\n\nNo, just go pay your admission like everyone else.\n\nQ: One change you did make after 13 years, seen on the new \"Avatar\" poster, was the title font from Papyrus.\n\nIt's Papyrus lite. I happen to like Papyrus. So I said, \"Don't change it too much. Just a little change.\"\n\nEspecially after Ryan Gosling's \"SNL\" skit about \"Avatar\" using the free Papyrus font, why the change?\n\nI had to keep Ryan Gosling happy on this thing. Obviously, he had a serious traumatic experience around the font.\n\nBefore revealing \"Way of the Water\" clips at this month's D23 fan expo, you said you're about to \"see if this was all worth it.\" How are you feeling about the sequel, 13 years after the original?\n\nObviously, you have to have the courage to take a serious leap of faith, And it's a leap of faith that in the current marketplace – after the pandemic, years later and with streaming ascendant – that there's still a marketplace for a movie of this size. But it's not a bigger leap of faith than we took on the first \"Avatar,\" with untried technology and a whole new way of telling a story. We took that leap then, and we had no idea we were going to succeed like that, even after the first weekend.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/06/06/the-watchers-ishana-night-shyamalan/73953836007/", "title": "'The Watchers': Ishana Night Shyamalan dives into the family business", "text": "For almost as long as she's been alive, M. Night Shyamalan has been watching movies with his daughter Ishana. And early on, he found that when she watched something, she would feel it profoundly.\n\n\"She's always been a super-sensitive kid,\" the iconic filmmaker says. \"She would watch 'Shrek' and when Shrek hits the wrong guy, she was inconsolable. She would start screaming and crying. We'd be like, 'Ishana, it's OK! Keep watching, hang in there, it's going to work out.' \"\n\nA lifetime spent behind the scenes of her dad's storytelling has led to Ishana Night Shyamalan, 24, crafting her own dark yarns, from the domestic terror of Apple TV+ series \"Servant\" to the horror fantasy of her directorial film debut “The Watchers” (in theaters Friday).\n\n\"I think my relationship with art is just that it's something I do to survive,\" says Ishana, a 2021 graduate of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She worked alongside her Oscar-nominated dad writing, directing and producing episodes of “Servant,” plus directing secondary units on his movies “Old” and “Knock at the Cabin.”\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

By nature, I'm just a bit more frenzied than he is.” But the same intensity still exists from when she was a youngster, \"which as a filmmaker is such a great weapon,\" says M. Night Shyamalan, a producer on \"Watchers\" and a proud parent alongside Ishana at recent red-carpet events.\n\nIt’s a big summer for the Shyamalans, starting with \"The Watchers,” about a young woman who finds supernatural spookiness in the woods. Then Ishana’s twistmaster dad releases his newest thriller “Trap” (out Aug. 9), which features Ishana's older sister (and singer) Saleka. Meanwhile, “my mom's chilling. She's doing her thing,” Ishana Shyamalan says with a laugh. (She also has a younger sister, Shivani.)\n\n\"We're just so lucky that we have such a strong family unit where we can be there for each other,\" she says. Making a movie \"takes a level of confidence and assuredness that I feel like all young people struggle with, but that at moments I really don't feel. My journey is learning how to stay assured and go for what I want in the right moments.\"\n\nHere’s what else to know about the latest Shyamalan storming Hollywood:\n\nIshana Night Shyamalan recognized herself in the struggles of Dakota Fanning's character in 'The Watchers'\n\nIn “Watchers,” Mina (Dakota Fanning) is an American living in Galway, still haunted by a childhood trauma, whose car breaks down in a remote forest and she becomes inescapably lost. She happens upon a strange building and is taken in by a group of people, but she learns this is no safe sanctuary: They’re visited every night by strange creatures who watch them through a one-way window.\n\nWhen adapting A.M. Shine’s 2021 novel of the same name, Ishana Shyamalan realized she shared Mina's struggles coping with \"guilt and solitude.\"\n\nFanning found the role of someone “running from the broken parts of herself” appealing and adored Shyamalan’s vibe as a young woman \"at the start of her adventure.\" One day while filming in a forest in Ireland, Fanning noticed everybody else throwing on coats and hoods during a deluge, but not her director. “Ishana’s hair is like fully soaked, barely has a jacket on, and she has a big smile on her face,” the actress recalls. “I was like, ‘You are meant to do this.’”\n\nM. Night Shyamalan’s daughter embraced her dad’s love of storytelling and rules of movie watching\n\nOn her Instagram page, Shyamalan has a picture of herself as a little girl in her father’s arms, looking through a camera on the set of his 2006 movie “Lady in the Water.” Even back then, she was fascinated with his job: “As a kid, that's the dream, that you can imagine something and it becomes real. So to have my dad be doing that magic thing was something that has always stuck with me.\"\n\nA big fan of Hayao Miyazaki, she grew up a “total nerd” for fantasy novels and films but loves horror because \"it's a language that I feel most connected to and feel I can express myself best through.\" M. Night Shyamalan introduced his daughters to all sorts of films, including scary movies, from a young age. Only the good stuff, though: “If they saw a mediocre movie, that would be because they went over to a friend's house.”\n\nPlus, they had to watch movies from beginning to end, and no starting it in the middle. “It's sacred. It sounds silly, but that's the way we were,” he says. “There was a great appreciation for the art form because that art form built our house.”\n\nDon’t expect any ‘cheeky' acting cameos from Ishana Shyamalan\n\nBy the time she was 16, after years of watching her dad work, Ishana Shyamalan “started to have the inkling that it might be possible for me to do that same thing once I got a bit older. He says he always felt he knew, which I don't know if I believe or not,” she says. (For the record, M. Night Shyamalan says he knew after their post-screening discussion of the 2015 horror movie \"It Follows.\" \"I could feel like, 'Oh, wow. Her mind just gets it.' \")\n\nSix years training as a ballerina gave Ishana Shyamalan a \"knowledge of movement, of how to flow, into everything I do.” Growing up, she also played piano, painted, did film photography and even made clothes. One thing that didn’t take was acting, outside of some middle-school plays. “I enjoy being in solitude and sort of like not being looked at,” she acknowledges. So while she loves her dad’s “cheeky cameos” in his movies, “I’m totally cool staying off-camera.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/12/16/babylon-review-margot-robbie-brad-pitt-old-hollywood/10899690002/", "title": "'Babylon' review: Margot Robbie leads coke-fueled ode to old ...", "text": "When your ode to old-school Hollywood includes high-velocity elephant diarrhea, drunken shenanigans, an orgiastic swath of half-naked people and mountains of cocaine in the first 30 minutes alone, realistically it’s hard to go anywhere else but down.\n\nWritten and directed by Damien Chazelle – the man behind the much-more-subdued 2016 movie homage “La La Land” – the boisterous mess “Babylon” (★★½ out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday) is a Tinseltown tale of fame, fortune and coke-snorting excess with real-life A-listers playing fictional A-listers. At least it's never boring, which is saying something considering the 189-minute length.\n\nThe movie harks back to the 1920s silent era of filmmaking – and its revolutionary transition to “talkies” – while smacking you in the face with a series of memorably bonkers episodes, usually involving Margot Robbie valiantly going for broke. Yet even with a great turn from Brad Pitt, an impressive showing by newcomer Diego Calva and a bunch of entertaining cameos, the madcap comedy-drama can’t help but run out of creative crazy juice by the end as it unspools into cinematic sentimentality.\n\nThe movie starts in 1926 at an unhinged (and uninhibited) party in the Southern California hills that introduces the main players. Manny Torres (Calva) is a Mexican immigrant solving crises at the drug-and-booze-fueled bacchanal. He forms a close bond with Nellie LaRoy (Robbie), a young actress in search of her big break who dives into the debauchery with gusto, and meets Jack Conrad (Pitt), the highest-grossing leading man in an industry that will soon evolve in major ways.\n\nNellie impresses the right people with her wild-child style – she’s described as “a maelstrom of bad taste and sheer magic” by gossip columnist Elinor St. John (Jean Smart) – and Jack takes Manny under his wing, as the youngster proves to have a knack for cinematic problem-solving. Manny and Nellie continue to cross paths as sound pictures change the industry, and their working lives. But as they move into the 1930s, challenges arise as the core trio deals with pride, vices and relationships.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nRobbie’s character is the heart of “Babylon,” a force of nature willing to do anything for fame but pays a price. She and Calva share some of the movie’s most important emotional moments – as do Pitt and Smart, who have an unforgettable convo about the fleeting nature of stardom.\n\nAnd with a mix of physicality and sheer gumption, Robbie rules the most raucous sequences as Nellie loses her cool on set, ruins a fancy-pants shindig and wrestles a rattlesnake. While Pitt has his over-the-top moments, he brings a thoughtful nuance to Jack, an icon on the downside of his career. And Calva gets the plum role as our window into this wild world, though Manny’s also a guy who learns a dream comes with consequences.\n\nTwo other supporting characters also factor into the plot: Jovan Adepo plays Sidney Palmer, a Black trumpeter whose status also skyrockets, and Li Jun Li plays Lady Fay Zhu, a lesbian Asian singer/actress who creates silent-movie dialogue cards on the side and has the hots for Nellie. Chazelle attempts to examine race and sexuality issues of the period with these roles; both deserve heftier arcs but get insubstantial screen time.\n\n'I consider myself on my last leg': Brad Pitt discusses sobriety, potential retirement\n\nAs an unabashed love letter to cinema, “Babylon” looks and sounds cool: Top-notch production design recaptures the magic of old movie sets and exudes wall-to-wall rowdiness in the film’s opening shindig, while Oscar-winning composer Justin Hurwitz (\"La La Land\") summons the jazzy melodies and thumping rhythms of the time with a strong score. Real-life period luminaries appear onscreen (including \"SNL\" regular Chloe Fineman as starlet Marion Davies) alongside main characters based on historical figures – for example, Nellie was inspired by Clara Bow and Jack is a mix of Clark Gable and Douglas Fairbanks.\n\n\"Babylon\" nods to celluloid classics – from “Singin’ in the Rain” to “A Star Is Born” to “La Dolce Vita.” But while it tries mightily, it doesn't measure up as one itself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/04/27/cinemacon-the-fall-guy-fast-x-exorcist-strays/11749891002/", "title": "Ryan Gosling, Emily Blunt give sneak peek of 'The Fall Guy' movie", "text": "LAS VEGAS – A five-minute stunt spectacular was the CinemaCon warmup act for Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt's new action comedy \"The Fall Guy,\" though the two A-listers questioned their being the main event.\n\n\"We’re just actors,\" Gosling cracked. \"We’re paid to stand over here and take credit for that.\"\n\nAt Universal's Wednesday presentation, the stars and director David Leitch (\"Bullet Train\") debuted the first footage of \"Fall Guy\" (out March 1, 2024) to the convention for theater owners and studios.

He had a surprise, though: \"This summer is only the beginning of 'Fast X.'

They feel part of the family.\"\n\nEllen Burstyn returns in first 'The Exorcist: Believer' trailer\n\nDirector David Gordon Green and producer Jason Blum teamed up to revisit the \"Halloween\" franchise with a recent trilogy, and they're doing the same with \"The Exorcist.\" The horror film \"The Exorcist: Believer\" (in theaters Oct. 13) arrives 50 years after the original classic and – and like with Jamie Lee Curtis in the recent \"Halloween\" films – returns one of its main stars, Ellen Burstyn.\n\nLike the first film, \"Believer\" taps into the theme of \"innocence corrupted by an unspeakable evil,\" Green said. \"We tried to delve back into what it’s like for evil to take over the bodies of not one but two children.\"\n\nHe debuted the first trailer for the film, which centers on two girls being found after going missing in the woods and showing terrifying signs of possessions. The parents have no idea what to do, and one dad (Leslie Odom Jr.) reaches out to Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) since she had her own devilish experience with her daughter, Regan. And the footage teased plenty of scary stuff for old-school \"Exorcist\" fans, including a scene where one of the girls crashes a Catholic communion ceremony creepily chanting \"body and the blood\" before going full demonic.\n\nWill Ferrell and his furry 'Strays' co-star bring the laughs\n\nIn addition to premiering an extended trailer for the R-rated talking dog comedy \"Strays,\" Will Ferrell did a comedy with a Border Terrier named Sophie. The actor insisted he brought the character of Reggie to life while Sophie provided the \"physical look\": \"It mostly meant that she just shows up on set and ate hot dog slices. But look, it’s not a competition. We both worked together to create Reggie.\"\n\nThen Ferrell got faux offended when the camera operator kept getting closeups of the adorable Sophie, leading the actor to compare their IMDB credits. \"Sophie was in 'Strays' and 'Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups' – which sucked,\" he joked. \"I have three Emmys and a Mark Twain Prize, and you regularly (poop) on the sidewalk.\" That comment brought a chorus of boos. \"She does!\" Ferrell responded. \"It’s real life.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick talk 'Trolls' threequel, boy bands\n\n\"Jesus Christ, that song follows me everywhere!\" Justin Timberlake playfully exclaimed as his \"Trolls\" hit \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" played him and co-star Anna Kendrick onto the CinemaCon stage. Their third animated musical comedy \"Trolls Band Together\" (out Nov. 17) – teased by Kendrick as \"weirder, wilder, crazier and glitter-ier than ever\" – reveals that Branch (voiced by Timberlake) used to be in a popular boy band.\n\nKendrick gave Timberlake grief about his previous musical life by working 'N Sync lyrics into their banter, and the two confirmed that Branch and Kendrick's Poppy are now a couple. \"They’re out of the friend zone,\" Kendrick said, with Timberlake adding, \"It's going to get hot. Troll hot!\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/09/01/times-staffers-select-favorite-football-movies/71511220/", "title": "Times staffers select favorite football movies", "text": "TIMES STAFF REPORT\n\nThe National Football League starts its season Sept. 10, and Times staffers have picked some of our favorite football-related movies (and one special TV show we just had to include) to get you in the spirit. We promise, you don’t have to be a fan of the game to find them entertaining.\n\nLike a sports team, we had to make some cuts, and yep, some of them stung. You won’t see “The Longest Yard” (either version), “Varsity Blues” or even “Brian’s Song” here (sorry). All of the following are on DVD; we listed some streaming services with them, too.\n\nHere they are, in no particular order (and may your team have a winning season):\n\n“Remember the Titans”: You can bet that if Disney makes a movie that’s “based on a true story,” it very likely will be both good and powerful — and it’ll teach some kind of lesson.\n\nAll of this is true of 2000’s “Remember the Titans.”\n\nIt’s the story of Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), who is hired to lead a high school football team as it opens its doors — for the first time — to African-American students and athletes.\n\nAnd football is just the backdrop for the bigger social issue at the center of the movie.\n\nAs you can imagine, there are plenty of tense, hard-to-watch moments; the film is set in a time when schools in the area were segregated — and to integrate them was a concept so foreign to the kids and their parents, which is clear in their actions and words.\n\nThe film also was a steppingstone for a few of young faces who would go on to be huge Hollywood stars: Hayden Panettiere plays the spunky, tomboy daughter of Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), barking orders and showing these coaches how it’s done; Wood Harris stars as Julius Campbell, whose friendship with the team’s quarterback, Gary Bertier (Ryan Hurst), is one incredibly heartwarming bromance; and Ryan Gosling — all probably 98 pounds of him, in full uniform — is the quiet but significant Alan Bosley.\n\nIt’s no surprise here that when the players are forced to work together, they learn to depend on and respect one another — and even become friends to the point that they consider each other family.\n\nNever thought you’d get the warm fuzzies from a football movie, did you?\n\nBonus: If you’re a fan of ’70s tunes, the soundtrack packs a killer punch. Available for rental on Amazon Instant Video, VUDU and Google Play. — Times Movie Addict Melissa King\n\n“Rudy”: Even though I’m approaching a decade since I last secured a chin strap, there is a part of me that longs to take the field under the Friday night lights one more time.\n\nEvery summer throughout my high school years, I would need a source of inspiration to get me fired up about the ensuing four-hour long football practices that commenced every sweltering August.\n\nFor a blue-collar Irish Catholic like myself, there could be no stronger motivator than the 1993 film “Rudy.” Popping my brother’s VHS version into our old VCR became a preseason ritual.\n\n“Rudy” is based on Dan Ruettiger’s improbable journey as walk-on member of the Notre Dame football team in the 1970s. Sean Astin plays the undersized and overmatched “Rudy” so well you can feel every thundering shoulder pad to his ribs.\n\nRudy has a dream to play football for the Irish, but his size and academic track record make getting into the gates in South Bend almost inconceivable.\n\nHowever, his ability to persevere and buck the odds lands Rudy a spot on the practice squad with a vision to make the team and one day take the field at Notre Dame Stadium.\n\nTo quote one of my favorite lines from the movie: “Having dreams is what makes life tolerable.” I might have to upgrade and buy the DVD version; 10 years has been too long. Available on Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and VUDU. — Times sports reporter Jeffrey Haag.\n\n“Friday Night Lights”: Entertainment reporter Kate Kompas asked us to write about our favorite football movies. So of course, as a loyal “Friday Night Lights” fan, I persuaded her to let me write about the TV show, not the movie (or the book). Because every FNL fan, (that’s the cool way to refer to the show) takes every opportunity to force, encourage, beg, pester and/or cajole friends, family and strangers into watching the series.\n\nWe have our reasons. Love for FNL runs deep. You’ve probably seen social media posts complaining about how Julie Taylor (the daughter of Coach Eric Taylor) is the worst (she is!) and that we will never give up our undying love for Tim Riggins (the fullback) or Matt Saracen (the first quarterback) — who can pick? — even though the show went off the air in 2011.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nThe show, supposedly about football, uses the sport and its diehard following in Texas to explore family, growing up, disability, change, morality and even race and gender. It’s not the “special episode of the week” show either. All of these themes ebb and flow as you’d expect them to with high school relationships and small-town politics.\n\nThere’s love and sex and marriage and laughter (and even murder – a plotline we never speak of and pretend never happened). And there are fun, emotional football sequences, and an underdog you can root for. Convinced yet? Just give the first episode a try. It’s sure to surprise you. Pretty soon, you’ll feel the love, too. All five seasons streaming on Netflix; you can buy by the episode or by the season on Amazon Instant Video. Individual seasons can be bought on VUDU. Also on Google Play. — Living Greater reporter Stephanie Dickrell.\n\n“The Blind Side”: There’s a reason Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for Best Actress as Leigh Anne Tuohy in “The Blind Side:” Her performance will make you laugh, and this movie will make you cry.\n\nBut they’re tears of joy, I swear.\n\n“The Blind Side” is based on the real-life story of gentle giant Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) — don’t call him “Big Mike” — a homeless youth whose gratitude and quiet demeanor prompted Leigh Anne, husband Sean (Tim McGraw) and their kids Collins and S.J. (Lily Collins, Jae Head, respectively) to take him in.\n\nOher went on to play for the University of Mississippi and became the Baltimore Ravens’ first-round pick in the 2009 NFL draft; he currently plays for the Carolina Panthers.\n\nThe sports aspect is secondary; the movie isn’t so much about football as it is about redefining “family” and watching this kid learn to trust and feel safe — and seeing the profound effect he has on the lives of the people who gave him a chance.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nThere’s a great scene during which Leigh Ann is having lunch with her pretentious friends who think she’s doing this for charity; one friend comments that Leigh Anne is “changing that boy’s life.”\n\n“No,” she says matter-of-factly, “he’s changing mine.” Boom.\n\nBullock is fantastic as this quick, witty and smooth-talking Southern belle. She knows a thing or two about football and is street-smart to boot. Her banter with McGraw is believable and fun, and her scenes with Aaron take heartwarming to a new level. “The Blind Side” is a treat for the whole family. Available for rent on Amazon Instant Video, Google Play and VUDU. — Movie Addict Melissa King.\n\n“Jerry Maguire”: My favorite football movie is widely considered a “chick flick,” even though ESPN ranked it as the 12th best sports movie of all time. When “Jerry Maguire” came out on Dec. 11, 1996, I didn’t know what to expect when I went to go see it on a bad blind date. It was a bad date, but at least the movie turned out to be great. It turned out to be my favorite football move of all time.\n\nWriter/director Cameron Crowe managed to show the greed and selfishness that had overtaken professional sports from an agent’s perspective and make it compelling. Jerry’s (Tom Cruise) relationship with his client, fictional Cardinals receiver Rod Tidwell (Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr.), showed what a real friendship could mean when a career was on the line. Rod has Jerry’s back and Jerry eventually had his.\n\nThat was the real heart of the movie, not Jerry’s relationship with Renee Zellweger’s Dorothy Boyd. The movie has some of the most quotable lines in the history of cinema and Gooding makes you believe he could actually play in the NFL.\n\n“Jerry Maguire” is more about a great bromance than anything else. A four-year, $11.2 million contract never felt so good. Streaming on Amazon Prime, Google Play and Netflix. Can rent on VUDU. — Times sports reporter Andy Rennecke.\n\nStory continues below.\n\n“From Elway to Marino”: I’m cheating a little here, because this is technically TV, too, but I’m considering it a documentary film — and it’s an excellent one.\n\nI’m a proud, near-lifelong Chicago Bears fan, but I enjoy watching the games (well, not last season’s) and typically couldn’t care less about the details of forming a team. You won’t catch me watching much of any draft day.\n\nBut “From Elway to Marino” makes every detail of the 1983 NFL Draft fascinating, and the people interviewed are extremely candid. (It probably helps that more than 20 years have passed, right?) Like the title flat-out says, the movie follows every selection in that draft, from the Denver Broncos’ No. 1 pick to the Miami Dolphins’ 27 pick (Marino, the future Hall of Fame quarterback, was indeed dead-last after a rough senior season and some rumors that he partied way too hard).\n\nOf course, both men went on to have incredible careers, although only one won a Super Bowl (two in fact). Still, I learned many things (George Steinbrenner was apparently really interested in John Elway for the New York Yankees?!), and the movie takes the viewer inside one of the most high-priced, delicate dances in pro sports. Streaming on Netflix; you can buy the film on Amazon Instant Video. — Arts and entertainment reporter Kate Kompas.\n\n“The Replacements”: Even if you don’t like football (but how can you not?), “The Replacements” is such a fun movie.\n\nThe story involves the owners of the fictitious Washington Sentinels football team filling the squad with scrubs during a strike, hoping to finish the season strong and have a shot at the playoffs.\n\nAnd it’s up to Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to assemble and coach a “team of poor nobodies who play to win, not a bunch of bitchy millionaires.”\n\nAmen, brother.\n\nEveryone loves an underdog, and “The Replacements” is full of ’em. It’s the gridiron version of the Island of Misfit Toys.\n\nThere’s maniacal SWAT team officer Daniel Bateman (Jon Favreau), who’s pain infliction meter is always on; Clifford Franklin (Orlando Jones), “the fastest S.O.B.” who’s unfortunately a bit of a fumble-fingers; the gambling, chain-smoking, “wiry”(spoken only with a Welsh accent, thank you) Nigel Gruff (Rhys Ifans), nicknamed “The Leg” for his ability to kick a soccer ball the entire length of the field; not-even-ex-convict Earl Wilkinson (Michael Jace), whose orange D.O.C. jumpsuit doesn’t stand for District of Columbia; an athletically gifted and deaf tight end Brian Murphy (David Denman — yep, Roy from “The Office”); and the “never-was” quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), whose biggest claim to fame is a disastrous Sugar Bowl performance that no one can forget.\n\nYou wonder how these guys can possibly work together; the chemistry between them is great, though, whether they’re jelling with or jarring at one another. And there are so many differing personalities that it makes for a fun — sometimes volatile — mix.\n\n“The Replacements” is infused with catchy tunes (good luck getting Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” out of your head — not that you’d necessarily want to) and music montages, so there’s seemingly never a dull moment.\n\nReeves looks the part, right from his close-up, slow-motion jaunt onto the field for the very first time. And that slow-motion technique is used a lot, but it effectively creates drama and keeps the audience rooting for these guys.\n\nIt’s “another shot for some; a last shot for others,” and it’s the perfect flick to get you pumped for the season. — Times Movie Addict Melissa King\n\nWhat movie did we leave off that deserves to be here?

Finland awaits the winner.\n\nEnd of second: USA 2, Czechia 1\n\nThat was a tightly played period, with U.S. and Czech players playing strong defensive hockey and limiting chances. The USA took advantage of an abbreviated power play to score on a Cole Eiserman one-timer. Czech goalie Michael Hrabal slid over to stop Cole Hutson in the final minute. Shots were 7-7.\n\nUSA-Czechia score: Cole Eiserman puts USA ahead\n\nTrevor Connelly darts into the offensive zone and feeds Cole Eiserman, who scores on a one-timer at 13:41 for a 2-1 lead.

Boston College's Gabe Perreault, the linemate of Leonard and Hagens, has seven points. The United States has the second-best power play at the tournament.\n\nCzechia: Czechia won bronze last year. Forwards Eduard Sale and Jacob Stancl are tied for the team lead with five goals. Sale, a Seattle Kraken first-round pick who plays in the American Hockey League, has two game-winners. Stancl and Vojtech Hradec have a team-high eight points. Czechia has a slightly better penalty kill than the USA.\n\nSweden vs. Finland: What to know\n\nSweden: Sweden won silver last year. Defenseman Axel Sandin-Pellika, a Detroit Red Wings first-round pick, is the tournament's top remaining scorer with nine points. He and forward Anton Wahlberg have four goals. Victor Eklund, the brother of the San Jose Sharks' William Eklund, is eligible for the 2025 draft.

By the appointed hour, each and every player had said she would not play.\n\nMORE HOCKEY COVERAGE:\n\nGary Bettman: Assume NHL players not going to Olympics\n\nHenrik Zetterberg, seven other NHL players whose seasons are flying under the radar\n\nDave Ogrean, USA Hockey’s executive director, threw down the gauntlet, telling USA TODAY Sports that his organization had a “Plan B” for the boycott, meaning it would field a team of replacement players at the world championship in Plymouth, Mich.\n\nWell, the deadline came and went. There is no replacement team. USA Hockey is adjusting the training schedule for the world championship in a manner that clearly indicates it expects its real team to be playing. And negotiations with the players are ongoing.\n\nThe takeaway is quite simple: USA Hockey blinked. The women won.\n\nWhat the terms of their new deal will be are still unknown, but they’ll undoubtedly be better than the stunningly awful equivalent of $1,500 per year each player now receives from USA Hockey. You read that right: $1,500 a year.\n\nThis is an organization that brought in revenue of $41.9 million in 2014, according to its tax return. You read that right too.\n\nIt’s natural to wonder how this compares with what other national governing bodies give their athletes. Here’s the answer in a nutshell: Not well.\n\nU.S. Figure Skating, with revenue of $17.9 million in 2014, pays its elite athletes more than $50,000 a year, and that’s just the beginning. Skating shows, personal appearances and endorsement deals, often put together with the help of USFS, give top U.S. skaters income of well over $100,000 per year.\n\nHow about tiny U.S. Biathlon? Its 2014 revenue was $2.3 million, which makes it hard to give athletes much of anything. But here’s what President and CEO Max Cobb did:\n\nAs part of a sponsorship agreement with the financial services firm State Street from 2014-16, Cobb carved out $90,000 for the NGB’s top performers over those three years, $30,000 per year. The first year, he gave elite athletes Susan Dunklee and Lowell Bailey $15,000 each. The next two years, Dunklee and Bailey were joined by Tim Burke in receiving $10,000 per year.\n\n“We try and do as many of those collaborative sponsorship deals as we can,” Cobb said Wednesday. “Keeping talented athletes who have medal-winning potential is job one for us.”\n\nThe strategy paid off last month when Bailey won the nation’s first-ever world championship gold medal and Dunklee became the first American woman to win a world championship medal.\n\nSo, has USA Hockey cobbled together anything like that for its women’s hockey players?\n\n“No,” said player agent Brant Feldman. “I had (four-time Olympian) Julie Chu last Olympics and she had eight endorsement deals. None were with a USA Hockey sponsor at the time we did the deal.”\n\nThis lack of innovation – or blatant lack of interest – in paying and promoting the U.S. women’s national hockey team is confounding. This has been one of the country’s most successful national teams over the past two decades, never having left an Olympic Games without a medal, while also winning seven of the last nine world championships.\n\nYet the disrespect this team receives from the men who run USA Hockey is palpable. When the governing body unveiled the 2014 Olympic jerseys to be worn by the men’s and women’s teams, something was missing — mention of the Olympic gold medal won by the women. Written on the right sleeve were the years “1960” and “1980,” the two times the U.S. men have famously won the Olympic gold medal. Conspicuously absent was “1998,” the year the U.S. women won the Olympic gold medal.\n\nTo this day, USA Hockey continues to sell jerseys without “1998” on the sleeve.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/19/us-womens-hockey-team-tops-finland-advances-final/350285002/", "title": "Winter Olympics: USA, Canada to clash for gold medal in women's ..."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2018/02/22/u-s-womens-hockey-gold-medal-came-great-olympic-game-made-even-greater-statement/362168002/", "title": "2018 Winter Olympics: U.S. hockey team wins a gold medal for the ...", "text": "GANGNEUNG, South Korea – Wake up, America. There’s great news waiting for you. While you were sleeping, something magical happened in a hockey game at the Olympics. If you don’t have the time to watch the game on replay, at least watch the shootout. Look at the GIFs on social media. Do something. You just have to see this.\n\nIn one of the most satisfying moments in U.S. Olympic history, in one of the most spirited rivalries in all of sports, in the midst of a bitter 20-year gold-medal drought, the U.S. women’s hockey team defeated Canada 3-2 in a game that grew more enticing by the minute as it moved from regulation to overtime to a shootout that needed even more shots to settle things, with a U.S. goal for the ages, followed by a save to match.\n\nIt was fitting that the greatest game in U.S. women’s hockey history would take place on the 38th anniversary of the greatest game in U.S. men’s hockey history (and the best upset in any sport, ever), the 1980 Miracle on Ice victory over the Soviet Union in Lake Placid.\n\nAnd it was the happy ending to an 11-month-long story that is as much about American culture as it is about sports. This is the team that boycotted its world championships last spring in an admirable and courageous pay equity battle with its national governing body. When USA Hockey’s leaders backed down, the women on this team came back in time for the worlds, which they won for the seventh time out of the last eight.\n\nThink about it: Before the equal pay conversation began in Hollywood, or anywhere else around the country, this team had already fought its own battle, and won.\n\nThese girls next door in hockey skates rode into these Games with that landmark victory at their backs and one singular purpose in their minds: to finally win the Olympic gold medal that had eluded this team since the inaugural women’s hockey tournament at the 1998 Nagano Olympics.\n\nEvery Olympic hockey tournament since, Canada won, beating the Americans in all but one of those gold-medal matches: 2002, 2006, 2010 and, finally 2014, that crushing loss in Sochi in which the Americans squandered a late lead and then lost in overtime.\n\nThere was no doubting the balance of this rivalry, but when they came to the Olympics, there was no balance at all. It was all Canada, with a generation of great U.S. players relegated to nothing but silver.\n\nWith that overture, even before the puck dropped Thursday and the first second ticked off the clock, there was an anticipation of nothing but greatness on the ice at the Gangneung Hockey Centre.\n\nAnd then the game started, and it was better than anyone dreamed. Women’s hockey hasn’t caught on as a spectator sport in most parts of the United States, and perhaps it never will, but this was as riveting a game as will be played in any sport anywhere this year. That’s a guarantee.\n\nThe U.S. went ahead, 1-0, late in the first period. Canada stormed back to take a 2-1 lead in the second. The Americans tied it with little more than six minutes remaining in the game. Then came a free-wheeling overtime. Still tied. And then the shootout.\n\nThat shootout! Many despise the idea that a great game ends that way in hockey, and soccer too, but if there’s anything more dramatic in sports, please let me know.\n\nThe Americans were on their way after 20-year-old goalie Maddie Rooney’s initial save, although the Canadians tied it up, sending the shootout into more shootouts.\n\nWith these two teams, it might have gone on forever. But no. Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, a 28-year-old veteran playing in her third Olympics, faked once, twice, three times before slipping the puck into the right side of the net past the sprawling, falling Canadian goalie Shannon Szabados.\n\nThen, when Rooney stuffed Canada’s Meghan Agosta, giving the moving puck one last swipe out of harm’s way, it was over. A celebration 20 years in the making came in pieces: bodies diving, gloves flying, flags waving.\n\n“The greatest day of all of our lives,” said U.S. captain Meghan Duggan.\n\n“I’m so happy. Just take a picture of my face,” said 30-year-old veteran Gigi Marvin.\n\nAs is often the case with women’s sports, especially U.S. women’s national teams, there was more at play than just the game. As Marvin said, “My niece is going to wake up tomorrow and see this and it’s going to be more important for her than it is for me.”\n\nWith those cultural overtones as a backdrop, and the heart-stopping shootout as the punctuation mark, it all seemed so familiar. Who wasn’t taken back to 1999, to the Women’s World Cup, to that U.S. soccer team, to a touchstone moment for a generation of young girls who have now grown up to be women who will never forget what that meant to them?\n\nAnd so it was fitting that one of those stars from 1999, Julie Foudy, now working here for ESPN, was in the press tribune, one eye on the ice, the other following a texting chain with a handful of her teammates throughout the game.\n\nOne of them was Brandi Chastain, who famously made the winning penalty kick in the Rose Bowl nearly 19 years ago.\n\n“Brandi was getting emotional,” Foudy said. “She kept saying, ‘I can’t handle this. This is crazy.’”\n\nSoon, there were so many texts that Foudy told them all she would get back to everyone later.\n\nAnother U.S. women's team had become another wonderful story, and it was time for her to get to work.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2023/04/16/usa-wins-world-championships-hilary-knight-hat-trick-canada/11679413002/", "title": "USA wins world championships vs. Canada on Hilary Knight hat trick", "text": "There could not have been a more poetic way for Hilary Knight to score her 100th point for Team USA.\n\nThe hat trick helped, too.\n\nWith less than four minutes remaining in the final of the 2023 women's world championship against rival Canada, Knight reared a slap shot from the top of the slot that snuck past netminder Ann-Renée Desbiens. The goal moved the U.S. women's hockey team ahead of Canada for the first time, and the Americans poured in two more goals over the final 3:10 to win gold 6-3 in Brampton, Ontario, their first major tournament (world championships or Olympics) victory since 2019.\n\nThe U.S. tied the game on three occasions without taking the lead, until Knight's clutch goal that came with a two-skater advantage. She earned her hat trick 27 seconds later with the U.S. on the power play, and Cayla Barnes added an empty netter with 1:58 remaining.\n\nFor Knight, it was her third game-winner in a women's world championship contest (2011, 2017).\n\nFor the U.S., the victory provided revenge over Canada, which had won the last three world championships dating to 2021 and won gold at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, defeating the U.S. in that final. There wasn't a world championships in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCaroline Harvey, the youngest player on the 2022 Olympic squad, equalized the game at three in the third period by creeping from the left point to the slot and firing in a wrister. It was Harvey's fourth goal of the tournament, in which she led all skaters with 14 points total, one ahead of Finland's Petra Nieminen. Knight finished tied for third with teammate Taylor Heise (12 points apiece).\n\nHarvey, who was essentially being benched for the medal rounds in Beijing, topped all U.S. skaters in ice time on Sunday (23:35).\n\nThe preliminary matchup between the two teams in the first round went to a shootout that took nine rounds to decide a winner, with Canada besting the U.S.\n\nA similarly even matchup ensued in the final, with Canada taking the lead on a 5-on-3 goal by Marie-Philip Poulin. Abbey Murphy drew the U.S. even with a drag move on a fast break that beat Desbiens (16 saves).\n\nU.S. goaltender Aerin Frankel saved 24 shots on 27 attempts.\n\nKnight finished with seven shots on goal in 21:21 ice time. Amanda Kessel (two assists) provided the nifty feed for Knight to score her first goal of the game between a pair of second-period tallies for Canadian forward Brianne Jenner, who gave Canada 2-1 and 3-2 leads, respectively.\n\nThe U.S. led when the final horn blew, however, finishing the championships with 43 total goals and a shiny new championship.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/01/paris-olympics-live-updates-results/74190713007/", "title": "Paris Olympics highlights: Biles wins gold, Ledecky make history", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nTeam USA had a huge gold-medal day Thursday at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nSimone Biles and American teammate Suni Lee competed in the women’s gymnastics all-around final, and it led to an exhilarating finish that ended with Biles securing the gold medal and Lee earning a bronze.\n\nThe Olympic swimming schedule featured four finals, including Katie Ledecky back in the pool for Team USA in the women's 4x200-meter free relay. While Australia swam to gold, the U.S. women took silver – and Ledecky made Olympic history in the process. But Team USA did not leave the Olympic pool Thursday without hearing the national anthem.

Defay advances to the semifinals and will next face American Caroline Marks, the last American – woman or man – remaining in the surfing competition being held in Teahupoʻo on the southeastern coast of the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia.\n\nThis will be the last competition for Moore, the decorated surfer out of Hawaii. She plans to step away from surfing and focus on starting a family. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOlympic surfing: American Caroline Marks advances to women’s semifinals\n\nThe U.S. will have at least one surfer in the women’s semifinals after Caroline Marks won her quarterfinal matchup against Tyler Wright of Australia. Olympic surfing is being held in Teahupoʻo on the southeastern coast of the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia.\n\nThe two surfers had solid best waves in the first half of the matchup, with Marks having just a slight lead. But in the second half, Marks was able to keep up her performance, while Wright struggled to get a spectacular wave to propel her to first. Marks won by more than two points.\n\nMarks' win means thre could be an American vs. American semifinal. She’ll await the winner of the quarerfinal between teammate Carissa Moore and France’s Johanne Defay. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nU.S. men’s 3x3 basketball team stunned, still seeking first win\n\nThe American men’s 3x3 basketball team has hit a new low.\n\nThe U.S. team was two points away from victory against 2020 Olympics gold winner Latvia, but the defending gold medalist went on a 6-0 run to win 21-19 and provide another devastating loss to Team USA. The U.S. team was up 19-15 with two minutes left, but Latvia completed the comeback in the next 100 seconds as Team USA missed its final four shot attempts.\n\nIt was a golden chance for the team to pick up momentum as it has an uphill battle to make the knockout round. The loss keeps the U.S. as the only winless team at 0-4. In last place out of eight teams, the top six teams advance to knockout play, and Team USA will likely need to win its final three games to advance.

Not the 75-minute delay at the most pivotal point in the match when they had battled back from one set down. And definitely not any of the three teams they played during pool play to open the Games.\n\nNuss and Kloth are now off to the Round of 16 unblemished following an eventful three-set victory over China’s Xinyi Xia and Chen Xue – a gritty, come-from-behind victory for the young Americans with LeBron James in the stands. (“King James” did indeed wait out the weather.)\n\nAfter dropping the first set 21-15, the U.S. won the last two sets, 21-16, 15-12.\n\nOfficials called the match temporarily at 3-2 in the third. The teams traded points to 9-9 when a Chinese error gave the Americans a 10-9 lead. Nuss put it away for the final point of the game to complete the comeback.\n\nKloth had 21 attack points and recorded two blocks. Nuss had 11 digs and 14 attack points.\n\nIn the first set, the Americans could not find their footing and trailed 13-8 at the first timeout. China went on another 3-1 run to up the lead. An ace to make it 18-13 sealed the set and China took it 21-15. f\n\nIn the second, Nuss started running around like a Tasmanian devil in human form and mostly refused to let the ball hit the ground. She started feeling herself with the celebrations as the U.S. raced out to a 17-12 lead and secured the set, 21-16 – but not before China cut the deficit to two. Nuss drilled an ace to thwart any threat of a Chinese comeback in the frame.\n\nThe crowd began reacting with screams of “U” on the first hit, “S” on the second bump and “A” on the knock over the net.\n\nThen the rain started to fall. Lightning struck in the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Play continued. Nuss and Kloth only became stronger with the elements.\n\nThat was until the match was postponed. But it didn’t matter. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nOlympic golf: Tokyo gold medalist Xander Schauffele remains in winning form\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – The last time Xander Schauffele teed it up in an Olympics, he won a gold medal for Team USA. But it says something about how special Thursday was that Schauffele walked of the golf course saying, “It feels like I’m here (in the Olympics) for the first time.”\n\n“For me, Tokyo was really special, obviously. But there were no fans,” said Schauffele, referencing the games of three years ago defined by COVID-19 restrictions. “The city was closed. I was stuck in my hotel room. … (This) was an awesome atmosphere.”\n\nSchauffele, fresh off major victories at The PGA Championship and The Open Championship, is enjoying a bit of a moment right now. When those happen, you can shoot a 6-under-par 65 in the opening round of the Paris Olympics – and be 5 under at the turn – and then afterward bemoan your “clanky start.”\n\nYou could say that Schauffele stole the show Thursday, along with Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama (8 under), the lone player ahead of him entering Round 2. — Gentry Estes\n\nOlympic beach volleyball: Thunderstorms halt U.S. pair's match as crowds seek sheleter\n\nPARIS – The USA women’s beach volleyball team of Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth were in the beginning of the third set of their match against China’s Xinyi Xia and Chen Xue when severe weather forced everybody to shelter.\n\nLeading 3-2 in the decisive game (to 15 points), officials called the match despite the players forging through rain and lightning in the distance – the lightning as the background, the Eiffel Tower being the foreground for the Thursday evening, pro-U.S. crowd.\n\nBut as the storm approached over Eiffel Tower Stadium, heavy, cold rain, along with continued lightning and booms of thunder, sent the masses scattering.\n\nThe match is expected to resume at some point but that might be a while. China took the first set, 21-15, while Nuss and Kloth stormed back in the second to take it 21-16.\n\nThe start of the U.S. men's 3x3 basketball match vs. Latvia was also delayed because of the storm. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nU.S. women's basketball team wins again, unbeaten in Olympic Games since 1992\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team continued their road to another Olympic gold medal today against Belgium in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games group stage.

Wilson could very well be on pace for tournament MVP, should the United States win their eighth straight gold medal.\n\nBelgium entered the Olympics as Team USA's biggest threat in Group C as FIBA ranks Belgium No. 6 in the world. But they lost the first matchup of group play to Germany 83-69.

You remember, right? He won the 2023 U.S. Open. Earlier this year, he shot a 60 to win a shortened event at Pebble Beach. He was second at Bay Hill, tied for second at The Players.\n\nClark has demonstrated why he deserved to be one of only four Americans who qualified for these Paris Olympics.\n\nHe just hasn’t shown it lately.\n\nAnd that includes Thursday’s Olympics first round at Le Golf National. While most of the 60-player field took advantage of ideal scoring conditions on Day 1, Clark opened with a 4-over 75. His first three holes: bogey, double bogey, bogey. Though he stabilized from there, he closed with another double on No. 15.\n\nClark is tied for 56th, one stroke above dead last. He's one of only 13 players over par. Were there a cut in this tournament, he’d surely miss it. Unless Clark gets real hot, real fast – Pebble Beach-style – the number of Americans golfers in realistic medal contention at these Olympics is already down from four to three. — Gentry Estes\n\nUSA women’s 3x3 basketball team finally wins after opening 0-3\n\nFinally, a Team USA 3x3 basketball team won at the Paris Olympics.\n\nIn its fourth game in Paris, the U.S. women became the first to snap a streak of six total winless efforts between themselves and the equally floundering men's team. They defeated Spain, 17-11, on Thursday.\n\nHailey van Lith and Rhyne Howard each scored five points (and one two-pointer apiece) in the victory. The team has two more games in pool play before the knockout stage begins. And if they don’t figure it out soon, they won’t last long once that begins.\n\nHoward finally showed some of her shooting capabilities by drilling four two-pointers on six attempts from deep to keep the U.S. in the game. The Americans pulled away in the final minute to secure the all-important first win with one more game to play before the knockout round begins. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nKatie Ledecky makes history as Team USA 4x200 relay squad secures silver\n\nHistory in the pool: Australia wins gold in the women’s 4x200 freestyle relay.

Kiefer beat Scruggs in the individual final, 15-6, marking the first time the country has gone 1-2 in the sport in the Olympics. – Dave Birkett\n\nKate Douglass wins 200-meter breastsroke final, sets American record\n\nNANTERRE, France — Team USA’s Kate Douglass is officially an Olympic champion, winning the women’s 200-meter breaststroke final Thursday with a time of 2:19. 24 – a new American record.\n\nIt’s the 22-year-old two-time Olympian’s third medal overall and second at the Paris Olympics after winning silver in the women’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay.\n\nDouglass out-touched defending Olympic champion Tatjana Smith of South Africa, who won silver with a time of 2:19.60.

The dream still was alive with the score in the third set against Marin locked at 15-15.\n\nAlas, Zhang she noted Marin’s experience in high-stakes matches when asked about the final outcome of their badminton battle. – Josh Peter\n\nNovak Djokovic dealing with knee injury in matchup vs. Tsitsipas\n\nSerbia's Novak Djokovic is aiming to win his second Olympic medal, but he may have to fight through an injury to get there.\n\nDuring his matchup with Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, trainers took a look at Djokovic's surgically repaired knee. Djokovic did not withdraw, and headed to a third set vs. Tsitsipas.\n\nHow high can Simone Biles jump?\n\nAt the U.S. Olympic Trials in June, the top of Biles’ head got as high as 12 feet above the surface on one of the jumps during her floor exercise routine, NBC Sports calculated.\n\nJust like Simone Biles flying through the air on vault, NBC’s viewership numbers for the women’s gymnastics team final at the Paris Olympics were through the roof.\n\nNBC’s live daytime broadcast of the women’s gymnastics team final averaged 12.7 million viewers across NBC and Peacock, marking the event as one of the network’s top weekday daytime events in Olympic history.\n\nThis meant that more people tuned in live to watch Team USA’s gold medal-winning performance than for any single game of the 2024 NBA Finals or the first round of the 2024 NFL draft. – Carrie McDonald\n\nPair of U.S. boxers defeated\n\nAmerican boxers Jennifer Lozano and Morelle McCane both missed out on opportunities to advance for medals on Thursday.\n\nLozano (50kg) fell to Finnish fighter Pihla Kaivo-Oja, who won the fight on judge's scorecards in all three rounds.\n\nIn the women's 66kg division, McCane faced Uzbekistan's Navbakhor Khamidova. Judges awarded the fight to Khamidova on a 3-2 split decision.\n\nTeam USA men's 3x3 basketball loses third straight to open group play\n\nPARIS — The U.S. men’s basketball 3x3 team cannot get off the schneid.\n\nWithout Jimmer Fredette, who is dealing with a right leg injury that prevented him from playing, the U.S. lost its third straight game to open pool play of the Olympics, as Lithuania pulled away late from the U.S. to win 20-18.\n\nCanyon Barry picked up the slack in Fredette’s stead and had nine points. Kareem Maddox finished with five. Barry had a chance to tie it at the buzzer following a defensive stop but his attempt from 2-point land clanked off the front rim.\n\nFans clapped for Fredette as the in-house emcees noted his absence from the contest. – Chris Bumbaca\n\nTeam USA women's field hockey squad remains winless\n\nIt's not the trip to Paris that the U.S. women's field hockey team envisioned.\n\nThrough four matches in Pool B, Team USA is still search for its first victory after losing 5-2 to Great Britain on Thursday.\n\nThe Americans were tight at the half, trailing a goal to Great Britain, but a dominant second half by the Brits put the game away.\n\nThe U.S. is in fifth place in Pool B and close out group play on Saturday, Aug. 3 at 1:15 p.m. vs. South Africa, who is also winless.\n\nJake Paul, an honorary coach of the U.S. Olympic boxing team, sounded off on Thursday.\n\nPaul, the social media influencer and pro boxer, joined a chorus of objectors following an Olympic women’s boxing match that included an Algerian fighter whose gender eligibility has come under question.\n\nThe Algerian, Imane Khelif, won her opening bout Thursday after landing a single punch – on the nose of Italy’s Angela Carini.\n\nSoon after, Carini quit − 46 seconds into the bout. She wept in the ring and during interviews with reporters.\n\n“This is sickening,’’ Paul wrote on his verified X account. \"This is a travesty. Doesn’t matter what you believe. This is wrong and dangerous.’’ – Josh Peter\n\nTeam USA men's beach volleyball squad makes coaching change\n\nAmidst their quest for a medal, the men's beach volleyball squad of Miles Partain and Andy Benesh have decided to make a coaching change, dismissing bench boss Mike Plasek on Thursday.\n\nThe decision was somewhat surprising.\n\n“There was a team meeting and a team decision to not move forward with their coach,” NBC beach volleyball broadcaster Dain Blanton reported during the opening set of the match. – Mark Giannotto\n\nSimone Biles goes for gold in women's gymnastics all-around final\n\nSimone Biles is looking to extend her Olympic gymnastics record medal count on Thursday when she competes in the gymnastics all-around final. USA TODAY Sports is providing live updates, highlights and more from the events.\n\nOlympic golf: Play again suspended due to lightning\n\nAfter a brief restart of play in Round 1, the Olympic golf tournament was again halted due to lightning in the area. Rain has played into the blueprint for Thursday's Games, with drizzles expected to hit the area until early evening.\n\nOlympic golf: Play resumes after brief weather stoppage\n\nAfter lightning halted Round 1 of the Olympic golf tourney, play resumed at 11:05 a.m. ET (5:05 p.m. local). Xander Schauffele looks to finish his round strong as the top American on the leaderboard.\n\nOlympic golf: Lightning suspends first round of play\n\nThe threat of lightning has suspended the first round of play in the 2024 Olympic golf tournament. At the time of suspension, Japan's Hideki Matsuyama sat at the top of the heap at 8-under. American Xander Schauffele and Mexican Carlos Ortiz are tied at 2-under.\n\nU.S. men's doubles tennis to play for gold\n\nDespite the quick turnaround from their men's doubles win over Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal, the American team of Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek cruised through their semifinal Thursday afternoon and will play for a gold medal.\n\nRam/Krajicek defeated Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlasek of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-2, needing only 61 minutes to get the job done.\n\nRam and Krajicek are two of the most accomplished doubles players in the world, who prepared for the Paris Olympics by playing together in Davis Cup competitions the last two years.\n\nRam, 40, won a silver medal in Rio eight years ago in the mixed doubles alongside Venus Williams. He has won four Grand Slam titles in men's doubles.\n\nKrajicek, 34, was ranked No. 1 for a time last year after winning the French Open doubles, his first major.\n\nInterestingly, it could be an All-American final if Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul beat Andy Murray and Dan Evans of Great Britain later Thursday afternoon.\n\nThis is the last professional tournament for Murray, a two-time gold medalist in singles and three-time Grand Slam champion, who has struggled with injuries for several years. – Dan Wolken\n\nAmericans off to strong start in Olympic golf\n\nAmericans Xander Schauffele and Scottie Scheffler are off to good starts in the first round of Olympic golf at Golf National in Paris. Schauffle, who won the 2024 PGA Championship and 2024 British Open, trails Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (-8) by one stroke through 14 holes.\n\nMeanwhile, Scheffler, the World's No. 1 golfer and 2024 Masters champion, carded a -4 and currently sits tied for 10th place.\n\nThe 60 contenders will all play four rounds in a stroke play format, with the medalists taking the fewest number of shots to complete the 72 holes.\n\nPARIS — The queen of Roland Garros was dethroned Thursday in the Olympic semifinals – by a different kind of queen.\n\nNo. 6 Qinwen Zheng – or QUEEN-wen, as she enjoys being called around the WTA Tour – took out No. 1 Iga Swiatek, 6-2, 7-5, in a stunner that will give China a chance to win its first gold medal in tennis on Saturday.\n\nSwiatek, a four-time French Open champion at this venue, hadn't lost a match at Roland Garros since the 2021 quarterfinals. She came into the Olympics as a massive favorite, but perhaps felt a different kind of pressure trying to win gold for Poland, her home country.\n\nInstead, she'll have to settle at best for the bronze medal.\n\nZheng will play either Donna Vekic of Croatia or Anna-Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia for the gold medal. − Dan Wolken\n\nMichael Phelps leading Team U-S-A chants at Olympic golf\n\nMichael Phelps, who is serving as a commentator for NBC during the Games, is taking in the first round of Olympic golf at Golf National in Paris. The a 23-time gold medalist is at the first tee cheering on the Americans in front of a raucous crowd.\n\nIf you recall, Phelps and rapper Snoop Dogg, who's also a commentator for NBC, entered the pool in a segment on Tuesday.\n\nSmith, Bacon advance to semis in women's 200m backstroke\n\nPARIS - American swimmers Regan Smith and Phoebe Bacon advanced to the semifinals of the women's 200-meter backstroke early Thursday morning at Paris La Defense Arena.\n\nBacon, in her first race of the Paris 2024 Olympics, finished fourth in a time of 2:09. Smith (2:09.61) was sixth.\n\nThe top 16 racers move on to the semis. − Dave Birkett\n\nWorld No. 1 women's archer upset\n\nWorld No. 1 archer Casey Kaufhold of the United States was upset 7-3 by Lei Chien-Ying of Taiwan on Thursday, knocking Kaufhold out of the women's individual archery competition in the second round.\n\nKaufhold's opponent shot three perfect 10s in the final set to slam the door on Kaufhold's individual medal hopes in the 20-year-old's second Olympics.\n\nShe still has a shot for a medal alongside Team USA's Brady Ellison in the mixed competition on Friday. − Gentry Estes\n\nPARIS – So far, not a good start for the reigning champion 3x3 women’s basketball team. Not good at all.\n\nThe Americans dropped their third straight game to open pool play at the tournament, this one a 17-15 loss to Australia on Thursday. The team has two more games in pool play before the knockout stage begins. And if they don’t figure it out soon, they won’t last long once that begins.\n\nNow it’s back to the drawing board – again – for the USA. Frustrations are mounting.\n\n“Everybody’s got the same refs,” Cierra Burdick said. “I don’t worry about things that are out of my control. Some people get good calls, some people get bad calls, that’s basketball.”\n\nAfter the opening loss to Germany two days ago, Hailey van Lith said the team’s intensity needed to improve.\n\n“I think the effort was a little bit better,” Burdick said. “But we got to find another gear to tap into. Because we’re not getting it done.”\n\nThe improvement would come during group play, the Americans have been saying. But for Burdick, it hasn’t come quickly enough.\n\n“I think we’re getting a little bit better, but not at the pace that I’d like,” she said. “But we gotta find our way.” − Chris Bumbaca\n\nPARIS – Algeria's Imane Khelif, one of two female Olympic boxers disqualified from the 2023 world championships after failing gender eligibility tests, entered the ring Thursday at the Paris Games.\n\nIt ended in abrupt and bizarre fashion.\n\nKhelif prevailed when Italy’s Angela Carini stopped fighting 46 seconds into the bout. The fight in the welterweight division at 66 kg (146 pounds) was scheduled for three three-minute rounds.\n\nThe issue of gender eligibility criteria surfaced at the 2023 world championships when Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan both won medals in the women’s competition before tournament officials announced the boxers had failed gender eligibility tests. They were stripped of their medals. − Josh Peter\n\nTeam USA advances to the semis in women's team foil\n\nPARIS - Lee Kiefer is going for gold again, and this time she's bringing the rest of the U.S. women's foil team with her.\n\nKiefer, who beat teammate Lauren Scruggs for gold in individual foil on Sunday, and Team USA advanced to the semifinals in women's team foil Thursday with a 45-37 win over China in its table of eight match.\n\nThe U.S. women will face the winner of Canada-France in its semifinal match. Italy and Japan meet in the other semifinal.\n\nKiefer has won gold in individual foil at the past two Olympics, while Scruggs, a 21-year-old student at Harvard, won her first Olympic medal Sunday.\n\nJacqueline Dubrovich, a two-time Olympian, is the third member of the foil team. −Dave Birkett\n\nVAIRES-SUR-MARNE, France − Team USA rowers Nick Mead, Justin Best, Michael Grady and Liam Corrigan won a gold medal Thursday at the Paris Olympics in the finals of the men's four competition. With Mead in the bow position and Corrigan at the stroke, the group recorded a time of 5:49:03.\n\nThe gold is the first for the USA in the men's fours since the Olympic Games Rome 1960. − Chase Goodbread\n\nUSA's Brady Ellison advances to archery round of 16\n\nBrady Ellison, the lone U.S. men's archer in these Olympics, won two head-to-head matches Thursday morning to advance to the round of 16 of the individual competition. Ellison defeated Abdullah Yildirmis of Turkey 6-2 in the first round and Kao Wenchao of China by the same score in the second round. The final four rounds of the men's archery competition will play out Sunday.\n\nA five-time Olympian, Ellison has long been considered one of the world’s best. He has three medals in his past − but no gold medals.\n\nMen's 50-meter rifle results\n\nLiu Yukun extended China's gold medal lead by winning the men's 50-meter rifle 3 positions event, with a total score of 463.6. Serhiy Kulish secured Ukraine's second medal of these Games, claiming silver with a score of 461.3. India's Swapnil Kusale took the bronze with a score of 451.4.\n\nOlympic track predictions\n\nWho will be the big winners in track and field at the Paris Olympics? USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon predicts the podium for every event.\n\nMen's race walk results\n\nIt's quite early in the United States, but medals are already being awarded in Paris.\n\nBrian Daniel Pintado of Ecuador won the gold medal in the men's 20K race walk, crossing the line first with a time of 1:18:55.

The team lost to their oldest rival, Team USA, in a penalty shootout in the gold medal match at PyeongChang 2018, ending their winning streak of four consecutive Winter Games gold medals.\n\nBut in Beijing at the 2022 Winter Games, they finally had their opportunity to make amends, and they seized the moment.\n\nIt was nervy and exciting, but finally Canada held on to secure a 3-2 victory in the final as they saw a 3-0 lead evaporate under late pressure from Team USA.\n\nAs the final buzzer sounded, Canadian players erupted into cheers of celebration, some broke into tears and bundled together into a group hug.\n\n“It’s just so good. It’s a great feeling,” Canadian forward Marie-Philip Poulin, who scored two goals in the final, said. “It was one hell of an effort. This is redemption.”\n\n(Left to right) Sarah Fillier, Jill Saulnier, Renata Fast and Melodie Daoust celebrate with their gold medals after beating Team USA. Elsa/Getty Images\n\nTicking down\n\nNot that they needed the extra motivation, but Canada women’s ice hockey general manager Gina Kingsbury had an innovative way to help her players build up to the 2022 Winter Games.\n\nKingsbury, a two-time Olympic champion as a player, gave each member of the Canadian women’s team a clock which counted down the days and hours to the Beijing 2022 Opening Ceremony after Canada finished third in the 2019 World Championships.\n\nThe clock’s purpose was to focus the Canadian players, and it came particularly in handy during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“We had a team slogan that was called ‘Impact the Red,’” Canada’s Natalie Spooner said. “Obviously, we couldn’t be together as a team every single day, but it was impacting those days when we weren’t able to be together, making sure we were improving as individuals and as a team also.\n\n“We were looking at that clock all the time. We had it in our houses, and even through Covid, we obviously weren’t able to be together for a lot of that time.\n\n“So we had that clock there to make sure we did our own work on those off days to make sure we were ready when we came back as a team.\n\n“It (the clock) had how many days, hours, minutes, seconds until the Opening Ceremony on it.”\n\nCanada's players rush onto the ice in celebration after beating Team USA in the women's ice hockey gold medal match. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nEach player kept their clock in their own unique locations – Spooner says she kept hers in the kitchen – and Poulin says she’ll display the clock alongside her gold medal from Beijing.\n\nAnd the Canadian players aren’t ruling out resetting the clock for Cortina in 2026.\n\nSpooner said: “The clock is at zero now, but if they re-start the clock for the next four years then maybe (she will put it next to the gold medal).”\n\n“Might as well,” Poulin said when asked whether she will reset it.\n\n‘Pretty numb’\n\nFor defending champion Team USA, it was a painful end to its Olympics campaign.\n\nThe team showed grit and determination to fight its way back into the final, but came up just short in its search for what would be a game-tying goal.\n\nUS goaltender Alex Cavallini says she felt “pretty numb” in the aftermath of the defeat.\n\nBut for her personally, it was also a “pretty special” moment because of the injuries she was battling through.\n\n“I actually tore my MCL (in mid-January 2022) and didn’t even know if I was going to make it on the flight here,” Cavallini explained.\n\n“I didn’t have a full practice until three days into when we got here. Our third practice in was when I actually practiced. Didn’t know if I was going to get a start or not.\n\n“For me to be able to battle it out, thanks to our amazing staff and coaching staff to believe in me even when I didn’t and support me along the way – that was a huge deal for me to even get minutes here.”\n\nAlex Carpenter, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Amanda Kessel line up for their silver medals after the women's ice hockey gold medal match.

Kiefer won the match, 15-6, and the gold. Scruggs won the silver.\n\n“It was so cool being in a final with Lauren, because we’re both about 5-3, 5-4,’’ Kiefer said, referring to their relatively small stature in the world of fencing. “We’re both very athletic and we’re very creative. And I think that’s really cool for the sport, and I think it’s going to inspire a lot of little girls.’’\n\n- Josh Peter\n\nUSWNT beats Germany in Olympic soccer\n\nMARSEILLE, France – Emma Hayes can’t have too many complaints after this one.\n\nThe United States women’s soccer team defeated Germany, 4-1, in the second match of group play at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Sunday. And like in the opener against Zambia, the scoring came early and often before the Americans cruised to a relatively stress-free victory.\n\nIt was an all-around effort for the U.S. Sophia Smith scored twice, Mallory Swanson punched in her third of the tournament and Lynn Williams also scored to account for the Americans’ goals. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher stood stout in worrying moments and finished with four saves.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nIs Kevin Durant the greatest Olympic basketball player ever?\n\nVILLENEUVE-D'ASCQ, France – Kevin Durant off the bench isn’t fair. Durant making shot after shot after shot – eight consecutive attempts to be precise – isn’t fair either.\n\nPoor Serbia, looking to upset the U.S. men’s basketball team at the 2024 Paris Olympics and here comes Durant, who hadn’t played in a game since the Phoenix Suns lost in the first round of the playoffs in April, picking apart Serbia.\n\nDurant scored 21 of his 23 points in the first half and led the U.S. to a 110-84 victory over Serbia, sending a message that with Durant on the court, it’s not the same team that almost lost to South Sudan and squeezed by Germany in pre-Olympic tuneups.\n\n“I was tired. I'm not going to lie to you,” Durant said. “My lungs were getting used to that heat, the intensity of the game, but it felt good to make some shots. Everybody played their role pretty well tonight. My role was to come in, provide space and shot-making for the team.”\n\n– Jeff Zillgitt\n\nSara Hughes, Kelly Cheng win in beach volleyball group play\n\nTeam USA's Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, the No. 3-seeded team, scored an easy 2-0 win (21-16, 21-11) over the Czech Republic's Barbora Hermannova and Marie-Sara Stochlova in a Group C women's match in beach volleyball. The American duo came into the Paris Olympics on a roll after winning the 2023 FIVB World Championship title. Before turning pro in 2018, the pair won 103 consecutive matches for the University of Southern California and notched the sport’s first two NCAA titles.\n\nParis Olympics organizers apologize after 'The Last Supper' backlash\n\nParis Olympic organizers apologized Sunday to people offended during a tableau of the opening ceremony that critics said mocked \"The Last Supper.\"\n\nThomas Jolly, the opening ceremony’s artistic director, said on French TV station BFMTV on Sunday, \"The Last Supper\" was \"not my inspiration\" and the \"idea was to have a pagan celebration connected to the gods of Olympus.\"\n\nStill, Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps apologized on Sunday for those offended by the scene.\n\n\"Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. On the contrary, I think (with) Thomas Jolly, we really did try to celebrate community tolerance,\" Descamps said. “Looking at the result of the polls that we shared, we believe that this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense, we are, of course, really, really sorry.”\n\n- Jordan Mendoza\n\nNBC announces big ratings from opening ceremony\n\nNBC announced its viewership ratings from the first days of the Paris Olympics, boasting 28.6 million viewers across all platforms for Friday's opening ceremony, the network's most-watched since 2012.\n\nOn Saturday, NBC reported more than 32 million viewers for the first full day of competition, an 83% increase from the opening Saturday of the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021.\n\nNic Fink wins silver in breaststroke\n\nNANTERRE, France — American breaststroker Nic Fink finally won himself an Olympic medal, tying world record holder Adam Peaty of Great Britain for silver in the men’s 100-meter breaststroke final Sunday night at Paris La Défense Arena.\n\nOn the second day of swimming competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Peaty and Fink finished with an identical time of 59.05. They were just out-touched at the wall by gold medal winner Nicolo Martinenghi of Italy, who swam 59.03.\n\nFink, a 31-year-old two-time Olympian, advanced to the final ranked fourth, needing to drop a little off his 59.16 semifinals swim Saturday. He shaved off .11 seconds to earn a spot on the Olympic podium in his only individual event in Paris.\n\n– Michelle Martinelli\n\nTeam USA's Torri Huske, Gretchen Walsh win gold, silver in butterfly 100\n\nNANTERRE, France —In a battle of the fastest women’s butterfly swimmers in history, Americans Torri Huske won the gold medal in 55.59 seconds and American Gretchen Walsh won the silver in 55.63.\n\nHuske and Walsh both won silver medals Saturday night as part of the U.S. women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay team.\n\nFor Huske, a 21-year-old former U.S. record holder taking a gap year from Stanford, this was a chance to perfect her performance in a race she nearly won three years ago. She ended up finishing fourth in the 100 butterfly in Tokyo after appearing to take the lead 10 meters from the finish. Huske did win a silver medal in the women’s 4x100 medley relay in 2021.\n\n– Christine Brennan\n\nLee Kiefer, Lauren Scruggs win gold and silver in fencing\n\nPARIS − A pair of American women fencers on Sunday night won a pair of coveted Olympic medals – one gold and one silver.\n\nLee Kiefer beat teammate Lauren Scruggs at the Paris Games in the final bout of the women’s individual foil competition that showcased U.S. talent.\n\nArguably, some of the best fencing talent the United States has ever produced.\n\nIt was on display not only in the golden medal bout – which Kiefer won 15-6 – but during the daylong competition that ended with an All-American final.\n\n– Josh Peter\n\nOlympic tennis: Coco Cauff wins singles opener\n\nPARIS — Coco Gauff, perhaps the Americans’ best chance to win a medal in tennis, started her singles run with a dominant 6-3, 6-0 victory over Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic.\n\nAmerican fans may remember Tomljanovic as the player who ended Serena Williams’ career at the 2023 US Open in a three-set thriller. Since then, however, Tomljanovic has struggled with injury and used a protected ranking to secure her spot on Australia’s Olympic team.\n\nAs for the 21-year old Gauff, who is seeded No. 2 and was Team USA’s female flagbearer at Friday’s opening ceremony, it was more or less an ideal start to the Olympics. On Sunday, she teamed with Jessica Pegula for a first-round victory in doubles. Gauff is also playing mixed doubles with Taylor Fritz.\n\nShe continues in singles Monday against Maria Lourdes Carles of Argentina, who is ranked 89th in the world. That match should start at around 7:30 or 8 a.m. ET, depending on how quickly the day’s first match finishes on Suzanne Lenglen Court.\n\n– Dan Wolken\n\nWhy Jayson Tatum didn't play in Team USA basketball win over Serbia\n\nVILLENEUVE-D'ASCQ, France – Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is coming off an NBA title in June and another All-NBA selection in 2023-24.\n\nYet Tatum didn’t play in the USA’s 110-84 victory against Serbia Sunday in the men’s 5x5 basketball Group C opener for both teams at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nU.S. coach Steve Kerr explained his decision and talked to Tatum about it.\n\n“It's really hard in a 40-minute game to play more than 10 guys, and with Kevin (Durant) coming back, I just went to the combinations that I felt would make the most sense,” Kerr said. “It seems crazy. I thought I was crazy when I looked at everything and determined these are the lineups I want to get to. Jayson's first-team All-NBA three years in a row, he's one of the best players in the world.\n\n“He's incredibly professional, and that's tonight. That doesn't mean it's going to stay that way the rest of the tournament, so he'll make his mark. But the key, and our guys know this, is to put all the NBA stuff in the rearview mirror and just win six games, and Jayson's the ultimate pro and champion and he handled it well and he's going to be ready for the next one.”\n\n– Jeff Zillgitt\n\nUSWNT vs. Germany starting lineup\n\nTeam USA continues their Olympic slate vs. Germany at 3 p.m. ET on Sunday.

We got to still earn our respect. We just got to continue to show the world what we're capable of. That is just a testament to people not respecting us still, so we took that as fuel.”\n\nIt was Sudan’s anthem that was played, according to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nSaid South Sudan’s Majok Deng: “They have to be better because this is the biggest stage, and you know that South Sudan is playing. There's no way you can get that wrong by playing a different anthem. It’s disrespectful. I don't know. I don't want to say anything, but to us it didn't feel right, and that kind of delayed the game. For you to play a different anthem, I don't think it's the right thing. Obviously, nobody’s perfect. They made a mistake. They played it at the end, and we moved on.”\n\nSouth Sudan won its first Olympics game in its first Olympics appearance in men’s basketball.\n\nOlympic fencing: Pair of Team USA fencers advance\n\nAmerican fencer Lee Kiefer took another step toward defending her Olympic title, advancing to the semifinals of the women’s individual foil competition Sunday.\n\nKiefer, who won gold at the Tokyo Games in 2021, throttled Flora Pasztor of Hungary in quarterfinals 15-4.

Distance runner Kenneth Rooks put up a personal best in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase to take silver in a shocking turn of events.\n\nMeanwhile, Team USA picked up its second gold in as many days in wrestling after Sarah Hildebrandt defeated Cuba’s Yusneylys Guzmán, 3-0, in the 50-kilogram final.

Check out all the highlights, results and medal count from Wednesday:\n\nUSA figure skaters finally awarded their gold medals\n\nPARIS — What started in disgrace exactly two and a half years ago in the cold and darkness of a dismal Beijing COVID winter ended Wednesday in delight at the foot of the Eiffel Tower under a sparkling Parisian summer sky.\n\nThe right team received the Olympic gold medal. This was the glorious end of the Kamila Valieva doping saga, the Russian scandal that forced the original medal ceremony to be canceled and triggered an infuriating series of international delays and appeals, finally ending with a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruling less than two weeks ago that paved the way for Wednesday’s unique celebration.\n\nAs the Eiffel Tower rose over the shoulders of the nine American gold medalists — the entire 2022 U.S. Olympic figure skating team — families, friends and spectators gathered around a runway inside Champions Park, roaring with joy.\n\n“Absolutely, it was definitely worth the wait,” U.S. team co-captain and ice dancer Madison Chock said, her 2022 gold medal around her neck. “I could never in my wildest dreams have imagined that we would get our Winter Olympic medal at the Summer Olympics in Paris let alone underneath the Eiffel Tower. Paris is one of my favorite cities ever since I was a little girl so this is a dream come true in many ways.” - Christine Brennan\n\nNoah Lyles, Olympian girlfriend to celebrate anniversary after Games\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France - Noah Lyles’ noteworthy summer extends off the track, too. Monday marks Lyles’ two-year anniversary with his girlfriend, Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield. She qualified for the semifinals in the women’s 400, but didn’t advance to the final.\n\nThe two haven’t formally celebrated their anniversary – they are quite busy at the moment – but the fastest man in the world has “big plans” after he officially crosses the finish line.\n\n“I got pretty big plans for a celebration. I’m trying to give her a little more time,\" Lyles said. \"Last year, we kind of went on a Noah Lyles campaign. Unfortunately, that cut into a lot of our vacation time, so I’m trying to be a better boyfriend and give her a lot more time for us to be a couple.” - Tyler Dragon\n\nEthiopia's Lamecha Girma stretchered off after steeplechase\n\nEthiopian runner Lamecha Girma was stretchered off the track at Stade de France on Wednesday during the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase final.\n\nAs the defending silver medalist in the event from the Tokyo Olympics was approaching a hurdle in the race, he tripped over the hurdle, resulting in a hard fall to the ground. He was placed in a neck brace and stretchered off by medical personnel. L'Equipe reported that Girma regained consciousness and was sent to the hospital for tests. - John Leuzzi\n\nUSA women's basketball team beats Nigeria\n\nPARIS — The U.S. women's basketball team defeated Nigeria, 88-74, to advance to the semifinals at the 2024 Paris Olympics. A'ja Wilson led the U.S. in scoring with 20 points. Jackie Young added 15, Breanna Stewart put up 13 and Brittney Griner scored 11.\n\nThe Americans will face Australia in the semifinal on Aug. 9 for a spot in the gold medal game, which is on Aug. 11. They are going for their eighth consecutive gold medal and have not lost an Olympic game since 1992.\n\nAndre De Grasse says allegations against coach were distraction\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Canadian sprinter and defending Olympic 200 champion Andre De Grasse attempted to defend his title Wednesday while his coach Rana Reider is embroiled in controversy.\n\nDe Grasse finished third in the first heat of the men’s 200 semifinal and failed to qualify for the final. After the race, De Grasse said he was running at less than 100% after aggravating an old injury. When asked directly if the allegations of abuse levied against his coach were a distraction, he said, \"Yeah, of course.\"\n\n“I try to keep my head and stay mentally strong. It’s always tough not having your coach out there with you,” De Grasse told reporters. “He kind of leads you through these Games, and been with him all year. It’s definitely a tough one.” - Tyler Dragon\n\nThe U.S. is rolling with a 76-48 lead through three quarters. Four players have scored nine points or more, led by Jackie Young’s 15. And every player has scored at least one point, and the Americans are shooting 60% from the field. It’s safe to say Australia is counting on playing the U.S. at this point.\n\nUSA women's basketball vs. Nigeria score at halftime\n\nThe Americans lead 52-33 at halftime in the women's basketball quarterfinals. They shot 59% from the field, 36% from 3. Breanna Stewart led the U.S. with 13 points, A'ja Wilson putting up 10 and Brittney Griner adding 5.\n\nUS wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt wins gold medal\n\nPARIS — Over the past four years, Sarah Hildebrandt has established herself as one of the best wrestlers in the world in her weight class. She won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Then silver at the 2021 world championships. Then another bronze, at worlds. Then another.\n\nYet on Wednesday night, Hildebrandt wasn't one of the best. She was the best.\n\nAnd the Olympic gold medal draped around her neck was proof.\n\nHildebrandt gave Team USA its second wrestling gold medal in as many nights (following Amit Elor) at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating Yusneylys Guzmán of Cuba, 3-0, in the 50-kilogram final at Champ-de-Mars Arena. It is the 30-year-old's first senior title at the Olympics or world championships – the gold medal she's been chasing after disappointment in Tokyo. - Tom Schad\n\nKenneth Rooks wins silver in steeplechase\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France - American Kenneth Rooks, ranked 24th in the world in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase, shocked the field with a silver medal Wednesday, clocking a personal-best 8:06.41. After 1,000 meters, Rooks trailed 11 racers, and was running just ninth after 2,000 meters. From there, however, Rooks found another gear and passed the entire field to take the lead with a few hundred meters remaining.\n\nHe was overtaken by gold medalist Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco (8:06.05), and Rooks barely beat bronze medalist Abraham Kibiwot of Kenya (8:06.47). Rooks, the only American in the race, earned Team USA's first men's steeplechase medal since Evan Jager won silver in the 2016 Rio Games. - Chase Goodbread\n\nJourdan Delacruz falls short of medal in women's weightlifting\n\nPARIS — U.S. women’s weightlifter Jourdan Delacruz significantly improved on her finish from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics but fell short of a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics Wednesday.\n\nCompeting in the 49 kilograms weight class, Delacruz placed fifth, lifting a combined weight of 195 kilograms, which is nearly 430 pounds – 185 pounds in snatch and 244 pounds in the clean and jerk.\n\nDelacruz, who won bronze at the 2023 world championship, finished last in Tokyo after she unable to complete a lift for the clean and jerk. She had no problem completing her lift in Paris.\n\n\"I’m not 100% sure yet, but I do think this may be one of my last competitions,\" Delacruz said. \"It was just a moment to thank the barbell for everything that it’s taught me and for the person I’ve become in the last 10 years. It was just a moment to acknowledge the sport. Aside from what happened on stage, that barbell has taught me a lot.\n\n\"I wish it went better. I had higher expectations. I thought I’d be on that podium today, but I’m actually surprisingly not as sad as I thought I’d be. I think that’s just because my family is here, and I’ve had such an amazing Olympic experience so far. This is something I’ll remember forever.”\n\nChina’s Hou Zhizui won gold (206 kilograms or 454 pounds) and set an Olympic record in clean and jerk, lifting 117 kilograms (258 pounds). Romania’s Mihaela Valentina Cambei earned silver and Thailand’s Surodchana Khambao took bronze. – Jeff Zillgitt\n\nUSA women's basketball vs. Nigeria: Live updates and more\n\nTeam USA women's hoops takes on Nigeria with a chance to punch their ticket to the semifinals of the Olympic basketball tournament.

Team USA would down Australia 11-10 (4-3 in shootout) to advance to the semifinals.\n\nTeam USA wins artistic swimming medal for first time in 20 years\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Team USA artistic swimmers won their first Olympic medal in the team competition in 20 years, winning silver behind China with gold (996.1389) and ahead of Spain with bronze (900.7319). They entered Wednesday night’s team acrobatic routine and overall final ranked second behind the gold medalists and held on to finish second with a total score of 914.3421.\n\nTeam USA’s most recent Olympic medal in the team competition was bronze at the 2004 Athens Games.\n\nThe last time Russia (or athletes competing under the Russian Olympic Committee) did not win Olympic gold in artistic swimming’s team competition was at the 1996 Atlanta Games, when Team USA finished first in the event’s Olympic debut.\n\nThe team competition is broken into three routines: the team technical routine, the team free routine and the team acrobatic routine. Following the acrobatic routine Wednesday night, the scores from all three routines are added together to determine the final rankings.\n\nAfter the team technical routine Monday, Team USA was ranked fourth (282.7567) behind China, Spain and Japan. But the Americans stunned in the team free routine Tuesday, finishing second (360.2688) behind China and setting themselves up to contend for their first Olympic medal in 20 years. – Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nPARIS — Standing outside the park venue Wednesday after American Tom Schaar won the silver medal, skateboarding legend Tony Hawk said he’s been pushing as hard as he can for more forms of skateboarding to be included in the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\n“It’s LA,” he said. “It’s what people consider the birthplace of modern skateboarding. We should celebrate all styles of skateboarding.”\n\nThat includes, of course, his hope that the International Olympic Committee will add a vert competition – the style of skateboarding most associated with Hawk’s tricks.\n\n“I’ve been trying my best to have words with them at every turn here,” Hawk said. – Dan Wolken\n\nThere are many things athletes look forward to when hanging out in the Olympic Village.\n\nUnfortunately for one British swimmer, food isn't one of them.\n\n“The catering isn’t good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform. We need to give the best we possibly can,” Adam Peaty, who won a silver medal in the 100-meter breaststroke, said to Inews this week.\n\nPeaty said in other Olympic stops, like Tokyo and Rio, the food was excellent.\n\n“I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish. It’s just not good enough,\" Peaty said. “The standard, we’re looking at the best of the best in the world, and we’re feeding them not the best.\"\n\nAmerican CJ Allen runs out of gas, fails to qualify for 400m hurdle finals\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Rai Benjamin cruised through the men’s 400-meter semifinals to Wednesday to secure his spot in the Friday-night finals.\n\nBenjamin won his heat – almost too easily – with a time of 47.85 second. His best time this season is 46.46 seconds.\n\nDuring heats, Benjamin jogged the end of his run – conserving fuel for the races to come. The defending Olympic silver medalist in the event won a gold in Tokyo as part of the men’s 4x400-meter relay team.\n\nBenjamin took his time out of the gates but dialed it up at about the one-third mark and essentially jogged the straightaway once again.\n\nCJ Allen of the USA took an early lead into the straightaway during the second heat. But he ran out of steam and finished fourth. Allen, the American indoor 400-meter record-holder, did not make the final with a time of 48.44.\n\nAmerican Trevor Bassitt, the eighth-ranked 400-meter hurdler per the world rankings, also finished fourth in the first heat and didn’t make the finals either.\n\nNorway’s Karsten Warholm, who set the world record in the event at the Tokyo Olympics, won the first heat with a time of 47.67 seconds. Warholm also had the fastest time during heats.\n\nFrenchman Clement Ducos took second in the first heat to make the finals, much to the delight of the crowd at Stade de France. – Chris Bumbaca\n\nShe quite didn't make her way to the podium, but either way, French track and field athlete Alice Finot was the one giving out hardware.\n\nAfter she set a European record but just missed out on a medal Tuesday in the 3000-meter steeplechase, Finot went over to her partner, Bruno Martínez Bargiela, and got down on one knee to propose. But, instead of a ring, she unhooked an Olympic pin that she wore during the race and offered it to him as they embraced to the cheering of the crowd at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – The more celebrated Nelly Korda becomes as a golfer, the more noticeable it is when she seeks to experience life as something else.\n\nIt’s all amplified for her. The tournaments in which she doesn’t play. The interviews she doesn’t give. This idea that it’s her responsibility, more than any peer, to expand the LPGA Tour’s popularity.\n\nShe may be a reluctant sports star at times, but she's the biggest one going in the women's game. And it’s not that the world’s No. 1 player is burned out on golf, she explained after Wednesday’s opening round at the Paris Olympics. It’s that she doesn’t want to become burned out.\n\n“As important as it is to sometimes grind it out,” Korda said, “it's also important to just put your clubs away and just be a regular human being. ... It feels nice when you're in a groove, but when you play under pressure and you're in the final group and you feel the emotions that you do, it takes a toll on you mentally.” – Gentry Estes\n\nTeam USA snares elusive gold in women's team pursuit\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France — The U.S. finally has its elusive gold medal in women’s team pursuit.\n\nThe U.S. team of Kristen Faulkner, Chloe Dygert, Lily Williams and Jennifer Valente beat New Zealand in the gold medal match of the cycling race Wednesday at the National Velodrome, finishing in 4:04.306.\n\nNew Zealand was about 6/10ths of a second behind in 4:04.927, while Great Britain beat Italy for the bronze.\n\nThe U.S. is one of the world’s leading powers in team pursuit having medaled in the event in each of the first three Olympics the sport was a part of in 2012, 2016 and 2020. But until this year, the American had never struck gold.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. beat Great Britain in a tight first-round heat before nipping New Zealand in the final.\n\nDygert and Valente also were a part of the U.S.’s silver medal-winning team in 2016 and the group that took in 2020. Dygert also won Olympic bronze in the time trial in road cycling this year, while Faulkner heads home with two golds in her first Olympics after winning the road race on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S. won silver in team pursuit at the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nGreat Britain also has medaled every year team pursuit has been part of the Olympics. Just three other countries have a medal in the sport: Germany, Canada and now New Zealand. – Dave Birkett\n\nKatie Moon, Noah Lyles, Kenny Bednarek and others are in action this afternoon as Olympic track and field events continue. USA TODAY Sports will provide live updates, highlights and more for all of Wednesday's happenings.\n\nPARIS — A gold medal escaped the U.S. men’s volleyball team again.\n\nAfter taking a 2-1 set lead against world No. 1 Poland in the semifinals, the U.S. dropped the final two sets and Poland advanced to the gold-medal game with a 25-23, 25-27, 14-25, 25-23, 15-13 victory in five thrilling sets Wednesday in an energetic, music-filled environment at South Paris Arena.\n\nPoland will play the winner of Italy-France for gold, and the U.S. will play the loser for bronze.\n\nIn the fourth set, the U.S. had a 16-14 lead but could not hold off Poland for the victory and fell short of the gold medal game. Poland carried momentum from its fourth-set win into a strong fifth-set performance. The U.S. trailed 14-10 and made it 14-13 in the fifth set before Poland closed out the game.\n\nIn Paris, the U.S. men were 3-0 in preliminary play and beat rival Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe U.S. won bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics but finished 10th at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The U.S. hasn’t won gold since the 2008 Beijing Olympics. – Jeff Zillgitt\n\nPARIS — Dallas Oberholzer came to Paris knowing he would finish last in the men’s park skateboarding competition. He’s 49 years old, for goodness sakes, competing in a sport ruled by Gen Z. He’s also from South Africa, a country where skateboarding has no infrastructure or funding. He’s spent decades traveling the world, funding this journey himself, often barely scraping by in search of the next good vibe.\n\nBefore the sport went corporate, before the Olympics, before Tony Hawk and Shaun White, that’s what skateboarding was really all about.\n\nBut being here hasn’t been all bad. Even as he approaches his 50th birthday he’s still growing, still learning. He even went to visit an osteopath in the Olympic Village the other day because, well, the knees don’t feel so good these days coming off the board. – Dan Wolken\n\nUSA adds skateboarding park silver medal\n\nPARIS — American Tom Schaar can add Olympic medalist to his long list of skateboarding accomplishments.\n\nThe youngest-ever X Games gold medalist and the first skateboarder to successfully pull off a trick with 1,080 degrees of rotation in competition, Schaar took silver at the men’s park competition on Wednesday.\n\nThough he had two successful runs, he slightly trailed Australia’s Keegan Palmer. With one more chance to post the best score, Schaar upped the ante but came off the board toward the end of his run, ensuring the gold medal for Palmer.\n\nPalmer’s winning run was scored 93.11, just barely ahead of Schaar’s 92.23. Brazil’s Augusto Akio took the bronze medal.\n\nPalmer also won the first-ever Olympic gold in park three years ago when he was just 14 years old.\n\nTate Carew, Team USA’s other medal hope, finished fifth.\n\nThis event concludes the skateboarding competition for Paris. Team USA will have to wait four more years to Los Angeles to take home its first skateboarding gold. – Dan Wolken\n\nPARIS — A female wrestler from India was disqualified from her gold-medal bout at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday morning after weighing in about 100 grams above the maximum limit for her weight class.\n\nFor context: That's about 0.22 pounds or 3.5 ounces − roughly the weight of a bar of soap.\n\nThe shocking news not only knocked Vinesh Phogat out of the 50-kilogram Olympic final against American Sarah Hildebrandt, where she would've been guaranteed to win no worse than a silver medal. Under international wrestling rules, Phogat's failure to make weight resulted in a full disqualification. She will technically finish dead last. – Tom Schad\n\nPARIS — For the first time in 40 years, an American man has won an Olympic medal in weightlifting.\n\nHampton Morris, a 20-year-old who trains primarily out of the garage at his family's Georgia home, ended the decadeslong drought by winning bronze at the 2024 Paris Games on Wednesday.\n\nMorris was sitting in fifth place after his snatch but he leapfrogged into medal position thanks to the second lift of competition, clean and jerk, where he is the reigning world-record holder in his weight class. Between the two lifts, the 135-pound Morris hoisted a combined weight of 298 kilograms, which is about 657 pounds. – Tom Schad\n\nNelly Korda is looking to defend her 2021 Olympic gold medal in the women's golf tournament this week. USA TODAY Sports will provide live updates and more for Korda's defense.\n\nTeam USA women's springboard divers fail to qualify for semifinals\n\nBoth Team USA divers Sarah Bacon and Alison Gibson failed to qualify for the women’s 3-meter springboard top-18 semifinals after finishing 19th and 28th, respectively, in Wednesday’s prelims.\n\nGibson had a scary start to her prelims and struggled to recover from a rough zero-score first-round dive, finishing with a total score of 198.30.\n\nA two-time Olympian, Gibson’s first dive was an inward 2 1/2 somersaults in the pike position. But mid-air at the end of her final rotation, the 25-year-old diver smacked her feet on the board and fell into the water. Thankfully for her, she only hit her feet, and she was able to continue competing. But it was a frightening moment that left at least her right foot a little cut up and bloody.\n\nGibson received zeros across the board for the dive, essentially leaving her to try to qualify for the semifinals in her only Olympic event on four dives when everyone else had scores for five.\n\nMeanwhile, Bacon’s best of her five rounds was her first dive, earning a score of 64.50 off an inward 2 1/2 somersaults in the pike position with a 3.0 degree of difficulty. But a low-scoring third round ensured it would be difficult for her to qualify for the semifinals, finishing with a score of 264.40.\n\nBacon, a 27-year-old first-time Olympian, previously won silver at the Paris Olympics in the women’s synchronized 3-meter springboard with partner Kassidy Cook.\n\nChina’s Chen Yiwen qualified first with a score of 356.40, while Australia’s Maddison Keeney was second (337.35) and Mexico’s Aranza Vazquez Montano was third (321.75). – Michelle R. Martinelli\n\n51-year-old Andy Macdonald puts on Tony Hawk-approved skateboard showing\n\nIf you grew up on the X-Games, \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\" or maybe even picked up a board yourself, Andy Macdonald is a name that conjures up some nostalgia.\n\nThe very same and now 51-year-old skateboarder qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics and participated in the men's park preliminaries on Wednesday. Fellow skateboarding legend Tony Hawk was in attendance, and clapped his hands and pumped his fists in approval of Macdonald's run.\n\nMacdonald will finish out his run with a 77.66 for 18th place in the heat. He wouldn't make the final, but he would make plenty of skateboarding fans smile.\n\nWhat were you doing during the summer when you were 11 years old?\n\nChances are you were not competing on the world's biggest stage at the Olympics trying to win a medal, but that's exactly what 11-year-old skateboarder Zheng Haohao is doing. And to think, she only took up the sport five years ago, soaring through the rankings to earn her spot at the Olympics.\n\nZheng is representing China during the 2024 Paris Games and was the youngest athlete competing, in becoming her country's youngest Olympian. She doesn't turn 12 until Sunday and is currently 26th in the World Skateboarding Ranking. − Scooby Axon\n\nPARIS — The track and field bromance that took center stage at the Tokyo Olympics is once again in the spotlight three years later.\n\nGianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Qatar's Mutaz Barshim shared the gold medal in the high jump at the last Summer Games. The pair, whom are adversaries on paper but also friends thanks to nearly 15 years of competing against one another in the same meets, decided to share the gold rather than do a jump-off to decide a winner – taking advantage of a loophole in the World Athletics rulebook.\n\nThe reaction was priceless, with Tamberi leaping onto Barshim and wrapping himself around the Qatari.\n\nOn Wednesday, during high jump qualifying, the duo was back at it in the heartwarming sense. Barshim began his run for liftoff over the bar but pulled up lame and immediately grabbed for his left calf. Tamberi was the first person to Barshim's side on the ground and helped him stretch the calf.\n\nThe extent of Barshim's injury is unknown, but he did qualify for the final by clearing 2.27 meters. − Chris Bumbaca\n\nPARIS – Some skateboarding experts thought the Americans had a chance to sweep the podium in the men’s park skateboarding event, but only two of the three Team USA members advanced to the finals that will be held later Wednesday.\n\nTate Carew, a 19-year old from San Diego, came into the Paris Games ranked No. 1 in the world in park and didn’t have to sweat too much as his best score of 90.42 was enough for fourth in qualifying, comfortably within the top-eight needed to make the finals.\n\nTom Schaar, a 24-year old from Malibu, Calif., who made his X Games debut when he was just 12, posted the second-highest qualifying score at 92.05. This is his first Olympics.\n\nThe big upset was Gavin Bottger, ranked No. 3 in the world, failing to reach the finals. Bottger, 17, only finished one error-free run in his three attempts. His score of 86.95 looked like it might be enough to hold up for the eighth spot, but he got passed by skaters in the third head and dropped below the qualifying line to 10th place.\n\nThe Americans will have to deal with No.2-ranked Keegan Palmer from Australia, who posted the top qualifying score, and three strong Brazilian skaters if they want to make the podium.\n\nAlex Sorgente, who was born in Florida but has dual citizenship through his father, is competing for Italy and also made the finals. − Dan Wolken\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Some athletes adopt the mindset that they don’t lose, they learn. Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson is one of those athletes.\n\nThompson, who still owns the best 100 time in the world this year, came into the Paris Olympics as a gold-medal favorite. But he came in second behind Noah Lyles by five-thousandths of a second in the most competitive men's 100 final in Olympics history during which all eight runners finished under 10 seconds for the first time ever, according to World Athletics.\n\nThe race was so close that Lyles thought Thompson had won.\n\n\"I did think Thompson had it at the end,\" Lyles said. \"I went up to him when we were waiting and I said, 'I think you got that one big dog.'\"\n\nThompson told USA TODAY Sports, that he wasn’t sure who had won immediately after the race.\n\n\"Honestly, I wasn’t sure if I won. I knew it was close between first and second,\" Thompson said. \"I know I cleared the person on my exact right, and I saw I was in front of the person on my left. But I wasn’t too sure if I got it. It was that close.\"\n\nNobody inside Stade de France knew who won until the photo view results were displayed on the video board seconds after the race. − Tyler Dragon\n\nUS women advance to gold medal in team pursuit\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – The U.S. is guaranteed to keep its medal streak alive in women’s team pursuit.\n\nThe U.S. team of Kristen Faulkner, Chloe Dygert, Lily Williams and Jennifer Valente beat Great Britain in the third heat of the first round at the National Velodrome on Wednesday to advance to the gold medal match later today.\n\nThe U.S finished the 4,000-meter race in 4:04.629 and will meet New Zealand in the finals. The time was just short of Germany's world record (4:04.242) set at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nGreat Britain will race against Italy for the bronze after finishing in 4:04.908.\n\nNew Zealand finished its heat Wednesday in 4:04.818.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Great Britain have won medals in women’s team pursuit every year since it started as an Olympic sport in 2012. The U.S. won silver in 2012 and 2016, and bronze in 2020.\n\nDygert and Valente were on the 2016-20 teams and can tie Great Britain’s Laura Trott-Kenny as the only three-time medalists in the sport. − David Birkett\n\nNelly Korda looks to defend her Olympic gold medal\n\nNelly Korda, the women's world No.1 player and defending gold medallist, headlines a strong field in Paris. But it's Lilia Vu of the US who has stormed atop the leaderboard (-3) through nine holes at Le Golf National. She is tied with Celine Boutier of France for the lead. Korda is even par thru 17 holes.\n\nPARIS — An Australian athlete has been taken into custody by French authorities for attempting to buy cocaine, according to reports.\n\nThe Paris Public Prosecutor's Office told 9News Australia an unidentified member of the men's field hockey team was involved in an alleged \"cocaine transaction at the foot of a building in the city's 9th arrondissement\" Tuesday. Police officers witnessed the incident, according to the 9News report.\n\nThe Australian Olympic Committee confirmed an arrest to Reuters but did not confirm the player's identity. − Chris Bumbaca\n\nAmerican runner shows grit to earn a spot in the 800m final\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France - With a time of 1:46.15, Hobbs Kessler of Team USA finished third in his heat to advance to the semifinals of the men's 800-meter event at the Paris Olympics' track and field venue at Stade de France. In a preliminary that required a top-three finish to automatically qualify, Kessler found himself in fourth place and trailing Italy's Simone Barontini halfway through the race, but overtook Barontini to earn the qualification.\n\nAlso qualifying was American Bryce Hoppel, who opened an early lead in the event's final heat and finished second with a time of 1:45.24. Kessler and Hoppel will compete in semifinals Friday morning, and if they advance, in medal finals Saturday night.\n\nAmericans who qualified in other events at the morning session included Shelby McEwen (men's high jump), Alaysha Johnson, Masai Russell and Grace Stark (women's 100m hurdles), and Graham Blanks and Grant Fisher (men's 5,000m). − Charles Goodbread\n\nPARIS — The term GOAT is so often tossed around in sports. Not always carelessly, but frequently enough that it’s diminished the original meaning behind the greatest of all time acronym.\n\nBut in some instances, GOAT truly applies, and few would disagree that Michael Phelps deserves the label. GOAT swimmer. GOAT Olympian.\n\nThere will never be another — at least not in this lifetime.\n\nOver the years, especially since Phelps retired following the 2016 Rio Games, many have been deemed “the next Michael Phelps.” At one point, it was American Caeleb Dressel. At the Paris Olympics, it’s France’s Léon Marchand.\n\nHowever, there’s a huge difference between a superstar and “the next Michael Phelps,” and Dressel agreed, calling Phelps “not even a once-in-a-lifetime” swimmer but “maybe once in a, I don’t know, end-of-the-world type guy.” − Michelle Martinelli\n\nAmerican sport climber advances to men's final\n\nAmerican sport climber Colin Duffy has advanced to the men's boulder-and-lead finals set for Friday at the Paris Olympics.\n\nDuffy, a 20-year-old from Colorado, entered the competition Wednesday in 11th place after the boulder semifinals on Monday. His strong performance in lead lifted him into seventh place overall, and the top eight climbers qualified for the finals.\n\n“Just very proud,’’ said Duffy, who finished seventh at the Tokyo Games in 2021 in sport climbing’s Olympic debut. “I wanted to go out and give a climb that I could be proud of and I was able to do that.’’\n\nFellow American Jesse Grupper, a 27-year-older from New York making his first appearance at the Olympics, finished 18th among the 20 climbers in the boulder-and-lead semifinals.\n\nAlso, Poland’s Aleksandra Miroslaw won the gold medal in the women’s speed climb while China’s Lijuan Deng took silver and Poland’s Aleksandra Kaluka took bronze Wednesday. American Emma Hunt reached the quarterfinals but slipped during her heat and failed to advance to the semifinals. – Josh Peter\n\nGreek pole vaulter out of Olympics after doping test\n\nGreek pole vaulter Eleni-Klaoudia Polak has been provisionally suspended after testing positive at the Paris Olympics, according to the IOC.\n\nPolak, 27, competed in qualifying, clearing a jump of 13 feet, 9 ¼ inches but didn’t advance to the final. Paris was her second Olympics as she didn’t make it out of qualifying at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAt the world championships, Polak’s best result was 22nd at the 2022 worlds held in Eugene, Oregon. According to her bio on the IOC web site, she took up the sport at age 14 after a coach saw her training in gymnastics and encouraged her to try pole vault.\n\nCarson Tyler earns spot in men's 3m springboard diving finals\n\nTeam USA diver Carson Tyler improved significantly from his prelims performance and finished seventh in Wednesday’s men’s 3-meter springboard semifinals, advancing to the final among the top-12 divers.\n\nTyler, a 20-year-old first-time Olympian, finished with a score of 438.00 – his prelims score was 389.80 – and will try to make the podium in the final set for Thursday. His highest-scoring dive came in the fifth and sixth rounds, the final two – first a reverse 3 ½ somersaults in the tuck position with a 3.5 degree of difficulty, followed by a reverse 1 ½ somersaults with 3 ½ twists in the free position with a 3.5 degree of difficulty – earning him scores of 78.75.\n\nTwo-time Olympic diver Andrew Capobianco, 24, placed 15th with a final score of 407.65, missing the cut for the final. The 24-year-old American struggled through the semifinals, but he earned his best score of 83.60 on his sixth-round dive: a forward 4 ½ somersaults in the tuck position with a degree of difficulty of 3.8.\n\nAt the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Capobianco finished 10th in the men’s 3-meter springboard, but he earned a silver medal in the men’s synchronized 3-meter springboard competition.\n\nThe divers to beat in the men’s 3-meter springboard are the three defending Olympic medalists from the 2021 Tokyo Games: Xie Siyi, who won gold, Wang Zongyuan with silver and Jack Laugher with bronze.\n\nWang and Xie, representing China, enter finals ranked first (537.85) and second (505.85), respectively, while Great Britain’s Laugher is ranked third (467.05).\n\nThe men’s 3-meter springboard final is set for Thursday at 9 a.m. ET. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nAmerican duo move on to men's 5000m finals\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Americans Graham Blanks and Grant Fisher advanced to the medal finals of the men's 5,000-meter race at the Stade de France track and field venue of the Paris Games on Wednesday. Blanks made up some critical ground over the last 1,000 meters to finish sixth in a time of 14:09.06 in Heat 1. He made his move just early enough to avoid a calamitous tumble that occurred right behind him, as one racer tripped, fell, and triggered falls for three others.\n\nThe top eight in each of two heats qualified for the finals, and Blanks was running 10th after 4,000 meters. In Heat 2, Fisher finished fourth with a time of 13:52.44 to give Team USA two runners in a medal-finals field of 16. American Abdihamid Nur was in fourth place after 4,000 meters, but a late fall cost him a last-place finish of 14:15.00. — Chase Goodbread\n\nThree Americans advance to semis for women's 100m hurdles\n\nThere will be a heavy Team USA presence Friday in the semifinals of the women's 100 hurdles event at the Paris Games' Stade de France venue for track and field. Three of four Americans competing earned automatic qualifications in the preliminaries on Wednesday, including Alaysha Johnson, Masai Russell and Grace Stark.\n\nJohnson placed second in Heat 1 with a 12.61 clocking, while Russell tied for the win in Heat 3 (12.53, same as the Netherlands' Nadine Visser). Stark ran in the final heat and posted a 12.72 time to finish third.\n\nTeam USA's Ebony Morrison ran a 12.93 to finish sixth in Heat 2.\n\nMedal finals in the event are scheduled for Saturday. — Chase Goodbread\n\nOlympics schedule today\n\nHere are some Olympic schedule highlights.

Illinois abolished capital punishment in 2011.\n\n“I want a long sentence,” the suspect’s father, Robert Crimo Jr., said, according to a report by the Post. “That’s life. You know you have consequences for actions. He made a choice. He didn’t have to do that.”\n\nCrimo will face additional charges for those he wounded, along with the murder charges already filed, Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart said. “It’s vital to the healing of this community that every single victim receives justice,” Rinehart told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday.\n\nAlso revealed publicly Wednesday: After the shooting, Crimo drove to Wisconsin’s capital of Madison on Monday and contemplated a shooting there before deciding against it, authorities said. That might have been one of two narrowly avoided mass gun attacks at July Fourth celebrations nationwide. Police in Virginia say a tip may have foiled a separate attack plot, unrelated to Crimo, in Richmond.\n\nIn Highland Park, residents have been paying their respects in the days following the shooting to those killed or wounded, with some overcome with emotion, others kneeling in prayer.\n\nA mourner visits a memorial for the victims of a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade, on Wednesday in Highland Park, Illinois.

Her grandparents were sitting “right across from where the shooter” was located, she told CNN.\n\n“Every single year of my life, we’ve gone to this parade, and they wanted to be there specifically so that when I passed by in the parade, I would be able to find them there,” Wathen said.\n\nHer grandfather was struck by shrapnel in his shoulder, barely missing his lungs, but doctors say he will make a full recovery, she said.\n\nThe trauma of the event, however, has “shaken a lot of people up,” she said. “It’s hard to say how we’ll be in a year, but for right now, it’s scary to even think about going back.”\n\nTwo people wounded remained hospitalized at NorthShore University Health System facilities as of Wednesday afternoon and were in stable condition, according to spokesperson Jim Anthony. A total of 39 people had been treated for injuries, he said, and an 8-year-old boy was transferred to UChicago Medicine Comer Children’s Hospital, which confirmed the child is in critical but stable condition.\n\nA woman views the candles and flowers left for the victims of the July 4th parade shooting on Tuesday, July 5, 2022 in Highland Park, Illinois.

WLS-TV/ABC7/Reuters In pictures: 4th of July shooting in Highland Park, Illinois Prev Next\n\nSuspect’s father thought he would use weapons at shooting range, report says\n\nThe suspect’s father decided to sponsor his son’s firearm owner’s identification card (FOID), a document needed to buy a weapon in Illinois, because he thought his son would take the weapons to a shooting range, the New York Post reported.\n\n“He bought everything on his own, and they’re registered to him,” Crimo Jr. told the Post.\n\n“They make me like I groomed him to do all this,” he said, according to the report, which comes amid questions over whether Crimo’s parents could face charges. “I’ve been here my whole life, and I’m gonna stay here, hold my head up high, because I didn’t do anything wrong.”\n\nIn a separate interview with ABC News, Crimo Jr. acknowledged he “filled out the consent form to allow my son to go through the process that the Illinois State Police have in place for an individual to obtain a FOID card.”\n\n“They do background checks,” he said. “Whatever that entails, I’m not exactly sure. And either you’re approved or denied, and he was approved.”\n\nCNN’s calls to Crimo Jr. have not been returned. Crimo Jr.’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, told CNN they would not be making any further public comments, “but the parents will continue to speak with law-enforcement and to assist them.”\n\nRinehart, the county state’s attorney, told CNN on Thursday there is no criminal liability for sponsoring someone’s FOID, but added the office is still going through evidence “in terms of who knew what when.”\n\n“There’s different ways to look at potential criminal liability in this case,” Rinehart said. “There’s not a, per se, violation of law if you vouch for somebody in a FOID card and they end up doing something terrible like this. But, having said that, we are continuing to investigate the case and continuing to explore all options.”\n\nIn addition to wanting to see his son serve a long sentence, Crimo Jr. told the Post he is “furious” over his alleged actions, adding that the night before the shooting, the two discussed a 22-year-old Danish man suspected of shooting and killing three people at a mall outside Copenhagen on Sunday.\n\n“He goes, ‘Yeah, that guy is an idiot.’ That’s what he said!” Crimo Jr. recalled, saying his son added, “People like that … (commit mass shootings) to amp up the people that want to ban all guns.”\n\n“I talked to him 13 hours before (Monday’s massacre). That’s why I guess I’m in such shock. … Like, did he have a psychiatric break or something?” Crimo Jr. said, per the Post.\n\nThe suspected shooter’s uncle, Paul Crimo, told CNN on Thursday that his nephew “showed no aggression towards me or nothing.”\n\n“There’s no indications of nothing, that I saw, that would lead to all this,” he told CNN. The uncle added that he did not know where his nephew got the money to pay for the guns he purchased and said he had no knowledge of them.\n\n“He lives in the back apartment, we don’t see each other,” he said.\n\n“I’m sorry, I mean, from the bottom of my heart, I mean, I’m devastated and my heart, my thoughts and prayers goes out to all the victims, the families and everybody that got hurt, the community, everybody,” the uncle added.\n\nSuspect contemplated second attack, police say\n\nFollowing the shooting in Highland Park, Crimo left the scene and drove to Madison, Wisconsin, where he “seriously contemplated” committing another shooting, according to Lake County Major Crime Task Force Deputy Chief Chris Covelli.\n\nThe firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered near the scene, but Crimo had another gun in his vehicle during his arrest, police said. That weapon was a Kel-Tec rifle, Covelli said Wednesday. Crimo had approximately 60 rounds of ammunition in his car at the time, Covelli added.\n\nWhen Crimo located another celebration in the Madison area, he “seriously contemplated using the firearm he had in his vehicle to commit another shooting,” Covelli said, though “indications are that he hadn’t put enough thought and research into it.”\n\nThe FBI alerted Madison police Monday afternoon that Crimo was on the run and may be in the area, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said Wednesday. “We feel for the grieving families in Highland Park and all those forever impacted by the events of Monday’s shooting. We recognize tragedy very well could have taken place in our own community,” said Barnes.\n\nAfter he was detained Monday evening in northern Illinois, Crimo “went into details about what he had done; he admitted to what he had done” in voluntary statements during questioning to Highland Park police, Covelli said.\n\nCrimo was appointed a public defender and is due in court again July 28.\n\nCovelli declined to address the suspect’s motive Wednesday, telling reporters he didn’t want to go into specific details about what Crimo told investigators.\n\n“However, he had some type of affinity towards the numbers 4 and 7, and the inverse was 7/4,” Covelli said, referring to Monday’s date, July 4. Crimo’s affinity “comes from music that he’s interested in,” said Covelli.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Chilling': CNN's Josh Campbell describes gunman's demeanor at hearing 01:05 - Source: CNN 'Chilling': CNN's Josh Campbell describes gunman's demeanor at hearing 01:05\n\nCrimo had purchased weapons in Illinois despite two encounters with police in 2019 over fears for his safety and that of others, information released by state and local police shows.\n\nHighland Park police received a report in April 2019 that Crimo had earlier attempted suicide, Covelli said Tuesday. Police spoke with Crimo and his parents and the matter was handled by mental health professionals, he said.\n\nIn September that year, a relative reported Crimo threatened family members – to “kill everyone” – and had a collection of knives, Covelli said. Police removed 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from their home.\n\nThe knives were “just a collection,” Crimo Jr. told the Post. “You know, I used to collect coins and baseball cards.”\n\nHighland Park police submitted a “Clear and Present Danger” report about the visit to the Illinois State Police, the state agency said. Family members were not willing to file additional complaints, the state police said in a Tuesday news release.\n\nThe knives confiscated by Highland Park police were returned the same day after Crimo’s father said they were his, the state police said.\n\nOver the next two years, Crimo legally purchased five guns, according to Covelli – including rifles, pistols and possibly a shotgun. Crimo passed four background checks between June 2020 and September 2021 when buying firearms, which included checks of the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System, state police said Tuesday.\n\nCrimo’s application for a FOID card – sponsored by his father because his son was under 21 – was not denied because there was “insufficient basis to establish a clear and present danger” at the time, state police said.\n\nRinehart, the Lake County state’s attorney, declined to comment Wednesday on whether Crimo’s father or other relatives could face charges.\n\nParents of accused shooters historically haven’t been charged in mass shootings until recently – as in the case of a 15-year-old accused of killing four fellow students at a Michigan high school in November, CNN legal analyst Areva Martin said.\n\nMichigan prosecutors say the negligence of parents Jennifer and James Crumbley allowed their son, Ethan, access to the weapon used in that mass shooting. Each has pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nIllinois prosecutors would have to establish reasonable foreseeability if they want to prosecute Crimo’s father, Martin said.\n\n“The question this prosecutor’s going to have to ask (is) was it reasonably foreseeable that someone who had made a suicide attempt and who had threatened to kill others would lead that person … to commit the crime against the paradegoers,” she said.\n\n“And if the answer to that question is yes … there definitely could be manslaughter charges filed against his dad, who did sign that consent form and gave consent for him to gain access to the high-powered weapon and weapons that were used.”", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell Joe Sutton Rebekah Riess", "Travis Caldwell", "Joe Sutton", "Rebekah Riess"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/weather/winter-weather-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Virginia's I-95 reopens after winter storm strands drivers | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nA 50-mile stretch of Interstate 95 in eastern Virginia reopened Tuesday night after a severe winter storm left some motorists stranded on the highway for more than 24 hours.\n\nAll disabled vehicles were removed from I-95 in that stretch in the Fredericksburg area between Richmond and Washington, D.C., by 8 p.m., transportation officials said.\n\nA Monday storm dumped more than a foot of snow in the area and not only stranded highway travelers overnight, but also snarled traffic on other roads and halted an Amtrak passenger train for more than 30 hours.\n\nAt one point, the storm left more than 400,000 customers in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast without power.\n\nOn Virginia’s I-95, motorists became stuck Monday into Tuesday partly because of disabled trucks blocking the way in snowy and icy conditions, state transportation officials said.\n\nDrivers described turning their engines on for a time to heat up, turning them off to conserve fuel, and sharing food and supplies with one another as crews tried to clear trucks blocking the way after they were unable to continue in ice and snow. Temperatures had dipped into the teens overnight.\n\nJim DeFede, a journalist who was driving home to Miami after a holiday visit with family in New York, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday that once he stopped, he was stuck for 18 hours.\n\nHe said he watched others who got out of their cars slip and slide on the ice and he stayed put, thinking there was no way emergency responders would get there if he fell and was hurt.\n\nHe said he had heard reports there were no deaths or injuries.\n\n“That’s great. But that’s just – that’s just dumb luck at this point,” he said. “This could have been a lot more serious.”\n\nLive updates: Drivers trapped for hours on I-95\n\nHe said one trucker was handing out bottles of water and one bread delivery truck opened its doors and people handed out loaves.\n\nDeFede finally got moving but was sent north, in the direction he had come from until, after two hours, he got off the interstate and found a place to stay.\n\nUS Sen. Tim Kaine, who was driving toward Washington, said he was stuck on I-95 for more than 24 hours.\n\n“At some point, it switched from a miserable travel day into kind of a survival mode day for me,” the Virginia Democrat told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on Tuesday by phone. “And the roads are incredibly slick, and my car is sliding around, and I don’t have food or drink in my car, so I was more focused on, ‘OK, how do I safely get out of this mess.’ ”\n\nLong lines of vehicles were snarled in portions of the roughly 50-mile stretch between exit 104 near Ruther Glen and exit 152 near Dumfries. Authorities closed that portion of the highway so workers could remove disabled vehicles and treat the road for snow and icing, the Virginia Department of Transportation said.\n\nHazardous conditions lingered Wednesday, as some roads still were icy, VDOT said.\n\nAnother winter storm could hit central and east-central Virginia late Thursday into Friday morning.

By 10 a.m., the family had been able to take an exit, but now was driving a road that hadn’t been plowed.\n\nMany secondary roads in the region were blocked by downed trees or wintry conditions, authorities said, so even those able to get off I-95 faced difficult travels.\n\n“Trees are down, cars are just everywhere. … It’s treacherous,” Travis told CNN by phone.\n\nAerial video from CNN affiliate WJLA showed numerous vehicles stationary Tuesday morning on four lanes of I-95 in Caroline County, south of Fredericksburg. A few people, including children, were standing outside cars. One man was walking his dog on a leash.\n\nPhalen – who had been stuck north of Fredericksburg – said she left her Fredericksburg home around 8 p.m. Monday for a trip to Alexandria which she’d expected to last just an hour.\n\nShe left Fredericksburg, she said, because her home lost power, and she also lost cell phone service there.\n\n“Because I didn’t have cell phone or internet connection at the house in Fredericksburg, I wasn’t able to see this nightmare I was walking into until I was smack dab in the middle of it, and then it was too late,” Phalen said.\n\nShe said she started with a full tank of gas, and was able to keep her car running for heat.\n\nThe Fredericksburg area received at least 14 inches of snow from the storm, according to the National Weather Service in the Baltimore/Washington area.\n\n“We know people have been stopped for extraordinary time periods leading up to these closure areas, but we are clearing trucks one by one to break through this blockage, and we will get to each driver and restore traffic flow,” Kelly Hannon, spokesperson for the VDOT Fredericksburg District, told CNN early Tuesday.\n\nA trucker, Jean-Carlo Gachet, was stuck for hours on I-95 near Dale City from about 1 a.m. Tuesday, he said.\n\nHe had food, water and a microwave, so he shared a heated breakfast with a man and his mother in a vehicle in front of him, he said. “Easily the longest traffic jam I’ve been in,” said Gachet, who said he’d left Rhode Island around 5 p.m. Monday and was trying to get to Georgia.\n\nA car is stuck in the snow in Alexandria, Virginia, as a winter snow storm hits the northern part of the state Monday. mpi34/MediaPunch /IPX/AP\n\nCNN en Español correspondent Gustavo Valdés was among those stuck in traffic.

The district recorded 8.5 inches of snow Monday, the heaviest one-day snow total since January 2016, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Capitol Heights, Maryland, recorded 11.5 inches of snow and Baltimore/Washington International Airport reported 6.7 inches.\n\nIt could take several weeks for all that snow to melt, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said, explaining that the white layer of snow cover reflects sunlight, essentially acting as a coolant that prevents the ground surface from warming enough to melt it.\n\nOn average, it takes about three days of temperatures above 50 degrees for about 2 to 4 inches of snow to melt, Javaheri said, and the Washington area is forecast to stay below that mark through at least the end of the week.\n\nA person walks along the sidewalk in Alexandria, Virginia, as a winter snow storm hits the area Monday. mpi34/MediaPunch /IPX/AP\n\n3 killed when SUV collided with snowplow, officials say\n\nThree deaths were reported in Maryland after an SUV with four occupants collided with a snowplow, according to Shiera Goff, spokesperson for the Montgomery County Police Department.

For the latest updates on the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, read USA TODAY's live hurricane coverage for Friday, Oct. 11.\n\nSIESTA KEY, Fla. − Hurricane Milton plowed into the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday after tearing a path of destruction across Florida, killing at least 14 people and knocking out power to millions, yet averting the \"worst-case scenario\" meteorologists, officials and residents had feared.\n\nMilton did not go quietly, though, flooding neighborhoods, destroying homes, ripping the roof off a major sports venue, and toppling a massive crane into an office building. Two deaths were confirmed in St. Petersburg, four in Volusia County, and one each in Polk and Citrus counties, as well as six in St. Lucie County on Florida's east coast following tornadoes there.\n\nPower outages inched higher during the day as the storm exited off the eastern coast of the state, and more than 2.6 million homes and businesses remained in the dark by late Thursday, according to poweroutage.us.\n\n\"The storm was significant, but thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a briefing Thursday. He cited the storm weakening before landfall and said the storm surge \"as initially reported has not been as significant overall as what was observed for Hurricane Helene.\"\n\nDeSantis said Tampa experienced a reverse storm surge that drove water away from the shoreline rather than overwhelming the city. The Florida Division of Emergency Management, in a post on social media, warned residents not to walk out into receding water because \"the water WILL return through storm surge and poses a life-threatening risk.\"\n\nMilton's powerful assault comes two weeks after Hurricane Helene slammed into the Florida coast on its way to devastating communities across at least seven states. Milton made landfall at about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday on the state's western coast, a Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph sustained winds amid a flurry of tornadoes it spawned.\n\nHurricane Milton tracker: Storm exits Florida at Category 1 strength after slamming west coast\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The tied-down dog whose abandonment close to a highway as Milton approached became the cause of much social media consternation was rescued by a state trooper and renamed, appropriately, Trooper.\n\n∎ Milton had pulled far away from Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean by Thursday afternoon, no longer a hurricane or a threat to land as it was more than 200 miles east of Cape Canaveral.\n\n∎ Disney World theme parks and Disney Springs will be operating again Friday, the entertainment giant said.\n\n'An apocalyptic feel': Martin County deputies help in recovery\n\nSuspected tornadoes ahead of Milton ravaged portions of southern Martin County on Wednesday, tearing through roofs, downing trees, and strewing debris onto roadways. Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said many deputies, himself included, were on-call throughout the night while they were clearing roadways and neighborhoods.\n\n\"We did that all over the county, surface roads, surface streets with trees down, and we had a couple deputies had to go to the hospital,\" Snyder said. \"One got his foot broken because they were cutting a tree and the trunk fell on his foot.\"\n\nSnyder said the sheriff's office was prepared for tropical force winds, trees down, power outages, and flooding, but they were not prepared for hundreds of homes damaged by high winds from suspected tornadoes.\n\n\"At one point we had over 500 storm-related calls for service. We were backed up, holding calls throughout the night, trying to get to everybody,\" Snyder said. \"We had people saying they were trapped. We had one woman who was picked up by the winds inside her house and thrown out into the lawn where her leg was broken.

Williams said she had planned to ride out Helene but fled when floodwaters entered her house. She said she went to the mainland for Milton. “I’m so traumatized, I was like, I have to get the heck out of here,” she said.\n\nLater Williams said her house seemed OK, although there were trees down everywhere. But the one-two punch of storms left her frustrated. \"I just wish the whole house would wash away,” she said.\n\nMilton leaves a trail of deaths across the state\n\nAt least two people died because of the hurricane in Volusia County, northeast of Orlando, sheriff's office spokesperson Andrew Gant said. Both of them − a 79-year-old woman in Ormond Beach and a 54-year-old woman in Port Orange − were killed by fallen trees, Gant said. He added that a third person perished apparently from a medical episode, but it hasn't been determined whether that was related to the storm.\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff’s Office, in the central part of Florida, confirmed one death related to Milton in a traffic accident, and another fatality was made official on Citrus County, north of Tampa. The five deaths in St. Lucie County were related to a tornadoes, including one that hit the Spanish Lakes community.\n\nIn addition, two deaths related to Milton were reported in St. Petersburg, a police official said at a news conference Thursday. St. Petersburg Chief of Police Anthony Holloway described one death as a medical-related incident. The other involved “someone that was found in a park,” he said, adding that he has not received the cause of death from the medical examiner’s office.\n\n\"Please stay off the roads,\" the police department said in a social media post. \"Traffic lights are out and trees are down everywhere.

The county medical examiner confirmed the fatalities in a news release Thursday morning. No other details were provided. A fifth death was later confirmed.\n\nA sixth person was found dead Thursday afternoon, St. Lucie County Sheriff's officials said. Sheriff Keith Pearson said search-and-rescue efforts remain underway and he hopes to find more people alive.\n\nDoug Anderson, a Lakewood Park resident, said he saw a tornado crossing Kings Highway as he was heading home from an errand around 5 p.m. Wednesday. He said the destruction in the Spanish Lakes community was jarring.\n\n\"I saw a semi knocked sideways, a truck knocked sideways,\" Anderson said. \"I followed the wreckage into Spanish Lakes.

In his Thursday briefing, Biden said \"38 tornadoes ripped through 13 counties.''\n\nIt is not uncommon for the outer rain bands of a hurricane to spin out tornadoes, but they're usually weaker and of shorter duration than the ones that preceded Milton's arrival, said Corene Matyas, a University of Florida geography professor.\n\nFive deaths in St. Lucie County in the state's east coast have been blamed on tornadoes, which took by surprise many who were only expecting to grapple with Milton.\n\n\"I was trying to get prepared for the hurricane and a tornado hit,\" said Calvin Lee Hamilton, 57, a lifelong county resident who saw a twister tear off roofs in his neighborhood. \"The tornado hit before the hurricane. It was a double disaster.\"\n\nIn Florida floodwaters, beware of alligators\n\nResidents of areas hit by hurricanes are often warned to avoid floodwaters, which may contain sewage, debris and fallen power lines. In Florida, the dangers also include alligators and other reptiles.\n\nAn alligator was caught on video swimming in floodwaters next to a Florida road after Hurricane Helene hit the state, and more may be spotted in areas close to humans after Milton.\n\n“Alligators & #snakes may be seen more frequently in areas with flooding,\" the state's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a social media posting Thursday. “Keep them at a distance & give them space.’’\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\nFor single mom in St. Petersburg, 'by far the worst storm'\n\nKatie Williams, of St. Petersburg, said Hurricane Milton was “by far the worst storm” she’s ever experienced.\n\nThe single mother wanted to evacuate, but said a rare eye condition forced her to shelter in her second-floor apartment with her 10-year-old daughter, Kiley, and her adopted cat, Honey.\n\nWilliams, 32, said it felt at one point as if the winds were “shaking the house.” After the power went out around 8 p.m., she lit candles so they wouldn’t be in the dark. Then her water went out and she lost cell service.\n\nOn Thursday, Williams ventured outside to check on her neighbors. She said there were “trees down everywhere” and countless power poles that had collapsed.\n\nIn Palm Harbor, 'scary' wind but less damage than expected\n\nIn Palm Harbor, Debbie Pace emerged from her home Thursday, curious to see what damage Milton had inflicted.\n\nFrom midday Wednesday, she and her family had hunkered down in their boarded-up home, just north of Clearwater. The power went out and for several hours the wind sustained a furious howl that “didn’t let you breathe,” said Pace, 52.\n\n“The wind was scary,” she said. “I could tell my kids were getting a little nervous. They would tell me to look outside now and again when we were playing Candyland and Chutes and Ladders.”\n\nWhile she lost a section of her fence and tree limbs littered the neighborhood, Pace said the damage was not as bad as she had anticipated. Her main worry now is power won’t be restored before food in her fridge spoils.\n\n“I ordered a generator a few days ago but it kept getting delayed,” she said. “It says it’s getting delivered Friday, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.”\n\nThis Sarasota home was unscathed\n\nIn the Grenada neighborhood of Sarasota, Ron Collins watched as his wife cut up tree branches with an electric saw Thursday morning. The couple remained in their home during the storm, even though it was in a mandatory evacuation area, because Collins designed the house for a worst-case scenario.\n\nA now-retired structural engineer who uses a power wheelchair, Collins said being unable to walk factored into their decision to stay for Milton. He preemptively had charged several spare batteries for his wheelchair to prepare for losing power: “Battery management has become my life,” said Collins, 68.“We did have a conversation about whether to evacuate when it was Category 4 looking like maybe becoming a Category 5,” Collins said. “But the human condition is that when it’s easy to evacuate, it’s too soon to know whether you really need to evacuate.”\n\nThe couple moved into the single-story concrete home in 2012. The roof is clad in inch-thick shielding to prevent branches stabbing through. The home was not damaged by Milton.“This house was built so we could shelter in place,'' Collins said. \"That was always the plan when we moved here.”\n\nDeSantis dismisses analyst estimates for Milton damage\n\nDeSantis said Thursday dozens of rescues had taken place and more were underway. He said he expected bridges, gas stations and big box stores that had been forced to close would be opening quickly. Although at least five fatalities were confirmed by local officials, DeSantis said he could not confirm any deaths yet. And he dismissed efforts by insurance experts at estimating the damage.\n\n\"How the hell would a Wall Street analyst be able to know?\" DeSantis said in response to a question on analyst estimates. \"Its been dark all day. ... Give me a break on some of this stuff. They are doing damage assessments now.\"\n\nHunkering down in St. Petersburg hospital\n\nDr. Meghan Martin, a pediatric emergency physician in St. Petersburg, worked through the night as Hurricane Milton made landfall along the Gulf Coast and roared across the state. At the hospital with her children, Martin said evidence of Milton's power was visible across the area.\n\nMartin said she occasionally logged into cameras set up outside her home to see whether floodwater seeped inside, as it had during Hurricane Helene. Martin, who runs a popular TikTok account, said she and most of the St. Petersburg area were spared from the storm surge, though the wind was ferocious.\n\n“I could barely watch the trail cam because of the wind, the rain and the projectiles that were rolling by,” she said. “It was just impossible to see anything.”\n\nWhy was Tampa spared?\n\nStorms that make landfall to the south of Tampa usually mean less storm surge for Tampa. Because Milton roared ashore with its center of circulation just a little over 20 miles to the south, the especially vulnerable Tampa Bay narrowly averted the most catastrophic storm surge. While water rocketed higher at tide gauges along the coast south of Siesta Key and Sarasota as Milton made landfall Wednesday, gauges plunged around the bay.\n\nStorm surge can happen near and to the right of where a storm makes landfall, but negative water levels can occur to the left of the landfall location, weather service meteorologist Ernie Jillson has said.\n\n\"Bays are more susceptible because they're like a bowl of water,” Jillson told USA TODAY. “They're protected by land on all sides except one, so that's why they're so susceptible to being emptied out.”\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nWhy Tampa Bay was spared: City averted catastrophic storm surge from Hurricane Milton. Here's why.\n\nFor some, Milton not as bad as Ian two years ago\n\nAt the Peace River Campground outside of Arcadia, about 50 miles north of Fort Myers, Paul Massey and his wife Cheryl carried a chair that Milton’s rains had ruined to the campground road – cleaning up Thursday from bursts of high winds and rain in this rural area.\n\nBut it was nothing like two years ago, when Hurricane Ian flooded 2,000 homes and at least 100 RVs where people were living in the Peace River area, they said. This time, Arcadia and the campground were largely unscathed.\n\nStill, they were keeping their eyes on the river just past a thicket of trees laden with Spanish Moss. After the storm, the river had started to creep up just a little, though Paul Massey doubted it would flood them out. As he spoke, a friend pulled up in a truck as he too checked the river levels.\n\n“Are you guys coming back?” Massey asked. \"Not yet,\" the friend said, explaining he would hold off because he couldn't get flood coverage for his RV. “If we could get full coverage, we’d be back, but we can’t.\"\n\n-Chris Kenning, USA TODAY\n\nIn Punta Gorda, storm tosses boats onto lawns\n\nIn Punta Gorda, 100 miles south of Tampa, residents woke Thursday to find Milton’s fierce winds and storm surge were powerful enough to deposit large sailboats on front lawns. The city, perched on the Peace River and Charlotte Harbor, also faced flooded neighborhoods and scattered piles of debris still sitting at curbs after Hurricane Helene barely two weeks ago. Some homes had broken water lines and the town’s power was out.\n\nJeff Weiler, riding his bike while taking his dog Einstein for a walk, said his home had been battered by a piece of dock. Worst of all, he said, his \"life's ambition\" − a recently purchased, 60-foot motor boat − had been damaged beyond repair.\n\n“I just cashed in my retirement to buy that boat,” he said, choking back tears. “It’s gone.”\n\nBiden, DeSantis discuss hurricane damage\n\nBiden spoke Thursday morning with DeSantis about the impacts of Hurricane Milton, the White House said in a statement. DeSantis told the president that officials are still assessing the damage across the state, and Biden reiterated that he would provide whatever support is needed to speed up the response and recovery, the statement said.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell participated in the call and planned to survey the impact with the governor Thursday.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nMilton turns pond 'into an ocean'\n\nIn New Port Richey, about an hour northwest of Tampa, Lloyd Anoa’i and his neighbors remain trapped in their houses hours after Hurricane Milton blanketed roads and driveways in several feet of floodwater. Anoa’i, 53, said Milton’s torrential rain turned the pond behind his house “into an ocean.” As the heaviest rain was coming down, Anoa’i ran to his car and moved it from his driveway to the highest point of his yard before water could reach the doors.\n\n“The water was like two and a half feet deep on my legs,” he told USA TODAY by phone Thursday. “It's crazy. Now nobody can go anywhere.”\n\nSome water seeped into a back bedroom through floor panels. Meanwhile, the storm’s wind kept Anoa’i and his family on alert as their conversation was interrupted by occasional, booming thuds – what he believes were tree limbs falling on the roof.\n\n\"It was pretty rough,” he said. “You could feel the house just trembling.”\n\nSome areas hit with 16 inches of rain\n\nThe eye of the storm made landfall in Siesta Key, a barrier island off Sarasota about 50 miles south of Tampa. In downtown Tampa early Thursday, fierce winds downed traffic lights, ripped signs out of the ground and sent construction barricades scudding across the wet pavement. Milton’s winds also shredded plywood meant to keep the storm out, and a portion of a downtown building’s brick facade collapsed, partially blocking a road.\n\nA flash flood emergency was in effect for Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater, the hurricane center said, after parts of the area were blasted with more than 16 inches of rain. Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected across portions of the east-central to northeast Florida coast through Thursday morning, the hurricane center said in its morning update.\n\n\"This rainfall will continue to bring the risk of considerable flash and urban flooding, along with moderate to major river flooding,\" the updated warned.\n\n15 people rescued from Tampa home damaged by fallen tree\n\nFifteen people, including several young children, were rescued from a Tampa home Wednesday night after it was struck by a collapsed tree, officials said. Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw told reporters at a news conference Thursday that the family was taken to a shelter at a nearby elementary school.\n\nA tree fell on another home in the Tampa area, causing several injuries, Tampa Fire Chief Barbara Tripp said. It’s unclear how many people were in the house and were rescued by firefighters. Tripp said her team responded to over 100 emergency calls through the night, including many reporting fire alarms, downed power lines and minor medical issues.\n\nTampa zoo animals are safe after Milton\n\nZooTampa said Thursday that it was without power because of Hurricane Milton, but the zoo's hurricane ride-out team made it through the night, spokeswoman Sandra Torres told USA TODAY in an email. The zoo “sustained some damage” from high winds, Torres said, and cleanup and recovery efforts will begin later, after a full assessment and once roads are safe to travel. For now, the zoo said, all animals will remain in their night houses and hurricane shelter locations.\n\n\"All 1,000 animals entrusted in our care are safe,\" Torres said. “We’re doing OK and thankful that we survived hurricane Milton.\"\n\nThe zoo’s six orangutans shared their night house with birds they had never seen before, said Tiffany Burns, ZooTampa’s senior director of animal programs. The “very intelligent, very intuitive” orangutans were fascinated by being around their new neighbors and some of their “different personalities” came out as a result, Burns said.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nSt. Pete Beach resident not allowed to return home yet\n\nDavid Green, who sheltered at a loved one’s home in Valrico, Florida, just east of Tampa, said Hurricane Milton’s winds were some of the worst he’s experienced. Green, 62, – whose house in St. Pete Beach had to be completely emptied after it was flooded by Helene – took to the interior hallways and closets as Milton bore down. He, his family and several dogs huddled as they listened to what sounded like branches crash on the roof.\n\n“Streets are flooded here. Lots of trees down,\" he texted to USA TODAY. \"Lots of vinyl and wood fences down in the neighborhood.\"\n\nEager to see whether there was any damage at his home, Green hopes he will soon be able to drive into St. Pete Beach. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office announced early Thursday that all roads into the county, which encompasses St. Pete Beach and the city of St. Petersburg, will be \"closed until further notice due to hazardous conditions.\" Rescue efforts were underway in the county, the sheriff's office said in social media posts Thursday.\n\n\"Several trees down, wires down and hazards throughout Pinellas County,\" one post said. \"Continue to shelter in place.\"\n\n'It wasn't too bad': Lt. Dan survives storm on 22-foot sailboat\n\nJoe Malinowski, who became known as Lt. Dan for riding out Milton on his 22-foot sailboat, said he had no problems during the storm, raising his arm in triumph as the sun rose over Tampa Bay on Thursday morning.Malinowski, 54, had been live-streaming his adventures aboard the Seashell for several days, catching media attention for his plan to stay moored in the harbor as Milton passed.“The hand of God was over Tampa,” Malinowski declared Friday morning. “It wasn’t too bad.”Thursday morning, a growing stream of Tampa residents made their way to Bayshore Boulevard to check on Malinowski, whose “Lt. Dan” nickname refers to a similarly disabled Forrest Gump movie character. Malinowski is missing his lower left leg.“You made it! I’m so glad you’re safe,” Tampa resident Monet Rahall, 28, called down to Malinowski.Rahall said she had to come check on Malinowski for herself, after watching his videos while she rode out the storm at her nearby home.“He’s an icon,” she said. “I saw him on the internet and wanted to see him for myself.”\n\nStorm tears hole in airport roof\n\nMilton's race across the state brought torrential rain and flash floods to parts of the east coast and left Melbourne Orlando International Airport with a 30-by-40-foot hole in the roof. A large part of the airport's ceiling came down about 2 a.m., according to Greg Donovan, executive director of the airport about an hour east of Orlando.\n\n\"We had a large section of our skylight, technically called a caul wall, come down in the center of the terminal,\" Donovan said. The good news, he said, was that it \"been really dry since that initial wave so we haven't had a lot of water intrusion.\"\n\nThe airport was closed at the time and no injuries were reported. Donovan said he was was mobilizing crews to patch the roof and limit water damage.\n\n− Jeffrey Meesey and Jennifer Sangalang, Florida Today\n\nCoastal community of Venice begins assessing damage\n\nIn Venice, 70 miles south of Tampa, there were widespread power outages and loss of cellphone service in some areas Thursday. The city said assessment teams were starting to examine flooding and other storm damage and asked people to stay off those roads a little longer.\n\nBecause so many elderly people retire in Venice − the city’s median age is 68 years old, compared to 38 for the U.S − local officials had worked closely with their state counterparts to evacuate nursing home residents and others who could not move themselves.\n\nCrane collapsed into Tampa Bay Times' office building\n\nOfficials reported late Wednesday that a crane collapsed near a building construction site in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida. According to the Tampa Bay Times, the crane left a gaping hole in an office building that houses several businesses, including the newspaper. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\n“The biggest thing right now is just reminding focus to stay off the roadway. Almost all of our traffic lights are out and people should treat those as a 4-way stop,” said Venice spokeswoman Brianne Lorenz. “There is a lot of debris and down powerlines so the roadways are not safe yet.”\n\n“The public is urged to continue to shelter in place” but avoid the area, the city of St. Petersburg said in a statement.\n\n\"We can confirm one crane cab in the upper section of the mast has fallen,\" said John Catsimatidis, the CEO of Red Apple Group, which is developing the skyscraper, the Times reported. \"We are working with city officials and others to assess the situation.\"\n\nMLB stadium Tropicana Field damaged\n\nMilton battered the Tampa Bay area with high winds and heavy rains after making landfall late Wednesday. St. Petersburg, Florida, officials confirmed that destructive winds damaged the roof at Tropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays. The ballpark was repurposed as a base camp for thousands of emergency responders as Florida braced for Milton. Footage from local television stations and photos shared on social media showed part of the stadium’s roof torn off amid high winds.\n\nThe domed stadium has been home to the Tampa Bay Rays since the team's inaugural season in 1998, though plans are in the works to replace it by 2028. It's among the smallest MLB stadiums by seating capacity, but Tropicana Field features a slanted roof designed at an angle in part to better protect it from hurricanes.\n\n− Eric Lagatta\n\nFirst responders limited during height of Milton\n\nThe high speed winds blowing off Hurricane Milton and whipping into tornadoes were keeping first responders along Florida’s Gulf Coast off the roads and unable to attempt any rescues when the storm hit. Florida authorities had been warning that although people can call 911 for help over the phone, they would effectively be on their own until Milton passed over. The warning came after 911 centers received a number of calls at the height of Hurricane Helene that authorities could not answer.\n\n“None of us want to sit on our thumbs not being able to do what we want to do,” said Nick Pachota, a veteran first responder and mayor of Venice, Florida. “But unfortunately if one of us gets hurt there’s no one to rescue the rescuer.”\n\n− Michael Loria\n\n'We will not be able to come': Hurricane Milton forces first responders to hunker down\n\nWhere did Hurricane Milton make landfall?\n\nThe center of Milton came ashore near Siesta Key as a Category 3 hurricane with 120-mph winds at 8:30 p.m., according to the National Hurricane Center. Siesta Key is a barrier island with 5,500 residents about five miles south of Sarasota or 50 miles south of Tampa on Florida's west coast. It's just over 100 miles southwest of Orlando. The storm took a northeasterly path through the state Peninsula, exiting near Cape Canaveral.\n\nOn the forecast track, the center of Milton will move away from Florida and to the north of the Bahamas on Thursday.\n\n− Cheryl McCloud and C. A. Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\n\nTornadoes rip through southwest Florida\n\nReported tornadoes tore through parts of southwest Florida on Wednesday, including in Collier County and Lee County, causing extensive damage across Fort Myers and Cape Coral.\n\nNorth Fort Myers resident Scott Fincher was sitting on the lanai of his Pine Lakes community home with his family, waiting for Milton. As they waited, they passed the time watching the local news, which was reporting on the \"tornado outbreak.”\n\nReporters then announced a tornado was headed into sister community Lake Fairways, which shares a boundary with Pine Lakes. That’s when Fincher knew: they had to hide.\n\nFincher immediately began moving everyone into the home: his wife, his sister-in-law and his dog. “Just as we were moving everybody in, that’s when it came through,” Fincher said, “and when I heard the rumbling.”\n\n“It was a wall of black,” Fincher said. “It was just as black as could be . . . I felt fear. You could feel the ground shaking a little bit, the house and everything.”\n\n− Kate Cimini, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nAnalysts: Hurricane Milton could cost insurers up to $100 billion\n\nHurricane Milton could result in losses of up to $100 billion for the global insurance industry, creating a surge in 2025 reinsurance prices that could boost some insurance companies' shares, analysts said Wednesday.\n\nMilton, which slammed into Florida's already storm-blasted west coast Wednesday night, spawned at least 19 tornadoes and caused damage in numerous counties, destroying around 125 homes, most of them mobile homes, according to Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"At this point, it's too dangerous to evacuate safely, so you have to shelter in place and just hunker down,\" DeSantis said upon announcing the landfall.\n\nInsured losses from Milton could range from $60 billion to $100 billion if the hurricane makes direct landfall in the densely populated area of Tampa, analysts at Morningstar DBRS said. A loss of $100 billion would put Milton on par with Katrina in 2005, they added, adding that insured losses would likely be \"substantial but not catastrophic.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/03/05/greys-anatomy-how-alex-karev-justin-chambers-said-goodbye/4955659002/", "title": "'Grey's Anatomy': Alex Karev says goodbye, reunites with Izzie Stevens", "text": "Sixteen seasons in, \"Grey's Anatomy\" still knows how to shock its audience – even though, in retrospect, we should've seen that coming.\n\nABC promised us the March 5 episode would be Alex Karev's send-off episode – and whew, was it send-off: He left his wife Jo (Camilla Luddington) to reunite offscreen with ex-wife Izzie (Katherine Heigl) ... and the two children Izzie had using frozen embryos the two made back in season five.\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nThe episode, which was chock-full of montages of seasons past, featured Jo , best friend Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and former boss Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) all reading letters from him (the return address was from Kansas; Meredith's just read \"Evil Spawn,\" a nod to his former nickname).\n\nHe says goodbye (via voiceover) to each of the three women in individual letters.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFirst up was his letter to Meredith: Alex apparently called Izzie earlier this season when he was looking for people to speak up for Meredith during the trial where she fought to keep her medical license – finally, a good enough excuse to call his ex. He learned Izzie, now a surgical oncologist, was single and had his five-year-old twins.\n\n\"You are my best friend and I will miss the hell out of you,\" he told Meredith.\n\nNext up, Jo: \"It's officially the worst thing I've ever done,\" Alex says in his letter to Jo. And it basically is: He admits he's in love with Izzie (though says he loves Jo, too – it's just that Izzie has his kids, and he wants to be there for them like his and Jo's families weren't ). Keep in mind this was after a rough few seasons where Jo confronted her abusive (now deceased) husband and the birth mother she never knew, and still came out stronger on the other side.\n\nThen, Bailey: Karev tells her she helped him grow the hell up, and references when she took a bullet out of his stomach. He says goodbye and thank you. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), another former boss, reflects on his relationship with Alex during an AA meeting after receiving a letter of his own.\n\nThis episode proved polarizing for \"Grey's\" fans on social media. But that doesn't take away from the legacy Alex Karev left us.\n\nWhen was Justin Chambers last on 'Grey's Anatomy?'\n\nChambers last appeared as Karev in the Nov. 14 episode of \"Grey's,\" but unbeknownst to fans at the time, it was his final performance. He was said to be helping his mother in Iowa ... though we learned in last week's episode on Feb. 28 he wasn't there at all.\n\nABC confirmed the news in January, as did the actor in a statement from his agent Stephen Hirsh.\n\n\"As I move on from 'Grey’s Anatomy,' I want to thank the ABC family, (executive producer) Shonda Rhimes, original cast members Ellen Pompeo, Chandra Wilson and James Pickens, and the rest of the amazing cast and crew, both past and present, and, of course, the fans for an extraordinary ride,\" he said.\n\nWith Chambers' departure, the show, now in its 16th season, is down to those three original cast members. The series premiered in March 2005.\n\nPompeo took to social media to celebrate the episode, sharing a video of their two characters throughout the years.\n\n\"For me personally for Karev to go back to the beginning.... was the best possible storyline,\" Pompeo wrote on Instagram Friday. \"It pays homage to those incredible first years and the incredible cast ...that created a foundation so strong that the show is still standing. So let’s not be sad.\"\n\nThe news that shook 'Grey's Anatomy' fans to their core: 'Grey's Anatomy' star Justin Chambers to exit show after 15 years\n\nA timeline of Alex Karev's journey on Grey's Anatomy (and why we'll miss him)\n\n\"Grey's Anatomy\" won't be the same without Alex – and it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out why.\n\nKarev – or as longtime \"Grey's Anatomy\" fans know him, \"Evil Spawn\" – has been a prominent doctor on the series since the beginning. Through 349 episodes, fans have watched him get married (then divorced), survive a gunshot wound, narrowly avoid a plane crash and get remarried. He rose from an intern to a resident to an attending pediatric surgeon to chief of surgery. Hey, it's been a lot of seasons.\n\nKarev started the series as a misogynistic, lazy jerk but turned into a lovable, reliable surgeon and friend (with many ups and downs in between). We learned an unstable childhood was to blame for much of his attitude. Yes, over the course of the series he cheated on his wife, Izzie . And yes, he ratted out a colleague after she tampered with a clinical trial, but he learned from those moments .\n\nHis marriage to Izzie in the wake of her cancer battle was beautiful, though it quickly flamed out the following season (the divorce occurred offscreen). Over time, he became even closer with the other remaining interns Meredith and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh). When Yang's departed at the end of Season 10, Karev effectively became Meredith's \"person,\" or best, best friend.\n\nHe eventually found love with new wife Jo , and all seemed to be going swimmingly for the pair, despite a mental health scare and their employment at different hospitals. He became chief of surgery at lower-tier hospital Pac North after getting fired from Grey-Sloan earlier this season because of Meredith.\n\nAnd that's the toughest part of why we'll miss him: He was there for her as she dealt with her best friend moving away and her husband's death. He was there for both his wives when they needed him most. He was there for his mentor, Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), after she lost her leg (he even performed the amputation).\n\nHe was there for us as we watched a succession of doctors depart the series. Karev was a constant; Where else would he go? After a rough upbringing, he craved stability – making the timing of his exit all the more perplexing.\n\nThen again: Maybe Izzie was that stability all along.\n\nWe'll have a powdered sugar donut in your honor, Karev.

Buffalo challenged whether Worthy had possession and ultimately ruled he did. Four plays later, Mahomes ran it in from one yard out.\n\nChiefs 21, Bills 10\n\nMust-see play: Bills punt, Chiefs get excellent field position on return\n\nJosh Allen threw three incomplete passes in a row and the Bills offense had to punt for the second time in the first half.

Harrison Butker's extra point is good and the Chiefs take the lead with 4:13 to go in the first half.\n\nMahomes completed all five pass attempts on the drive and scrambled for six yards on a crucial 4th-and-1 conversion to keep the drive going near midfield.\n\nChiefs 14, Bills 10\n\nChiefs-Bills score: James Cook gives Buffalo the lead\n\nThe Bills offense capitalized on Patrick Mahomes' fumble with a 10-play, 72-yard scoring drive that culminated in running back James Cook sprinting down the left side for a six-yard touchdown run.

Buffalo will take over on offense with 57 seconds to go in the first quarter.\n\nChiefs-Bills score: Buffalo gets on the board with Tyler Bass FG\n\nBuffalo's second offensive drive of the game went much better than the first as the Bills picked up a pair of first downs. A fumbled exchange between Josh Allen and running back James Cook on 2nd-and-5 from the Chiefs' 35-yard line stopped the Bills' progress, though, and Buffalo couldn't convert on 3rd-and-9.

The Des Moines Register will be providing updates as more information becomes available.\n\n5:05 p.m. 'Sun showed the true devastation'\n\nMadison County Sheriff Jason Barnes did not sleep overnight. At 11 a.m. Sunday, Barnes talked to residents just northeast of U.S. HWY 169.\n\nOn Saturday night Barnes had said, “It looked like a bomb went off.” As he was out surveying the damage and talking to residents, he said it was even worse than he initially thought.\n\n“It’s every bit of last night and more,” Barnes said. “Sun showed the true devastation.” - Philip Joens\n\n5:02 p.m. Wedding dress of Cecilia Lloyd, who died in the Winterset tornado, is recovered from the rubble\n\nMichelle McCool lives three houses south on Carver Road of Cecilia and Tom Lloyd’s house. She and her husband watched the tornado go past their house and turn before they lost sight of it. She had never been through a tornado before.\n\n“I thought it was a loud truck coming up the road,” McCool said. “And it got louder, louder. You could see the debris in the clouds as it went over.”\n\nVolunteers at the Lloyd’s house treated McCool like the foreperson there. McCool kept the most precious personal belongings found — a film reel, social security cards, a Bible and even glassware that survived without breaking — in her pickup truck. She coordinated with people who had questions and occasionally gave out orders. The son of Cecilia and Tom Lloyd was in the hospital with his dad. Cecilia was one of six in Winterset who died as a result of the tornado.\n\nAround 2:30 p.m., a volunteer found Cecilia Lloyd’s wedding dress wrapped in a garment bag. McCool placed the old lace dress in the passenger seat of her pickup and couldn’t help but tremble.\n\n“That’s sad,” McCool said as she choked up. “Especially knowing she didn’t make it.\n\n“That’s the tough stuff. It’s the personal side of it, you know?”\n\nWinterset residents, including McCool, said that the community spirit shown Sunday felt important. People came from as far away as Pella, New Sharon and Pleasant Hill to clean up.\n\n“It brings you tears,” McCool said. “You always hear about the bad in the world, (then) you see this. There are good people. This is what matters.” - Philip Joens\n\n4:39 p.m. MidAmerican reports fewer than 1,000 still without power\n\nAbout 800 customers are still without power primarily in the southern and southeastern parts of the Des Moines metro, said MidAmerican Media Relations Manager Geoff Greenwood.\n\nAs of 4:30 p.m., 558 of those customers are in Des Moines and greater Polk County and 157 are in Norwalk and greater Warren County. At its peak Saturday, MidAmerican reports that about 10,500 customers were affected.\n\nSunday night's anticipated snowfall may slow crews down, with some residents expected to be without power through at least tomorrow, Greenwood said.\n\n4:17 p.m. A meaningful treehouse stood no chance during Saturday's tornadoes\n\nSheltering in their basement during Saturday's tornadoes, Von and Chris Miller of Pleasant Hill had no idea what kind of damage their property would sustain.\n\nNow, on Sunday, friends and family have gathered to help the Millers clean up downed trees and the wreckage that remains of the family's gazebo and treehouse. This was the first tornado the couple had experienced while living in their Pleasant Hill home, but both were prepared for the storms.\n\n\"We both grew up on farms in Iowa,\" Chris Miller said. \"If it wasn't like right outside your house, you just stood outside and watched it.\"\n\nThe Millers lost power around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and expect to be without power for a couple weeks, as several of the utility poles holding power lines in their neighborhood either snapped or were leveled completely.\n\nMORE: As they clean up, Iowans share harrowing stories of destruction, survival from Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather\n\n\"We are very fortunate and very lucky that our house is still livable,\" Von said. \"The neighbors lost their roof, two houses down she lost her whole house. It was on a slab and it's just gone.\"\n\nWhile their house took less severe damage, the treehouse destroyed in the tornado held special meaning for the family.\n\n\"We'll probably put something out there (to replace it),\" Von said. \"The sad thing is, when we added onto this house, we had an old two-story garage that was kind of pulling off. Our daughter asked what we were going to do with it.\n\n\"My daughter and I tore it down, pulled all the nails out, salvaged all the wood and built a two-story treehouse. And now that's gone. It's kind of sad.\"\n\nParts of the treehouse and gazebo were blown onto neighboring property, and pieces of neighbors' property are now in the Millers' yard. - Grace Altenhofen\n\n4:12 p.m. NWS Des Moines says to be prepared for winter weather Sunday night\n\nPeak snowfall will occur between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. from Sunday night to early Monday morning. \"Be prepared for possible slick roads,\" NWS said in a tweet.\n\nMORE: What is a 'wedge' tornado and did we see one in Iowa on Saturday?\n\nThe most amount of snow is predicted to happen in southeast Iowa, although Winterset and Chariton, two of the cities most affected by Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather, are included in the NWS map.\n\n3:45 p.m. Winterset boys basketball plays in the state tournament Tuesday. On Sunday, they were cleaning up tornado damage\n\nWhen a devastating tornado hit Winterset Saturday, members of the Winterset Huskies boys basketball team sprang to action.\n\nTuesday at 3:45 p.m., No. 4 seed Winterset (19-5) will play No. 5 seed Marion (19-5) in the Class 3A boys state basketball tournament at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines.\n\nSunday, however, the Huskies were far from the court, at the home of Cecilia Lloyd, 72, who was killed in the tornado.\n\nAn overturned Cadillac rested where a three-car garage used to be. Photos, statues, video tapes and other knick-knacks sat scattered across the property Cecilia Lloyd shared with her husband Tom Lloyd, who was seriously injured.\n\nWinterset head coach Josh Henry picked up personal belongings shortly after arriving at about 1:30 p.m. Henry and other Huskies never imagined they’d be working in the mud on a bitterly cold day in Winterset three days before their state tournament appearance.\n\nBut at Cecilia Lloyd’s home, life humbled Henry and his players.\n\n“It’s way more than basketball. We preach that to our guys anyway,” Henry said. “This is real life seeing that play out. Picking up clothes and personal belongings, it shows you that life is way more than basketball or any sport.”\n\nThe stakes Tuesday at Wells Fargo Arena will be high. Henry and his team want to win. But this is life, he said. That's so, so much more important. Brayden Dinkla, one of Winterset's players, told the Register a cheerleader's house was destroyed, as was the house of an uncle of one of the players.\n\n“We as a society put so much emphasis on sports,\" Henry said. \"But things like this help everyone open their eyes up.”\n\nMORE: See photos and videos of damage from the tornadoes and severe weather that swept through Iowa on Saturday\n\nSenior Blake Bellamy is a forward for Winterset. He met up with Henry and several of his teammates at 1 p.m. to clean up at houses around Winterset.\n\nLike his teammates, Bellamy is excited for Tuesday. When the tornado hit Saturday, he was in Des Moines. Bellamy echoed his coach’s sentiment that this showed the importance of sports as an escape, but that they also have their place.\n\n“At the end of the day basketball is just basketball. This is real life stuff that needs to be done before basketball,” Bellamy said. “Basketball doesn’t come first when stuff like this happens.”\n\n3:20 p.m. Red Haw State Park in Chariton has extensive damage and will be closed for the time being\n\nIowa DNR spokesperson Tammie Krausman said there was extensive damage to trees, a few beach docks and then campground, where a woman was ultimately killed at Red Haw State Park in Chariton, Iowa.\n\nTwo shelters and a storage building are \"pretty much demolished,\" she said.\n\nKrausman said they still don't know the full extent of damage.

That’s what we do. We show up. We take care of our family. We take care of our neighbors. We take care of our community.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of Iowans and the way that they always step up and respond and I'm so proud of local leaders and the coordination that takes place every time we have an emergency disaster.\"\n\n2:03 p.m. Kim Reynolds calls the damage in Winterset 'devastating'\n\nDuring her 2 p.m. press conference following a tour of damage from the Winterset tornado, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds opened by calling the damage \"devastating.\"\n\n\"It was unimaginable the destruction we were able to witness on the brief tour we just went through,\" she said.\n\n1:31 p.m. Saturday's formation could be a 'wedge' tornado\n\nA tornado that hit Madison County in Iowa Saturday and killed six people there was so wide it could be considered a wedge tornado.\n\nThe term is pretty subjective and based on appearances, said National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Krull. There aren't any exact measurements that define a wedge tornado, only that the formation is very large — typically short and wide.\n\nThe Register has more information on wedge tornadoes online.\n\n1:17 p.m. Faith Mathews felt the tornado pulling her away as she ran inside\n\nAt the end of a particularly hard-hit stretch of Southeast Sixth Avenue in Runnells, a long line of 120-foot high MidAmerican highline wooden power lines were toppled, prohibiting people who wanted to help about six neighbors whose homes and barns were severely damaged in the storm.\n\nFaith Mathews said she and her husband David had just returned home on Saturday around 4:30 p.m. and were assessing the weather when they both heard the wind making a strange sound.\n\nDavid yelled at Faith from outside the house to get down into the basement.\n\nFaith said she could feel the tornado pulling her away from the house as she made her way down toward the basement. She covered their dog with her body. David covered them both with his.\n\nWhen they finally were able to get up, their home was completely destroyed.\n\nThe tornado tore the roof off the three-bedroom home and crumbled the brick walls. The Mathews’ coffee business, American Pride Roasters, which sells beans at the downtown Des Moines Farmers Market, also was destroyed. A Lance camper the couple purchased last fall sat upside down on the couple’s Corvette. Two Ford pickups also were damaged. The house was uninhabitable.\n\n“You just think this isn’t real,” said Faith Mathews, who is 45. “I don’t know how I feel really. I think I’m still in a lot of shock.”\n\nBy noon Sunday, numerous people had reached out to help the neighbors along Southeast Sixth Ave, though many could not get near the homes and farms.\n\n“It’s so amazing how people reach out,” Faith Mathews said. “We’ll rebuild. It’s all we can do.”\n\nIn the farm field next to the Mathews home, corn stalks were bent to the ground toward the east, the direction of the tornado. Grain wagons from a five-generation farm a half mile away were tossed around like children’s toys.\n\nThe grain wagons belonged to Tim Fritz, who lost his 180-year-old barn, original to the family farm he grew up on, when the tornado tore through from the 8400 block to 9300 block of Southeast Sixth.\n\nDowned trees and other debris also lay in the field. Fritz and his girlfriend Julie were hauling cattle to southwest Iowa when the tornado hit, they said.\n\nAt Four Mile Elementary School, members of the Red Cross, the Polk County Sheriff’s Department, Pleasant Hill Fire Department and other volunteers stood by to help families who stopped in infrequently needing help.\n\nBut most neighbors who were affected, as well as their family and their friends, were busy cleaning up the widespread damage on their properties as snow was forecast to hit the area by evening. - Lee Rood\n\n1:10 p.m. Professor estimates $1 billion in damages after Iowa tornado, severe weather\n\nNorthern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini told the Associated Press that Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather across Iowa, combined with wind damage as far away as Illinois, likely caused more than $1 billion in damages.\n\n1:02 p.m. 'It was so loud, it was quiet. I don't know how else to describe it.'\n\nJosie Carter and her father Chad Carter rode out the Winterset tornado in the basement of their home on top of a tall hill about a mile northeast of U.S. HWY 169. On Sunday morning, a small army of volunteers helped them clean up what remained of their home.\n\n“It was so loud, it was quiet,” Josie Carter, 17, said. “I don’t know how else to describe it. I could hear it was a big wind storm, then so much was going on. It just went quiet and still. I want to say that was the eye.”\n\n“I just remember the pressure,” Chad Carter added.\n\nThey narrowly survived, they said.\n\n“I was able to get to the basement and the door slammed because of the wind, but (my dad) was still at the bottom of the stairs. He didn’t quite get into the basement. So I thought he was gone,” Josie Carter said.\n\nThe Carters moved into the home about eight years ago. On Sunday morning, they found a few pictures and keepsakes among the rubble.\n\n“No treasures yet,” Chad Carter said. - Philip Joens\n\n12:54 p.m. Description of a man being inside a Chariton camper that was thrown into the air\n\nThe owner of Country Cabins in Chariton, Nick Cattell, told the Register a man was in one of his campers when it was propelled in the air by a tornado Saturday.\n\n12:48 p.m. HyVee offers meals to impacted families\n\nEmergency centers are continuing to serve impacted areas Sunday.

A place where children could “get their fingers off them damn contraptions,” as Paulsen puts it.\n\nAnd throughout the years, he said he’s always heard the phrase: “I wish I had something like this in my hometown.” People didn’t think his dream could fly, he said, but it did.\n\n“It’s the neatest place in southern Iowa,” Paulsen, 83, said of his western rustic-meets-retro establishment. Old CDs, guitars, western posters and cowboy hats still don the panels and walls of what’s left of the structure.\n\nBut the Soda Pop Saloon wasn’t hit the hardest on his property, which is called the Frontier Trading Post. It stood upright, despite a large swath of its roof blown off. Next door, the family’s antique barn, was destroyed.\n\nAnd just a little further, trailers, a large Conex cargo container and fishing merchandise propelled from the tornado laid scattered across the family’s 8-acre property, hundreds of feet away from where they should be.\n\n“It’s like God came down, rolled the trailer into a ball and threw it back down to the ground,” said Cindy Reyes, Paulsen’s daughter, of their Diamond Trio trailer discovered upside down in trees, crushed and crumpled.\n\nThe Diamond Trio is a country band Paulsen started with his sister, Charlotte, and Reyes – another one of Paulsen’s dreams.\n\nOn Sunday, the Paulsen family came together to asses the damage and make sure their loved ones were accounted for. Humor plays a large part in the family’s make up – Norm Paulsen Jr. says he gets his bad jokes from his father – and to cope with the loss, they cracked jokes with one another.\n\nBut when Norm Paulsen Sr. drove up to the property, it was quiet.\n\nHis brother, Richard Roberts, 67, warned him: “It’s even worse out back – you will never imagine the devastation.\"\n\nIt took a few minutes for Paulsen Sr. to collect himself. But when he did, he sat down in the untouched gift shop of the trading post.\n\n“Where the hell do you even start,” he said.\n\nThen, Paulsen Sr. laughed.\n\n“Looks like the summer opening of the Soda Pop Saloon will be delayed a week or two.”\n\nHis family surrounding him laughed, too. - Andrea May Sahouri\n\n11:48 a.m. One fatality, one injury in Chariton\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources confirmed that one person has died and another was injured when a tornado swept through Red Haw State Park in Chariton.\n\n\"Extensive damage\" throughout the campground included \"significant\" destruction to \"the beach area, including the boat docks, the Bait House, beach shelters and a storage building,\" the department said in a news release.\n\n\"The park is currently without power,\" according to the release. \"The public is asked to keep away from the area, so debris clean-up and repairs can be completed.\"\n\n11:40 a.m. Upcoming Des Moines, Iowa, weather forecast\n\nAccording to National Weather Service Des Moines, the worst of the severe weather that struck Iowa Saturday and caused destruction in Winterset and Chariton is done.\n\nBut tonight the Des Moines area is expected to get rain and snow before 9 p.m., which could affect road conditions in damaged areas.

The final results have yet to be certified, and the clerk can accept overseas and military ballots until next week.\n\nDistrict 7\n\nCivil rights lawyers Mike Siegel and Gary Bledsoe are headed to a runoff to represent the north Austin district. District 7’s current representative, Leslie Pool, could not seek reelection because of the city’s term limits.\n\nSiegel won 39.83% of the vote and Bledsoe received 19.29% support, but, with four other candidates in the race, no candidate cleared the majority threshold needed to avoid a runoff. They will face off at the ballot box again on Dec. 14.\n\nDistrict 10\n\nBusiness owner Marc Duchen is barely leading the District 10 race with 50.62% of the vote. His opponent, Ashika Ganguly, received 49.38% support, according to unofficial final results in Travis County. Final results have yet to be certified, and the clerk can accept overseas and military ballots until next week.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\nAISD voters approve higher tax rate\n\nAustin school district voters on Tuesday approved a tax rate election to raise the property tax rate by 9.1 cents to inject another $41 million into the district’s budget at a time when it’s facing a $119 million deficit — an investment school officials say will stave off the most painful cuts.\n\nVoters decisively approved the tax hike with 58% of the 305,254 votes cast, according to complete but unofficial results.\n\nIn passing Proposition A, voters agreed to raise their school tax rate from 85.95 cents per $100 of property valuation to 95.05 cents, a cost of about $420 annually for an average-value Austin homeowner.\n\nThe higher rate will raise $171 million total, but only $41 million will go to Austin schools. The other $130 million will go to the state as part of a decades-old program called recapture. The program functions as a “Robin Hood,” taking tax revenue from districts that collect more than their state-determined need for education funding and redistributing it to those that collect less in revenue than their state-determined need.\n\nThe district has pledged to spend $17.8 million of the new revenue to raise salaries for teachers and other staff members, particularly for those who are mid- to advanced-career level. Another $3 million will go to hiring instructional aids and the rest will be used pay down the district’s deficit.\n\nSchool board races\n\nIn the District 2 school board race, LaRessa Quintana beat out Sarah Ivory with 60.9% of the 20,479 votes, according to complete but unofficial results.\n\nFernando Lucas de Urioste and Lindsey Stringer will face off in a runoff election for the District 8, at-large seat after no candidate won a majority but whittled down the six-person field of contenders.\n\nDe Urioste was the top vote-getter with almost 32.5% of the 200,412 votes cast, according to complete but unofficial results.\n\nStringer narrowly slid into the runoff with almost 26% of the votes, beating Amy Moore, who got 23.7%. The remaining candidates — Dylan “Sky” MacAdams, Nathaniel Hellman and Nick Franke — received 8.7%, 5.7% and 3.6% of the vote, respectively.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n1:55 a.m. update: Democrats fail to flip San Antonio seats in school voucher fight\n\nIn close and wildly expensive races, Republicans maintained control of two San Antonio seats that Democrats had sought to flip in the Texas House.\n\nIn a 52-48 victory, state Rep. John Lujan, a former sheriff's deputy and firefighter, won a third term representing House District 118. Lujan defeated Kristian Carranza, a Democratic legislative staffer who made abortion rights and public school funding central to her campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, criminal defense attorney Marc LaHood secured a 6 percentage point margin of victory against Laurel Jordan Swift for House District 121, according to the final but unofficial election results. He became the GOP nominee after Abbott helped him oust incumbent Rep. Steve Allison, R-San Antonio, in the primary. Allison, who encountered Abbott's wrath for opposing school vouchers, endorsed Swift.\n\nLaHood also took donations from the Texans for a United Conservative Majority, a political action committee funded by Christian nationalists Tim Dunn and Ferris Wilks.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n1:30 a.m. update: GOP nominee Adam Hinojosa ousts state Sen. Morgan LaMantia\n\nIn the only competitive race in the Texas Senate, Republican Adam Hinojosa ousted Democratic state Sen. Morgan LaMantia in District 27 in the Rio Grande Valley, according to the final but unofficial results.\n\n“The people of this district have rejected the woke absurdity of the left — open borders, boys playing girls sports, sex change operations, and fiscal insanity,\" Hinojosa said in a statement declaring victory just before midnight Tuesday.\n\n--Bayliss Wagner\n\n1:15 a.m. update: Voters pick ACC board trustees\n\nSherri Lynn Taylor has secured the Place 7 seat on the Austin Community College Board of Trustees, a seat left vacant by Barbara Mink, a founding member of the district and current board chair who is retiring after 24 years on the board, according to the complete but unofficial election results from eligible parts of the six counties who elect the seats at-large.\n\nTaylor came out ahead with 57.55% of the vote against ACC alum Cole Wilson, who has campaigned since January and secured endorsements from the Travis County Democratic Party, multiple council members and state senators. Taylor does not have a searchable campaign website or campaign email.\n\nIn the race for the Place 9 seat, incumbent Julie Ann Nitsch, another ACC alum who has served on the board since 2016 pushing for holistic student support and resources, was handily ahead of challenger Joseph Sefton, the newly retired ACC chief information officer who ran on a platform of adding a greater tech focused perspective to the board. Nitsch secured 70.6% of the votes, according to the unofficial results.\n\nIncumbent Stephanie Gharakhanian, an attorney who has held the seat since 2018, ran unopposed for the Place 8 seat.\n\nACC seats are elected at-large. Trustees are tasked with representing the district and meeting the community’s needs. Results are not official until the counties and ACC trustees certify them.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n1:10 a.m. update: US Rep. Henry Cuellar reelected despite indictment\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a 20-year congressional veteran who is considered among the most conservative Democrats in the U.S. House, defeated Republican retired naval officer Jay Furman in a district anchored by the border city of Laredo in South Texas.\n\nCuellar, a proven vote-getter who was elected to the Texas House eight times before winning his first election to Congress in 2004, was made vulnerable after a federal indictment in May accused him and his wife of accepting $600,000 in bribes and money laundering.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges the money came from Azerbaijan’s state-operated oil and gas company. The Cuellars have insisted that they are innocent of the charges, but Furman had run late-campaign ads accusing Cuellar of using his office “to enrich himself and empower cartels.”\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n1 a.m. update: Travis County's Proposition A set to pass, final results show\n\nTravis County is poised to become the first county in Texas to help low-income families pay for childcare after voters showed overwhelming support for Proposition A on Tuesday.\n\nThe measure, which is set to pass with about 60% of the vote (provisional ballots still need to be counted), calls for a 2.5-cent property tax rate increase to cover the cost of early childhood, after-school and summer care for more than 9,000 children.\n\nProp A will cost the average county homeowner about $125 more per year in taxes and generate $75 million to fund the effort. It is expected to launch in late 2025 or early 2026, officials have said.\n\n-- Bianca Moreno-Paz\n\n12:15 a.m. update: Lockhart ISD voters approve ACC annexation\n\nVoters in the Lockhart school district approved joining the Austin Community College's taxing district Tuesday night, providing residents with in-district tuition and a path to a permanent ACC facility in the city, according to the final but unofficial election results.\n\nWith 24 of 24 precincts reporting, 61.21% of voters supported the annexation and an ad valorem tax, while 38.79% came out against the proposal.\n\nIn exchange for a property tax rate of $0.1012 per $100 of property valuation, the Lockhart school district will officially be part of the Riverbat community, with access to all educational resources and in-district tuition, including benefiting from ACC’s free tuition pilot program which launched this year.\n\nThe Austin, Del Valle, Elgin, Hays, Leander, Manor and Round Rock school districts are in-district.\n\nThe Greater Lockhart for ACC PAC said being annexed into the college district would provide the necessary accessible and affordable educational infrastructure to support the growing workforce opportunities in the region.\n\nThe last ACC annexation vote — of Pflugerville — failed in 2018. The last annexation proposal that passed before the Pflugerville vote was in 2010.\n\nThe results will not be official until they're certified by ACC board members at a Nov. 14 special meeting.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n11:50 p.m. update: Some Travis County Democrats leave disillusioned with Election Day results\n\nAs the clock approached 11 p.m. and the crowds thinned at the Travis County Democratic watch party at the Driskill Hotel in downtown Austin, friends Heather Westmoreland, 47, and Monica Holland, 42, remained in a row of mostly empty chairs watching the MSNBC feed on a small television. The two had arrived together about 7:30 p.m. excited to join the cheering crowds. Their hopes for the night took their first blow when they saw how quickly incumbent Ted Cruz was declared the victor in his Texas U.S. Senate race against Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred.\n\nThen, news networks declared Republican former President Donald Trump had won North Carolina. Their despair grew. The two watched the number of red seats in the U.S. House and Senate widgets on the corner of the TV screen grow and grow.\n\n“I’m honestly getting sick to my stomach. I’m getting flashbacks of the last time,” Westmoreland said as the two prepared to leave the watch party for the night. They were not optimistic.\n\nA transplant from Illinois six years ago and a Cedar Park resident, Westmoreland said she came into Election Day heavily focused on the loss of women’s reproductive protections. But as she sat through the night, she also found herself thinking: “Regardless of who wins, the biggest concern is what’s going to be of our country — with the civil unrest.”\n\nBoth women said they see “MAGA supporters” as verbally and physically threatening in their politically diverse neighborhoods of suburban Austin. Their unease with those they view as politically opposite has altered their life decisions for many years. Westmoreland has thrown out previous dreams of moving out to the Texas countryside with her partner and kids, opposed to the idea of moving farther into what she sees as the heartland of those she deeply disagrees with. Holland has lost close friendships with Round Rock neighbors since 2016. The rare conversations that occur, she said, quickly turn into political rambling.\n\n“I believe Trump for what he’s saying. That he’s being very literal,” Holland said. “But so many of his supporters say that’s not true, that he’s just saying that. And that’s what’s scary for me”\n\nWestmoreland nodded in agreement.\n\n“That last thing I want to hear from someone who voted for Trump is them saying, ‘Gosh, I didn’t see that coming.’” She grimaced. Holland did too, nodding. A Democratic Party employee stood in front of the television to announce the end of night’s watch party.\n\n-- Emiliano Gomez\n\n11:40 p.m. update: Texas Court of Criminal Appeals expected to have three new GOP judges\n\nTexas' highest court for criminal matters will have three new Republican judges come January, cementing Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's effort to remake the court in his image.\n\nPresiding Judge Sharon Keller, who became the first woman elected to the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2000, will be replaced by Dallas state Appeals Court Judge David Schenck. Schenck previously served under Gov. Greg Abbott when Abbott was Texas' attorney general.\n\nGina Parker, a former city, county and district attorney with no judicial experience, ousted Judge Barbara Hervey in the GOP primary and will take her seat on the bench in January.\n\nLee Finley, an attorney in private practice who also has not previously served as a judge, will replace Republican Judge Michelle Slaughter. Finley is from Collin County, Paxton's home turf.\n\nAs the American-Statesman reported in February, Paxton, a Republican, targeted the GOP incumbents over a 2021 Appeals Court opinion that maintained that the attorney general's office does not have the authority to prosecute voter fraud cases.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n11:40 p.m. update: GOP takes US Senate majority, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn wants to take charge\n\nWith the Republicans taking control of the U.S. Senate, the spotlight now turns on the Texan who was not on Tuesday's ballot: John Cornyn, the state's senior senator.\n\nCornyn has been spending much of the election year courting the votes of returning and incoming GOP senators in hopes of becoming the upper chamber's majority leader. Current leader Sen. Mitch McConnell is retiring from the top post but not from the Senate.\n\nCornyn told reporters last week in Austin that he expects the vote to take place in the next few days or weeks, and that his experience in the GOP leadership under McConnell positions him well to take charge.\n\n\"I'm confident our new conservative majority can restore our institution to the essential role it serves in our constitutional republic,\" Cornyn said in a statement late Tuesday.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n11:20 p.m. update: GOP incumbents on path to keep Texas Supreme Court seats\n\nRepublicans on the Texas Supreme Court will hold on to all three seats up for grabs this cycle, with incumbents defeating their Democratic challengers who targeted them over their votes on two major abortion cases.\n\nJustices Jane Bland, Jimmy Blacklock and John Devine each led their opponents by at least 15 percentage points as of 11:20 p.m., with roughly 75% of all votes reported. The victories extend Republicans' unbroken, 28-year winning streak on the state's court of last resort for civil cases.\n\n10:40 p.m. update: Republican Rep. Caroline Harris Davila on path to reelection to Texas House\n\nState Rep. Caroline Harris Davila, R-Round Rock, is poised to comfortably win a second term, as she lead her Democratic opponent Jennie Birkholz by 12 percentage points as of 10:40 p.m. Tuesday. Gov. Greg Abbott endorsed her in the race.\n\nIn 2022, she won the seat for House District 52, encompassing Hutto and a small portion of Round Rock, by 10 percentage points.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n10:35 p.m. update: Austin Mayor Kirk Watson poised to win reelection, avoid runoff\n\nIncumbent Kirk Watson, the perennial local politician who first served as Austin's mayor more than two decades ago, secured 51.4% support in his bid for reelection during early voting in Travis, Williamson and Hays counties. With 36 of 176 precincts reporting in Travis, his lead weakened slightly to 51.1% but remained safely above the 50% majority threshold needed for victory.\n\nEven before some Election Day results posted, Watson was optimistic.\n\n\"It looks to me very much like we're going to prevail in this race, but you can't call an election with just early vote(s),” he told supporters Tuesday night.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\n10 p.m. update: Incumbents in competitive U.S. House races in Texas take early lead against opponents\n\nEarly voting totals show the three competitive U.S. House races in Texas, both in the Rio Grande Valley, are still tight, but the chances for flips are getting smaller.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen is leading his challenger, former U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores of Los Indios, by four percentage points in the race for District 34. Just over 75% of the vote in that district has been reported.\n\nU.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, who is seeking a second term, has an eight-point edge against challenger Michelle Vallejo, 54% to 46%, with about 65% of the vote counted.\n\nIn District 28, longtime U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, is up 52% to 48% against GOP opponent Jay Furman with roughly 58% of the vote reported. Cuellar is facing a federal indictment over charges that he took foreign bribes.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\nAustin ISD declares victory on Proposition A; Election Day ballots still being tallied\n\nWith early votes counted, Austin school district administrators and board members declared victory Tuesday night on the district's proposed property tax rate increase to raise an additional $41 million in revenue.\n\nEarly returns showed almost 59% of people who voted early supported Proposition A, which would raise the school district's property tax rate by 9.1 cents. Travis County is still counting Election Day totals.\n\nA group of district administrators and board members, who gathered for a watch party at Punch Bowl Social on Congress Avenue, erupted in cheers and started chanting, \"Prop A! Prop A!\"\n\nSuperintendent Matias Segura thanked the community, his eyes tearing up. The district, which faces a $119 million budget deficit, will need to cut at least $90 million from its budget over the three years. This increased revenue means the district can stave off the most painful cuts, he said.\n\n\"There are things that we were going to have to consider that we're no longer going to have to consider,\" Segura said.\n\nBoard President Arati Singh vowed to spend the additional tax revenue in a way that will benefit students and teachers.\n\n\"We are going to spend this money in a way that is strategic, in a way that is going to increase student outcomes, that's going to give our kids the education they deserve,\" Singh said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:45 p.m. update: Austin City Council District 7 race appears headed to runoff\n\nA six-way race to represent District 7 on the Austin City Council is likely headed to a runoff.\n\nMike Siegel, a civil rights lawyer and former Democratic nominee for congress, secured the most votes by far in early voting — 42%. But he must secure more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff but that could prove difficult with five challengers. Texas NAACP President Gary Bledsoe, the second-highest vote getter so far, received nearly 19% of the early vote.\n\nAs of 9:42 p.m., the Travis County Clerk had not posted Election Day results.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\n9:20 p.m. update: Three of four Round Rock ISD bond proposals take early favor\n\nThree of four Round Rock measures in a $1 billion bond package appear on track to pass, according to early but incomplete voting totals.\n\nProposition A is passing with 63.8% of the early votes. This $798.3 million proposal contains facility upgrades, replacements to equipment that is at the end of its life, safety upgrades and additional classrooms.\n\nProposition B is passing with 60.5% of the early votes. The $125.3 million proposal would upgrade technology. Proposition C, an $8.6 million proposal to upgrade fine arts, is passing with 56.2% of the early votes.\n\nThe $65.9 million Proposition D, which would construct a multipurpose athletic field and improve athletic facilities, is failing with 60.2% of voters coming out against the measure during early voting.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:20 p.m. update: Round Rock school board races show early leaders\n\nIn the Round Rock school district, incumbent Estevan \"Chuy\" Zárate is leading with 59.4% of the early votes against challenger Joshua Escalante in the Place 1 race, incomplete and unofficial results show.\n\nMelissa Ross is leading with 64.7% of the votes against April Guerra for the Place 2 seat.\n\nIn Place 7, Mingyuan \"Michael\" Wei is leading with 67.6% of the early votes against Jim Steele.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:15 p.m. update: Travis County voters poised to pass Proposition A\n\nTravis County Proposition A, the measure that would raise property taxes to help low-income families pay for childcare, appears poised to pass after receiving overwhelming support during early voting, unofficial and incomplete results show.\n\nAbout 60% of the voters who weighed in ahead of Election Day supported the measure. Travis County Judge Andy Brown and Precinct 1 County Commissioner Jeff Travillion, who attended an election night watch party hosted by the local Democratic Party, told the American-Statesman they were optimistic. \"We hoped that it would pass resoundingly,” Travillion said as the crowd around him cheered and booed the presidential results being aired on TV. He called childcare a “clear pocketbook issue.”\n\n-- Emiliano Gomez and Bianca Moreno-Paz\n\n9:10 p.m. update: Texas House: Republicans favored in competitive seats\n\nEarly voting totals are painting a dim picture for Texas Democrats who hoped to flip seats in the state House and hold off the possible passage of a school voucher bill in the next legislative session.\n\nWhile state Rep. Mihaela Plesa, D-Dallas, is leading her GOP challenger Steve Kinard 52% to 48% in Collin County, according to early voting results, five other competitive races are trending slightly in favor of Republicans.\n\nIn San Antonio, state Rep. John Lujan earned 52% of the vote in early unofficial results, while his Democratic opponent Kristian Carranza snagged 48%. Republican Marc LaHood is up by the same margin against Laurel Jordan Swift, according to the unofficial Bexar County early voting results.\n\nEarly voting results in three other House seats presently held by Republicans:\n\nDenise Villalobos vs. Solomon Ortiz: 57% to 43% in Nueces County, early voting results show.\n\nState Rep.

Morgan Meyer, R-University Park, vs. Elizabeth Ginsberg: 59% to 41% in Dallas County, early voting results show.\n\nIn addition, former Uvalde mayor Don McLaughlin is poised to flip a seat formerly held by a Democrat in the state House. He led opponent Cecilia Castellano by 40 percentage points as of 8:05 p.m., though Election Day ballots were still being tallied.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n9 p.m. update: Fuentes takes commanding lead for District 2 Austin council seat\n\nAustin City Council incumbent Vanessa Fuentes declared victory Tuesday night after taking a commanding lead over her competitor for the District 2 seat anchored in Southeast Austin.\n\nFuentes received 86% of the early vote, while her competitor Robert Reynolds took in 14% of the 20,670 votes that were cast before Election Day in this race.\n\nIn a post on X, Fuentes thanked residents of her district for “entrusting” her with a second term.\n\n“Together, we will keep fighting for good-paying jobs, complete and connected neighborhoods, and high-quality city services that make a difference in people’s lives,” Fuentes tweeted. “The next four years are about what WE can achieve together, building a city that works for everyone.”\n\nReynolds did not respond to a Statesman request to comment.\n\n-- Skye Seipp\n\n8:50 p.m. update: Rep. Michael McCaul will return to Congress for 11th term\n\nIncumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin outdistanced his Democratic challenger Theresa Boisseau in the race for the 10th Congressional District.\n\nAn inside player in the GOP caucus, McCaul will return to Congress for an 11th term in January.

About half of the county's 925,858 registered voters cast ballots early.\n\nIn an interview with the American-Statesman shortly after 8 p.m., Garza thanked county residents for their “vote of confidence.\"\n\n“It means that our work continues,” he said.\n\nThat work will include expanding the county’s sexual assault response team, as well as continuing to grow a unit that investigates wrongful convictions. Garza said when he was first elected in 2020, the conviction integrity unit had only one staff member.\n\n\"Over the last four years we’ve built a team,” he said. \"We’re just getting our sea legs.\"\n\n-- Skye Seipp and Emiliano Gomez\n\n8:30 p.m. update: Incumbent Kirk Watson takes early lead in five-candidate race for Austin mayor\n\nIncumbent Austin Mayor Kirk Watson has taken an early lead in his bid for reelection with 51.4% of the early vote in Travis, Williamson and Hays counties, according to unofficial vote totals.\n\nNo precincts have yet reported Election Day tallies in the three counties, however 52% of registered voters in Travis County cast their ballots early. Watson, who first served as Austin's mayor from 1997-2001, was again elected to the city's highest office in 2022. His mayoral term is shorter term than usual, slated at two years, after Austin voters in 2021 opted to move the mayoral election to be in line with the U.S. presidential race.\n\nWatson is facing four challengers. For a candidate to win the election outright, they'll need to secure more than 50% of the vote or the race will go into a runoff between the top two vote-getters.\n\nCommunity organizer and executive director of Go Austin/Vamos Austin Carmen Llanes Pulido is in second place with 18.8% support, according to early voting totals in the three counties. Coming in third place is former Austin City Council Member Kathie Tovo with 17% of the vote.\n\nTrailing further behind in early voting numbers are small business owner Jeffery L.

Election Day ballots are still being counted.\n\nStatewide, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz were clinging to narrow leads. The early returns showed Allred running slightly ahead of Harris.\n\nAs expected, the GOP strength is anchored in rural Texas while the Democrats were riding high in the urban and some suburban centers. A notable exception is Tarrant County, the state's most purple urban/suburban enclave where Trump and Cruz have small leads.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n7:45 p.m. update: Democrats Doggett, Casar sail to reelection\n\nU.S. Rep.s Lloyd Doggett and Greg Casar, both of Austin, cruised to reelection Tuesday.\n\nDoggett, who has been in Congress since 1995, easily defeated Republican Jenny Garcia Sharon and Libertarian Girish Altekar in District 37.

Lindsey Stringer and Amy Moore follow with 25.6% and almost 24% of the early votes, respectively. Nathaniel Hellman, Dylan \"Sky\" MacAdams and Nick Franke are also running for the seat.\n\nTrustees Lynn Boswell and Kevin Foster are running unopposed for reelection.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n7:20 p.m. Early election results show tight US Senate race in Texas\n\nWith a smattering of counties, some big and some small, reporting early election results, the race between Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred is about even. Keep in mind, the polls have been closed less than 20 minutes as of this update and Election Day votes are still being tallied.\n\nAllred is running comfortably ahead in his home base of Dallas County, as per the incomplete and unofficial returns. In neighboring Tarrant County, narrowly won by President Joe Biden four years ago, Cruz has a slim early lead.\n\nIn Williamson County, north of Austin, it's Allred with the slim lead, and he is also carrying Travis and Hays counties, early results show. So far, all of the rural counties reporting numbers show Cruz well ahead.\n\n-- John C.

One state attorney general's name was conspicuously absent from the list of those who signed the open letter.\n\nTexas' own Ken Paxton.\n\nRecall that in the presidential election four years ago, and the weeks that followed, Paxton went to court seeking to nullify the results of the election in four of the battleground states that went for Democrat Joe Biden over incumbent Donald Trump.\n\nHere's what the attorneys general from the other 49 states and two U.S. territories had to say on the subject:\n\n“Regardless of the outcome of Tuesday’s election, we expect that Americans will respond peacefully and we condemn any acts of violence related to the results. A peaceful transfer of power is the highest testament to the rule of law, a tradition that stands at the heart of our nation’s stability. As Attorneys General, we affirm our commitment to protect our communities and uphold the democratic principles we serve.\"\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n4:45 p.m. update: 'I don’t have a voice': Austin voter turned away after missing key deadline\n\nJeff Dukett thought he had done everything he needed to vote — but he left the Austin Oaks Church polling site without casting a ballot Tuesday afternoon because election workers told him he hadn’t updated his address in time.\n\nTo vote in the Nov. 5 election, a voter who moved would have had to update their address with the elections office by Oct. 7. Dukett, who moved from San Marcos to Southwest Austin, updated his address in late October, not realizing the deadline.\n\n“This is why people don’t get out to vote,” Dukett said, fuming. “It’s just frustrating because I know (the presidential race is) going to be close and I don’t have a voice.”\n\nAccording to the Texas Secretary of State’s website, voters have few options if they miss the deadline to update their address 30 days before Election Day. If the voter still lives in the same city or county, they can return to their old precinct to vote — an option that doesn’t help Dukett, having moved one county to the north.\n\nTexas has a path for people who moved from one county to another to vote a “limited ballot,” which would include only those races that appear on the ballots for both the voter’s old address and their new one. That would include races such as president and U.S. Senate, but not mayor, for instance.\n\nBut that option didn’t help Dukett, either: Limited ballots are available only during early voting, not on Election Day.\n\n“I waited all day to do this,” Dukett said, frustrated as he left without voting. “I’ll never vote again.”\n\n-- Bridget Grumet\n\n4:30 p.m. update: Abbott appears bullish on school vouchers, even before polls close\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott aggressively campaigned during the March primaries against several GOP Texas House members who stood in the way of the Legislature last year enacting a school voucher program. And after he helped many of them get defeated, the governor expressed confidence he'd get his way when lawmakers return to Austin for a new legislative session in January.\n\nThat prediction is predicated on the outcome of a handful of state House races that will be decided when the votes are tallied Tuesday night. But Abbott's confidence showed no sign of waning even with a few hours left before the polls closed in Texas. His office put out an afternoon advisory that the govenor will hold \"a media availability on the importance of passing school choice for all Texas families\" in Tyler early Wednesday.\n\nDepending on how the voting goes, look for the governor's confidence level to flow over the brim, or for him to defiantly challenge the House to get with his program.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n4:15 p.m. update: Parents turning out for AISD Proposition A\n\nSome parents who came to Davis Elementary School in Northwest Austin to vote Tuesday decided to support the Austin school district’s proposed 9.1-cent tax rate increase. The district pledged to use the $41 million it will collect in additional revenue to give employees raises and pay down its $119 million deficit.\n\nJoyce Tseng, who has two children and is pregnant with a third child, said she wants her children’s teachers to have higher pay and access to better resources and thus supported Proposition A wholeheartedly.\n\nAmanda Armond didn’t have to think about whether to vote for the tax rate election. Her daughter goes to fifth grade at Davis and she wants to ensure teachers and students have the resources they need, she said.\n\n“If I have to pay more in taxes for the benefit of schools, teachers, what have you, I will, always,” Armond said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n4 p.m. update: Voters in Austin suburbs contribute to changing demographics\n\nJust north of Austin, Williamson County is one of several diverse and rapidly-growing suburban Texas counties that has moved from being safely Republican to purple territory in recent years.\n\nElected officials from the county are a mix of Republicans and Democrats, unlike those in deep-blue Travis County. And voters there slightly preferred President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in 2020, but they also chose to reelect Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn and a number of other GOP candidates that year.\n\nTwo residents who are part of that blue shift are Bryon Curtis and Keizhia Carlyle. Both see women’s and abortion rights as critical issues this year.\n\nLaw enforcement administrator and Hutto dad Bryon Curtis was emphatic about his opposition to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom he feels is “racist” and “a horrible person.”\n\nThe main reason Curtis voted for Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is her stance on abortion rights. “I have daughters,” he said. “I want them to have access to health care.” He also opposes mass deportation.\n\nWhile knocking on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee in Hutto, Curtis says he met numerous women who said they’re voting for Harris.\n\n“I've had a lot of women go, ‘I used to vote Republican, or my husband votes Republican, but I'm voting for Harris,’” he said. “It's the abortion issue … I think you'll have more women voting Democrat than you did traditionally.”\n\nKeizhia Carlyle said women's rights are at the top of her priorities. She also cited border issues as a top driver for her, saying she feels Republicans' statements about migration through the U.S. southern border exaggerate the problem.\n\n\"I just I think they're using (the border) as a hot-topic issue to get voted in, to scare people. ... And I don't think you should go to the polls in fear. You should know the truth and vote your beliefs.\"\n\nIn Hutto, she added, \"Jobs aren't being taken. People aren't, like, breaking into my home. ... This fear-mongering on TV and all that, I just feel like it's a lie.\"\n\nCarlyle, a Black woman, said the candidates' rhetoric on race and ethnicity was a major reason she chose to vote on Tuesday.\n\n\"The negative talk about women, people of color, minorities — I'm just tired of hearing the same old thing from Republicans,\" she said. \"It's like minorities don't matter. And I'm just trying to show through my voting that we do matter, and we do have a voice.\"\n\nOf the election in general, she said, \"I'm glad it's going to be over.\"\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n3 p.m. update: Why all politics are local for this Texas voter\n\nLeaving the polling place after casting her vote at Deer Creek Elementary School in suburban northwest Travis County, Nikki Cherniak saw nothing to be gained by adding her voice to the almost deafening cacophony that has become the soundtrack to modern national politics.\n\nA retired teacher of 23 years, Cherniack said it was the school board races that motivated her Election Day decision to vote.\n\n\"I'm more interested in what's happening in my community than anything else,\" she said, adding that there's no shortage of opinions in the race for president and the contest for U.S. Senate.\n\n\"We need people on the school board who really understand the needs of the children and the teachers.\"\n\nCherniack declined to say which candidates running for places on the Leander school board best fit that bill because she didn't want to add to that white noise there, either.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n12:45 p.m. update: US Senate candidates in Texas sprint to finish\n\nCampaigning in the tantalizingly close U.S. Senate race in Texas continued as Election Day voting was underway Tuesday.\n\nAt least in the virtual sense. Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz’s team, just before lunchtime, posted side-by-side images of his Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred and former U.S. House Speaker (and still California congresswoman) Nancy Pelosi suggesting that his opponent would be in lockstep with the nation’s most prominent San Francisco liberal.\n\n\"Colin Allred's 100% voting record with Nancy Pelosi shows that he's too extreme for Texas,\" said the message posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAround the same time, Allred, a three-term congressman from Dallas, reminded voters that country music legend Willie Nelson was in his corner. In addition to Nelson, Allred's post also featured Cruz's 2018 opponent former Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke and former Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis, plus some national figures, repeating the message \"All in for Allred.\"\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n12:35 p.m. update: Voters 'hopeful' at University of Texas\n\nOn a sunny Election Day afternoon, Dalton Pastorius, a University of Texas sophomore majoring in government, said he has “never felt hope like this before.”“I’ve never been as hopeful as I am today,” he said. Standing outside the Texas Union in a 2008 T-shirt of former President Barack Obama on coins under the banner “Real change,” Pastorius handed out flyers with voting information, beaming with genuine excitement. Pastorius feels personally connected to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. In 2019 during the primaries, he had a poster of her on his wall. “I’m just so ecstatic to vote for her,” he said, encouraging people to vote and research the candidates up for office.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n12:20 p.m. update: Austin voters weigh in on AISD Proposition A\n\nThe Austin school district, facing a $119 million budget deficit, is proposing a higher tax rate to raise revenue to help cut the shortfall and give teachers a raise.\n\nProposition A proposes to raise the school property tax rate from 85.95 cents per $100 of property valuation to 95.05 cents, which would raise $41 million for local schools and send another $130 million to the state as part of a decades-old program called recapture, which takes tax revenue from districts that collect more than their state-determined need for education funding and redistributing it to those that collect less in revenue than their state-determined need.\n\nOutside the Gus L. Garcia Recreation Center in Northeast Austin on a blustery Tuesday morning, Jose Brownlee, who has lived in Austin since 1996, stood in line with a group of other voters to cast his ballot.\n\nBrownlee said he voted against the district's tax rate proposal because his taxes are already too high.\n\n\"We're already struggling out here and everything's already tough,\" Brownlee said.\n\nHowever, Roy Spinoza sees Proposition A as an economic boon to the city.\n\nSpinoza, who has lived in Austin for 42 years, has three grandchildren in local schools. His desire to put Republican former President Donald Trump back in the White House drove him out to the polls Tuesday.\n\nThough he isn't excited about paying more in taxes, Spinoza thinks people need to invest in their city, which includes the schools, he said.\n\n\"I don't want to see Austin go down and get ruined just because no one wants to pay into it,\" Spinoza said.\n\nLikewise Lynette Cox, who moved to Austin six months ago, decided to vote in favor of the Austin school district tax rate election. Cox doesn't have children, but to her, investing in public education is a matter of principle.\n\n\"You have to invest in the future of the U.S.,\" Cox said.\n\nAustinite Trey Pasquariello also voted for the district's proposal, he said.\n\n\"Raising money for any schools is a good thing,\" Pasquariello said.\n\nHe also sees the investment as a return for his own home because if schools improve, then his home value will likely increase, he said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n10:15 a.m. update: At the polls, Texas voters express opposing views on immigration, abortion\n\nThe line to vote on Tuesday morning snaked around the Wilco Hutto Annex building, a polling location in Hutto, a rural town about 30 miles north of Austin, with the wait to cast a ballot exceeding 45 minutes. It’s been this way since the polls opened at 7 a.m.\n\nWhile Hutto residents are mostly Republican, voters of all stripes were out on Election Day casting their ballots.\n\nAunchelle Weeks, 42, a Hutto business owner and mom, came to the polls with her daughter. She cast her vote for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, a Democratic congressman from Dallas who is running to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n“I just don’t feel like Trump has the country’s best interests at heart,” she said. “I think he’s in it for himself.”\n\nWeeks' three top issues: the economy, taxes and abortion rights. She feels Harris’ economic plan is more developed. GOP nominee Donald Trump’s plan, she feels, “has been tried and it hasn’t worked.”\n\nAsked what shapes her views on abortion, she said, “I got pregnant right after they turned over Roe v. Wade, and I had never been so frightened in my life for something to go wrong. And it really made me think about my girls going forward. I don’t want them to have that fear when their time comes to carry.\"\n\nTexas has one of the most restrictive abortions bans in the country, with no exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies. Weeks said she’s hopeful that Harris will win.\n\n“I think that she’ll come through in the end and hopefully get things back on track,” Weeks said.\n\nFor professional firefighter Jason Oltman, 44, a dad to grown children, he turned out to support Republicans up and down the ticket though he said he voted for some Democrats in local races.\n\nOltman voted for Trump because he said the former president is \"not a politician.”\n\n“He can pretty much tell PACs to kiss his ass,\" he said. “He doesn’t have to depend on them, or he chooses not to listen,” he said, while acknowledging that Trump still takes donations from them.\n\nThe first reason Oltman gave for voting to reelect Cruz: he opposes sex change procedures for children. He also said voters “can’t just go off what they hear on TV,” referring to the political ads that have inundated the airwaves. “Everybody’s throwing knives.”\n\nAt the same polling place — Wilco Hutto Annex — Hutto resident Al Artus cast his votes for Trump, saying concerns about the former president's rhetoric are overblown.\n\n“I totally get his sense of humor,” he said of Trump. “They say, you know, ‘Orange man bad.’ They just don’t understand.”\n\nThe biggest concerns for him are immigration, inflation and the economy. Artus said he is deeply concerned about human trafficking, which occurs at the border, and feels Trump will crack down on those responsible.\n\n“We're standing on a gold mine of prosperity and wealth, but (they’re like), ‘No, let's just make everything more expensive and make it harder for people who are on fixed incomes,’” he said. “And why are we allowing women to be abused in such a way, children (to be abused) in such a way?”\n\nAs for abortion, it isn't a major concern for Artus.\n\n“I think if you have a problem with it, you just go to another state,” he said. “I don’t think we should have this one giant, powerful arm over everybody.”\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\nWhat time do polls open on Election Day?\n\nIf you're voting on Election Day, polls in Texas are open from 7 a.m. through 7 p.m. local time.\n\nAs long as you're in the line by 7 p.m., you will be allowed to vote even if you haven’t been admitted inside a polling place. You have the right to stay in line as long as it takes to be able to cast your ballot.\n\nWhere can I vote on Election Day 2024?\n\nWhat do I need to bring to vote in Texas?\n\nVoters should come prepared to present one of seven acceptable forms of photo ID:\n\nTexas driver's license\n\nTexas personal identification card\n\nPassport\n\nTexas handgun license\n\nMilitary ID card\n\nCitizenship certificate\n\nTexas election identification certificate\n\nA student ID, even from a public school or college, is not an acceptable ID for voting under state law.\n\nAny otherwise qualified voter who cannot reasonably obtain one of the approved forms of photo ID can fill out a \"Reasonable Impediment Declaration\" at the voting location and present an alternative form of identification, such as a utility bill, bank statement, government check or voter registration certificate.\n\nWhat's on the ballot in the November 5 election?\n\nAlong with voting for the next president, eligible Texans can vote for other officials running on the local, state, and federal levels.\n\nHere is a look at what's on the ballot according to the Texas secretary of state website:\n\n1 U.S Senator (the seat currently held by Ted Cruz)\n\n1 of 3 Railroad Commissioners\n\n15 State Senators\n\n7 State Board of Education members\n\n3 members of the Texas Supreme Court\n\n3 members of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n5 Chief Justices and various justices for Texas Courts of Appeals\n\nLower-level judges and local county offices will also appear on the ballot:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/weather/nationwide-massive-storm-tornadoes-thursday/index.html", "title": "Ice and snow start hammering East Coast states after same deadly ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe massive storm system that pulverized homes, killed three people in Louisiana and brought blizzard conditions to northern states is bringing a new wave of brutal weather starting Thursday.\n\nMore than a foot of snow has covered parts of the upper Midwest since Monday, including Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nNext, significant ice and heavy snow will smother parts of the Mid-Atlantic and New England, forecasters said.\n\nParts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York have already seen several inches’ worth of snowflakes, with some areas seeing up to six inches. More than a foot of additional snow could be on the way – while some places with higher elevations could get walloped with up to 2 feet of snow.\n\n“We urge everyone in the impacted regions to avoid unnecessary travel tonight and tomorrow,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Thursday. “Work from home if possible, stay off the roads, and make sure you and your loved ones remain vigilant.”\n\nAt its peak snowfall rate, the storm is expected to dump about one to 2 inches of snow per hour in parts of New York, the governor said, adding power outages were possible over the coming days.\n\nThe intense snowfall will spread into interior New England on Friday, with up to a foot expected there.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, some areas were under a winter weather advisory as temperatures dropped below freezing after a round of rain, warning that an “additional glazing of ice could occur through midnight,” forecasters said Thursday night.\n\nMiles of Interstate 90 in South Dakota were closed Thursday due to hazardous weather. South Dakota DOT\n\nFreezing rain and snow also covered parts of the Mid-Atlantic Thursday. A quarter inch of ice was reported Thursday morning in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia and Maryland, and about a tenth of an inch had built up in parts of Virginia.\n\nThe mammoth storm system that plowed across much of the country this week will morph into a nor’easter that will continue spread ice, snow and rain to the Northeast.\n\nNow, as the East Coast hunkers down, tornado survivors in the South are grappling with colossal damage.\n\nA tornado passes a highway Wednesday in New Iberia, Louisiana. Mike Ibert via Reuters\n\n‘All of a sudden, everything just blew up’\n\nThe same storm system now slamming eastern states left a trail of devastation in Gulf Coast states.\n\nAt least 50 tornado reports have been made since Tuesday in Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Texas Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma.\n\nIn northern Louisiana, a tornado that moved through the town of Farmerville was rated an EF-3, with 140 mph winds, according to the National Weather Service. The tornado, which moved through Union Parish Tuesday evening, was 500 yards wide at its largest point and was on the ground for over nine miles.\n\nAt least 20 people were injured and the tornado demolished parts of an apartment complex and a mobile home park, Farmerville Police Detective Cade Nolan said.\n\nPatsy Andrews was home with her children in Farmerville when she heard “rushing wind like a train” outside, she told CNN affiliate KNOE-TV.\n\n“All of a sudden that wind was so heavy, it broke my back door,” Andrews said. “The lights went off and all we could hear was glass popping everywhere.”\n\nA tornado caused widespread damage in Union Parish, Louisiana. CNN\n\nAndrews said she and her daughter crawled into a hallway as glass shattered around them and water leaked through the roof. They ended up hunkering down in their bathroom and praying. Her family survived the storm but was left with a damaged home.\n\nFurther south, the weather service also confirmed two EF-2 tornadoes – in preliminary ratings while damage surveys are ongoing – in the New Orleans area. The first tornado impacted areas of St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, including Montz and Killona, where one person was killed. The second affected areas from Marrero to Arabi on the south and east sides of New Orleans.\n\nMore than 50 structures were damaged, St. Charles Parish President Matthew Jewell said Thursday, including 45 in Killona and nine in Montz. About 21 of those are no longer livable.\n\n“This happens as the weather’s getting colder and 10 days before Christmas and to a lot of people who are just now recovering from Hurricane Ida,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a Thursday news conference. “That was especially heartbreaking in St. Charles Parish.”\n\nIn Jefferson Parish, Trent Theriot ducked inside a small closer as soon as he heard a tornado was headed his way.\n\n“A strong gust of wind came through the front door … the tornado came through the front,” Theriot told CNN’s Nick Valencia. “All of a sudden, everything just blew up.”\n\nJefferson Parish Councilman Scott Walker posted images of storm damage on Facebook. \"Powerlines down, home severely damaged, rooftops ripped off, \" he wrote. Courtesy Scott Walker\n\nWhen he emerged from the closet, Theriot’s house no longer had a roof and had shifted several feet off its foundation.\n\nBut he said he’s fortunate to be alive. “Thank Jesus,” Theriot said, “I’m here for another day.”\n\n‘More devastating than initially expected’\n\nThe tornado that shredded much of Gretna, Louisiana, on Wednesday may have damaged up to 5,000 structures, the mayor said.\n\n“Unfortunately, now that the sun is up, it is more devastating than initially expected,” Mayor Belinda Constant said Thursday.\n\nA tornado blew out a vehicle's windows and damaged or destroyed homes in Gretna, Louisiana. Matthew Hinton/AP\n\n“There are more houses that will probably have to be condemned or just demolished based on such damage,” she said. “It’s about a mile-and-a-half stretch that is completely just inundated with destruction.”\n\nDespite the devastation in Gretna, only three injuries were reported, the mayor said.\n\n“This is not the place where we normally have tornadoes. So our reality of a safe house is not what it is in other parts of the country. But people survived in bathtubs,” she said.\n\n“We’re a resilient people, and this is the type of thing that don’t choose locations.”\n\nWidespread power outages in the cold\n\nPower lines are mangled after a tornado struck Wednesday in Gretna, Louisiana. Matthew Hinton/AP\n\nFrom tornadoes in the South to blizzard conditions in the Upper Midwest, more than 100,000 homes, businesses and other electricity customers in the US had no power Thursday night, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMost of those outages – more than 80,000 – were in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Ferocious winds from blizzard conditions knocked down power lines in the Upper Midwest, and temperatures in some areas without power plunged to near or below freezing.\n\nVisibility was significantly reduced Thursday on Interstate 94 near Bismarck, North Dakota. Tom Stromme/The Bismarck Tribune/AP\n\nA mother and child were killed and found far from their home\n\nAt least three deaths in Louisiana have been linked to the storm.\n\nYoshiko A. Smith, 30, and her 8-year-old son, Nikolus Little, were killed Tuesday when a tornado struck Caddo Parish and destroyed their home, local officials said.\n\nTheir bodies were found far from where their house once stood, officials said. Autopsies have been ordered for both, the county coronor said.\n\nIn St. Charles Parish, a 56-year-old woman died after a tornado hit her home, the Louisiana Department of Health said Wednesday.\n\nAnd “a number of people” remain in hospitals, the governor said. Some have significant injuries and others are stable, he added.\n\nIn Texas, a tornado struck Wise County near Paradise and Decatur on Tuesday, officials said. Video showed homes splintered, with roofs ripped off in Decatur.\n\nAnd in Wayne, Oklahoma, a tornado damaged homes and barns Tuesday, officials said. No injuries were reported, but homes were flattened or had roofs torn off, according to footage from CNN affiliate KOCO.\n\nGiven the extensive destruction across the state, “I am amazed that we didn’t have more loss of life in Louisiana, and I’m very thankful for it,” Edwards said Thursday.\n\nEdwards said alert notifications on cell phones were extremely important in giving people proper warning before storms impacted their areas.\n\nBut while road crews clear debris and try to restore downed power lines, Edwards urged residents to avoid sightseeing hard-hit areas – such as Iberia Medical Center in New Iberia, a city reportedly hit by a tornado.\n\nIberia Medical Center was damaged by severe weather Wednesday in New Iberia, Louisiana. Leslie Westbrook/The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate/AP\n\nIn Arabi, Cindy DeLucca Hernandez thought she could beat the storm while driving home with her 16-year-old son after school.

See latest data, trends on US birth rate", "text": "Here's a reality that is changing the planet: Births are declining across the globe as people opt for different parenting choices amid evolving family dynamics.\n\nFrom the U.S. to Singapore, the global birth rate is on a decline compared to 1960 as people battle higher costs of living and childcare. They're also dealing more with medical conditions and societal norms on what parenthood looks like, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's 2024 report on society at a glance.\n\nThe international group is comprised of 38 countries, including the U.S., to develop solutions to social, economic and environmental challenges.\n\n\"Over the past decades, many factors have changed, affecting women’s choices with respect to having a(nother) child,\" the OECD said in the report. Among the key factors: increased education among women, improved access to effective contraceptive measures, a growing predominance of dual-earner households, and a strengthening of public policies such as paid leave and formal early childhood education and care.\n\n\"In addition, a succession of global crises has increased economic, labor market and housing insecurities especially among younger people, which complicates their transition into parenthood,\" the report says.\n\nIn the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks the nation's birth rate, which is used to study how many children are being born and the factors behind it, said Brady Hamilton, a National Center of Health Statistics birth statistician. He added the agency breaks down the rate by age group and race, which he said gives more detail on the population.\n\n\"The more detail you can get, the better you can understand changes in the population structure,\" he said.\n\nHow is the birth rate calculated?\n\nTwo main birth rates are tracked, Hamilton said - crude birth and fertility rate. Crude is the number of children born per 1,000 people. The number is calculated by dividing births in a year by the average population for the year.\n\n\"Not everybody in the entire population reproduces,\" Hamilton said. \"Young people don't, old people don't. And your number of children born is kind of controlled by the size of your reproductively active female population. So that leads you into the fertility rates.\"\n\nFertility rates are calculated by the total number of births to women aged 15 to 44.\n\nHow many people are born every day?\n\nAccording to the CDC, 3,667,758 people were born in 2023. That's about 9,852 births per day in the U.S.\n\nWhat is the current birth rate?\n\nThe crude birth rate for the U.S. in 2023 was 10.74 births per 1,000 people, according to the CDC.\n\nAmong all 50 states, Vermont has the lowest rate at 7.82 births per 1,000 people, and Utah has the highest at 13.17 per 1,000.\n\nThe fertility rate that same year was 54.5 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, a slight drop compared to 2022's rate of 56 births per 1,000 women.\n\nIs the U.S. birth rate declining?\n\nYes, the U.S. rate has been on a steady decline since 2007, according to a May White House press release. Many have tied the low rate to people living longer with their parents, fears of job loss from a pregnancy and youth not in education or employment, according to OECD. The rate can be improved, however, when women have an equal footing with men on work-life balance and compensation, it said.\n\n\"Young people increasingly find meaning in life outside of parenthood, and there appears to be increased acceptance of not having children,\" the organization said.\n\nHow does the U.S. compare to other countries?\n\nAccording to the United Nations' world population data, the average global birth rate is 16.52 births per 1,000 people. The U.S. is among the developed countries with the highest birth rate - Greenland has the highest at 14.1 births per 1,000 people, while Saint Pierre and Miquelon has the lowest at 5.2 births per 1,000 people.\n\nAmong all 236 countries, the Central African Republic has the highest rate in the world at 45.35 births per 1,000 people and the Vatican City has the lowest at 4.21 births per 1,000 people.\n\nBirth rates help companies, government agencies prepare for the future\n\nHamilton said it's an important statistic, coupled with immigration and death data, for the health agency to see how people are coming into society if a certain age group is having fewer children, and what measures need to be taken to address problems in the rates.\n\nPew Charitable Trusts said in a December 2022 report that birth rates are vital to school districts, as fewer babies born can result in lower budgets and possibly school closures. On the other hand, a baby boom creates a need for more funding and buildings to educate children. The research organization pointed to Minnesota, which projected sharp declines in enrollment and issued a 2.3% cut to the state's 2022 education budget as a result.\n\n\"Some fiscal effects have already emerged, while others will be relatively minor or won’t be felt for decades,\" according to Pew Charitable Trusts' website.\n\nHamilton added that knowing the birth and fertility rates gives a better picture of a place's demographics, such as the size of age-based generations, the sustainability of welfare programs for retirees through income taxes, and changes in the population of a race in a certain town, county, state or the nation.\n\nIn the private sector, Hamilton said birth rates are necessary for companies that manufacture baby products such as baby food, formula and toys. Keeping tabs on it helps them avoid shortages, he said.\n\n\"So there's a lot of information that is useful to many different groups when it comes to the number of births,\" he said.\n\nJust Curious for more?

Census bureau data lags by about a year.\n\nWhile Delaware's overall population growth has remained steady at an average of 1% per year since 2010, adults 65 and older have seen the fastest growing numbers, with that population increasing 55% in the 11-year period. In contrast, the 35 to 49 age group declined the most, dropping 4.2% in the same timeframe.\n\nCurrently, the 50 to 64 age group makes up the largest share of Delaware's population − 20.5%. The 65 and up age group comes in close second, however, making up 20.1% of the state's population.\n\nFollowing these two groups, Delaware's age group percentages are: 20 to 34 (18.6%); 5 to 19 (18%); 35 to 49 (17.5%); 0 to 4 (5.3%).\n\nThough adults ages 50 to 64 still account for the largest percentage of the state's population, the rapid growth of the 65-plus age group comes as no surprise given the trend is also being seen nationally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Community Living found.\n\nAccording to a webpage updated in May − prior to the Census Bureau's July release of 2021 data − there were 54.1 million people age 65 and older in the U.S. in 2019, up from 39.6 million in 2009. That represents a 36.6% increase in that age group.\n\nBy 2040, the government expects the 65 and older population to reach 80.8 million, and 94.7 million by 2060.\n\nWhy is this age range growing?\n\nThere are several reasons, both globally and in the U.S., why older adults make up a larger share of the population.\n\nAround the world, life expectancy is increasing, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Institutes of Health. Most countries, including developing countries, show \"a steady increase in longevity over time,\" though it remains unclear how much more life expectancy will increase.\n\nCoupled with this is a general decline in birth rates, both nationally and worldwide.\n\nBeginning in the U.S. in the late 1960s, families began getting smaller, according to the Population Reference Bureau, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that collects statistics for research focused on the environment and the health and structure of populations.\n\nDuring the baby boom, the total fertility rate − or the average number of births women will have in their lifetime − peaked at more than 3.5. By the mid-1970s, the rate had dropped to 1.7, which had been the lowest level ever recorded in the U.S. until recently.\n\nAccording to a May 2021 article by the Population Reference Bureau, in 2020, the total fertility rate dropped to 1.64, the lowest level ever in the U.S.\n\nWhile this is concerning for a myriad of reasons, researchers with the University of California, Princeton University and Northwestern University recently published a working paper − a research paper that has either not yet been peer-reviewed or published in an academic journal − based on data from 2015 to 2021 that found that there was a slight \"baby bump\" during the pandemic.\n\nDid the pandemic increase our population?\n\nThe paper's authors found that though U.S. birthrates declined slightly as pandemic lockdowns were implemented in early 2020, the rates rose again last year, culminating in a net increase above the pre-pandemic trend.\n\nThe decrease at the beginning of lockdowns was largely due to fewer female immigrants coming into the U.S. and having children here, while the increase was largely from women under 25 having babies earlier and women with a college education \"who were more likely to benefit from working from home,\" the study found.\n\n\"This 2021 'baby bump' is the first major reversal in the U.S. fertility rates since the 2007 Great Recession and was large enough to reverse two years of declining fertility rates,\" the authors wrote. \"Combining the modest 2020 fertility decline and the 2021 baby bump, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a net increase in births among U.S.-born mothers of around 46,000 children.\"\n\nWhile the paper's authors did not look at national data for 2022, they did examine California birth rates between January and August of this year. They found in that state, \"which tracks the overall U.S. data closely,\" births \"remained elevated at a level similar to 2021.\"\n\nThe authors suggested that both improved child care and increased work-from-home flexibility \"might beassociated with higher future fertility.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen in coming years whether Delaware will reflect the national \"baby bump\" that researchers found, given the share of children ages 0 to 4 decreased at a faster rate from 2020 to 2021 (5.5% to 5.3%) compared to 2018 to 2019 (5.7% to 5.6%) and 2019 to 2020 (5.6% to 5.5%).\n\nStill, there's some hope. In Sussex County, the state's most rapidly growing county − which saw an increase in population of 3.6% between 2020 and 2021 − the share of children ages 0 to 4 decreased at a slower rate (0.01%) than the rest of Delaware.\n\nGot a story tip or idea?

However, most of these individuals were not receiving benefits.\n\nAre there millions in the Social Security database aged 100-159?\n\nYes, but the SSA knows many are presumed dead, and close to none of them receive payments.\n\nThe SSA uses death reports from a number of sources to denote when a person with a Social Security number has died and adds the information to a \"death master file,\" according to the 2023 report. Versions of the death master file are also given to federal benefits agencies and financial institutions to prevent and spot fraud.\n\nThe 2023 review found that 18.9 million people born in 1920 or earlier had not been reported dead nor kicked over to the death master file. That accounted for about 3.6% of all the unique Social Security numbers ever made.\n\n\"We believe it likely SSA did not receive or record most of the 18.9 million individuals’ death information primarily because the individuals died decades ago − before the use of electronic death reporting,\" the report stated.\n\nHowever, \"almost none\" of the 18.9 million Social Security number holders born in 1920 or earlier were receiving SSA payments, the 2023 report said, noting there were about 44,000 who were still receiving payments at the time of the audit.\n\nSocial Security protocol halts payment at age 115\n\nThe agency's lack of an automatic process to add people's information to the death master file once they surpass a reasonable life expectancy age was also flagged in an inspector general report in 2015.\n\nAs of September 2015, the SSA began to automate terminating benefits once people reached age 115, according to the website.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nElon Musk, DOGE and Social Security: What to know\n\nMusk's DOGE has attempted to access sensitive information at several federal agencies.

But even as babies struggling to breathe fill hospital beds across the United States, there may be a light ahead: After decades of disappointment, four new RSV vaccines may be nearing review by the US Food and Drug Administration, and more than a dozen others are in testing.\n\nThere’s also hope around a promising long-acting injection designed to be given right after birth to protect infants from the virus for as long as six months. In a recent clinical trial, the antibody shot was 75% effective at heading off RSV infections that required medical attention.\n\nExperts say the therapies look so promising, they could end bad RSV seasons as we know them.\n\nAnd the relief could come soon: Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Task Force, told CNN that he’s “hopeful” there will be an RSV vaccine by next fall.\n\nCharlotte Brown jumped at the chance to enroll her own son, a squawky, active 10-month-old named James, in one of the vaccine trials this summer.\n\n“As soon as he qualified, we were like ‘absolutely, we are in,’ ” Brown said.\n\nBabies have to be at least 6 months old to enter the trial, which is testing a vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health – the result of decades of scientific research.\n\nBrown is a pediatrician who cares for hospitalized children at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and she sees the ravages of RSV firsthand. A recent patient was in the back of her mind when she was signing up James for the study.\n\n“I took care of a baby who was only a few months older than him and had had nine days of fever and was just absolutely pitiful and puny,” she said. Brown said his family felt helpless. “And I was like, ‘this is why we’re doing it. This single patient is why we’re doing this.’ “\n\nEven before this year’s surge, RSV was the leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the US. The virus infects the lower lungs, where it causes a hacking cough and may lead to severe complications like pneumonia and inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs called bronchiolitis.\n\nWorldwide, RSV causes about 33 million infections in children under the age of 5 and hospitalizes 3.6 million annually. Nearly a quarter-million young children die each year from complications of their infections.\n\nRSV also preys on seniors, leading to an estimated 159,000 hospitalizations and about 10,000 deaths a year in adults 65 and over, a burden roughly on par with influenza.\n\nDespite this heavy toll, doctors haven’t had any new tools to head off RSV for more than two decades. The last therapy approved was in 1998. The monoclonal antibody, Synagis, is given monthly during RSV season to protect preemies and other high-risk babies.\n\nLessons learned after grave setback\n\nThe hunt for an effective way to protect against RSV stalled for decades after two children died in a disastrous vaccine trial in the 1960s.\n\nThat study tested a vaccine made with an RSV virus that had been chemically treated to render it inert and mixed with an ingredient called alum, to wake up the immune system and help it respond.\n\nIt was tested at clinical trial sites in the US between 1966 and 1968.\n\nAt first, everything looked good. The vaccine was tested in animals, who tolerated it well, and then given to children, who also appeared to respond well.\n\n“Unfortunately, that fall, when RSV season started, many of the children that were vaccinated required hospitalization and got more severe RSV disease than what would have normally occurred,” said Steven Varga, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who has been studying RSV for more than 20 years and is developing a nanoparticle vaccine against the virus.\n\nA study published on the trial found that 80% of the vaccinated children who caught RSV later required hospitalization, compared with only 5% of the children who got a placebo. Two of the babies who had participated in the trial died.\n\nThe outcomes of the trial were a seismic shock to vaccine science. Efforts to develop new vaccines and treatments against RSV halted as researchers tried to untangle what went so wrong.\n\n“The original vaccine studies were so devastatingly bad. They didn’t understand immunology well in those days, so everybody said ‘oh no, this ain’t gonna work.’ And it really was like it stopped things cold for 30, 40 years,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York.\n\nRegulators re-evaluated the guardrails around clinical trials, putting new safety measures into place.\n\n“It is in fact, in many ways, why we have some of the things that we have in place today to monitor vaccine safety,” Varga said.\n\nResearchers at the clinical trial sites didn’t communicate with each other, Varga said, and so the US Food and Drug Administration put the publicly accessible Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System into place. Now, when an adverse event is reported at one clinical trial site, other sites are notified.\n\nAnother problem turned out to be how the vaccine was made.\n\nProteins are three-dimensional structures. They are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids that fold into complex shapes, and their shapes determine how they work.\n\nIn the failed RSV vaccine trial, the chemical the researchers used to deactivate the virus denatured its proteins – essentially flattening them.\n\n“Now you have a long sheet of acids but no more beautiful shapes,” said Ulla Buchholz, chief of the RNA Viruses Section at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n“Everything that the immune system needs to form neutralizing antibodies that can block and block attachment and entry of this virus to the cell had been destroyed in that vaccine,” said Buchholz, who designed the RSV vaccine for toddlers that’s being tested at Vanderbilt and other US sites.\n\nIn the 1960s trial, the kids still made antibodies to the flattened viral proteins, but they were distorted. When the actual virus came along, these antibodies didn’t work as intended. Not only did they fail to recognize or block the virus, they triggered a powerful misdirected immune response that made the children much sicker, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.\n\nThe investigators hadn’t spotted the enhancement in animal studies, Varga says, because the vaccinated animals weren’t later challenged with the live virus.\n\n“So of course, we require now extensive animal testing of new vaccines before they’re ever put into humans, again, for that very reason of making sure that there aren’t early signs that a vaccine will be problematic,” Varga said.\n\nA breakthrough reinvigorates the field\n\nAbout 10 years ago, a team of researchers at the NIH – some of the same investigators who developed the first Covid-19 vaccines – reported what would turn out to be a pivotal advance.\n\nThey had isolated the structure of the virus’s F-protein, the site that lets it dock onto human cells. Normally, the F-protein flips back and forth, changing shapes after it attaches to a cell. The NIH researchers figured out to how freeze the F-protein into the shape it takes before it fuses with a cell.\n\nThis protein, when locked into place, allows the immune system to recognize the virus in the form it’s in when it first enters the body – and develop strong antibodies against it.\n\n“The companies coming forward now, for the most part, are taking advantage of that discovery,” said Dr. Phil Dormitzer, a senior vice president of vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline. “And now we have this new generation of vaccine candidates that perform far better than the old generation.”\n\nThe first vaccines up for FDA review will be given to adults: seniors and pregnant woman. Vaccination in pregnancy is meant to ultimately protect newborns – a group particularly vulnerable to the virus – via antibodies that cross the placenta.\n\nVaccines for children are a bit farther behind in development but moving through the pipeline, too.\n\nFour companies have RSV vaccines for adults in the final phases of human trials: Pfizer and GSK are testing vaccines for pregnant women as well as seniors. Janssen and Bavarian Nordic are developing shots for seniors.\n\nPfizer and GSK use protein subunit vaccines, a more traditional kind of vaccine technology. Two other companies build on innovations made during the pandemic: Janssen – the vaccine division of Johnson & Johnson – relies on an adenoviral vector, the same kind of system that’s used in its Covid-19 vaccine, and Moderna has a vaccine for RSV in Phase 2 trials that uses mRNA technology.\n\nSo far, early results shared by some companies are promising. Janssen, Pfizer and GSK each appear effective at preventing infections in adults for the first RSV season after the vaccine.\n\nIn an August news release, Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer of Vaccine Research and Development, said she was “delighted” with the results. The company plans to submit its data to the FDA for approval this fall.\n\nGSK has also wrapped up its Phase 3 trial for seniors. It recently presented the results at a medical conference, but full data hasn’t been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. Early results show that this vaccine is 83% effective at preventing disease in the lower lungs of adults 60 and older. It appears to be even more protective – 94% – for severe RSV disease in those over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions.\n\n“We are very pleased with these results,” Dormitzer told CNN. He said the company was moving “with all due haste” to get its results to the FDA for review.\n\n“We’re confident enough that we’ve started manufacturing the actual commercial launch materials. So we have the bulk vaccine actually in the refrigerator, ready to supply when we are licensed,” he said.\n\nEven as the company applies for licensure, GSK’s trial will continue for two more RSV seasons. Half the group getting the vaccine will be followed with no additional shots, while the other group will get annual boosters. The aim is to see which approach is most protective to guide future vaccination strategies.\n\nJanssen’s vaccine for older adults appears to be about 70% to 80% effective in clinical trials so far, the company announced in December.\n\nIn a study on Pfizer’s vaccine for pregnant women published in the New England Journal of Medicine this year, the company reported that the mothers enrolled in the study made antibodies to the vaccine and that these antibodies crossed the placenta and were detected in umbilical cord blood just after birth.\n\nThe vaccines for pregnant women are meant to get newborns through their first RSV season. But not all newborns will benefit from those. Most maternal antibodies are passed to baby in the third trimester, so preemies may not be protected, even if mom gets the vaccine.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says the long-acting antibody shot for newborns, called nirsevimab, should cover them for the first six months of life. She expects it to be a “game-changer.”\n\nThat shot, which has been developed by AstraZeneca, was recently recommended for approval in the European Union. It has not yet been approved in the United States.\n\nHope on the horizon\n\nThe field is so close to a new approval that public health officials say they’ve been asked to study up on the data.\n\nChu, who is also a member of an RSV study group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations, says her group has started to evaluate the new vaccines – a sign that an FDA review is just around the corner.\n\nNo companies have yet announced that process is underway. FDA reviews can take several months, and then there are typically discussions and votes by FDA and CDC advisory groups before vaccines are made available.\n\n“We’ve been working on this for several months now to start reviewing the data,” Chu said. “So I think this is imminent.”\n\nWatching this year’s RSV season unfold, Brown, the pediatrician who enrolled her son in the vaccine trial for toddlers, says progress can’t come fast enough.\n\n“The hospital is surging. We’re not drowning the way some states are. I mean, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina, they’re really drowning. But our numbers are huge, and our services are so busy,” she says.\n\nBrown says her son is mostly healthy. He doesn’t have any of the risks for severe RSV she sees with some of her patients, so she was happy to have a way to help others.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd while it’s far too early to say whether the vaccine James is helping to test will prove to be effective, the trial was unblinded last week, and Brown learned that her son was in the group that got the active vaccine, not the placebo\n\nHe has done well through this heavy season of illness, she says. The NIH-sponsored study they participated in is scheduled to be completed next year.\n\nThe vaccine, which is made with a live but very weak version of virus, is given through a couple of squirts up the nose, so there are no needles. The hardest part for squirmy James, she said, was being held still.\n\n“If we can do anything to move science forward and help another child, like, sorry, James.

The company said it hopes the treatment will be available in the United States for the 2023 - 2024 RSV season.\n\nThis year, RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, has overwhelmed pediatric hospitals all around the US. Nearly every child gets RSV prior to the age of 2, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While it can often be a milder respiratory infection for many children and most adults, studies show it is still a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants.\n\nGlobally, in 2019 alone, there were 33 million cases and more than 3.6 million hospitalizations. It’s estimated there were 26,300 in-hospital RSV deaths of children younger than age five and 101,400 deaths overall, according to a 2022 study published in the Lancet.\n\nThe new monoclonal antibody treatment is a joint project with AstraZeneca and Sanofi. It will be sold under the brand name Beyfortus (nirsevimab). Sanofi said it has been working in collaboration with AstraZeneca on the project for about five years.\n\nThe treatment is given to infants in a single dose shot at the time of birth or just before the start of the RSV season. And unlike with a vaccine where the body builds up its immunity in reaction to a vaccine over time, a monoclonal antibody works right away. The most common side effects are rash, injection site reactions and fever.\n\nIf approved in the US, Beyfortus would be the only single-dose RSV protective option for the general infant population. Sanofi said that broad protection is important, since 80% of infants that are hospitalized for RSV have no comorbidities.\n\nBeyfortus can also be used for a second RSV season in children that remain highly vulnerable to RSV infection, typically meaning children with underlying medical conditions.\n\nThere is another monoclonal antibody treatment approved in the US and Europe called palivizumab, or Synagis, that protects against infection in high-risk infants. With that treatment, infants get an intramuscular injection every month during RSV season and it usually requires 5 doses. The treatment was approved in 1998.\n\nApproval for Beyfortus from the European Commission was based on trial data that showed the treatment reduced the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV that needed medical attention by 70.1% compared to placebo in a Phase 2b trial, according to a news release from Sanofi. In a later stage Phase 3 trial conducted in 21 different countries, Beyfortus reduced the incidence of RSV-related bronchiolitis, inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs, or pneumonia that needed medical attention by 74.5% compared to placebo.\n\n“The totality of the data that we have generated across population indicates that protection is around 80% in the all-infant population,” said Jon Heinrichs, the global project head at Sanofi Vaccines Research & Development. “We believe it will make a huge difference on RSV.”\n\nRSV has also placed a big burden on doctors office and hospitals even outside of a bad RSV season like the one the US is seeing right now.\n\n“Imagine a situation where 80% of that disease could be prevented,” Heinrichs added.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says Beyfortus could be a “game-changer.”\n\nThe other advantage with a treatment like this is that if an RSV season were to start early like it did this year, with RSV hospitalizations shooting up to levels typically seen in December, it can deliver protection just in time for any infant.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBeyfortus would also protect the child directly. A vaccine given to a mother to offer passive protection to a child wouldn’t necessarily work for a child born after the RSV season is over. By then, the immunity would likely have worn off, Heinrichs said. Half of infants that are hospitalized with RSV are born outside of the RSV season.\n\n“So it’s really critically important in our minds at least to protect all infants from RSV disease, and we think this is the only way to do it,” Heinrichs said.\n\nIn the US, there are four new RSV vaccines that may be nearing review by the FDA, and more than a dozen are going through trials right now.

And the prospect of Congress breaking a deadlock in the coming weeks by passing another relief package for jobless Americans and struggling businesses remains uncertain.\n\nHistorically, the long-term unemployed have a much tougher time finding jobs than those sidelined for shorter spells. Skills erode over time, the theory goes, and extended unemployment may carry a stigma. That means a large group of Americans may have less income and spending power for years, even after the pandemic and its short-term economic effects are over.\n\nBesides the financial fallout for affected households, there’s a broader toll for the economy, whose post-pandemic scars will also include more than 100,000 business closures.\n\nThe long-term unemployed are “not working, they’re not spending,” says Carl Van Horn, director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.\n\nBleeding money\n\nAnd, he says, “A smaller workforce means a smaller economy” that produces fewer goods and services.\n\nKantorowitz is still receiving jobless benefits, but the $600 federal bonus in his weekly unemployment checks expired in late July, as it did for millions of other Americans. He put off a car repair, pared back to basic cable service and cut meat and seafood from his grocery list as he clips coupons.\n\n“I’m going to buy things that are on sale rather than what I want,” says Kantorowitz, who has drawn several thousand dollars from his savings to pay the bills. \"I'm bleeding money.\"\n\nIs this crisis different?\n\nYet some economists and staffing officials argue this downturn is different, and long-term unemployment won’t be a blemish for workers and an albatross for the economy, as in past recessions.\n\nThe pandemic threw more than 20 million people out of a work in an unprecedented wallop last spring. The economy was supposed to bounce back quickly, with business shutdowns in March and April, reducing COVID-19 cases and federal aid keeping companies and jobless workers afloat until restaurants, stores, and other outlets reopened and brought back employees.\n\nThe outbreak, however, has been much harder to subdue than believed. About 55% of the 22 million jobs the U.S. lost earlier this year have been recovered but recouping the rest could take a few years, economists say, even with a vaccine expected to be widely available next spring.\n\nAs a result, employers aren’t looking askance at the long-term unemployed or the millions who have dropped out of the job market, especially with many caring for sick relatives or children who are remote-learning from home, says Amy Glaser, senior vice president and staffing firm Adecco.\n\nWhile big resume gaps traditionally have raised concerns for hiring managers, “Not during the pandemic,” says Paul McDonald, senior executive director at Robert Half staffing. “A lot more employers are taking the candidate’s situation into consideration. These employers are selecting the best candidate for the job regardless if the person was out of work seven months or two to three weeks,” he says.\n\nJoblessness becomes a positive\n\nIn fact, a long bout of pandemic-induced unemployment may be a positive for some employers.\n\n“There’s a cachet for giving someone a job opportunity,” says Jim McCoy, senior vice president of talent solutions at ManpowerGroup, a staffing firm.\n\nTom Bemiller, head of Aureus Group, which owns a chain of three auto body shops in Pennsylvania, says he struggled to find workers before the pandemic, when unemployment was at a 50-year low of 3.5%.\n\nNow, he says, even though sales are down 35% this year, “I’m scouting for talent,” noting he can draw from an ample pool of unemployed auto body specialists.\n\nBemiller recently hired two technicians and an estimator who have been out of work more than six months, including one who was slow to search for a new job because of child-care duties and another who preferred to receive jobless benefits until his $600 weekly bonus ran out.\n\n“I’m very excited about it,” he says. “I got a really, really top-level technician.”\n\nBemiller says technicians’ skills don’t atrophy in six or nine months. Plus, he says, “In a normal world, a long stretch of unemployment is a red flag for me. In 2020, I’m going to talk to you. I want to hear your individual story. If I believe you’re going to work hard for me,” a long bout on the sidelines isn’t a drawback.\n\nOthers even say they welcome it.\n\n“We almost find it as an advantage,” says Will Caldwell, CEO of SnapnHD, which generates reports on housing flood risks for real estate and mortgage firms.\n\nJob candidates looking to switch to his La Jolla, California-based company are often wedded to the customer relationship software they used at their previous jobs, he says. Those who are unemployed “are going to be more open to learning our processes,” he says.\n\nAnd if they’ve been out of work more than six months? “I’m going to get someone with more hunger who wants to work,” he says.\n\nCaldwell plans to nearly double his staff of 20 over the next year to keep pace with revenue that has climbed 45% this year.\n\nStill a stigma?\n\nDespite employers’ goodwill, some economists believe the long-term unemployed will likely face the same old employer biases as the pandemic grinds on and their jobless stints lengthen.\n\nWith unemployment at 6.9% and more people vying for fewer jobs, companies “become very picky,” Van Horn of Rutgers says. “It’s supply and demand.”\n\nIf a long-term unemployed candidate is competing against others who are working or have been jobless for shorter periods, some firms may assume “they’re not good workers or they got turned down at other places,” Van Horn says. “I think the stigma will be there.” Plus, he says, “Skills actually do atrophy.”\n\nSome industries are changing for the long haul, and chronically jobless workers may not have the qualifications to match, says Harry Holzer, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Many laid-off retail workers, for example, may lack the skills for jobs that have become more heavily skewed toward e-commerce, he says.\n\nSome data supports this skeptical view. In October, people out of work less than five weeks found jobs at more than twice the rate of those unemployed six months or longer, according to figures from Moody’s Analytics and the Labor Department. Some of the disparity can be traced to furloughed workers who were quickly recalled by reopening businesses. But even among permanently laid-off workers, the short-term unemployed found jobs at twice the rate of their long-term jobless counterparts, the data shows.\n\n“We’re all hoping this (downturn) will be different,” says Till von Wachter, an economist at the University of California Los Angeles. “I don’t think the past tells us there will be a different outcome.”\n\nThe struggles of the long-term unemployed could depend partly on their occupation, von Wachter says. He doesn’t believe restaurant servers are grappling with skill erosion or a stigma in the eyes of prospective employers, but higher-skilled white-collar workers are more likely to face those challenges.\n\n'Keeps me up at night'\n\nKantorowitz has applied to dozens of jobs each week and notched a steady stream of interviews, including multiple rounds. But with few jobs available at hotels, he has been forced to hunt for sales positions in other fields, such as at a wine company, a bakery, and a senior home. In the end, he believes he’s just falling short because he lacks experience in those areas.\n\nIs his widening unemployment spell a turnoff for some companies?\n\nNo hiring manager has said as much, but, “It’s something that keeps me up at night,” says Kantorowitz, who thinks he also may be facing some age discrimination. That’s why he tells himself, “Just find yourself a seat” in the market by taking a job outside his specialty.\n\nKantorowitz also has taken a slew of webinars in an effort to stay current.\n\nKatty Douraghy, president of Artisan Creative, a recruiting firm for digital, creative and marketing jobs, says long-term unemployed workers aren’t at a disadvantage as long as they keep their skills updated, with designers learning the latest tools.\n\nThat’s precisely what Joe Campos, 42, who lost his job as an art director for Mattel in May, has been doing, along with coming up with new designs for consumer product companies and adding them to his portfolio. He’s not yet worried about the length of his unemployment but will grow more anxious if it extends past January.\n\n“I don’t want to make a desperate move and take a bad job,” he says. But he’s willing to take a junior-level creative job at lower pay to quickly get back in the game.\n\nBetter outlook?\n\nThe outlook for the long-term unemployed may soon brighten. If a vaccine is widely distributed by spring, the economy could bounce back more swiftly than expected, and chronically jobless workers who have been furloughed could be recalled while those permanently laid off suddenly find a plethora of open jobs, Holzer says.\n\nDuring this crisis, “The onus of long-term (unemployment) will be more apparent when the duration...increases further,” to a year and beyond, says Moody’s economist Sophia Koropeckyj, adding that “skill erosion has not really set in.”\n\nAsked if he’s encouraged by the prospect of a more vibrant job market, Kantorowitz says, “Are we talking March, June or September?” noting that his jobless benefits will expire in late spring.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/04/03/24-7-wall-st-healthiest-countries/70859728/", "title": "The healthiest countries in the world", "text": "Thomas C. Frohlich, Alexander Kent and Mark Lieberman\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nWorld Health Day is April 7, and people around the globe are turning their attention to health issues. The global infant mortality rate of 33.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013 has followed a long-term downward trend. Similarly, life expectancy has improved dramatically in recent decades. The improvements were uneven, however, and health conditions continue to vary widely between nations.\n\nIn order to assess the overall state of a country's health, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed a host of factors broadly categorized as health indicators, access measures, or the economy. The healthiest country, Qatar, led the countries reviewed with the highest overall score, while the least healthy country, Sudan, received the lowest score. These are the most and least healthy countries worldwide.\n\nNegative health outcomes were far less common in the healthiest countries than in the least healthy ones. Chief among them, life expectancy, tended to be far higher in the nations with the strongest overall health measures. Life expectancy at birth in all of the healthiest countries exceeded the global expectancy of approximately 70 years. A child born in Iceland is expected to live longer than 80 years, the highest life expectancy in the world.\n\nAccording to Gaetan Lafortune, senior economist at the OECD Health Division, life expectancy is perhaps the best way to measure the health of a nation. However, a range of indicators is necessary to capture the complex picture of a national population's health. Similarly, no single measure can explain a health outcome like life expectancy. Rather, only a wide range of behaviors, infrastructure characteristics, and economic factors can explain the strong or weak health outcomes in a nation.\n\nFor example, seven of the healthiest nations reported less than 10 incidents of tuberculosis per 100,000 people in 2013, a fraction of the global rate of 126 incidents of tuberculosis per 100,000 people. While lung diseases and other poor health outcomes were far less common in these nations, risk factors such as smoking were not necessarily less prevalent. The residents of the healthiest nations were actually more likely than most nations reviewed to report a smoking habit.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe quality of a nation's infrastructure and health system are closely related to a low prevalence of disease. Doctors were far more available in the healthiest countries than in the least healthy ones, for example. The prevalence of physicians in seven of the healthiest countries was at least double the global ratio of 1.52 physicians per 1,000 people. In all of the least healthy countries, on the other hand, there was less than one doctor per 1,000 people.\n\nThe quality of infrastructure is also very important for the health of a country's residents. \"Access to clean water in particular is absolutely crucial to avoid all sorts of diseases that lead to death for children and adults,\" Lafortune said. In all of the healthiest countries, drinking water is treated before it reaches residents' homes In half of the least healthy countries, less than half of the drinking water consumed in rural areas was treated.\n\nHealth care spending and the availability of resources are also major determining factors of nationwide health. As Lafortune noted, \"It is not too good for your health to be poor.\" Poor people — in any country — will be in worse health and live shorter lives than rich people.\n\nAll of the healthiest nations spent more than $2,000 per capita on health annually, versus the global expenditure of just over $1,000 per capita. With only one exception — Equatorial Guinea — the least healthy nations spent far less than the global figure. In fact, health care expenditures in seven of the least healthy countries was less than $100 per capita.\n\nOf course, high spending does not guarantee strong health outcomes. Annual health spending in the United States totalled $8,895 per capita, more than the spending of all but two other countries reviewed. Yet, the health of U.S. residents was rated worse than 33 other nations.\n\nAs Lafortune explained, the return from health spending is far higher in countries already spending very little. For example, immunization rates — which were as low as 25% in the Central African Republic for measles — can be increased dramatically with little resources. \"As spending goes up, what becomes more important is the efficiency of the spending,\" Lafortune said.\n\nIn many of the least healthy countries, living conditions are so poor that \"unhealthy\" may actually be an understatement. Recent regional violent conflicts may account for a country's exceptionally low life expectancy much more than other unhealthy behaviors, for example. Four of the least healthy countries — Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Yemen, and Sudan — have all been through at least one civil war since 1990. Haiti, while not exactly war torn, is still recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2010 as well as a cholera epidemic that emerged in the aftermath of the natural disaster.\n\nThese are the most healthy countries in the world.\n\n10. Australia\n\n> Life expectancy: 79.9 (5th highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 3.4 (21st lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $6,140 (6th highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 5.7% (58th lowest)\n\nBased on an assessment of healthy behaviors and outcomes, access to health services, and various economic factors, Australia is the 10th healthiest country in the world. The country's strong national health care system compared to most countries largely explains its ranking. There were about 3.3 physicians per 1,000 Australians in 2011, the 26th highest such ratio out of the 174 nations reviewed, and well more than twice the global prevalence of just over 1.5 physicians per 1,000 people. In addition, annual health spending totalled $6,140 per capita, sixth highest of all countries reviewed and nearly six times the global expenditure of $1,030 per capita. Partly as a result, country residents had among the world's longest life expectancies at nearly 80 years in 2012. However, Australia also had a relatively high obesity rate, at 28.6%, and a relatively high alcohol consumption rate.\n\n9. Sweden\n\n> Life expectancy: 79.9 (5th highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 2.4 (8th lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $5,319 (10th highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 8.1% (62nd highest)\n\nLike in most of the healthiest countries, Sweden has universal health coverage, with patient fees covering only a very small percentage of health costs. The country's annual health expenditures totalled $5,319 per capita, the 10th highest spending worldwide. The high health care spending and strong coverage have resulted in good health outcomes compared to most countries. There were just two infant mortalities per 1,000 live births and four maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in Sweden, both nearly the lowest such rates worldwide. Swedes also live longer than most people, with a life expectancy at birth of roughly 80 years. Compared to other healthy countries, however, Sweden's 2013 unemployment rate of 8.1% was relatively high.\n\n8. Singapore\n\n> Life expectancy: 79.9 (5th highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 2.2 (5th lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $2,426 (22nd highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 2.8% (13th lowest)\n\nThe small island nation of Singapore has a remarkably strong economy. Less than 3% of Singapore's workforce was unemployed in 2013, one of the lowest unemployment rates worldwide. Also, Singapore's GDP per capita of $55,182 in 2013 was one of the higher economic outputs worldwide. In addition to a strong economy, Singapore fares especially well in health measures. The nation's obesity rate of 6.2% was among the lower rates worldwide, and especially low compared to the healthiest countries. A child born in 2013 was also expected to live roughly 80 years, tied for the fifth highest life expectancy worldwide. While the city-state's health care system is universal, like many other especially healthy countries, it is a unique system. Residents are subject to a forced savings rate, and funds for medical expenses are saved in a Medisave Account. Catastrophic health insurance enrollment is automatic for all residents as well, although people can opt out.\n\n7. Austria\n\n> Life expectancy: 78.4 (20th highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 3.2 (15th lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $5,407 (9th highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 4.9% (45th lowest)\n\nHealth care spending in Austria totalled about $5,400 per capita annually, ninth highest out of all countries reviewed. Like many other healthy countries, the relatively high level of health care expenditure helps increase the number of physicians and quality of health care. There were nearly five doctors per 1,000 Austrians in 2011, the fourth highest ratio globally. As in most of the healthiest nations, the Austrian government controls most functions of the country's health care system. While Austria is one of the healthiest countries, nearly half of adult Austrians reported a smoking habit in 2011, one of the higher smoking rates worldwide.\n\n6. Iceland\n\n> Life expectancy: 81.6 (the highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 1.6 (tied-the lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $3,872 (16th highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 5.6% (56th lowest)\n\nIceland, by population, is the smallest of the 10 healthiest countries. Iceland is the sixth healthiest country worldwide partly because it had the highest life expectancy, which at 81.6 years was also a full year longer than Switzerland, the country with the second highest life expectancy. About 18% of adult Iceland women smoked, the 88th highest rate of all countries, while 19% of all adult males smoked, 17th highest of all countries. Iceland also had the lowest infant mortality rate, at just 1.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. Iceland's low infant mortality rate came even though a relatively low 91% of children aged 12 to 23 months received DPT — diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus — and measles vaccines.\n\n5. Japan\n\n> Life expectancy: 79.9 (4th highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 2.1 (3rd lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $4,752 (11th highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 4.0% (32nd lowest)\n\nWith 127 million people, Japan is the most populous of the 10 healthiest countries in the world. Ironically, it had the highest death rate of the top 10 countries, at 10 per 1,000 people. About one quarter of the nation's population was over 65 last year, a testament to the longevity and health of Japanese people. One factor contributing to the strong overall health rating is Japan's adult obesity rate of 3.3%, which was seventh best in the world and the best out of the 10 healthiest countries. Despite its high ranking, Japan has relatively high smoking rates for both males and females and one of the higher rates of CO2 emissions, at 9.2 metric tons per capita, almost twice the global average of 4.9 metric tons per capita. Japan's tuberculosis rate of 18 per 100,000 people was far below the global rate of 126 per 100,000 people.\n\n4. Luxembourg\n\n> Life expectancy: 79.1 (16th highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 1.6 (tied-the lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $7,452 (4th highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 5.9% (63rd lowest)\n\nWith the fourth highest per capita health care spending, Luxembourg, the only grand duchy in the world also has the fourth best health results, suggesting a link between health spending and outcomes. Luxembourg had the lowest mortality rates for both infants and children under five years old. But like most of the 10 healthiest countries, Luxembourg has a relatively high death rate. Though it is reasonably strong, the country's overall health ranking is likely held back by its residents' relatively high alcohol consumption of 11.9 liters per capita, and relatively high obesity rate of 23.1%.\n\n3. Switzerland\n\n> Life expectancy: 80.6 (2nd highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 3.6 (24th lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $8,980 (2nd highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 4.4% (40th lowest)\n\nWith the second highest life expectancy of all nations, Switzerland is the third healthiest country in the world. Switzerland had 3.9 physicians per 1,000 people, the ninth highest ratio of the 172 nations reviewed. The country ranked high overall despite a relatively high death rate of nine deaths per 1,000 people as well as prevalent risk factors. The per capita alcohol consumption in Switzerland of 10.7 liters was almost 73% higher than the global average. Also, an estimated 22% of adult females and 31% of adult males smoked. The incidence of tuberculosis in Switzerland of 6.5 cases per 100,000 people was 16th highest in the world. Despite these habits, Switzerland's population remains very healthy, perhaps due to its health care expenditure. An annual $8,980 per capita was spent on health in the country, the second highest globally.\n\n2. Norway\n\n> Life expectancy: 79.5 (9th highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 2.3 (6th lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $9,055 (the highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 3.5% (22nd lowest)\n\nNorway spends more on health care per capita than any other country. The country's annual health care spending totalled $9,055, ahead of Switzerland's $8,980 and the United States' $8,895. Norway had a relatively high death rate of 8.4 deaths per 1,000 people, six times that of Qatar. Norway's infant mortality rate, its mortality rate for those under five, and life expectancy rate at birth all ranked within the top 10 of all nations, however. While the country fared relatively poorly on health measures, its economy is very strong, and residents have some of the best access to health professionals and facilities in the world. Norway had the second best access to services, reflecting clean water and that its entire population had access to electricity. There were also nearly four physicians per 1,000 people in the country, one of the highest shares.\n\n1. Qatar\n\n> Life expectancy: 77.6 (28th highest)\n\n> Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): 7.0 (44th lowest)\n\n> Health expenditure per capita: $2,029 (25th highest)\n\n> Unemployment rate: 0.5% (2nd lowest)\n\nWhile Qatar topped 24/7 Wall St.'s health rankings, it was the only country of the 10 healthiest not to have a national health care system. As the emirate is transitioning to a universal system, however, the health of its population may become even better. Qatar plans to have its entire population covered by the end of this year. With 7.7 physicians per 1,000 people, more than any other country, the country's health system is already very good. Qatar fared very well in health, access, and economic measures, largely on the strength of its relatively low overall death rate of 1.4 deaths per 1,000 people and relatively low maternal mortality rate. The small Middle Eastern country, which is about the size of Connecticut, took steps to protect its citizens from diseases with 99% of children receiving the DPT and measles vaccines. As in several other prosperous and healthy nations, Qatar had the second-highest obesity rate in the world.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the most and least healthy countries, 24/7 Wall St. collected data on 21 measures on more than 170 countries. These measures were grouped into three categories: health, access, and economy.\n\nWhile our index aspires to be comprehensive, many measures are also interrelated. To account for interdependence, our index was created using a geometric mean rather than the traditional arithmetic mean. We then used the geometric mean of each index to calculate a country's overall score. Potential scores ranged from one to 172, with lower values indicating better scores.\n\nOne challenge was data availability for all 172 countries. We addressed this challenge in two ways. The data is for the most recent year available but also needed to be no older than 2010. Secondly, data had to be available for at least 75% of countries. In addition, we only considered countries with at least 150,000 people.\n\nThe health category captured both outcomes and residents' behaviors in each country. Infant mortality, fertility, maternal mortality, and the incidence of various diseases came from the World Bank. We used the World Bank's life expectancy figure for males as a proxy for life expectancies for all people because it is much more widely available in the countries reviewed. Smoking rates and the percentage of children with certain immunizations also came come the World Bank. Lastly, we considered per capita alcohol consumption and adult obesity rates from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe access category was designed to measure the availability of specific resources that are critical to the health of a nation's people. We looked at the share of a country's population with access to clean water, clean air, and electricity — all data from the World Bank. Additionally, we looked at the concentration of physicians in each country as a proxy for how easily residents can access health care.\n\nEconomic conditions also have an impact on health and health outcomes. The economy category included per capita health expenditure by public and private sources, as well as poverty and unemployment rates. All economic data came from the World Bank.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Parkland\n\nFamily members of the victims killed in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, will address the shooter face-to-face in court for a second day today. In an emotional hearing that began Tuesday, several family members took to the stand to deliver their statements directly to Nikolas Cruz, the now 24-year-old shooter who avoided the death penalty last month. Among several chilling remarks, the younger brother of one of the 17 victims shared that he walks by his sister’s room every day and sees that it’s empty. Another victim’s mother recounted “listening to the screams and the howling” of families after the shooting. Cruz will be officially sentenced this week following a jury’s recommendation he should be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\n2. RSV\n\nPfizer says it will seek FDA approval this year for a vaccine to prevent respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The virus typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but it can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults and infants. Pfizer’s vaccine candidate is administered to pregnant women who then make antibodies that can protect the baby after birth. In the trial, the vaccine appeared to be about 80% effective at preventing severe RSV disease in infants during the first three months of life. If approved, Pfizer’s shot will be the first against RSV and the first new product related to the infection in over two decades. Worldwide, RSV causes about 33 million infections in children under the age of 5 and hospitalizes 3.6 million annually.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It's awful': Doctor explains RSV symptoms as cases surge 04:03 - Source: CNN 'It's awful': Doctor explains RSV symptoms as cases surge 04:03\n\n3. Ukraine\n\nUkraine’s Air Force said it has no effective defense against the types of ballistic missiles that Iran is preparing to ship to Russia to use in its war in Ukraine. Western officials say Iran is working to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including short-range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield. This expected shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support for Russia’s war effort. In recent weeks Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine. While the precise timing of when the new shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will be delivered before the end of the year.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This is what a missile strike looks like: Clarissa Ward reports from Ukraine 02:47 - Source: CNN This is what a missile strike looks like: Clarissa Ward reports from Ukraine 02:47\n\n4. Inflation\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to make history yet again today, approving a fourth-straight interest rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point. This comes after Democratic lawmakers sent a letter this week to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressing concerns about the central bank’s plan to raise rates at an “alarming pace.” Noting the Fed’s new unemployment forecast, the letter pressed Powell to address the millions of job losses that could result from its war on inflation. The Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Katie Porter, highlighted comments from economists who worry the Fed is moving too aggressively. They pointed to a recent warning from the UN of a central bank-fueled global recession. This comes as the Fed raises interest rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s – weighing down the stock market, spiking mortgage rates and fueling recession fears. Powell said last month that no one knows if the rate hikes will cause a recession, or how deep that recession might be.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hold on to the assets that you have: Larry Summers gives advice as recession looms 03:24 - Source: CNN Hold on to the assets that you have: Larry Summers gives advice as recession looms 03:24\n\n5. SpaceX\n\nSpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, the world’s most powerful rocket, returned to the skies on Tuesday for the first time since 2019. The massive rocket is hauling satellites to space for the US military in a secretive mission dubbed USSF-44. There is not much information available about the mission, but the US military said that the launch will put multiple satellites into orbit on behalf of a program that focuses on quickly developing space technology as it relates to tracking objects in space, as well as a range of other activities. Though the Falcon Heavy is currently the most powerful operational rocket in the world, there are two rockets waiting in the wings to claim that title – including NASA’s SLS rocket, which is currently slated to attempt to send the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission around the moon later this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch: SpaceX completes first Falcon Heavy mission in three years 00:58 - Source: CNN Business Watch: SpaceX completes first Falcon Heavy mission in three years CNN Business 00:58\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nThis dashcam video is cracking up cops\n\nA man’s unusual behavior during a traffic stop has officers comparing him to Forrest Gump.

Alabama’s preliminary, seasonally adjusted jobless rate for April was 3.6%, down a bit from March and nearly 10 percentage points below April 2020, when shutdowns prompted by the coronavirus outbreak decimated businesses. The number represents about 80,000 unemployed people statewide compared to nearly 290,000 at the same time a year ago. The number of people employed increased by 253,632 over the year to 2.2 million, according to a statement from the Alabama Department of Labor. With more open jobs than unemployed people, average weekly earnings for business rose to $968 in April, up more than $67 over the year. “Wage growth is astounding in Alabama,” Labor Secretary Fitzgerald Washington said. “We hit record highs in both hourly and weekly wages for all sectors, and the leisure and hospitality sector, which has been clamoring for workers, also hit record highs. Employers in Alabama are responding to labor shortages by raising wages, as to be expected.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Residents could soon access their vaccination records through their phones and other devices. The state health department is working to adopt technology that would give residents easy access to immunization records, which could also provide proof of COVID-19 vaccinations, Alaska’s News Source reports. The state plans to use the consumer access portal MyIR Mobile, whose technology is already available in Arizona, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Dakota, Tennessee, Washington, West Virginia, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. After people register, they can access their state immunization records. “I would really like people to think of MyIR Mobile as your old yellow vaccination card, and that is what it is,” said Matt Bobo of the state health department. Officials are working with the state’s information technology department to make sure the program is secure. Just last week, the health department took its website offline to investigate what it said was a malware attack. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy opposes any so-called vaccine passports and has said the state will not require anyone to show proof of vaccination. But businesses, nonprofits and employers with certain limitations can require people to be vaccinated. There’s no timeline on when MyIR Mobile will be operational, Bobo said.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A weekly Pima County-sponsored event called Vax After Dark is immunizing people whom health clinics, physician’s offices and large vaccine sites have missed. “We’re in the difficult part of getting people immunized,” said Dr. Theresa Cullen, director of the Pima County Health Department, which started the effort last month. “Every person we get vaccinated helps us control and get out of the pandemic.” The outdoor pop-up sets up tents and chairs – this time in the parking lot of Antigone Books in Tucson – plays Top 50 music, and puts a lot of resources into inoculating a relatively small number of people. About 20 people were working out of the unit at its most recent three-hour event Thursday from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., and a total of 36 people were vaccinated, which hardly compares to the hundreds per hour who can get shots at large-scale sites. Still, Pima County officials consider the effort a success because Vax After Dark reaches people who otherwise might not get a COVID-19 shot – people who don’t have a regular health provider, feel disconnected from the health system, don’t have a way to get to a large-scale site or have lingering questions about the vaccine. “If not for this, I might still be wondering where to go,” said Justin McCawley, 46. “I’m not very adult when it comes to my health.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The city has received more than $10.6million of an expected $21.2million in federal funding from this year’s coronavirus relief package, and some of that could be used for sewer line work required in the city’s federal consent decree. “There are regulations on how the funds can be spent, and infrastructure for water/sewer is included,” Fort Smith’s Deputy City Administrator Jeff Dingman wrote in an email. “Staff is working on how those funds might be incorporated into the project and rate planning we already have underway.” Dingman said when city administration staff has an approach for the Board of Directors to consider, it will be presented for approval. The funds are kept in a separate bank account for “transparent tracking and monitoring,” he said. The city entered a $225 million-plus, 12-year consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Justice in late 2014 to improve wastewater runoff that was getting into the Arkansas River. A five-year extension was granted in May 2020. The city estimated $22 million in consent decree-related capital improvements were needed in 2021. Another six years in extensions are being requested due to issues that arose during the 2019 flood and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The huge Los Angeles Unified School District will start the new school year next fall with on-campus, in-person instruction for all students five days a week but will retain an online option, Superintendent Austin Beutner said Monday. Elementary school students will have full days of instruction with their teacher and classmates, while middle and high school students will change classrooms for each period, said Beutner, who leads the nation’s second-largest school district. After-school programs will be available to students from the end of the school day until 6 p.m. Beutner said, however, that an online option must remain in place for the next school year for students who are unable or choose not to come to schools for in-person instruction. “Some students and some staff members may need to stay at home until all at schools are vaccinated due to health reasons because they live with an immunocompromised family member,” Beutner said, adding that he expects the majority of students and staff to be at school every day. Students and staff will wear masks until more children are vaccinated, he said. The superintendent reiterated his assertion that Los Angeles Unified has in place the highest safety standards of any school district in the nation.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Democrats outlined their priorities Monday for $3.8 billion in federal coronavirus relief destined for the state under the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan, and budgetary support, workforce development, affordable housing and mental health top their agenda. Gov. Jared Polis, majority Democrat legislative leaders and the four Democratic members of Colorado’s congressional delegation gave an overview of the plans at a Capitol news conference. Polis and others emphasized that the outline came after virtual and in-person meetings with Coloradans across the state in recent months. Polis said roughly $1.3 billion will be used to shore up current and future state and local spending; another third will go to workforce development, affordable housing, and mental and behavioral health; and a similar amount will support transportation and rural development and agriculture spending. Some of the state budget support will be unveiled in legislation currently being drafted for consideration this legislative session, said Sen. Dominick Moreno, chair of the Joint Budget Committee. A bipartisan legislative task force will study how to invest the coming pandemic relief funds in housing, behavioral health and job creation over the summer, said House Speaker Alec Garnett.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: After months of limited public access amid the pandemic, some of the last municipal buildings in the region have reopened to residents. As of Monday, Norwich City Hall is opening its doors to public traffic from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. five days a week. Mayor Peter Nystrom said the reopening decision was made based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and comes at a time when the rest of the state is also seeing a relaxing of gathering strictures. In addition to the municipal building, the police department headquarters’ lobby reopened to the public, and the Rose City Senior Center will resume some programming June 1. According to the center’s website, a limited number of classes will be offered at first, and other programming will be “slowly re-introduced,” with more visitors allowed into the facility over time. Municipal buildings in Killingly and Plainfield have been open to the public for several months with only brief public shutterings since the spring of 2020, while Griswold reopened its town hall in April. Pomfret Town Hall will reopen to the public June 2 from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. – but only on Wednesdays at first.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Sailors aboard the Chiquita Passion cargo ship received their first and only dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine Thursday in an effort to protect the crew in their international travels. Officials from the Delaware Division of Public Health alongside the Seamen’s Center of Wilmington boarded the ship to inoculate a couple dozen crew members at the Port of Wilmington. Sailors expressed their gratitude and relief to be able to get vaccinated before returning to their home countries. Kasyan Yuriy, captain of the Chiquita Passion, said the vaccine would help him and his crew feel more protected against the coronavirus while they perform their essential work. The sailors’ jobs help fuel a global exchange of goods, including food products, produce and cars. The Ukrainian maritime crew traverses the world to transport these goods, greatly increasing their chances of contracting COVID-19. The crew arrived in Wilmington after a five-day voyage from Guatemala. In April 2020, sailors were confined to their ships because companies weren’t switching out crews at the time due to COVID-19. Today, the situation isn’t much different. Sailors aboard the Dole Ecuador ship, whose crew was vaccinated May 19, are not allowed to leave their ship.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As the city reopens from its COVID-19 restrictions, the D.C. History Center is trying to capture stories from the past year and a half in a time capsule, WUSA-TV reports. Anne McDonough, deputy director of the D.C. History Center, said it’s important to hear directly from Washingtonians about what it was like to live through the pandemic in real time. “When you’re in the middle of something, it can be really hard of course to think about how this is going to be perceived or researched or examined in the years to come,” McDonough said. The collection, “In Real Time,” is a collecting initiative of the D.C. History Center that began in April 2020. It asks the public to help in documenting the historic events that took place during the past year. In its 127-year history, this is one of the first times the D.C. History Center has focused on collecting stories of an event while it is still occurring. Other institutions such as the D.C. Public Library, Humanities D.C., and the National Museum of African American History and Culture are also saving stories from the pandemic. To contribute to the collection, residents can upload a picture or story to the D.C. History Center. Optional prompts ask how COVID-19 has impacted families and what acts of kindness have been witnessed during this time.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis agreed to temporarily suspend sales taxes on back-to-school supplies; emergency preparedness purchases and recreational activities meant to encourage people back into the outdoors; music venues; museums; and other post-pandemic endeavors. But so-called tax holidays he signed into law Friday are being offset by the taxes the state will now collect on online purchases, to take in an estimated $1 billion annually. Some of the early proceeds would be transferred to the state’s unemployment trust fund and reduce unemployment taxes for businesses. The first holiday arrives this week during a 10-day period in which Floridians can prepare for the upcoming hurricane season without paying sales taxes on certain purchases. In late July and early August, Floridians won’t have to pay sales taxes for school supplies, some clothing and the first $1,000 for a computer. New to the “tax holiday” lineup this year is a “Freedom Week” during the first week of July on recreational purchases, as well as for purchasing tickets for concerts, athletic events and museums. The Republican governor used the bill signing event at a Home Depot in Pensacola to criticize other states he said put “repressive polices” in place during the coronavirus outbreak that “locked down their people.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state will use federal coronavirus relief money to temporarily pay all the costs of child care for 50,000 children enrolled in a program that subsidizes care for lower-income families. The state Department of Early Care and Learning said the plan will cost an estimated $95 million and last until Oct. 2, 2022. The extra money, which began with payments to child care facilities last week, is being offered to current and new participants. The payments will be made automatically, and parents don’t have to do anything to enroll. Normally, parents have to pay a designated family share of tuition in the Childcare and Parent Services program, in tiers up to 7% of their income. Parents also normally have to pay any difference between the weekly maximum the state is willing to pay under CAPS and what a child care facility actually charges. An annual survey of costs by ChildCare Aware of America finds that child care centers charge an average of $168 a week to care for an infant in Georgia. DECAL estimates in that scenario that parents would save $35 a week, or $1,820 a year. Parents will still be charged for transportation, meals or other fees. DECAL officials say they are trying to help families whose incomes may have declined during the pandemic and help more people get back to work.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state will once again require people receiving unemployment insurance benefits to search for work as a coronavirus testing program for travelers and growing vaccinations fuel a recovery of the tourism industry, Gov. David Ige says. Those filing for unemployment will need to report at least three steps they took to look for work from May 30 through June 5 when they submit their weekly claim June 6, said Anne Perreira-Eustaquio, director of the state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. Those steps can include filling out job applications, interviewing for jobs and registering at the jobs website HireNetHawaii.com, she said. Hawaii’s unemployment rate was 9% in March, the highest in the nation and above the national average of 6%. But the rate has improved since peaking at 23.8% in April 2020. Ige said he would maintain other pandemic-era unemployment insurance benefits, including a weekly $300 federal supplement. The Democratic governor said he believed the extra payment helps unemployed residents pay rent and other expenses, which helps the economy. “As you know, the cost of living in Hawaii is higher than in other jurisdictions. And we have heard of many in our community who continue to struggle to find work and who continue to be unemployed,” Ige said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist Ammon Bundy is running for governor, according to documents filed Friday with the Secretary of State’s office. Bundy, best known for leading an armed standoff at an Oregon wildlife refuge five years ago, is running as a Republican in the 2022 Idaho gubernatorial primary, according to campaign finance documents. Current Gov. Brad Little, Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin and four other Republicans – Jeff Cotton, Edward Humphreys, Lisa Marie and Cody Usabel – have also filed campaign documentation needed to run for governor. So far no Democratic candidates have entered the race. Bundy garnered international attention when in 2016 he led a group of armed activists in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to protest the federal control of public lands. He was eventually arrested and later acquitted of all federal charges in that case. Bundy currently has two misdemeanor criminal trespassing cases pending against him in Idaho, and he’s representing himself for both. The cases stem from events during a protest of coronavirus restrictions at the Idaho Statehouse last August. He’s pleaded not guilty in one case and has not yet entered a plea in the second.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Amtrak is resuming full passenger rail service across the state as the number of COVID-19 cases falls. Gov. J.B. said Pritzker last week that the full long-distance interstate schedule restores service on four state-sponsored lines. Service on the Hiawatha line between Milwaukee and Chicago resumed Sunday. Routes connecting Chicago and Quincy, Chicago and Carbondale, and Chicago and St. Louis will operate at full capacity by the middle of July. Tickets for travel on those lines can be reserved now. Amtrak has stations in 30 Illinois communities and served more than 1 million riders per year before the coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker’s office said an Illinois capital development program includes $1.1 billion for rail improvements, including $78 million to upgrade rail crossings and improve safety.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana AFL-CIO is criticizing Gov. Eric Holcomb’s decision to withdraw the state from federal programs providing an extra $300 in weekly payments to unemployed workers and expanded jobless benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The labor union said it cost the state nothing to remain in the programs, arguing that they have provided millions of dollars a week to families who could soon face having no income. Holcomb announced last week that the state would leave those federal programs effective June 19. Many businesses blame their difficulty filling job openings on the extra $300 weekly payment and programs that provide jobless aid to self-employed or gig workers and to people who have been unemployed for more than six months. Indiana AFL-CIO President Brett Voorhies said Holcomb was “trying to coerce Hoosiers into low-paying jobs.” “If he really wants to get Hoosiers back to work, he should focus on making sure parents have affordable child care, more Hoosiers are fully vaccinated, and the available jobs are good, union jobs that pay living wages and provide good benefits,” Voorhies said. “Choosing to eliminate financial aid to Hoosier families is cruel and unnecessary.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The coronavirus pandemic may have hastened the state’s shift toward an unwanted milestone – fewer births than deaths each year. Iowa, like much of the nation, has been going through a “baby bust” for more than a decade, and the decline accelerated during 2020 and the first two months of 2021. Meanwhile, the number of deaths in the state spiked 16% last year, to 35,651, as a wave of COVID-19 infections accelerated a years­long increase in deaths. The death total nearly equaled the 36,057 children born last year to Iowa parents. Preliminary reports suggest March 2021 brought a bit of a rebound in Iowa births, reflecting pregnancies that began early last summer. A total of 3,106 babies were born in Iowa in March 2021, compared to 3,026 in March 2020. But overall, the state’s birth rates have been sliding since 2007, the year before the country’s last big recession. Laura Lindberg, a research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, said some Americans who delayed starting or expanding families because of the pandemic might try to become pregnant in the next few months or years. But she doesn’t expect a dramatic baby boom that would suddenly push the birth rate up to where it was more than a decade ago.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A public school district is trying to figure out how to keep school board meetings accessible online without hindering public comments after YouTube concluded that a video of a recent meeting spread misinformation about COVID-19 and removed the video. The Shawnee Mission school board’s meeting last Monday saw several parents and a state lawmaker call for the district to remove its mask mandate, The Kansas City Star reports. Several residents of the district in Johnson County have spread misinformation about COVID-19 and mask-wearing at county, city and school board meetings during the past year. But district spokesman David Smith said it was the first time that the district learned a video was removed. More than two dozen residents gathered before the meeting to protest the district’s mask mandate, which officials have said will stay in place. State Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican who’s argued for ending coronavirus pandemic restrictions, was in the crowd and spoke during public comments. YouTube’s community guidelines list COVID-19 fallacies it will remove, including that the coronavirus is not real or that children cannot get infected. Smith said the district is still talking about how to manage the issue. “We really don’t want to lose our ability to broadcast,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: More residents need to get vaccinated to avoid a bump in COVID-19 cases, health officials say, or the city could be in for a “rough fall.” Louisville Chief Health Strategist Dr. Sarah Moyer said during a news conference Wednesday that she’s “frustrated” that only 38.7% of people in the city are fully vaccinated. A little more than 48% of residents have received at least a first dose. “We have plenty of vaccine available in every ZIP code in the county, as well as transportation access,” Moyer said. She said the city will take suggestions on how to break through to those resistant to vaccines and will hold more education events and talk to employees because “until we can get that number up, none of us are truly safe.” Louisville had 542 new COVID-19 cases the week of May 10-14, the fewest since July 2020, but “if people choose to go maskless before they are vaccinated, we will see that number go up,” she said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now said fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks in many situations, and Gov. Andy Beshear will largely drop a mask mandate for vaccinated Kentuckians on June 11. Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer of U of L Health, said it’s possible to get to 70% vaccinated over the next two months or so.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: House lawmakers rejected a modest increase in the state’s jobless benefits and a return-to-work incentive payment aimed at driving people to exit unemployment and go back to work. Only 44 legislators voted for the bill by Rep. Rodney Lyons, while 54 House members voted against it Thursday. Lyons, D-Harvey, initially proposed to raise Louisiana’s maximum weekly unemployment benefits – currently set at $247 – by $28. That was a deal struck by some business and labor associations to raise benefits that are the second-lowest in the nation. But Republicans on the House labor committee also added a provision by GOP Rep. Mike Echols into the bill that would have given residents receiving unemployment a lump sum payment of $500 or $1,000 to go back to work, if they gave up their right to claim jobless benefits for six months. Some opponents objected to raising unemployment benefits. Others objected to giving a bonus payment to jobless people who are required to search for work in order to receive unemployment.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New mask guidance took effect in the state Monday, which means residents no longer need to wear face coverings indoors in most situations. Mainers, with the exception of state employees, can go maskless in most indoor settings, except for schools and day care. State officials are still recommending that people who are not yet vaccinated against COVID-19 wear a mask indoors. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, made the decision in mid-May to align the state rules with the latest guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state is also lifting physical distancing requirements at indoor public settings where people are eating or drinking, such as bars and restaurants. But state employees will have to wear masks in shared indoor work spaces until at least July 7, the state budget commissioner said in a Friday memo. Businesses, meanwhile, are free to set their own rules, but one major supermarket chain already relaxed its mask rules. Hannaford announced that vaccinated customers no longer had to wear masks effective Monday in Maine. Customers who have not been vaccinated are asked to continue to wear a mask inside stores. Monday was also the first day for several other newly relaxed pandemic requirements, including a removal of all capacity limits in public settings, whether indoors or outdoors.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Federal authorities in the state have seized the domain name of a website accused of fraudulently offering to sell COVID-19 vaccines. The U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of Maryland said “COVIDReliefSociety.org” is the 10th virus fraud-related domain name that it has seized since the pandemic began. In a news release Thursday, prosecutors said the website promised same-day delivery of COVID-19 vaccines anywhere in the world but actually collected visitors’ personal information to launch phishing attacks and deploy malware. The site now bears a message that the federal government has seized it. “In a time when we are urging people to get vaccinated for COVID-19, it is reprehensible that fraudsters are trying to prey on unsuspecting residents and their families,” acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan Lenzner said in a statement. Investigators believe the site’s domain name was created in December. It included an image of what appeared to be a screen capture of vaccine developer Moderna’s website and trademarked logo, according to prosecutors.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Fans are being allowed to return to the TD Garden in greater numbers this coming weekend, just in time for Bruins and Celtics playoff runs, arena management announced Monday. Even though the arena will open to “near full capacity” Saturday, fans will still be required to wear face coverings and follow other COVID-19 safety protocols, management said in a statement. “The Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics have confirmed with their respective leagues that TD Garden is permitted to align with city and state guidelines and return to near full capacity beginning May 29, 2021,” the statement said. TD Garden has been permitted to host fans at 25% capacity since May 10. The Celtics have home playoff games against the Brooklyn Nets scheduled for Friday and Sunday. The Bruins finished off their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series against the Washington Capitals 3-1 on Sunday, and their second-round opponent will be either the Pittsburgh Penguins or the New York Islanders.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer apologized Sunday after apparently violating state-mandated social distancing guidelines at an East Lansing bar and grill. It was the latest pandemic-related misstep for the Democratic governor, who waited weeks to disclose partial details of a private jet trip she took to visit her father in Florida after two of her top aides headed south as coronavirus cases surged in Michigan and as residents were cautioned against traveling south for spring break. A photo circulated on social media of Whitmer with a large group of unmasked people at a bar-restaurant, The Landshark Bar & Grill. The photo, which shows Whitmer seated with about a dozen others, was posted on social media by one of the attendees but later deleted. “Throughout the pandemic, I’ve been committed to following public health protocols,” Whitmer said in a statement Sunday. “Yesterday, I went with friends to a local restaurant. As more people arrived, the tables were pushed together. Because we were all vaccinated, we didn’t stop to think about it. In retrospect, I should have thought about it. I am human. I made a mistake, and I apologize.” Michigan restaurants and bars remain subject to capacity limits and social distancing requirements. Current orders require six people or fewer at tables and distances of 6 feet between tables.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has accelerated after several sluggish weeks. The pace of inoculations remained above 40,000 shots a day Sunday, a level not previously seen for more than two weeks. Data shows a big increase in first vaccine doses, which now average nearly 18,000 a day, up from about 10,000 a day a week ago. Some of the increase can likely be attributed to 12- to 15-year-olds who are now eligible for the vaccine. Minnesota was averaging 60,000 shots a day at one point last month before the numbers began dropping, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Officials continue to encourage Minnesotans to keep their guard up during proms, graduations and other spring events, noting that more coronavirus variants are driving new cases across the state. The state’s largest portion of confirmed cases is among people in their 20s, more than 110,000 since the pandemic began. The number of infected high school-age people has also grown, with more than 49,000 15- to 19-year-olds known to be infected throughout the pandemic. Experts say young people are less likely to feel the worst effects of the disease but worry they can spread it to older or more vulnerable people. The latest numbers show about 63% of Minnesotans 16 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, and 56% have been fully vaccinated.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state could see more than $700million in federal funding for broadband over the next few years, thanks to pandemic aid, Federal Communications Commission grants and a possible infrastructure bill. That doesn’t include indirect funding sources such as Paycheck Protection Program loans for broadband-related businesses, subsidies for ratepayers, grants for 5G development and older grant opportunities like the FCC’s Connect America Fund. The large influx of investment is likely to dramatically alter the digital landscape of Mississippi, which has long been a broadband desert, ranking last in the nation for internet connectivity. According to U.S. census data, Mississippi has the lowest rate of broadband subscribers per capita. Broadband in rural areas has long been a large contributor to the digital divide – the gap between who benefits from reliable internet connections and who doesn’t. As the pandemic pushed schools into online learning, many school districts and colleges were faced with the struggle of ensuring everybody had access. For some, this meant mailing out mobile Wi-Fi hot spots to students, opening school parking lots for Wi-Fi access, or even sending out homework by mail.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A series of COVID-19 vaccine clinics will be held at public park facilities in the next eight weeks, a Springfield-Greene Park Board spokesperson said Monday. Clinics are coming soon to taxpayer-owned locations like Rutledge-Wilson Farm Park, Dickerson Park Zoo and the Mizumoto Japanese Stroll Garden. To sweeten the deal for folks getting their arms jabbed, “special incentives” are available, including free admission to facilities on the days clinics are held for those who choose to get vaccinated, Park Board spokesperson Jenny Fllmer Edwards said. Similar “givebacks” include a “thank-you card” that offers a variety of discounts for park board services like boat rentals, Edwards said. The Springfield-Greene County Health Department said in a news release that it identified locations in places with relatively low vaccination rates where it appeared that the largest number people could be reached as part of a strategy to meet people “where they are.” The clinics are available for walk-ins, but individuals may save time by registering on the Missouri Vaccine Navigator. Preregistered individuals are asked to bring their ID and patient identification number from the website. A parent or guardian’s consent is required for children ages 12 through 17, the health department said.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: City-County Health Officer Trisha Gardner received a standing ovation from commissioners, staff and attending citizens for her leadership throughout the COVID-19 health crisis during last week’s Great Falls City Commission meeting. “It was very unexpected,” Gardner said. “It’s an honor to serve this community.” Commissioner Owen Robinson recognized Gardner stepped into her job in late 2019, just months before COVID-19 became a reality in Great Falls, which he described as “probably the most critical time for a public health officer in Cascade County, ever.” Commissioner Mary Sheehy Moe commended Gardner for her service to the community during the pandemic. “By February of this year, nearly 1 in 6 Americans was living in a community at the height of a pandemic without a public health officer,” Moe said. “Great Falls, Montana, was not one of those communities.” Moe recalled how COVID-19 reached its peak last fall and said how despite how much pushback the Board of Health received, Gardner focused on what would keep the city safest in the short term and coronavirus-free in the long term.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state will end a $300-a-week unemployment bonus that has been going to jobless workers during the pandemic, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Monday, declaring a “return to normalcy” and rescinding the last of his coronavirus-related executive orders at what he called his last pandemic-related news conference. Nebraska joined at least 22 other Republican-led states that are halting the additional unemployment benefits, including assistance for gig workers and the self-employed, who don’t normally qualify. Ricketts said the extra benefits will end June 19. Ricketts pointed to Nebraska’s status as the state with the lowest unemployment nationally last month and one of the lowest overall throughout the pandemic. He said he also believes the $300 benefit creates a disincentive to find a job when the state’s online job portal has 39,000 open positions. Workers’ advocates have disputed that argument and countered that employers should offer higher pay if they want to attract quality employees. Ricketts, who has opposed prior minimum wage increases, said employers should pay what the free market dictates. “I certainly think the employers should pay what the market demands to hire people,” he said. “The government should not be interfering with that by artificially driving that number up.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Long-simmering disputes over coronavirus restrictions in the Legislature boiled over Thursday when the Democratic majority voted to punish Republican lawmakers for refusing to comply with rules in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Under rules announced Wednesday, people in the state Capitol can roam the building without face coverings as long as they have been vaccinated. Republican Assemblywomen Annie Black and Jill Dickman went mask-free on the Assembly floor Thursday but refused to make known whether they had received COVID-19 shots. Dickman was escorted out of the Assembly floor after staff told her that she would have to prove she had been vaccinated. She refused. In a party-line vote, the Assembly elected to strip Black of her right to vote on measures and address the chamber until she apologized for violating legislative rules. She remained on the Assembly floor. “This is WAY out of control!” Black tweeted after the incident. Democratic Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson said the Assembly rules allowed people to forgo masks but required they wear them if they have not been vaccinated. “We were informed that there were persons who had not confirmed they were vaccinated and would not wear masks, so they didn’t comply with our rules,” he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College is increasing mental health support and loosening some COVID-19 restrictions in dorms amid concerns about students feeling isolated. “The pandemic has exacerbated many problems, but foremost among them has been mental health,” Dartmouth President Phil Hanlon and other officials said Friday in message to students, employees and parents of undergraduates. “On this critical issue, we must do more to support our community.” Under the new rules meant to increase socialization, students are now allowed to host two guests who also live on campus in their dorm rooms at the same time, the Valley News reports. The college also is adding a second nurse to the on-call staffing at its health center and plans to add new counselors and a student wellness coordinator to expand mental health services. The two counselors will also receive suicide prevention training following the deaths of multiple students throughout the pandemic. The changes were announced two days after the death of a freshman at her home in New York. Two other freshmen and a junior also have died this academic year. A candlelight vigil for all four will be held Tuesday night.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state will lift its indoor mask mandate for people vaccinated against COVID-19 beginning Friday, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. The announcement comes about a week after Murphy, a Democrat, rejected similar mask guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying he wanted “more time on the clock” for people to get vaccinated. Also on Friday, the state is lifting the requirement for maintaining 6 feet of distance between patrons at all indoor and outdoor businesses such as restaurants, retail stores, gyms and casinos. New Jersey had been an outlier, with neighboring Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania aligning with the CDC soon after its advice came out. The state’s vaccination rates have been climbing, with Murphy pledging to fully inoculate 70% of the population by June 30. Murphy faced a torrent of criticism over the delay, especially from Republicans who are hoping to defeat him in November as he seeks reelection to a second term. He dismissed it, though, and said the decision focused on avoiding more deaths from COVID-19. Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli pointed to daily deaths still in the double digits and the daily infection rate hovering above lows seen last summer as rationales for continuing the mask mandate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The September spectacle featuring funnel cakes, turkey legs, livestock and art exhibits, and carnival rides plans an in-person return this year. The New Mexico State Fair was scrapped in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, although some events took place virtually. The event drew about 475,000 visitors from around the state and region to Albuquerque in 2019. Spokesman Wyndham Kemsley said Thursday that officials are confident the fair can be held safely in person, with more hand-washing and sanitation stations, as well as social distancing. “We have one of the biggest properties in New Mexico, so we have a lot of open space,” he said. The fair is scheduled for Sept. 9-19. Organizers are looking to hire hundreds of employees. Ticket sales for another big event, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, are expected to start in July. The fiesta, too, was canceled last year. Its early morning mass ascensions, fireworks shows and launches of special-shaped hot air balloons attract hundreds of thousands of spectators from across the globe and hundreds of balloon pilots and their crews. The fiesta is set for Oct. 2-10. The New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs announced Thursday that all the state museums have reopened and several historic sites.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio promised a return to normal for the nation’s largest public school system Monday as he announced that classrooms will open for in-person instruction in September with no remote option. “It’s time for everyone to come back,” said de Blasio, a Democrat. “It’s time for us all to be together. It’s time to do things the way they were meant to be done. All the kids in the classroom together getting a great education from educators who care, staff members who care.” He said the roughly 1 million students who attend traditional public schools will be in their classrooms with some version of the coronavirus protocols that have been in place in the current academic year, including mask-wearing and testing for the virus. After closing schools in March 2020, New York City was one of the first large U.S. cities to reopen school buildings in the fall of that year, but the majority of parents chose online-only learning for their children. Children and staff members who have been in physical classrooms have been randomly tested for the coronavirus, and the city has reported very low rates of virus transmission in the schools. The head of the union that represents city teachers said that while there is “no substitute for in-person instruction,” some students might still need a remote option next fall.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Interested in a little extra spending money for the upcoming holiday weekend? Health officials in four North Carolina counties will offer $25 incentives for those who’ve yet to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The state Department of Health and Human Services announced a pilot program starting Wednesday at certain vaccine sites in Mecklenburg, Guilford, Rowan and Rockingham counties. Adults who get their first dose at the sites or drive someone for that first-dose appointment will receive $25 cash cards, DHHS said in a new release. The “Summer Cash Cards” will be available through June 8 while supplies last. The State Employees Credit Union is providing the cards for the pilot. The incentive is another effort by DHHS to boost vaccination rates entering the summer. The North Carolina Zoo offered last week a free ticket for those who received their first COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic on the zoo property. A similar offer will occur June 10-12. More than 52% of the adult population in North Carolina had received at least one dose as of late last week, according to DHHS data.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Air travel has picked up in the state, but it has not returned to the level recorded before the coronavirus pandemic hit. The state’s eight commercial service airports saw a significant increase in passenger numbers last month compared to April 2020. The state Aeronautics Commission said the airports in Bismarck, Minot, Williston, Dickinson, Grand Forks, Fargo, Devils Lake and Jamestown collectively had 62,163 passenger boardings last month. That compares with 92,063 in April 2019. Just 4,964 passengers traveled by air in April of last year as the pandemic spread. That was the lowest monthly total since record keeping began four decades ago, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “Our airports and aviation industry have endured a long road to recovery since last April, when passenger levels dropped 95% as our country worked together to slow the spread of COVID-19,” state Aeronautics Commissioner Kyle Wanner said. “Leisure travel has been growing and allowing for an initial recovery in air travel demand. As the nation’s recovery from the pandemic continues, we would also like to see additional business travel begin to cycle back into the market.” Millions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid have been sent to North Dakota airports. The latest is a $1.2 million award to the Williston airport.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans have reported nearly 6,000 medical issues arising in the days and weeks following their COVID-19 vaccinations, but it’s impossible to know which problems, if any, were actually caused by the shots. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allows anyone to submit a report to its Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System online. That means reports are not verified, and many of the symptoms people report, beyond the expected mild side effects, might have no direct link to the injection, said Dr. Susan Koletar, director of the division of infectious diseases at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. In recent months, Ohioans reported everything from abnormal X-rays and colonoscopies to concussions, pink eye, general feelings of apathy and, on the more serious side, suspected blood clots. “It is absolutely not a reason to not get it,” Koletar said. “A lot of (the reports) are expected side effects. People should expect that their arm should hurt a little bit. … Is getting the vaccine worth not feeling great? I think the answer is ‘yes.’ ” In fact, the most common events reported to the CDC in Ohio were fever and chills, arm pain and an assortment of body aches. Such side effects can actually be a sign that the immune system is working to create protective antibodies, experts say.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: When the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a grinding halt in March 2020, the leaders of the city’s agencies dedicated to helping those experiencing homelessness had no choice but to push forward. The number of people served by those programs fell from 10,171 in 2019 to 9,874 in 2020, according to the city’s Homeless Management Information System. Closures and capacity reductions meant fewer people were able to receive services. Staff, volunteer, and supply shortages meant less manpower and fewer goods to go around. The day shelter at the Homeless Alliance’s WestTown Campus went from serving at least 350 people a day to being able to allow only 64 people inside at a time, according to Kinsey Crocker, director of communications. “It’s been a rough 15 months,” said Jerod Shadid, program planner for homeless services for Oklahoma City. The city showed its highest levels of homelessness in more than a decade in the city’s 2020 point-in-time count, when the community had not even started to see the effects of COVID-19. No point-in-time count was conducted this year because of the pandemic, making it harder to see some trends, but numbers collected by the Homeless Alliance showed a rise in unsheltered homeless people fairly early in the pandemic.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: State officials are betting that the desire to win $1million will boost the percentage of Oregonians vaccinated against COVID-19. With only half of residents either fully or partially vaccinated, Oregon Lottery officials approved a plan Friday to hold a special drawing. Those who have been vaccinated by June 27 will be eligible for the drawing the following day. “It’s never been easier to get a vaccine, so don’t miss your shot to enter,” Gov. Kate Brown said. She said the effort aims to raise the percentage of adult Oregonians who get vaccinated to 70% in order to fully reopen the state. The Oregon Health Authority said 50% of Oregonians were vaccinated as of Friday. Residents who have received at least a first dose are automatically entered to win through the state’s vaccine database. Brown, responding to a question at a Zoom news conference, said people who are in Oregon illegally and have been vaccinated are also eligible to win the prize. Other states are also trying the tactic, including New York, Maryland and Ohio. Oregonians 18 and older will have the chance to win $1 million or one of 36 $10,000 prizes, with one winner in each county. Residents ages 12 to 17 will have a chance to win one of five $100,000 Oregon College Savings Plan scholarships.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will resume work-search requirements in July for hundreds of thousands of residents receiving unemployment compensation, a top Wolf administration official said Monday. Gov. Tom Wolf’s acting labor and industry secretary, Jennifer Berrier, told a state House of Representatives committee hearing the requirement will resume July 18, meaning people claiming jobless benefits will have to search for work during the previous week. She also said a work registration requirement will resume in September. The rules have been waived by Wolf under his emergency disaster authority invoked during COVID-19 pandemic. Republicans in Pennsylvania’s GOP-controlled Legislature have pushed Wolf to reinstate the requirements, and Rep. Torrin Ecker, R-Cumberland, urged Berrier to resume the work-search requirement earlier than July. Employers in Pennsylvania and across the country say they are struggling to find enough workers and put the blame on jobless benefits that are padded with a $300-a-week federal pandemic benefit. Wolf’s office said it has not found the extra cash benefit or the suspension of the work-search requirement to be primary factors in a “perceived labor shortage.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Lippitt House Museum, one of the best-preserved Victorian interiors in America, plans to reopen for tours early next month, officials said Monday. The semi-private, staff-guided tours that resume June 4 will follow COVID-19 safety best practices. Advance reservations are required. The tours take visitors through the elaborately decorated rooms in the context of the home’s residents and workers and the roles they played in industry, immigration, design and civic engagement. “The elaborate decor, spacious rooms, and the large windows of Lippitt House make it an attractive destination for people looking for a safe way for the entire family to explore one of New England’s cultural treasures,” museum Director Carrie Taylor said in a statement. The house that dates to 1865 is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: “I am from a place I can’t go back to; This year on the Island has felt like a new life, that I am still waiting to begin.” That’s the opening line of 10-year-old Vince Mathison’s poem “Where I’m From,” written for an assignment in his virtual fourth grade class at Hilton Head Island Elementary School, The Island Packet reports. He was told to write based on a poem with the same title by George Ella Lyon, including descriptions of his family, his food and his feelings on the pandemic. His classmates did the same: “I am from the computers which I face every day, and the teachers so close, yet so far away,” one wrote. “No friends around, no more playdates, no more BBQs,” wrote another. But Vince might have had the most unique answer to “where I’m from”: His hometown is Shenzhen, China. He wrote that what was meant to be a two-week visit on Hilton Head in February 2020 has turned into a 15-month stay. Vince got “about two weeks” of in-person school before Gov. Henry McMaster moved schools to virtual classes through the end of the year. Since 2015, the Mathison family has come to Hilton Head Island to celebrate Chinese New Year and, belatedly, Christmas with mom Linzi’s grandparents. Most commercial air carriers reduced or suspended routes to and from China in February 2020.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge will decide next month whether three members of the U.S. Marshals Service should be found in civil contempt over his requirement to have everyone in his courtroom vaccinated against COVID-19. Judge Charles Kornmann notified courthouse employees in March that the inoculations would be required in order to provide the safest environment for everyone. The U.S. marshal for South Dakota, Daniel Mosteller, responded to the judge by telling him that the U.S. Marshals Service is not requiring employees to get the vaccine and that they will not provide their vaccination status to the court. Kornmann held his first courtroom session for the year May 10. The U.S. marshal who brought the first defendant into the courtroom refused to disclose her vaccination status, Aberdeen American News reports. As a result, Kornmann told the marshal to leave and pulled in a different deputy marshal to sit in the courtroom. The chief deputy marshal, Stephen Houghtaling, told Kornmann by phone that the remaining defendants scheduled for hearings had been removed from the courthouse because the marshals service didn’t think it could keep the courtroom secure without two marshals in the room. Kornmann noted that the Marshals Service hasn’t followed that practice in the past.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A slew of tenants left their downtown homes at the height of the pandemic, some following a national trend of trading urban core living for the space and relative affordability of the suburbs. Downtown’s occupancy rate plummeted from 95% in the first quarter of 2020 to about 78% as the year came to a close, according to data from the Greater Nashville Apartment Association. But in the first few months of 2021, downtown Nashville went from the city’s worst-performing neighborhood to its most in-demand for apartment living. Apartments in downtown, the Gulch and SoBro saw a staggering 5.2% increase in the number of occupied units, according to Apartmentdata.com. “Everybody’s coming back to the downtown area. Since Jan. 1, the price of an apartment downtown has gone up, on average, $124,” said Cindi Reed, the site’s vice president of sales and development. And the greater Nashville area apartment market’s rapid recovery isn’t limited to downtown. From January to April, tenants moved into 2,413 of the metro area’s available units – what real estate professionals call absorption. Apartments took a hit in 2020, absorbing just 3,600 units during the entire year. In 2019, the area absorbed 5,681 units.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: About 60% of the COVID-19 vaccine doses that have spoiled since the state’s vaccination program began in December were wasted in roughly the past two weeks, according to an analysis of state data released last week. A Houston Chronicle analysis of the roughly 60,000 doses spoiled since December found about 36,000 were lost in the prior two weeks, indicating plummeting demand for the vaccine in Texas. The number of wasted doses through spoilage of the highly perishable vaccine was still a minute fraction of the state’s vaccine allotment. The state has been administering an average of about 144,000 vaccinations daily. Even so, that was less than half of the 290,000-dose-a-day peak last month. Just 1 in 3 Texans was fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Thursday, mostly with the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, while 42% have received at least one dose. More than 51,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Texas during the 15-month pandemic out of the more than 3.2 million positive coronavirus test results reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 1,910. That’s down 13.8% from the previous week’s tally of 2,215 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Utah ranked 20th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Cases fell in four counties, with the best declines in Salt Lake, Utah and Davis counties. Utah ranked 34th among states in share of people receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 44.1% of its residents at least partially vaccinated. The national rate is 49.2%, a USA TODAY analysis of CDC data shows. In the week ending Sunday, Utah reported administering another 130,930 vaccine doses, including 61,780 first doses. In the previous week, the state administered 119,890 vaccine doses, including 40,475 first doses. In all, Utah reported it has administered 2,514,415 doses. Meanwhile, 32 people across the state were reported dead of COVID-19 in the week ending Sunday. The week before that saw 34 deaths recorded. A total of 2,290 Utahns have died from the disease, Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Amtrak service in the state will start running again July 19 after being suspended for more than a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tickets are currently available for the Vermonter and the Ethan Allen Express state-supported train service, officials said, according to WCAX-TV. “The trains will be running on the same schedules that were in place when the state suspended service on March 26, 2020,” Transportation Secretary Joe Flynn said in a statement last week. “We appreciate the patience of all of our customers, including the many Vermonters who relied on these trains for transportation when the pandemic struck.” The train service was suspended last March after the the governor issued a state of emergency. The Vermonter runs between Washington D.C. and St. Albans, and the Ethan Allen Express runs between New York City and Rutland.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Hampton University will give financial assistance to graduates in the classes of 2020 and 2021. WAVY-TV reports university President William R. Harvey announced the assistance in a letter to graduates Friday. Graduates with federal student loans will be given $500 toward repayment of their loans. The payment will go directly to the U.S. Department of Education loan servicer that oversees the loans. Students who do not have federal student loans will be reimbursed their graduation fee of $150. The pandemic has taken a toll on all aspects of campus life, and a virtual commencement that wasn’t up to the university’s standard of excellence only added to concerns, Harvey said. He understands what graduates missed by not having an in-person ceremony, he said. Graduates will be honored at an in-person ceremony on campus in December. Students will be provided details by the end of June.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: In another hopeful sign that the state’s travel industry is bouncing back after pandemic-induced lows last year, Amtrak says it’s restoring daily service on 12 long-distance routes across the country, including two that run through Seattle. Starting Monday, both the Empire Builder – Chicago to Seattle/Portland – and Coast Starlight – Seattle to Los Angeles – routes resumed daily service, giving passengers on the West Coast more travel options, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports. The routes had previously only been operating three times a week because of low ridership during the pandemic. The Amtrak Cascades route was also adding a second round-trip between Seattle and Eugene starting Monday, and a third round-trip on the Seattle-to-Portland segment will also be added. Service to stations north of Seattle – Everett, Mount Vernon and Bellingham – remains suspended. Trips to British Columbia on the Cascade line have also not been restored due to the ongoing border closure. Following COVID-19 health protocols set by the state as part of its reopening plan, capacity for train cars has been set to 50%. The service restoration is expected to bring back 1,200 furloughed employees.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Women and children who participate in a nutrition program will receive a temporary benefit boost this summer for the purchase of additional fruits and vegetables, state health officials said. The Women, Infants and Children program will increase the benefit amount to $35 per month for each eligible participant from July through September. The current benefit is $9 per child, $11 for pregnant or postpartum women, and $16.50 for mothers who breastfeed, the Bureau for Public Health’s office of nutrition services said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture offered the increase through $490 million from the federal coronavirus relief package passed this year. “Investing in WIC helps address food insecurity, a critical issue faced by many West Virginia families during the COVID-19 pandemic,” state program director Heidi Staats said. “The USDA funding more than triples the fruit and vegetable benefit to allow purchase and consumption of more canned, frozen and fresh fruits and vegetables.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nLa Crosse: A priest who has been ignoring gathering restrictions at his Masses and criticized Democrats for their stance on COVID-19 vaccines says the leader of the Diocese of La Crosse has asked him to resign. The Rev. James Altman announced the request from Bishop William Callahan during his sermon Sunday at St. James the Less Catholic Church in La Crosse. The sermon was recorded and posted to YouTube. “As the bishop has stated to me: I am ineffective. So for the record, dear family, Bishop Callahan has asked me to resign as pastor as of this past Friday, two days ago, because I am divisive and ineffective,” Altman said. Audible “no” sounds from the crowd can be heard during the video, the La Crosse Tribune reports. Altman came under fire last fall for calling Democrats godless and warning they would go to hell if they don’t repent. Later, he called COVID-19 protocols “Nazi-esque controls.” “Let us be clear, God damns every single one of those godless moves, whether it be in civil government or worse, in the complicity of many in the church,” Altman said during a Palm Sunday Mass. “In fact, if hell itself has many levels, the lowest, hottest levels are the final burning place for those shepherds who were complicit in the godless restrictions.” Altman said his lawyer is challenging the bishop’s request.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Wyoming Department of Health has announced the likely final phase for statewide public health orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the immediate removal of one of the two remaining orders that affected indoor events of more than 500 people. Mask-wearing and physical distancing requirements in an order related to K-12 schools will remain through May 31, while the same requirements for colleges are immediately eliminated. “We are making these changes now because we are confident in the effectiveness of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines,” said Dr. Alexia Harrist, state health officer and state epidemiologist with WDH. “We are seeing excellent results among those who have been vaccinated. The vaccines are doing their job very well.” Department data shows more than 28% of residents are fully vaccinated, with more people choosing to get COVID-19 shots every day. “I strongly encourage anyone who is eligible but who hasn’t yet been vaccinated to do so as soon as possible,” Harrist said. She said she expects specific protocols for the safe operation of K-12 schools will be determined at the school district level past June 1.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/05/22/housing-market-2019-more-buyers-bust-budgets-purchase-homes/3747092002/", "title": "Housing market 2019: More buyers bust budgets to purchase homes", "text": "A nationwide housing shortage has eased somewhat. Home price gains have moderated. And bidding wars are no longer commonplace.\n\nYet buyers are still blowing through their budgets by ever-higher amounts to lasso their dream homes, according to a recent survey by Owners.com, a real estate brokerage.\n\nThe finding shows that even in a more buyer-friendly market with more choices, many shoppers still struggle to land the house that meets their needs.\n\n“Finding the right house is still very challenging,” says Dario Cardile, vice president of growth at Owners.com. “To get quality, they need to go up.”\n\nThirty-eight percent of home buyers topped their spending limits, up from 32% a year ago, according to the March survey of 1,800 home buyers who made a purchase within the past four years. And they busted their budgets by an average $20,000, up from $16,510 in the early 2018 survey.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“People are going above their budgets more than we expected,” Cardile says.\n\nAmong the reasons more buyers are splurging: Despite the cooler market, prices are still climbing and inventory remains relatively low, especially in large coastal cities.\n\nThere were 1.83 million existing home listings in April. And while that total is up from 1.67 million a year earlier, it remains below a normal level, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThe median price was $267,300, 3.6% higher than in April 2018. Although that price is still rising, it's less than the 5% to 6% annual price gains a year earlier. Meanwhile, Americans’ average pay increases have accelerated above 3%, seemingly easing the financial strain.\n\nCompetition for houses has also eased. Clients of Redfin who made offers on homes faced bidding wars 15% of the time last month, according to the real estate brokerage. That was down sharply from 60% a year earlier.\n\nBut it’s still not easy to snag that ideal house in a good neighborhood with top-notch schools that’s a short commute from the office, Cardile says. About half the buyers surveyed said finding the right home was the most challenging part of their house hunt, more than those who cited saving up for the down payment.\n\nJohn Frazier, 71, hunted for a one-bedroom condo in downtown Philadelphia for weeks early this year but found nothing suitable within his $250,000 price limit.\n\n“We looked at a bunch of places but couldn’t find anything where I wanted to be and what I wanted,” says Frazier, who was moving with his partner from an apartment in midtown Manhattan to take a part-time public relations job in Philadelphia. Some units were too far from his preferred Center City neighborhood while others were older and needed work.\n\nSo Frazier increased his cap by $50,000 and quickly found a modern, top-floor condo for $300,000 with spectacular views and a health club, and within walking distance of shopping, his doctors and the city’s theaters. The unit had attracted other buyers, and so Frazier offered $5,000 above the list price. The owner accepted, and he moved in March 22.\n\n“It was right, and that’s why I went the extra $5,000,” he says. “I wanted to shut off a bidding war.”\n\nAlthough he’s spending about $200 a month more than he initially intended, the monthly payment is still within his budget, he says.\n\nAmong the different age groups of buyers:\n\n• Thirty-nine percent of Gen Xers went over budget and by $35,000 on average, up from 34% who topped their spending limits by an average $13,996 a year ago.\n\n• Twenty-seven percent of baby boomers busted their budgets by an average $25,000, compared with 19% who went over by $8,024 last year.\n\n• More millennials surpassed their spending caps – 46% – up from 40% last year. But they cut the average amount they overspent in half to $12,000.\n\nIt’s not that millennials are being more frugal, Cardile says. If anything, entry-level homes favored by people in their 20s and 30s have posted sharper price increases than more expensive trade-up units. Rather, he suggests millennials increasingly are using online tools to narrow down their searches. As a result, he says, they’re savvier about the market, prompting them to set higher spending limits and exceed them by smaller amounts.\n\nWhere property taxes are lowest: Which states have the highest and lowest property taxes?\n\nGM's secret weapon: GM engineers hid secret tailgate in storage room for 2 years\n\nAnother factor is that just 41% of millennials said finding the right home was their biggest challenge, compared with 52% of Gen Xers and 56% of boomers. Many millennials are still single or childless and less tied to jobs, making them more willing to move to mid-sized markets to buy affordable homes, Cardile says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/22"}]}

He said three recently terminated Pentagon employees, Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick and Colin Carroll, were put on leave because an internal investigation found they'd fed information to the media.\n\n\"If we think you are leaking to the press, that's a very real problem. We take that very seriously at the Pentagon,\" Hegseth said. \"Disgruntled former employees are peddling things to try to save their ass, and ultimately, that's not going to work.\"\n\nHegseth said the Pentagon launched an investigation with the Defense Department's Office of Special Investigations following a series of stories that relied on non-public information. He said the investigation \"led to some unfortunate places, people I have known for quite some time, but it's not my job to protect them.\"\n\nHe said the Pentagon plans to turn over information about leakers to the Department of Justice.\n\n\"When that evidence is gathered sufficiently ‒ and this has all happened, very quickly ‒ it will be handed over to DOJ, and those people will be prosecuted if necessary,\" he said. \"The leakers know who they are, and we know over time the truth will be told.\"\n\nHegseth's appearance came after the New York Times, citing four anonymous sources, reported Sunday that Hegseth shared sensitive military information in a Signal chat with a group that included his wife, brother and personal attorney. The communication mirrored the attack plans on Houthi militants in Yemen that Hegseth shared in a separate Signal chat of Trump officials the same day that inadvertently included the editor of The Atlantic magazine.\n\nHegseth did not deny sending the information to his wife Jennifer, a former Fox News producer, or his brother and personal attorney, both whom have jobs in the Pentagon. But he said the information wasn't war plans.\n\n\"I look at war plans every single day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination and other things,\" Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth told Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade he believes the story came from information leaked by a terminated former Pentagon employee.\n\n\"Why would it surprise anybody, Brian, if those very same people keep leaking to the very same reporters, whatever information they think they can have to try to sabotage the agenda of the president or the secretary?\" Hegseth said. \"Once a leaker, always a leaker, often a leaker.\"\n\nHegseth also downplayed an account from former chief Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who in an opinion piece published in Politico detailed \"a month of total chaos at the Pentagon\" under Hegseth's leadership. Ullyot resigned last week.\n\n\"Anybody that knows John, knows why we let him go. We did a lot of favors for John, did some good work up front, and he was moved along,\" Hegseth said, accusing Ullyot of mispresenting things to the press. \"We did right by him. We tried to help. He's spinning it otherwise. It's too bad. It's politics I guess.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has stood behind Hegseth amid the controversies, and the White House denied a report by National Public Radio that Trump is looking at potential replacements to lead the Pentagon.\n\n“Pete's doing a great job,” Trump said Monday, touting military recruitment numbers with Hegseth in command. \"It's just fake news. They just bring up stories. I guess it sounds like disgruntled employees. You know, he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people, and that’s what he’s doing.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended Hegseth, telling reporters hours after his Fox News appearance that the reporting on use of a second Signal chat to share information was a \"smear campaign.\"\n\n\"The president stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth, and the change that he is bringing to the Pentagon,\" Leavitt said.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.

Yes. It won't happen now | Opinion", "text": "It was recently revealed that weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared classified attack plans in a Signal chat with a journalist, he did it again. This time, the chat included his wife and brother.\n\nImmediately, speculation over whether Hegseth would remain in the Trump administration for the long term began to formulate, with news outlets reporting that the Trump administration was looking to move on from him as head of the Department of Defense.\n\nThe Trump administration quickly denied these rumors, which I tend to believe, but I also know it's not likely to happen. As much as I dislike Hegseth and think he should be fired and should have never been appointed, he is still everything he was when Trump selected him: a good communicator who is unqualified to lead the Pentagon. Even still, there is little incentive for Trump to abandon him so quickly.\n\nHegseth is incompetent, but that doesn't matter to Trump\n\nAmericans shouldn’t expect the revolving door of Cabinet members that was commonplace in the first Trump administration. His increased power over the Republican Party reduces the likelihood of frequent firings, even if this Cabinet is more outlandish.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhether it be Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Hegseth, incompetence isn’t a trait that is punished in a Trump administration. It's actually ignored as long as these Cabinet members remain loyal. Nothing else matters to Trump and, increasingly, Republican leaders.\n\nDespite the mishandling of classified information in Signal chats, which has created news stories critical of Trump, these hardly qualify as scandals in the grand scheme of the Trump world. It helps that Hegseth has been busy doing Trump's work with the military, such as firing three DOD employees who were speaking to the news media without authorization.\n\nOn April 24, Hegseth’s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, became the fourth top official to be fired or reassigned in the past week amid political turmoil at the Pentagon.\n\nTrump supporters easily brush off criticisms of Hegseth’s poor decision-making and dismiss valid criticism as a “hoax,” or at least downplay it. After all, it's what Hegseth and other administration officials did in response to the Signal story.\n\nFor Trump, Hegseth's benefits outweigh his shortcomings\n\nHegseth is a true MAGA culture warrior in the Department of Defense. From reinstating the name of Fort Bragg (notably after a different Bragg), to advancing the removal of transgender service members, he is able to create all the right headlines for Trump's administration.\n\nIt also helps that Hegseth's objective of restoring a \"warrior culture\" to the DOD appeals to traditional conservatives like me.\n\nMost important, though, he has no problem being combative with the mainstream news media, which Trump obviously adores.\n\nTrump faced an uphill battle to get Hegseth confirmed, and replacing him would be no easy political sell. For now, Hegseth’s benefit to the administration outweighs the negative press he is creating. It's not until the scales shift against him that Hegseth needs to worry. Until then, he's fine to stay incompetent as long as he also stays loyal.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/11/24/pete-hegseth-story-sex-assault-investigation/76477124007/", "title": "Pete Hegseth's changed story in sex assault investigation", "text": "The disputed 2017 sexual encounter that could sink President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Defense Department involved alcohol, personal dislike − and a shifting narrative that sexual assault experts say could weaken former Fox News anchor Pete Hegseth's credibility.\n\nHegseth told investigators in a recently released 2017 police report that he had only consumed beer and was \"'buzzed' but not intoxicated\" at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa in northern California before the incident, which led to a sexual assault investigation and a confidential monetary settlement.\n\nHegseth's statement to police directly conflicts with a 2017 witness account − and with recent statements by Hegseth's attorney, who said he was visibly intoxicated on the night in question and that his alleged victim was \"the aggressor in the encounter.\"\n\nNo charges were filed and Hegseth has insisted the encounter was consensual.\n\nThe release of the graphic police report came the same day that former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration as Trump's next attorney general over allegations of sexual misconduct involving a minor.\n\nIn addition to Gaetz, Trump has nominated three other men accused of sexual misconduct to important positions in his next administration: Hegseth, Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nWhile Gaetz had faced an uphill confirmation battle, Hegseth is \"going to be in pretty good shape,” Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the likely next chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Thursday after meeting with the nominee.\n\nA 'creeper' vibe\n\nThe 2017 allegation centers on a California Federation of Republican Women convention where Hegseth, a telegenic Republican culture warrior, was the keynote speaker on Saturday, October 7, and his alleged victim was a staffer for the organization.\n\nOn several occasions that night, the alleged victim expressed dislike for Hegseth.\n\nIn texts to her husband, who was staying at the hotel with, according to reports, their two small children, she wrote that Hegseth was giving off \"creeper\" vibes, ridiculing him as he spoke from the podium.\n\n\"I'm going to be here all night,\" she wrote. \"It's awful.\" She also texted her husband that she had been drinking \"much more than normal.”\n\n'Crotch blocker'\n\nLater that night, after conference attendees moved from an after-party to a sports bar in the hotel, the alleged victim intervened when Hegseth became pushy in asking another woman back to his room, touching the woman's knee as he made his play, according to the police report.\n\nThe woman \"gained the attention of JANE DOE,\" as the alleged victim is called in the police report, \"and had JANE DOE become a 'crotch blocker,'\" an investigator wrote. The alleged victim didn't appear intoxicated, this witness told police.\n\nA poolside argument\n\nVideo surveillance footage showed Hegseth and the alleged victim leaving the hotel bar, arm in arm, around 1:15 a.m. on Oct. 8.\n\nBy 1:30 a.m., noise complaints sent a hotel employee to a pool area where they found the alleged victim and Hegseth. They were arguing, she told police, about what she characterized as Hegseth's disrespectful treatment of the woman at the bar. The employee told police Hegseth appeared \"very intoxicated\" and that he cursed when asked to keep the noise down and said he had \"freedom of speech.\"\n\nThe alleged victim apologized to the employee and guided Hegseth away from the pool area, toward his room.\n\n'Worried about you'\n\nSometime after, she received a text message from her husband that said, \"Holy smokes lady...I don't remember the last time you were socializing at nearly 2:00 am.\"\n\nHer last message of the night was cut off: \"Hahaha I know. I gotta make sure that fo...\"\n\nHer spouse responded, \"Doing OK? My love? Worried about you.\"\n\nBuzzed or drunk?\n\nAround 4 a.m. Sunday, the alleged victim returned to her hotel room and attended activities for the Republican women's group that morning. On Monday she began to recall pieces of the incident with Hegseth, she told police.\n\nFour days after the incident, the alleged victim sought a sexual assault exam and a nurse informed police. The victim told investigators she didn't know how she wound up in Hegseth's room, but said she remembered Hegseth blocking the door as she tried to leave. She told police he took her phone away at one point.\n\nHegseth told police he was \"buzzed,\" but not drunk, during the evening, and that he didn't recall being chastised over noise at the pool or being belligerent to anyone. He recalled \"not even a thought\" of having sex with the alleged victim prior to their encounter, he told investigators, and was surprised when she joined him in his room.\n\nThe police report says Hegseth \"stated there was 'always' conversation and 'always' consensual contact between the two of them.\" He told police the alleged victim \"showed early signs of regret\" afterwards, the report says.\n\nSeven years later, with a Cabinet appointment on the line, Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, told media outlets Hegseth was “visibly intoxicated” and the woman was “the aggressor in the encounter.”\n\nA changed story\n\nAny time claims shift during a criminal investigation it raises questions, said Laurie Levenson, a criminal law expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Does it work better to say he wasn't intoxicated and bolster his position that he was a responsible person evaluating this woman's intoxication?\" Levenson said of Hegseth's reversal. \"Or is it better to say, 'Gee, I don't recall the details because I was so intoxicated?'\"\n\nLevenson said issues around intoxication and consent arise frequently in sexual assault allegations. She noted the district attorney's decision not to press charges isn't the same as clearing Hegseth of wrongdoing.\n\nHegseth addressed the allegation Thursday in a scrum of reporters on Capitol Hill who asked, \"Did you sexually assault a woman in Monterey, California?\"\n\n\"It’s very simple,\" Hegseth replied. \"The matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared. And that’s where I’m gonna leave it.\"\n\nHegseth later paid the alleged victim an undisclosed sum to settle a potential civil claim, Parlatore told media outlets. The settlement included a confidentiality clause barring her from discussing the incident. When CNN contacted her last week, she \"became visibly distraught at the mention of Hegseth’s name but declined to be interviewed,\" the outlet reported.\n\nFormer Utah sex crimes investigator Justin Boardman, now a consultant, said he was struck by the disparity between Hegseth's statement's to police in 2017 about whether we was intoxicated and his attorney's words this week.\n\n\"He described himself as sober, carefully talking through a consensual encounter every step of the way,\" Boardman said. \"He was saying everything to make himself look in the best possible light to police.\" Parlatore didn't reply to a query about Hegseth's changed story.\n\nConsent sexual assault cases difficult in court\n\nAlcohol and drug use is often a hinge point in sexual assault investigations. National standards warn nurse examiners that voluntary alcohol or drug use is often used to undermine a victim’s credibility in court, but that in some instances it might be helpful in prosecuting a case by documenting their vulnerability.\n\nThe standards also set a toxicology collection window of roughly 96 hours after an alleged assault. The woman in 2017 reported the incident after four days, or roughly right on the edge of that window.\n\nThe police report does not indicate if a toxicology screening, which can indicate the presence of alcohol and drugs, was completed.\n\nIn California, as elsewhere, people are unable to provide consent if they are too intoxicated, but a prosecutor must prove the condition “was known, or reasonably should have been known by the accused.”\n\nBoardman, the former sex assault investigator, said alcohol and drug-facilitated cases are particularly difficult to investigate and prove to a jury. They face hurdles with measuring alcohol consumption and the biases baked into juries about rape.\n\nHegseth's actions with the other woman at the bar could also be considered, Boardman said.\n\n\"He had the the chops to go after somebody else, casting at the bar,\" Boardman said. \"He was touching other women inappropriately.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trump’s transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt defended Hegseth after the police report’s release.\n\n“This report corroborates what Mr. Hegseth’s attorneys have said all along: the incident was fully investigated, and no charges were filed because police found the allegations to be false,\" Leavitt said.\n\nIn a statement to KSBW News, the Monterey County District Attorney's office said that \"no charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nNick Penzenstadler is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Goldberg discovered the chat in mid-March when Mike Waltz, Trump's top national security advisor, accidentally added him.\n\nNonetheless, Hegseth and White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt reiterated their claims Wednesday that \"war plans\" or classified information were discussed.\n\nThe White House acknowledged that Goldberg was accidentally added to the chat. In a Tuesday Fox News interview, Waltz took \"full responsibility\" for letting in Goldberg, promising to \"get to the bottom of it.\" During her briefing with reporters on Wednesday, Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Signal chat involving top national security officials and Goldberg contained no classified information.\n\nThe Trump administration's use of Signal, a messaging app publicly available on the app store, for sharing its war plans ignited mounting concerns over the national security breach.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the topic dominated a previously scheduled House Intelligence Committee hearing featuring testimony from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel. Democrats continued to call for Trump to fire Hegseth, while Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon told reporters the Trump administration is “in denial” on the issue.\n\nTrump questions whether Signal is defective\n\nTrump questioned the quality of Signal amid criticism over his national security team sharing plans for attacking Houthis with a reporter over the app.\n\n“I don’t know that Signal works,” Trump said. “It could be a defective platform and we’re going to have to find that out.”\n\nBut he said the results of the attacks on the Houthis have gone well.\n\n“The result is unbelievable,” Trump said. “The Houthis want peace because they’re getting the hell knocked out of them. It’s been very, very strong. The Houthis are dying for peace.”\n\nTrump said National Security Adviser Mike Waltz took responsibility for sharing the chat with Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\n“There was no harm done because the attack was unbelievably successful that night,” Trump said.\n\nAsked whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should resign, Trump said expressed confidence in him. House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called on Trump to fire Hegseth Tuesday.\n\n“Hegseth is going a great job,” Trump said. “He had nothing to do with it.”\n\nHegseth shared details about the aircraft and flight times of the attack in the chat.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nRubio calls allowing reporter on Signal chat ‘a big mistake’ and expects ‘reforms’\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday that the information on the Signal chat shared with a reporter about a Houthis strike was a “mistake” and that he expected the White House to make “reforms” to prevent it from happening again.\n\n“I’ve been assured by the Pentagon and everyone involved that none of the information that was on there, though not intended to be divulged, obviously, that was a mistake and shouldn’t have happened and the White House is looking at it,” said Rubio, who was in Kingston, Jamaica. \"Obviously, it was a big mistake.\"\n\n“But none of the information that was on there at any point threatened the operation or the lives of our servicemen,” Rubio added. “In fact, it was a very successful operation, and it’s an ongoing operation.”\n\nThe Pentagon said the information wasn’t classified and there was no intelligence in the messages, Rubio said.\n\n“This was sort of a description of what we could inform our counterparts around the world when the time came to do so,” Rubio said.\n\nThe White House is investigating how the journalist became a part of the group.\n\n“I think there will be reforms and changes made so this is not going to happen again,” Rubio said. “It can’t.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHegseth says 'nobody's texting war plans'\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth continued to push back against characterizations that the information he texted other Trump administration officials in a Signal chat earlier this month was classified war plans.\n\n\"Nobody's texting war plans,\" he told reporters Wednesday afternoon before boarding a plane in Hawaii. \"As a matter of fact, they even changed the title to attack plans, because they know it's not war plans,\" he said. Earlier that morning, the Atlantic published an article that included screenshots of Hegseth's messages detailing weapons that would be used to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, and what times the strikes were planned.\n\n\"There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information,\" he added.\n\nResults of Houthis operation speak for themselves: White House\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted again on Wednesday that the Signal chat involving top national security officials and a reporter contained no classified information.\n\n“There was no classified information transmitted,” Leavitt told reporters. “There were no war plans discussed.”\n\nThe information included launch times for F-18 flights and descriptions of targets. But Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that no classified information or war plans were shared, despite what the \"hoax peddlers\" at Atlantic magazine said.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe both testified under oath this week that no classified information was discussed, Leavitt said.\n\nLeavitt added that the American people should decide whether the operation was harmed by the chat after reviewing that no U.S. troops were injured while terrorists were killed and their weapons were destroyed.\n\n“I would classify this messaging thread as a policy discussion – a sensitive policy discussion, surely – amongst high-level Cabinet officials and senior staff,” Leavitt said. “The results of this operation should speak for themselves.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump remains confident in national security team: spokesperson\n\nPresident Donald Trump is still confident in this national security team and won’t be firing any of the officials involved in the Signal chat with a reporter that described attack plans against the Houthis, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.\n\n“The president’s view on all of this remains the same today as it did yesterday,” Leavitt said. “He has placed great trust in his national security team.”\n\nAs for the usage of Signal, Leavitt said it was an approved app for the Defense Department, State Department and CIA.\n\n“It is the most secure way to communicate,” Leavitt said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nNSC, Musk will investigate how reporter got on Signal chat\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that the National Security Council, the White House counsel’s office and billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s team will investigate how National Security Adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently included a reporter on a chat about the Houthis strikes.\n\n“Elon Musk has offered to put his technical experts on this, to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat, again to take responsibility and make sure that this can never happen again,” Leavitt said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nCIA director and House Democrat have testy back and forth over Hegseth’s drinking\n\nRep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., asked CIA Director John Ratcliffe whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was drinking before he “leaked classified information” about a strike on Houthis in Yemen.\n\nRatcliffe responded: “I think that’s an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no.”\n\nAs Hegseth’s nomination as Defense secretary was being considered by the U.S. Senate earlier this year, multiple people raised concerns that he had problematic drinking habits and that he drank on the job. Hegseth denied he has a drinking problem and pledged to quit drinking if he was confirmed.\n\nRatcliffe and Gomez then spoke over each other as the Democratic lawmaker sought to reclaim his time and ask a new question while Ratcliffe sought to explain further.\n\n“This was a question that was on the top of minds of every American,” Gomez argued. “Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised.”\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nSwing district Republican says White House 'in denial' over Signal chat\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents a House district that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 presidential election, told reporters Wednesday that the Trump administration is “in denial” about The Atlantic’s reporting showing top administration officials sharing sensitive information via a Signal chat that included a journalist.\n\n“The White House is in denial that this was not classified or sensitive data,” Bacon said. “They should just own up to it and preserve credibility.”\n\nThe White House and top officials in the chat have denied that classified information was shared.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nNSA Director confirms vulnerability to Signal messaging app\n\nThe senior Trump administration officials' use of Signal to discuss U.S. military attack plans in Yemen continued to come under scrutiny during Wednesday's House Intelligence Committee hearing.\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., pressed the National Security Agency's director, Timothy Haugh, on a recent cybersecurity warning to NSA employees revolving around Signal “because there’s risk to that app.”\n\n“There are,” Haugh said.\n\nThe administration’s Russia negotiator, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia while he was in the chat, and Crow asked whether he was on his personal phone. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard replied, “I don’t know.”\n\nGabbard was in the Asia-Pacific when she received the text messages through Signal, she said. But Gabbard said she didn’t remember which country she was in.\n\nCrow said effective leaders “accept responsibility when things go wrong… you set the standard from the top.”\n\n“It is completely outrageous to me that administration officials come before us today with impunity. No acceptance of responsibility. Excuse after excuse after excuse,” Crow said.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTop Democrat on Intel Committee presses Gabbard on Signal chat testimony\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee is holding a hearing on Wednesday with top U.S. intelligence officials, including National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Both were members of the Signal chat where sensitive information about a Houthi strike in Yemen was shared.\n\nRanking Member Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., noted that during a Senate hearing on Tuesday both Gabbard and Ratcliffe were asked whether the Signal chat included information on weapons, packages, targets or timing in the Yemen strike.\n\nHimes asked Gabbard whether she would like to reflect on that answer, given the messages showing those details were in a story published by The Atlantic on Wednesday morning.\n\n“My answer yesterday were based on my recollection or the lack thereof on the details that were posted there,” Gabbard said.\n\nHimes also raised the office’s guidance for classification that indicates information providing advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack “should be classified as top secret.”\n\nGabbard said “I don’t disagree with that,” but added that the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, has the authority to classify or declassify information.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nNSA director says Signal chat information 'would be classified' if intercepted\n\nNational Security Agency Director Timothy Haugh testified during Wednesday's House Intelligence Committee hearing that he'd consider the information at the center of the leaked Signal chat \"classified\" had it been intercepted from Russia or China.\n\n“It would be classified” based on our collection methods, Haugh said in response to a question from Rep. Julian Castro, D-Texas.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nGabbard calls Signal chat leak a 'mistake'\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that it was a “mistake” for a journalist to be added to the Signal chat where officials shared intelligence information about a U.S. military strike on the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nThe National Security Council is conducting “an in-depth review” of how The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to the chat, but “there were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,” she said, despite screenshots of the messages The Atlantic published Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Signal messaging app “comes pre-installed on government devices,” Gabbard added, and administration officials were encouraged to use it to communicate, though in-person conversations are ideal.\n\nGabbard said she is now “limited in (her) ability” to comment on the case because of a lawsuit that has since been filed against the administration over the mishap.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nSenate Democrat says Signal leak 'a crime in my view'\n\nThe details released by Hegseth in the Signal group texts were clearly classified and “is a crime in my view,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday in an interview.\n\n“This is information at the very top of the pyramid as to what should be kept secret and classified,” Blumenthal told USA TODAY. “He should resign. There is no question that he has betrayed his trust.”\n\nPilots who have flown missions to attack Houthi targets have described to Blumenthal “sophisticated, effective air defenses that put them in jeopardy without advanced word they are coming. The idea that he revealed times, the weapon systems and target is a crime in my view.”\n\nIt’s baffling, Blumenthal said, that Hegseth wouldn’t have used secure communications because he has an aide at his side to provide them.\n\n“To disclose this information on Signal on what we are using to strike targets and when shows incompetence,” Blumenthal said. “It’s unconscionable.”\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nJudge targeted by Trump for impeachment assigned to Signal chat lawsuit\n\nU.S. District Chief Judge James Boasberg, a D.C. federal judge whom President Donald Trump has said should be impeached, was assigned to handle a new lawsuit dealing with Trump administration officials' use of a Signal chat to discuss planned military strikes in Yemen.\n\nThe March 18 Trump post on Truth Social for Boasberg and other judges to face impeachment garnered a rare public rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who said appealing decisions rather than impeaching judges was the right way to deal with losing in court.\n\nTrump was angry because Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order to halt deportations under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a law that Trump is trying to invoke to get around the typical legal process for deportations.\n\nBoasberg is now assigned to hear a lawsuit brought by American Oversight, a nonprofit government watchdog alleging Trump officials' didn't comply with the Federal Records Act when it came to preserving records tied the Signal chat communications, which the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg saw when he was included – seemingly by mistake – in the chat.\n\nSome messages in the chat were set to disappear after one week and some after four weeks, according to Goldberg's firsthand account.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee hearing opens with warnings from top Republican and Democrat\n\nTwo of the officials that were included in the Signal chat - Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe - are testifying Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee for its annual threats hearing.\n\nCommittee Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., opened the hearing with top intelligence officials by acknowledging that the Signal messaging scandal dominated the Senate's analogous hearing on Tuesday. He said he hoped Wednesday's hearing would focus more on the national security threats facing the U.S. government.\n\n“I have deep concerns about the state of our national security,” he said.\n\nRanking Member Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the committee, slammed the Trump administration’s approach to foreign policy and national security, but made it clear that he would be asking about the Signal chat.\n\n“After these last two months, I’m worried the call might be coming from inside the house,” he said. “As far as I can tell, we’re on team Kremlin.”\n\nNow we know that people “in the most dangerous and sensitive jobs on the planet” put sensitive information into a Signal chat that could be intercepted by the Russians and the Chinese, he said.\n\n“I think it’s by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now,” Himes said.\n\n⁃ Riley Beggin\n\nAtlantic releases attack plans discussed by Trump officials in Signal chat\n\nThe Atlantic magazine on Wednesday released the full text chain from Hegseth and other top Trump officials detailing operations to carry out U.S. military airstrikes in a Signal chat group with a reporter present after the White House denied \"war plans\" had been shared.\n\nThe Atlantic's editor-in-chief revealed in a new report what Hegseth told the \"Houthi PC Small Group\" on March 15 before the U.S. conducted airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi sites and during the operation.\n\nThe report includes screen shots of the group texts, which detail drone targets, sequencing of the attacks and the type of weaponry used.\n\nGoldberg and fellow Atlantic reporter Shane Harris said The Atlantic had previously withheld publicizing Hegseth's texts out of concern for the sensitive nature of the information. Goldberg had been mistakenly invited to the chat and was observing the group's conversations, unbeknownst to the 18 Trump officials in the chat.\n\nBut after Trump officials insisted Tuesday that no classified material was shared in the chat ‒ and downplayed the gravity of the breach ‒ the magazine's journalists said they decided to disclose the messages to let people \"reach their own concussions.\"\n\nTrump's White House on Tuesday continued to dispute the initial Atlantic report about \"war plans\" being discussed in the chat, noting that The Atlantic's headline describes the information as \"attack plans,\" not war plans like Monday's initial story.\n\n\"The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT 'war plans,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.\"\n\n- Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/25/who-pete-hegseth-atlantic-war-plans-leak/82648472007/", "title": "Who is Pete Hegseth? What to know about Defense Secretary amid ...", "text": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is under fire after a magazine editor was added to a group chat where top Trump administration officials were discussing military plans.\n\nThe Atlantic's editor Jeffrey Goldberg reported Monday that he was added to a chat titled \"Houthi PC small group\" on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. Throughout that week, people with user names corresponding to top Trump officials like Vice President JD Vance, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, discussed the positives and negatives of going after Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, Goldberg wrote. He said hours before the U.S. launched a wave of strikes targeting the Houthis, Hegseth sent details about the strikes.\n\nThe White House confirmed the contents of the chat appear to be authentic.\n\nHegseth denied that he was texting about war plans, criticized Goldberg as \"deceitful,\" and declined to comment further on the leak while talking to reporters Monday in Hawaii.\n\nBut this is not the first time Hegseth has faced controversy. Here is what to know about him.\n\nPete Hegseth controversy explained: What to know amid backlash to Trump's Defense pick\n\nWho is Pete Hegseth, Secretary of Defense?\n\nPresident Donald Trump raised eyebrows when he named Hegseth, as his Defense secretary pick, as he broke the tradition of filling the position with Pentagon chiefs with long resumes in government.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense oversees the largest government agency and acts as the head military policymaker and advisor.\n\nHegseth, 44, worked with Fox News from 2014 until he left following the news of his nomination. Hegseth joined the Army ROTC in college and was deployed overseas with the Army National Guard after graduating, according to a 2022 article in Reserve + National Guard Magazine. According to his Defense bio, his deployments included Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan and he has also held staff positions in the National Guard.\n\nHe has received two Bronze Star Medals, the Joint Commendation Medal, two Army Commendation Medals, the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) and the Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB), according to his government profile.\n\nThroughout his nomination, Hegseth faced prior allegations of sexual assault, public drinking and abusive treatment towards women. Three Republicans voted against him, but he still gained enough support to be confirmed.\n\nSince taking up his position, Hegseth has followed in Trump's wake by targeting diversity, equity and inclusion in the military.\n\nWhat did Pete Hegseth text about Yemen plans?\n\nAccording to Goldberg's report, here is what Hegseth contributed to the chat:\n\nAfter an account named \"JD Vance\" raised concerns over the imminent plans in Yemen, an account labeled \"Pete Hegseth\" said:\n\n“VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”\n\nHegseth went on to say:\n\n“Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC. I welcome other thoughts.”\n\nVance replied he hated \"bailing Europe out again.\"\n\n“VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”\n\nOn the morning of the airstrikes, Goldberg said Hegseth posted an update in the chat with operational details that he refrained from quoting due to security reasons.\n\nAs incident echoes Hillary Clinton's emails, Hegseth's remarks resurface\n\nFormer Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton reacted to the leak with \"You have got to be kidding me,\" in a post on X. Her use of a private email server for business as Secretary of State became a central Republican attack point in her campaign. Trump had called for her imprisonment over it.\n\nHegseth himself joined in this line of attack, along with several other members on the leaked Signal chat, CNN reported.\n\n“People have gone to jail for 1/100th of what – even 1/1,000th of what Hillary Clinton did,\" he said in a Fox News appearance in 2016, according to the archived video.\n\nThis story was updated with new information.\n\nContributed: USA TODAY's Cybele Mayes-Osterman, Josh Meyer, Tom Vanden Brook; Reuters\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

Ron DeSantis leaving Florida to become President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of the Department of Defense would scramble the top of the Sunshine State's government at a particularly pivotal time.\n\nFlorida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez would take over as the state’s chief executive, presumably to serve the remaining two years of DeSantis’ second term. She’d become both Florida’s first woman governor and the first Cuban-American to lead a state that's home to generations of immigrants from the island nation.\n\nShe’d also have some big decisions to make. Fast.\n\nWhile Nuñez would need to choose a new lieutenant governor to fill her absent spot, in coming weeks she also would name a U.S. senator and fill the state Cabinet post of chief financial officer.\n\nThere’s also the 2025 legislative session, which begins in March.\n\nDeSantis has emerged as a possible Trump replacement for Pete Hegseth, his embattled defense secretary choice, who is under scrutiny for his treatment of women and allegations of drinking and mismanagement of funds at veterans’ charities.\n\nDeSantis exit would fuel turmoil at top\n\nA DeSantis exit would fuel the turmoil triggered when Trump last month announced his intention to nominate Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of State, leaving the Senate seat he’s held since 2010.\n\nTwo weeks later, CFO Jimmy Patronis submitted a March resignation as part of his candidacy for the Panhandle congressional seat vacated by Republican Matt Gaetz, who withdrew as Trump’s attorney general nominee amid sexual misconduct and drug allegations.\n\nDeSantis had said he planned to at least fill Rubio’s seat in January.\n\nBut that now may become one of the first major choices confronting Nuñez, 52, who served eight years in the state House representing parts of Miami before teaming up with DeSantis as his lieutenant governor pick during the 2018 governor’s race. The pair were re-elected in 2022.\n\nAuditions for '26 governor's race would begin\n\nA DeSantis departure to Washington also would likely accelerate focus on Florida’s 2026 governor’s race.\n\nNuñez would be seen as an incumbent, if she chose to run, but there are plenty of other potential contenders, including a bevy of Republicans: Florida state Attorney General Ashley Moody, Florida state Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds of Naples, and even possibly Gaetz if he sought a bounce back.\n\nDemocratic contenders may include state Senate Democratic Leader Jason Pizzo of North Miami, state e Sen. Shevrin Jones of Miami Gardens and U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Coral Springs.\n\nNuñez joined DeSantis in ballot fight... Millions in Florida taxpayer cash fuel DeSantis' ad war on pot, abortion amendments\n\nWith Trump making a crackdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign for the White House, Nuñez’s potential step up to lead the nation’s third most-populous state could draw renewed attention on her own record.\n\nNunez, whose father was a Cuban exile, sponsored state House legislation in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants living in Florida to obtain in-state tuition rates for colleges and universities.\n\nShe also fought a repeal effort in 2017 only to join with DeSantis in calling for erasing the benefit as part of a 2023 immigration package pushed by the governor.\n\nLike many Florida politicians, an evolving history on immigration\n\nThe tuition benefit, though, endures in Florida, eventually having been excluded from the new immigration law which imposed restrictions on undocumented residents and potential penalties on employers hiring them.\n\nIf the 'DeSantis to the Defense Department' story continues to play out, Nuñez would become the first Florida lieutenant governor to rise to the top job since Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy Mackay served 23 days as governor upon the death of Gov. Lawton Chiles in December 1998.\n\nBefore Mackay, Lt. Gov. Wayne Mixson was governor for three days in January 1987 when Democratic Gov. Bob Graham exited early to be sworn in as a U.S. senator.\n\nLike all Florida lieutenant governors, Nuñez has mostly played an understudy role in support of DeSantis administration policies.\n\nShe’s often featured at roundtable events. And as a Latina woman and mother of three, Nuñez may have served to publicly soften the edges of DeSantis’ opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion at universities and work, while also promoting the expansion of private school vouchers.\n\nNuñez cited her Catholic faith while joining DeSantis in campaigning against the abortion rights constitutional Amendment 4, which narrowly failed to draw the needed 60% support from Florida voters in November.\n\n“We cannot go to church and pray like Christians and turn around and vote like atheists,” Nuñez said at an October rally.\n\nJohn Kennedy is a reporter in the USA TODAY Network’s Florida Capital Bureau.

DOJ fights judge\n\nWASHINGTON – After President Donald Trump granted clemency to Oath Keepers militia founder Stewart Rhodes for his Jan. 6-related conviction, a federal judge ordered Rhodes on Friday to stay away from the U.S. Capitol now that he is out of prison.\n\nWithin hours, the Justice Department – which under the Biden administration had secured Rhodes' 2022 conviction – argued that Judge Amit Mehta didn't have the authority to issue that restriction. Trump commuted Rhodes' 18-year sentence Monday along with the sentences of 13 other defendants. He also pardoned roughly 1,500 defendants who faced Jan. 6-related charges.\n\nRhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, on Tuesday and by Wednesday, he had visited Capitol Hill. Mehta issued his brief order, which also applied to seven other defendants whose sentences were commuted Monday, following that visit.\n\nThe order states that all eight defendants need Mehta's permission to visit the Capitol in particular as well as Washington, D.C. in general.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department said in its motion that the commutation of Rhodes' sentence means he is no longer subject to the terms of probation or a supervised release from prison.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Quite a day': Devastated Pacific Palisades neighborhood abuzz ahead of Trump visit\n\nLOS ANGELES – Activity buzzed outside Fire Station No. 69 in the Pacific Palisades late Friday morning in anticipation of President Trump’s arrival to inspect the wildfire damage.\n\nThe throng gathered less than a block from burned-down neighborhoods included members of the Secret Service, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Teddy’s Tacos.\n\n“It’s quite a day,’’ said Teddy Vasquez, 39, surveying the scene near his taco truck that has been serving free food outside the firehouse since less than 72 hours after the fires broke out Jan. 7. “Firefighters left their homes to be out here. The least I could do is come out here and feed them.’’\n\nWith Trump expected to arrive by helicopter at about 2:30 p.m. local time, law enforcement walked along nearby Fiske Street, a demolished block of homes that Trump is expected to survey after an aerial tour of the ruin.\n\nAlso, banquet tables have been set up inside the fire department for an emergency briefing that will include the president. Fire captain Jeff Brown, a key participant in the activities, declined comment. But Vasquez, the taco truck owner, was happy to chat about Trump’s impending arrival as his workers began to heat flour tortillas.\n\n“Hoping President Trump likes tacos,’’ said Vasquez, who lives in Long Beach. “I think he will after he tries Teddy’s.’’\n\n– Josh Peter\n\n“I want more babies,” Vance says in his first speech as vice president\n\nVice President JD Vance on Friday told anti-abortion activists at their annual March for Life rally in Washington that the country had failed its citizens.\n\n“We failed a generation not only by permitting a culture of abortion on demand, but also by neglecting to help young parents achieve the ingredients they need to lead a happy and meaningful life,” he said.\n\nHe said a “culture of radical individualism” had led to people viewing the “responsibilities and joys” of raising a family as obstacles.\n\n“Our society has failed to recognize the obligation that one generation has to another as a core part of living in a society,” he said. “So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America.”\n\nVance, a former senator from Ohio, has advocated boosting the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $5,000 per child to help with the cost of raising children.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\n‘Houses, trailers, bodies’ float past during Asheville flood: victim\n\nThomas Bright described for President Trump his harrowing escape from a home that had been in his family for 80 years and four generations before Hurricane Helene destroyed it.\n\nBright woke up at 5 a.m. to the sound of trees falling on the house in the Azalea Road area of East Asheville. He began moving five vehicles from around the house to a road about one-third of a mile away, as the floodwaters began to rise.\n\nWhen the water was ankle-deep inside the house, he retreated to a loft. When the water reached their hips, he made a makeshift ladder to climb onto the roof.\n\nHe spent four hours on the roof writing farewell notes on his cellphone to his two children and his two grandchildren as debris from the storm floated past. His garage floated away before the water crested at about 4 feet high on the roof.\n\n“We didn’t think we were going to make it at all,” Bright said. “We were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘Horrific’: Fairview resident tells Trump of flood and bodies\n\nMona Nix-Roper, who lives in the Fairview area of North Carolina, told President Trump her home became like an island in September as floodwaters from Hurricane Helene rose around it.\n\nShe was home alone because her husband was staying with a 98-year-old neighbor to make sure she was alright. When Nix went out to check the road and bridge that provide access to her home, she found they were gone.\n\nFire Department officials urged her the next day to evacuate because of the risk of landslides. Her 21-year-old son Nathan hiked in five miles after roads became impassable to help her leave.\n\n“He said, ‘Mom, grab a bag, we’ve got to go,’” Nix said. “I said, ‘Son, there’s no way I can hike out of here.’ He said, ‘No, we’ve got to go.’”\n\nAs they walked out, they saw a neighbor’s body that had turned blue in the water.\n\n“Horrific is just all I can say,” Nix said. “There were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones. And there were dead bodies. My son’s like, ‘Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.’”\n\nNix’s home was without power for two months, so she lived in her church’s sound room. Others had lost everything, so she said she is embarrassed to ask for help.\n\n“We need help,” Nix said. “It’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nTrump appeared moved.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump thanks March for Life activists via video\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, President Trump on Friday said a “historic wrong was set right” thanks to the “tireless work and devotion across five decades” of anti-abortion rights activists as he addressed March for Life rallygoers at the National Mall.\n\n“Three years ago, I was so proud to be a participant,” he said. “Six courageous justices of the Supreme Court of the United States returned the issue to the state legislatures and to the people where it belongs.”\n\nIn his second term, Trump said he would “stand proudly for families and for life.”\n\n“Under my leadership, the reformed Department of Justice will finally investigate the radical left attacks on churches and crisis pregnancy centers, and we will bring perpetrator to justice,” he said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nPastor describes generosity of volunteers helping recovery\n\nPastor Ramona Nix told President Trump she had dedicated her Eagle Rock, North Carolina church a week before the storm arrived with Hurricane Helene in September.\n\nNix stayed in the church building for three months, sleeping on the floor for three weeks, because the community’s needs were so great. Her son ferried supplies in, Nix said.\n\n“Before the week was over, the church was so packed, we couldn’t even walk,” Nix said. “Even our sanctuary, it was up to the platform.”\n\nVolunteers arrived from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Oklahoma to help with the recovery. “They were coming in day and night,” Nix said.\n\nAt one point, Nix asked a woman who arrived if she could do anything special for her.\n\n“She said, ‘I don’t want to be selfish, but could I have a cup of coffee,’” Nix said. “I handed her that coffee and she stood there. Tears just poured. She said, ‘You don’t realize how important the little things.’ It’s not the big things in life that we have, but it’s the little things.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n‘I didn’t think I was going to make it’: NC victim to Trump\n\nKim West described her harrowing escape from her home as it flooded from Hurricane Helene in September, as President Trump visited the storm-ravaged Swannanoa, North Carolina.\n\nAs the river waters rose near their house, Kim and her husband Chris West started moving vehicles to higher ground along the road. By then, water was ankle deep inside the house. Kim West grabbed her purse and pug dog, and Chris West put dog food in a trash bag.\n\n“By the time we got into the driveway, it was already waist deep,” West said. “I didn’t think I was going to make it.”\n\nThey were stuck on local roads for hours because of flooding. The waters finally receded about midnight, after they began evacuating at 5 a.m.\n\n“We just lost everything that we had,” West said. “Didn’t even have a brush for like three days.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nThune and Johnson address March for Life rallygoers\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday addressed the annual March for Life rally at the National Mall in Washington, saying the anti-abortion rights protesters were “not alone.”\n\n“You are part of a great movement united around the truth. That every life is precious,” he said. “I stand with you in this fight and so do many of my colleagues in Congress.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., talked about being a “product of an unplanned teen pregnancy\" born in 1972, one year before abortion was legalized when Roe v. Wade became the law of the land.\n\n“I am so eternally grateful that my mom and dad ignored all the people who told them to just take care of that problem,” he said. “They chose to embrace life and to have me the first of their four children.”\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump granted pardons to 23 anti-abortion rights activists.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump suggests abolishing FEMA\n\nPresident Trump ratcheted up his criticism with the suggestion he might abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of its response in North Carolina to lingering damage from Hurricane Helene in September.\n\n“I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe even getting rid of FEMA,” Trump said after a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina. “Frankly, FEMA’s not good.”\n\nTrump accused FEMA crews of being unfamiliar with areas when responding to disasters. FEMA also imposes rules and requirements on crews that aren’t as good as what local officials provide, Trump said. The federal government should instead send funding to governors to manage their own response to disasters, he said.\n\n“FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state.”\n\nAfter speaking with flood victims in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Trump later added, “If it was up to me right now, I’d end it right now.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nPolitics shadow Trump's visit to North Carolina\n\nGlimpses of the politics behind disaster aid were visible as President Trump visited North Carolina to review damage from Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump recalled a whistleblower reported that Federal Emergency Management Agency crews refused to help people with Trump's 2024 presidential campaign signs in their yards. “That’s not good,” the president said.\n\nTrump noted that North Carolina and adjoining Tennessee each supported him in the last election – the Volunteer State slightly more.\n\nThe president also called for California to adopt voter ID, to ensure the citizenship of voters, to receive disaster aid for its wildfires around Los Angeles.\n\nThroughout his comments at a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina, Trump cited problems with former President Joe Biden’s response to the disaster that left 104 people in North Carolina dead, 73,000 homes severely damaged or destroyed and Asheville without running water for two months.\n\n“It doesn’t matter at this point: Biden did a bad job,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTennessee governor thanks Trump for helping Appalachia\n\nTennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, whose state abuts North Carolina and was also damaged by Hurricane Helene, attended President Trump’s briefing on the disaster and thanked him.\n\n“The people in this region – including Tennessee, the people of Appalachia – are grateful that you are here and that you haven’t forgotten them,” Lee said. “There are other disasters. This was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.”\n\nTrump joked about which state gave him more votes. “I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee,\" the president said.\n\nLee said one of the counties hurt in the disaster supported Trump with 88% of the vote.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says Anthony Fauci can hire his own security\n\nPresident Trump said the federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci, a former head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, had been removed Thursday because it can’t last a lifetime and he could hire his own protection.\n\nFauci led the federal health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to harsh criticism from Republicans about studies of the origin of the disease and the lockdowns to combat it during the first year.\n\n“When you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off,” Trump told reporters while visiting storm-damaged North Carolina. “You can’t have them forever.”\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also lost their security details during the first week of his administration.\n\n“They all made a lot of money, they can hire their own security, too,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nNC Reps. Edwards, Foxx and Moore to help lead recovery\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, announced he would help guide recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene with three House Republicans from the region with the most damage.\n\nThe lawmakers are GOP Reps. Chuck Edwards, Virginia Foxx and Tim Moore.\n\nTrump announced that Whatley would lead the recovery effort with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump wants voter ID in California for disaster aid\n\nPresident Trump said on Friday he would like to see two changes in California – the adoption of voter ID and the redirection of water from the northern part of the state to the south – in exchange for disaster aid for wildfires.\n\nTrump said he wanted voter identification to ensure the citizenship of voters. He also repeated his complaint that the state should divert funding from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Los Angeles to fight fires.\n\n“I want two things,” Trump told reporters upon his arrival in Asheville, North Carolina. “After that, I will be the greatest president California has ever seen.”\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says OPEC lowering oil prices is key to stopping war in Ukraine\n\nTrump said his proposal for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce the price of oil is key to stopping the war in Ukraine.\n\n“We want to see OPEC cut the price of oil and that will automatically stop the tragedy that’s taking place in Ukraine,” Trump said in Asheville, North Carolina. “It’s a butchering tragedy, for both sides, by the way.”\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said a key to stopping the war is for OPEC to cut its prices because “if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily.”\n\n“OPEC ought to get on the ball and they ought to drop the price of oil and that war will stop right away,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump offers ‘a lot of money’ to NC, overhaul of FEMA\n\nPresident Trump told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, that the federal government would supply “a lot of the money” to repair damage from floods and landslides after Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump also proposed to overhaul the FEMA so that states respond to their own disasters rather than the federal government.\n\n“We’re going to fix it as fast as we can,” Trump said. “It’s a massive amount of damage.”\n\nTrump said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein would work on plans for demolition of damaged buildings and cleaning up debris. Trump said the federal government would probably provide 75% of the funding.\n\n“We’re going to supply the money, a lot of the money,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said he would review “the whole concept of FEMA” because states such as Florida with hurricanes and Oklahoma with tornadoes are better at responding to disasters.\n\n“I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” Trump said. “I think you’re going to find it a lot less expensive – less than half – and you’re going to get a much quicker response.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff ‘glad’ Trump will see devastation from wildfires\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, a frequent critic of President Trump, said he’s glad Trump is visiting Los Angeles to tour the wildfire damage but that he and Sen. Alex Padilla have votes scheduled and couldn’t attend.\n\n“I’m glad that he’s going to see the devastation because I think, frankly, until you see it and the scope of it – whole neighborhoods gone block after block after block – it’s hard to wrap your head around,” Schiff told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\nBut Schiff said he hoped Trump and congressional Republicans wouldn’t put conditions on funding for disaster aid.\n\n“We've never done that when it comes to our fellow citizens who are hurting,” Schiff said. “And California, frankly, has been the most generous state in terms of supporting our fellow citizens, whether they're in red states or blue when they face disaster.”\n\nSchiff said overhauling the Environmental Protection Agency and the FEMA, as Trump has suggested, are areas that could lead to bipartisan support.\n\n“All of that is ample ground to get together and make things happen,” Schiff said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he didn’t invite California Sen. Adam Schiff on trip\n\nPresident Trump said he didn’t invite Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent Democratic critic, on the trip to areas of Los Angeles damaged by wildfires.\n\n“Is he going? I don't know. I mean, I really don't know,” Trump said. “You know, if he's going to be there it would be cheaper, but I didn't invite him. Somebody did.\"\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., has asked that disaster aid for California not come with strings attached, after Republicans suggested potential restrictions on the funding. Schiff is a former member of the U.S. House who previously led the first impeachment of Trump over his dealings with Ukraine and has questioned whether his nominees to become Cabinet secretaries will act independently from him.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he will watch ‘March for Life’\n\nPresident Trump said he would be watching the “March for Life” in Washington as he traveled to North Carolina and California to visit disaster areas. He said Vice President JD Vance would represent the administration “very well.”\n\n“I’m going to be watching it,” Trump said. “He’s going to be representing us very well.”\n\nTrump also noted that he pardoned 23 people who he said were \"unjustly\" charged for protesting outside abortion clinics.\n\n“It was disgraceful what happened,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump calls DOD nominee Pete Hegseth ‘a good man’\n\nPresident Trump praised his nominee to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, as a “good man” but didn’t predict what would happen with his Senate confirmation vote scheduled for late Friday.\n\n“He’s a good man. I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Trump said. “I hope he makes it.”\n\nGOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against limiting debate on the nomination. Trump also questioned whether Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would support Hegseth because Trump and McConnell have had disputes in the past.\n\n“I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: North Carolina was ‘allowed to fester’\n\nPresident Trump told reporters on Friday morning outside the White House that he’s going to North Carolina because the state has been treated badly since Hurricane Helene and to California where he said the wildfires should have been extinguished already.\n\n“North Carolina is a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester. It should have been done months ago,” Trump said. “North Carolina has been treated very badly.”\n\nTrump will visit Los Angeles later in the day to hear about the wildfires.\n\n“We’re going to take a look at the fire if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's travel schedule ‒ minute by minute\n\nPresident Trump left the White House by helicopter at 9:16 a.m. for his tour of disaster areas in North Carolina and California on Friday. Here’s where he is going (all times Eastern Standard Time):\n\n11 a.m. in Fletcher, N.C.: Trump will receive a briefing on the recovery from Hurricane Helene, which flooded much of western North Carolina in September. Participants include a handful of lawmakers, state Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler; state House Speaker Dustin Hall; and Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan’s Purse.\n\n12:05 p.m. in Swannanoa, N.C.: Trump meets with families affected by the hurricane. Participants include Ramona Nix, pastor of Eagle Rock Church; and people who received benefits from Samaritan’s Purse: homeowners Chris and Kim West; Thomas Bright and Jackie Mitchell; and Curtis A., Amber and Curtis B. Wright.\n\n1:15 p.m. Trump leaves Asheville Regional Airport on a flight to Los Angeles.\n\n5:40 p.m. Trump arrives at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n6:25 p.m. Trump tours the Pacific Palisades Neighborhood. Participants include Fire Capt. Jeff Brown; Jason Hing, chief deputy of emergency services for the Fire Department; and homeowners Mike and Gaby Shaw.\n\n7:05 p.m. Trump receives an emergency briefing in Pacific Palisades. Other participants include Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass; Ric Grenell, presidential envoy for special missions; Randy Moore, chief of the U.S. Forest Service; Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors; and Ed Ring, director of water and policy for the California Policy Center; and a dozen House members.\n\n8:20 p.m. Trump leaves for Los Angeles airport.\n\n8:50 p.m. Trump flights to Las Vegas, where he will spend the night.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\n‘Deportation flights have begun’: White House press secretary\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Friday announced that Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants was underway.\n\n“Deportation flights have begun,” she wrote on X. “President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences.\"\n\nLeavitt also included two photos of people boarding military aircraft.\n\n‒ Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Stein to meet Trump\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is planning to meet Trump on the tarmac of Asheville Regional Airport during Trump’s visit to Western North Carolina, according to The Citizen-Times, a USA TODAY Network partner.\n\nEarlier in the week, Stein, a Democrat, said Trump’s planned visit to western North Carolina, which was ravaged by Tropical Storm Helene nearly four months ago, was “very good news” for the region’s residents. The storm killed more than 100 people across the state and caused an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to the latest estimate from the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management.\n\n‒ Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nWhat is Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump's disaster-area tour begins around 10 a.m. EST on his first trip away from Washington. First comes a late morning visit to hurricane-damaged Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nHe'll then be wheels up on Air Force One in the early afternoon, heading west to Los Angeles and Santa Monica to visit areas ravaged by multiple wildfires. Trump is expected to reach California around 6:15 p.m. EST.\n\nThe president ends his Friday with a flight to Las Vegas, where he'll spend the night before hosting a downtown rally on Saturday. Trump won Nevada in 2024 after losing it four years earlier, and he recently told reporters he wanted to “thank them for the votes.”\n\nA video message from the president will also play at the annual March for Life rally by anti-abortion advocates on Capitol Hill this morning. Vice President JD Vance will address the crowd during the rally in his first public appearance in his new role.\n\n‒ Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJudge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order, calling it 'blatantly unconstitutional'\n\nA federal judge in Seattle on Thursday blocked Trump's administration from implementing an executive order curtailing the right to automatic birthright citizenship in the United States, calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour at the urging of four Democratic-led states issued a temporary restraining order preventing the administration from enforcing the order, which the Republican president signed on Monday during his first day in office.\n\nThe order has already become the subject of five lawsuits by civil rights groups and Democratic attorneys general from 22 states, who call it a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n– Reuters\n\nTrump's CIA director confirmed\n\nThe Senate easily confirmed CIA Director John Ratcliffe with a bipartisan 74-25 vote Thursday afternoon, making him the second of Trump’s cabinet picks to clear the chamber after Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nRatcliffe previously served as the director of national intelligence during the first Trump administration.\n\n– Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/25/trump-signal-group-chat-waltz-hegseth-updates/82649700007/", "title": "Trump admin scrambles to defend group text leak as investigations ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump expressed confidence in his national security team Tuesday while top Republicans and Democrats in Congress demanded answers after an explosive report revealed top Trump administration officials discussing sensitive information about U.S. war plans in a Signal group chat with a journalist present.\n\nThe stunning security breach was revealed by the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg in a first-hand account detailing how Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, mistakenly invited him into a chat on the app Signal that included 18 administration officials including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nUnaware the reporter was in the chat, the Trump officials plotted U.S. airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi sites in Yemen that took place March 15. The conversations culminated with Hegseth, hours before the airstrikes, sharing secret plans ‒ including targets and attack sequencing ‒ in the chat.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have said the Signal leak - by federal officials using the publicly available encrypted messaging app - raises alarming questions about the potential mishandling of national security information, which federal law dictates should only be shared through the government's own approved secure platforms.\n\nThe White House's National Security Council is investigating the incident, Gabbard told senators on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also confirmed to reporters that he expected the committee that oversees the Pentagon would look into the Trump administration's use of Signal.\n\nTop House Democrat calls for Trump to fire Hegseth\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., sent a letter to President Donald Trump Tuesday urging him to “immediately” fire Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.“The so-called Secretary of Defense recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans—including the timing of a pending attack, possible strike targets and the weapons to be used—during an unclassified national security group chat that inexplicably included a reporter,” Jeffries wrote in the letter. “His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law.”- Riley Beggin\n\nJust something that can happen’: Trump downplays Signal chat fiasco\n\nTrump insisted Tuesday afternoon no classified information was shared in the Signal chat and defended his national security adviser, who mistakenly invited The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief into a chat group with top Trump officials.\n\nSpeaking to reporters from the White House' Cabinet room, Trump downplayed the gravity of the security breach during meeting with several of his ambassador picks and said Waltz has no reason to apologize.\n\n“It’s just something that can happen. You can even prepare for it, and it can happen.” Trump said. “We always want to use the best technology. This was the best technology for the moment.”\n\nTrump said the White House will consider potential changes to security practices and how officials communicate with each other including the use of Signal, which he said he will likely not be used as often.\n\n\"We'll look into it,\" Trump said. \"But everybody else seems to be using it, it seems to be the number one used device or app, whatever you want to call it.\"\n\n\"It's used by a lot of the military, and I think, successfully,” he said. “But sometimes somebody can get onto those things. That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly.\"\n\nEven though the White House has acknowledged the contents in The Atlantic’s story, Trump lashed out at the reporter, calling him a “sleazebag” who works for a “failed magazine.”\n\nWaltz says he’s investigating ‘how the heck’ reporter got into chat\n\nWaltz also lashed out on Tuesday at Goldberg, telling reporters he’s never met The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief and will investigate how he mistakenly invited him into a Signal chat group with other Trump officials.\n\nTrump asked Waltz to address reporters about the Signal chat during a meeting in the White House Cabinet Room.\n\n“Mr. President, you asked about lessons,” Waltz said. “There's a lot of journalists in this city who have made big names for themselves making up lies about this president.”\n\n“And this one in particular,” Waltz said of Goldberg, “I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we are looking into him and reviewing how the heck he got into this room.”\n\nWaltz told Trump the reporter “wants the world talk about more hoaxes and this kind of nonsense rather than the freedom that you're enabling.”\n\nTrump said the main thing is the attack on Houthi sites in Yemen was a success. “The Houthis are absolutely on the run. The worst of them have been killed,” Trump said.\n\nTrump stands by his national security adviser\n\nTrump, in a phone interview Tuesday morning with NBC News, stood by Walz in his first substantive remarks on the security breach. \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,\" the president said.\n\nTrump told NBC that Goldberg's presence in the chat had \"no impact at all\" on the military operation.\n\n“It was one of Michael’s people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there,\" Trump said when asked what he was told about how Goldberg was added to the Signal chat.\n\nTrump defended his national security team despite the details revealed in The Atlantic's story, calling the situation \"the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.\"\n\nFBI director briefed about Signal scandal\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said he was briefed about the Signal incident Monday night and again on Tuesday morning.\n\n“I don’t have an update,” Patel said in response to Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner’s question of whether the FBI had launched an investigation into the potential leak of classified information.\n\nWarner had asked Gabbard, seated to Patel’s left in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, to confirm she was one of several senior officials a part of the group chat.\n\n“I’m not going to get into the specifics,” Gabbard said repeatedly, adding, “because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.”\n\nRatcliffe, the CIA director and another reported member of the Signal chat, confirmed to Warner he was a member of the virtual group.\n\nTrump officials deny classified information was shared\n\nBoth Gabbard and Ratcliff claimed there was nothing classified or at risk of endangering national security included in the messaging thread.\n\n“I’m a little staggered that that is your view,” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said at one point to Ratcliffe.\n\nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, also pushed Gabbard on the issue, asking, “So the attack sequencing and timing and weapons and targets you don’t consider should have been classified?”\n\nGabbard deferred the question to the Department of Defense.\n\nRepublican leaders promise investigation\n\nRepublican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his panel plans to investigate the Signal group chat to \"see what the facts are.\"\n\n\"It's definitely a concern,\" Wicker, R-Miss., said in an interview with CNN. \"You can be sure the committee, House and Senate, will be looking into this. And it appears that mistakes were made. No question.\"\n\nThune, the Senate's top Republican, later told reporters in the U.S. Capitol that he expected Wicker's panel would investigate the matter.\n\nHegseth revealed details about planned airstrikes\n\nOn the morning of the Saturday attack in Yemen, Goldberg said Hegesth sent an update to the group that contained \"operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen,\", including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying and attack sequencing.\n\nGoldberg said he did not publicize the full transcript of Hegseth's message because of the sensitive nature of the attack details.\n\n\"I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts,\" Goldberg wrote in his article. \"The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility.\n\nTrump officials used emojis to celebrate military operation’s execution\n\nAs the airstrikes were carried out in Yemen, several Trump officials responded with emojis, according to The Atlantic report.\n\n“I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote in the chat, with two other users subsequently adding prayer emojis.\n\nWaltz provided an update to the group, describing the operation as an “amazing job.” He later sent the group three emojis: a fist, an American flag and fire.\n\nRubio and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles congratulated Hegseth and the United States Central Command for executing the operation. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, responded with five emojis: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep and two American flags.\n\nMembers of the chat then discussed the damage that resulted from the airstrikes as well as the likely death count, according to Goldberg.\n\nVance discussed reservations about Houthi strikes\n\nThe airstrikes came in response to more than two years of Houthi attacks on vessels in the Rea Sea that has disrupted shipping.\n\nBut ahead of the airstrikes, Vance shared concerns about carrying out plans, telling the group he worried the operation could undercut Trump's foreign policy position on matters that impact Europe more than the U.S.\n\nAt one point he said, \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.”\n\nIn another message, Vance told the group: “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nWhy was a reporter included in the chat?\n\nIt is unclear why Goldberg, a longtime Washington-based reporter and editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to the chat of Trump officials.\n\nGoldberg said he received a connection request from a Signal user with name Mike Waltz on March 13. Two days later, he was added to a chat called “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nNo one realized that Goldberg, whose username appeared as \"JG,\" had been added, Goldberg wrote.\n\nGoldberg said he was initially suspicious about the chat, wary that it could be a hoax designed to entrap a reporter and skeptical top national security officials would be using a phone app to discuss such sensitive material. He said he realized it was authentic when the Yemen airstrike plans revealed by Hegseth came to fruition.\n\n\"I didn’t think it could be real,\" The Atlantic article's headline said. \"Then the bombs started falling.\"\n\nTop Senate Intelligence Democrat blasts witnesses for Signal scandal\n\nAt Tuesday's hearing, Warner wasted no time bringing up The Atlantic’s scathing story in his opening remarks during the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing Tuesday morning on global threats to the United States.\n\nWarner, vice chairman of the committee, condemned the reported group chat of senior officials – which included Gabbard and Ratcliffe, who sat facing Warner and the committee as witnesses for the hearing.\n\n“Putting aside that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” Warner said, “it’s also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check – security hygiene 101 – who are all the names? Who are they?”\n\nThe Virginia senator called the error reckless and sloppy, and said it was emblematic of issues across the Trump administration.\n\n“If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer, and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired,” Warner said. “I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error.”\n\nTrump was charged with mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House when his first term concluded. A federal judge dismissed the indictment last summer and special counsel Jack Smith dropped his appeal to continue pursuing the federal criminal charges after Trump's presidential election victory last November.\n\nWhat is Signal?\n\nSignal, which is downloadable on Apple and other phone devices, is an open-source encrypted messaging often used by reporters who seek more privacy than traditional texting platforms.\n\nBut Signal is not approved by the government for classified communications. Its use by leading Trump national security officials leaves an opening for U.S. adversaries like China, Iran and Russia, national security experts say.\n\nSignal president calls app ‘gold standard’ in private communications\n\nMeredith Whittaker, the president of Signal, defended the app on social media as the “gold standard” in private communications even if top U.S. national security officials disclosed a pending attack on Houthis in Yemen to a journalist through an encrypted chat.\n\nWhittaker didn’t address the potential security breach of Waltz and others inviting Atlantic magazine’s editor-in-chief into a chat where the attack was discussed.\n\nBut she said Signal collects little data about its users, so there is little to see when the company receives subpoenas for information that it cannot resist.\n\n“Signal is the gold standard in private comms,” Whittaker said.\n\nWhite House acknowledges authenticity, downplays breach\n\nThe White House acknowledged the authenticity of the Signal chat but downplayed the significance of the breach, arguing the airstrike operation was executed as planned.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Goldberg of \"sensationalist spin,\" insisting that no \"war plans\" were discussed. She said no classified material was sent in the thread, adding that the White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a “number of different platforms” for Trump’s top officials to communicate.\n\nShe said the White House is “looking into” how Goldberg’s number was inadvertently added to the chat.\n\nHegseth also denied war plans were shared, telling reporters on Monday, “Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that.”\n\nJournalist says group chat had military details\n\nRatcliffe and Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that their multi-day chat two weeks ago did not discuss the kind of specific operational details that could be considered classified related to the bombing of Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nBut in a series of interviews before Tuesday's hearing, Atlantic's Goldberg said the conversations by Ratcliffe, Gabbard, Hegseth and others in the days before the March 15 U.S. airstrike did contain those kinds of details.\n\nGoldberg told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki on Monday night that he wanted to be “responsible here and not disclose the things that I read and saw.”\n\nBut the journalist added, “I will describe them to you: The specific time of a future attack. Specific targets, including human targets meant to be killed in that attack. Weapons systems.”\n\n“Even weather reports that the government is ... I don't know why Hegseth was sharing it with everybody,” Goldberg said. “I mean, the precise detail. And then a long section on sequencing. This is gonna happen, then that is gonna happen. After that happens, this happens, then that happens, and then we go and find out if it worked.”\n\n“I mean, you know, he can say that it wasn't a war plan,” Goldberg said of Hegseth. “But it was a minute-by-minute accounting of what was about to happen.”\n\nTop Democrat on Intel Committee slams officials in Signal chat\n\nWarner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters the arguments that Gabbard and Ratcliffe made before his panel Tuesday were absurd “that somehow this might be defense intelligence but it’s not actual intelligence. Having senior military officials fighting over policy before you launch a military strike by its nature is classified information.”\n\n“You know the old adage, if you’re in a hole, stop digging,” Warner said. “Well, DNI Director Gabbard and CIA Director Ratcliffe today dug that hole a lot deeper in their dodging and weaving.”\n\nHe added that encrypted text messaging platforms like Signal are not intended to be used for classified information and expressed shock that the administration hasn’t said whether they’ve collected the phones or if they were personal phones the officials used for communicating.\n\n“I think you’re going to see a continued level of incompetence that’s going to stun even Trump’s supporters,” Warner said.\n\nJosh Meyer, Riley Beggin and Bart Jansen contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/14/pete-hegseth-senate-confirmation-hearing-live-updates/77673816007/", "title": "Hegseth singed but not burned in Defense confirmation hearing ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − Pete Hegseth emerged mostly unscathed by withering questioning during his confirmation hearing at the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday as Democratic senators laid into him over comments about women in the military and raised allegations of serious impropriety.\n\nHegseth, Donald Trump's pick for Defense secretary, kicked off a marathon run of Senate confirmation hearings − the first public questioning of the president-elect's top administration choices.\n\nThe Hegseth hearing was Tuesday's main − and only − event. The former Fox and Friends co-host dodged and demurred when confronted over an 8-year-old rape complaint that resulted in no charges and allegations of mismanagement and drinking on the job and said he was the victim of a coordinated smear campaign.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Armed Services Chair, said he was “encouraged” by the hearing. “I think he helped himself immensely.”\n\nThere were no surprises. Democratic senators complained that Hegseth had not been subjected to a thorough FBI background check and that they were unable to gain access to a reportedly scathing whistleblower report from a veterans' nonprofit he had run.\n\nHegseth, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, has scant executive experience. He has described himself as a change agent who will rid the Pentagon of \"woke\" policies he says have made U.S. forces less battle-ready.\n\nTuesday's hearing was an appetizer for a smorgasbord of questions and confrontations expected Wednesday, when six different Senate committees are scheduled to hear from Trump's picks to run the Homeland Security, Justice, State and Transportation departments, as well as the CIA, and the important White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nStay with the USA TODAY Network for live updates.\n\nHegseth confirmation hearing ends with cheers\n\nAfter friendly questions from Sen.

Hegseth and his supporters are embracing and shaking hands as the senators and their staffers file out of the committee room.\n\nCheers break out as he exits.\n\nSlotkin presses on deploying the military at home\n\nSlotkin, a former intelligence officer and acting assistant defense secretary, pressed Hegseth if he would resist an order that conflicts with the Constitution.\n\nShe asked Hegseth if he had been involved in discussions about using the active-duty military within the United States, including detention camps and policing dangerous cities.\n\nHegseth acknowledged that mass deportations could take place in the new administration but declined to say if active-duty troops would take part.\n\nShe accused him of avoiding the questions, and “genuflecting” to Trump.\n\nAsked if Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joints of Staff, would be on a list of officers who could be fired if he becomes Defense secretary, Hegseth said any officer could.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nSen. Slotkin asks if Hegseth would 'push back' against an illegal order\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., asked Hegseth about orders that Trump gave his former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, to deploy the military against Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020.\n\n\"Are you saying you would stand in the breach and push back, if you were given an illegal order?\" she said.\n\nHegseth responded that he wouldn't \"get ahead\" of discussions with Trump. But he did not answer directly if he agreed with a public apology Esper made after the 2020 incident.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth brands allegations of public intoxication 'anonymous smears'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, read off several instances of Hegseth's alleged public intoxication through the years, including being drunk in public and in front of young female staffers. Hegseth branded all the allegations \"anonymous smears.\"\n\nWith Hegseth's admissions that he had issues with drinking in the past, \"it's hard to square the circle,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"It's clear to me that you're not being honest with us or the American people,\" because it would be disqualifying, he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat has Pete Hegseth said about women in the military?\n\nDemocratic senators have taken aim at Hegseth’s past comments about women serving in the military. So, what's he said?\n\n“I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,” Hegseth said on a podcast in November, five days before Trump named him the next Defense secretary. “It hasn't made us more effective, hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.\"\n\nIn his recently published book, Hegseth argues that “women cannot physically meet the same standards as men.”\n\n“Dads push us to take risks. Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially in combat units,” Hegseth wrote.\n\nHegseth appeared to backpedal under the scrutiny of the confirmation process, telling reporters in December, \"We support all women serving in our military today who do a fantastic job across the globe, in our Pentagon, and deliver critical aspects.\"\n\n\"So, I look forward to being a leader for every single member of this Pentagon, men and women.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Hegseth told the Senate Armed Services Committee he is \"incredibly grateful\" for the \"amazing contributions\" by women in the military – so long as they meet the required standards.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nRosen presses Hegseth on Ukraine\n\nSen. Jackie Rosen, D-Nev., asked Hegseth if he, and the Trump administration as a whole, would continue U.S. support Ukraine.\n\n\"Are you going to stand behind Ukraine?\" Rosen asked. \"Do you have knowledge of a plan\" Trump will use to end the war in Ukraine? she said.\n\n\"I will always give clear guidance, my best guidance...on matters like that,\" he replied.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nDuckworth reads soldiers' creed to Hegseth\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth read lines of the soldiers' creed to Hegseth: \"I will always place the mission first,\" and \"I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior tasks and drills.\"\n\nDuckworth said Hegseth was unqualified and unprepared to take on the position.\n\n\"You, sir, are a no-go at this station,\" she said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nDuckworth says Hegseth is 'unqualified' for office\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.. called Hegseth unqualified for the office, questioning his management of the veterans organizations he led and his experience in international affairs.\n\nThe country needs a Defense secretary who is ready on the day he takes office, Duckworth said.\n\n“You are not that person,” Duckworth said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWarren digs into Hegseth's women in combat comments\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren dug into Hegseth's comments on women in the military, saying \"I have serious concerns that your behavior toward women disqualifies you.\"\n\nWarren called his backtrack \"a very very big about face in a very very short amount of time.\"\n\n\"What extraordinary event\" in that period of time, she asked, \"made you change the core values you expressed?\"\n\nHegseth said \"standards had been changed\" in pursuit of quotas and percentages in the military.\n\nIf his opinions could be changed so fast, Hegseth could \"go back to the old guy who said, 'straight up, women do not belong in combat roles,'\" once in the role, Warren said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth asked if he would 'abandon' Ukraine\n\nSen. Angus King said he was concerned that Hegseth had not mentioned Ukraine or Russia in his opening statement. \"Is this code for we're going to abandon Ukraine?\" he asked\n\nHegseth said that would be up to Trump, who he said had expressed a desire to end the conflict.\n\nHegseth circumvents questions about Geneva conventions\n\nSen. Angus King, the committee's only independent, asked Hegseth about whether he was opposed to torture and past comments he made that rules of warfare held back the U.S. military.\n\n\"Are you saying that the Geneva Conventions... should not apply in the future?\" King said.\n\nHegseth said he did not condone waterboarding and torture, but he said enemies \"took advantage\" of restrictive rules of war.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nKaine presses Hegseth on disqualifying conduct\n\nUnder questioning from Kaine, Hegseth declined to say if sexual assault, domestic abuse or being drunk at work would disqualify a candidate for Defense secretary.\n\nKaine dismissed Hegseth’s claim that the allegations were from anonymous sources, noting that an email from Hegseth’s mother had been cited by the New York Times.\n\n“Don’t make this into some anonymous press thing,” Kaine said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nKaine delves into Hegseth's infidelity\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., clashed with Hegseth over the 2017 sexual assault allegation. Hegseth told police the encounter was consensual and no charges were filed.\n\nBut Kaine focused on the fact that Hegseth was married at the time of the incident, and had just fathered a child with a woman who was not his wife. \"I am shocked that you would sit here and say you're completely cleared,\" he told Hegseth.\n\n\"If it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be Secretary of Defense, wouldn't it?\" Kaine said.\n\nHegseth responded that he was falsely accused.\n\nAsked if he was physically violent towards any of his wives, Hegseth said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nSenator takes on 'woke' military\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, disparaged what he referred to as the Biden “woke” military and what he called the false narrative that the military ranks were filled with extremists.\n\nHegseth called the military one of the least racist institutions in America.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nHirono asks if Hegseth would carry out Trump military orders\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono asked Hegseth if he would comply with orders from President-elect Trump to deploy the military against protesters on U.S. soil and deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nHirono referred to the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 when, according to an account by former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Trump asked the army to shoot protesters during unrest in Washington, D.C.\n\nHegseth responded that he saw police injured by protesters, who he called destructive.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth denies sexual assault\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked Hegseth if he had sexually assaulted or harassed women.\n\n“No, senator,” Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth has made a disturbing pattern of making disparaging comments about women and minorities and walked them back, Hirono said.\n\n“You are no longer on Fox and Friends, Mr. Hegseth,\" she said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWould Hegseth carry out order to invade Greenland?\n\nHirono asked Hegseth if he would carry out an order to take over Greenland or the Panama Canal, a proposal floated by President-elect Trump with increasing conviction in recent weeks.\n\n\"Senator, I will emphasize that President Trump received 77 million votes in the election,\" Hegseth said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHirono asks if Hegseth will resign if he drinks on the job\n\nHegseth told Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, he was \"falsely accused\" when a woman reported him to police over an alleged sexual assault in 2017.\n\nHirono noted Hegseth had paid the woman a confidential settlement.\n\nThe two sparred when Hirono asked Hegseth about his alleged history of heavy drinking.\n\n\"Will you resign as Secretary of Defense if you drink on the job?\" she said.\n\nHegseth did not answer directly, saying he is committed to serve.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth says 'women will have access' to combat roles\n\nSen. Ernst said it’s “incredibly important” for men and women to be allowed to serve as long as they meet standards. “I do believe in high standards,” Ernst said.\n\n“Yes, women will have access to ground combat roles” if they meet standards, Hegseth said. Those units include infantry, artillery and armor.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nSen. Ernst, key Republican vote, has the microphone\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, an Iraq veteran and a survivor of military sexual assault, and one of three Republican senators seen as crucial to the survival of Hegseth's nomination, now has the floor. She's opened by asking about balancing the books at the Pentagon and reducing waste before moving to the question of women in the military.\n\nHegseth told Ernst he would prioritize an audit for the Pentagon, the only agency in Washington that has not passed one.\n\n\"Previous secretaries of defense, with all due respect, haven't necessarily emphasized the strategic prerogative of an audit,\" he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBlumenthal asks if Hegseth will submit to a thorough FBI check\n\nBlumenthal challenged Hegseth to submit to a thorough FBI investigation that included allegations of sexual assault and interviews with his former wives.\n\nHegseth demurred, saying he was not in charge of FBI background checks.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBlumenthal questions Hegseth's financial management\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., questioned Hegseth on financial mismanagement at the two veterans organizations he headed, Concerned Veterans for America and Veterans for Freedom, which Blumenthal called \"the only test\" of Hegseth's ability to manage the military's $850 billion budget.\n\n\"Every dollar we raised was used intentionally for the execution of our mission,\" Hegseth said.\n\nDonors had in effect ousted Hegseth from one of the organizations, Blumenthal said, for mismanagement.\n\nHegseth said he was “extremely proud” of the work that he and others had done there.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nGillibrand raps Hegseth quota claim\n\nIn the face of strident statements from Gillibrand, Hegseth maintained that infantry commanders had to meet quotas for women in their units.\n\n“That does not exist,” Gillibrand said.\n\nThere are no such quotas, a Defense official confirmed.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nSen. Gillibrand hits Hegseth's comments on women in the military\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand lambasted Hegseth for \"creating the impression\" that the military maintains quotas for women in service roles.\n\n\"I have never disparaged women serving in the military,\" Hegseth responded.\n\nBut Gillibrand chided Hegseth for his past comments, saying he had \"denigrated\" women and LGBTQ people in the military.\n\n\"You said in your statement you don't want politics. Everything you've said in these public statements is politics,\" she said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nCotton asks Hegseth if he is a 'Christian Zionist'\n\nAsked by Sen. Tom Cotton if he considered himself a \"Christian Zionist,\" as protesters in the chamber had called him, Hegseth said he was a Christian.\n\nHegseth said Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza and that he supports Israel \"destroying and killing every last member of Hamas.\"\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nShaheen presses Hegseth on women in the military\n\nSen. Jean Shaheen, D-N.H., asks Hegseth to answer for his comments on women war fighters, citing, among many statements, a chapter in his new book called “The (deadly) obsession with women warriors.”\n\nShaheen asked Hegseth if he thought the two women on the committee who served in the military, Sen. Joni Ernst and Sen. Tammy Duckworth, were \"less effective and less capable,\" using his own words against him.\n\nHegseth said he was \"incredibly grateful\" for their service, but added, \"it's about standards.\"\n\nHegseth describes \"amazing contributions\" by women in the military.\n\nI appreciate your eleventh hour conversion,\" Shaheen said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth is asked about his efforts to clear fighters convicted of war crimes\n\nReed questioned Hegseth about his advocacy for the exoneration of several servicemembers convicted of war crimes.\n\n\"How will you be able to effectively lead a military in which one of the principle elements is discipline, respect for lawful authority?\"\n\nIn his response, Hegseth called U.S. rules of engagement \"restrictive\" and said they \"made it more difficult to defeat our enemies.\"\n\nHegseth came to prominence in part due to his advocacy on behalf of troops accused of war crimes.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump pardoned Maj. Matthew Golsteyn and reversed the demotion for Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.\n\nGolsteyn, a Green Beret, was charged with executing a suspected bomb maker who had been ordered to be released after questioning in Afghanistan in 2010. Golsteyn admitted during a polygraph test, taken when he tried to join the CIA, that he had killed the man. That launched an Army investigation that culminated in the murder charge.\n\nGallagher was convicted of posing with the corpse of an ISIS fighter but acquitted of charges of murder and attempted murder.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nReed questions Hegseth on threatening emails sent to military officials\n\nHegseth said he was not aware of threatening emails Sen. Reed said were sent to military officials threatening their positions and pensions for following military policies during the Obama and Biden administrations.\n\nThe emails, Reed said, called the officials \"disloyal, corrupt, traitorous, liberal,\" and he said their language echoed some of Hegseth's own writing and statements.\n\nAsked if he supported those letters, Hegseth pivoted to what he called a lack of accountability for the disastrous 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth rails against media 'smear campaign'\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., offered Hegseth an opportunity to address allegations of sexual assault and harassment.\n\nHegseth blamed a “coordinated smear campaign in the media,” Hegseth said.\n\nIn particular, he singled out “left-wing” media for, he said, not presenting his side of the story.\n\n“All they were out to do was to destroy me,” Hegseth said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nHegseth calls himself 'a change agent'\n\nAddressing senators about to judge his qualifications to lead the Pentagon, Hegseth stressed his record in the military. \"I joined the military because I loved my country,\" he said.\n\n\"When I took off uniform, my mission never stopped.\"\n\nTo his lack of experience, Hegseth said, \"We've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly the right credentials, whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives, and where has it gotten us?\"\n\n\"It's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm,\" he said, calling himself \"a change agent.\"\n\nHegseth began his statement by thanking his wife, Jennifer, whom he said had changed his life, his parents and seven children. He also credited his faith in God.\n\nHe praised President-elect Donald Trump, who he said charged him with bringing back a “warrior culture” to the Pentagon.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook and Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nProtesters removed during Hegseth statement\n\nProtesters have interrupted Hegseth's opening statement with a series of outbursts. Chairman Wicker orders them removed.\n\n\"You are a misogynist,\" said one man, who identied himself as a Vietnam veteran and criticized Hegseth for his support for Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"Hey corrupt senators, when are you going to stop the war in Gaza?\" another woman yelled as she was pulled out of the chamber.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nGlowing introductions for Hegseth criticize Pentagon status quo\n\nNorm Coleman, a former U.S. Senator for Minnesota, introduced Hegseth as a \"son of Minnesota.\"\n\n\"He is young in the best sense of the word,\" Coleman said. \"He has struggled and overcome great personal challenges. Please don't get into the cynical notion that people can't change.\"\n\nRep. Mike Waltz, a Republican congressman and Trump's pick for National Security Advisor, called Hegseth a \"dear friend\" and said he was prepared to revamp a Pentagon that he said \"continuously failed\" at its mission.\n\n\"I have no doubt that he is going to get the Pentagon back to his primary mission - lethal readiness,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a man who can reinvigorate that warrior ethos.\"\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\n'You lack the character' to lead, Reed tells Hegseth\n\nReed criticized Hegseth for statements he’s made about diversity at the Pentagon. Hegseth has said that “Diversity is not our strength.”\n\nReed, who served in the Army in the 1970s, said the military was not stronger when women were prohibited from combat, and the Pentagon banned gay and lesbian people from serving.\n\n“Our military is more diverse than it has ever been, but more importantly, it is more lethal it has ever been,” Reed said. “This is not a coincidence. Mr. Hegseth, I hope you will explain why you believe such diversity is making the military weak, and how you propose to ‘undo’ that without undermining military leadership and harming readiness, recruitment, and retention.”\n\nReed noted that he has supported nine previous nominees for Defense secretary, but says he cannot vote in favor of Hegseth.\n\nRunning though a litany of allegations against Hegseth, including that he mismanaged two non-profit veterans' organizations, Reed winds up his statement: \"Unfortunately, you lack the character and composure to hold the position of secretary of Defense.\"\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nTop Democrat registers opposition to Pete Hegseth\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat, makes clear his opposition to Hegseth in his opening statement, before the former TV host has heard a single question.\n\nReed listed the challenges facing the Pentagon: confronting China and Russia, dealing with turmoil in the Middle East, the threat of violent extremism. The next Defense secretary will need experience, wisdom and character, Reed said.\n\n“Mr. Hegseth, I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the overwhelming demands of this job,” Reed said.\n\nReed went on to question Hegseth’s alleged incidents of sexual assault and harassment, alcohol abuse, mismanagement of the non-profit veterans’ organizations he led, criticism of women in combat and championing the causes of troops convicted of war crimes.\n\n“I have reviewed many of these allegations and find them extremely alarming,” Reed said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWicker praises Hegseth as unconventional but 'excellent' pick\n\nIn his opening statement, Sen. Roger Wicker, the Armed Services Committee's Republican chair, called Hegseth an \"excellent choice\" because of, not in spite of, his unconventional background.\n\nHe compared Hegseth's inexperience to Trump, \"that New York developer who rode down the escalator in 2015 to announce his candidacy for president.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that Mr. Hegseth, supported by a team of experienced top officials, will get the job done,\" he said.\n\nWicker described Hegseth as the right nominee to shake up a Pentagon \"no longer prepared for great power competition\" at a precarious global moment.\n\nOf Hegseth's past, Wicker said Hegseth had \"admitted to falling short, as we all do from time to time.\"\n\n\"It is noteworthy that the vast majority of the accusations leveled at Mr. Hegseth have come from anonymous sources,\" he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna provides front row support\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., took a front row seat. As a \"veteran and also a female member of Congress,\" Luna said, \"I'm here today to show support for Pete Hegseth.\"\n\n\"They said that he was an alcoholic or implied it, that he was a womanizer, all this crazy stuff, a white nationalist,\" she said. \"Clearly, I would not support any of that, and I've looked through those allegations, they are categorically false.\"\n\nAsked about Hegseth's comments on women in combat, Paulina Luna said she agreed that women should be barred from some such roles. \"If you have a mixed team, I think it could jeopardize the value of that mission,\" she said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nApplause and chants as Hegseth enters\n\nHegseth enters the hearing room with members of his family to applause and chants of \"U-S-A!\" The chants quickly subside.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chair of the Armed Services Committee, opens the hearing with a moment of silence for victims of the Southern California wildfires and a note of thanks to Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the ranking member and former chair.\n\nHe asks the audience to stay quiet and avoid disruptions.\n\nSenate prepares to question Hegseth\n\nThe brightly-lit Senate hearing room was buzzing with activity Tuesday morning as senators prepared to publicly question Hegseth.\n\nCommittee and media personnel streamed past the velvet barriers separating the audience from a semicircle of senators' desks.\n\nA line of Hegseth supporters wearing matching baseball caps and red pins reading \"Vets for Hegseth\" filled a full row.\n\nTwo protesters with antiwar group Code Pink held signs up at the front, one reading, \"No Hegseth, No Christian Jihad,\" before a guard ordered them not to hold the signs above their heads.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat questions does Pete Hegseth face?\n\nSenators on the Armed Services Committee are looking for answers from Hegseth on how he would manage the military's $850 billion budget and its 2 million servicemembers. Also on the table are how Hegseth would approach ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and increasing tension with China.\n\nHegseth, a 44-year-old former Fox News host and veteran, could face tough questions about his personal life and past, including his reported history of heavy drinking, his treatment of women and a sexual assault allegation filed against him eight years ago. Hegseth has denied abusing alcohol on the job and says a disputed 2017 sexual encounter was consensual.\n\nSenators' sights are also trained on Hegseth's past comments opposing women serving in combat roles, which he walked back in the run-up to the hearing. A cultural critic of the military, Hegseth has accused the Pentagon of relaxing its personnel and training standards and adopting so-called \"woke\" ideology.\n\nDoes Hegseth have the votes for confirmation?\n\nHegseth needs a majority – 51 votes – to be confirmed in the Senate. With Republicans in the majority, he would win confirmation if every Republican voted for him.\n\nBut the Republican majority is slight, leaving Hegseth room to lose just three Republican votes. And some Republican senators have said they need to see more before they can cast a vote for him.\n\nThey include three women senators – Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa. To Ernst, a veteran and sexual assault survivor, Hegseth's past comments and history have personal significance.\n\n2017 sexual assault allegation hangs over Hegseth hearing\n\nSince Hegseth's appointment in November, a murky sexual assault allegation filed in 2017 has dogged his attempts to win over senators.\n\nA staffer for California Federation of Republican Women filed a police report that year after she said he assaulted her at a hotel conference. No charges were filed.\n\nHegseth later paid the woman an undisclosed amount to settle a potential civil lawsuit, in a settlement that included a confidentiality clause barring her from talking about the incident, according to his attorney, Timothy Parlatore.\n\nHegseth said he was \"buzzed\" but not drunk at the time, and that the encounter was consensual. But Parlatore told news sources in the last few months that Hegseth was \"visibly intoxicated\" and the woman was \"the aggressor.\"\n\nWhat time is the Pete Hegseth hearing?\n\nHegseth's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee is set to begin on 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, January 14.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/04/23/fired-pentagon-official-with-arizona-ties-denies-leaking-sensitive-information/83216591007/", "title": "Fired Pentagon official with AZ ties denies leaking sensitive info", "text": "AI-assisted summary Former Pentagon aide Dan Caldwell denies leaking classified information in an interview with Tucker Carlson.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, under scrutiny for sharing military information, faces pressure after Caldwell and two other top aides were fired.\n\nCaldwell, who worked with Hegseth on VA reform, claims he was targeted for his foreign policy views.\n\nFired Pentagon aide Dan Caldwell denied leaking sensitive military information in a 90-minute sitdown interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire for sharing military information in a Signal group chat that included a journalist.

Trump has also discussed trying to eliminate the Department of Education.\n\nAfter a buyout offer was accepted by fewer federal employees than expected, tens of thousands of federal workers on probation have already been laid off. These probationary workers include employees in their first year or two on the job, people who have recently moved between federal agencies and people who were recently promoted.\n\nThe firings have affected all 50 states and include employees at agencies that Americans frequently interact with including the National Park Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, Internal Revenue Service, National Institutes of Health and many others. And they have continued as the weeks pass.\n\nThe White House has not responded to repeated requests from USA TODAY for a precise number of fired employees. The firings are expected to shift next month to include workers not in a probationary period.\n\nJan. 20: Trump signs executive order changing job classifications\n\nAmong his first actions as president, Trump signed an executive order that revives a policy from the final days of his first administration known as Schedule F. The directive creates a new employment classification for tens of thousands of nonpartisan career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections by reclassifying them as at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.\n\nA separate executive order froze hiring of federal civilian employees in the executive branch. It states that any federal civilian position vacant when Trump took office may not be filled, and no new position may be created with rare exceptions.\n\nJan. 28: Buyout offer made to federal employees\n\nTrump's administration offered buyouts to nearly all 2.3 million federal employees. The offer came in a surprise email that hit inboxes at 6:04 p.m. on Jan. 28 with the subject line: \"The Fork in the Road.\"\n\nIn the email the U.S. Office of Personnel Management offered all federal employees eight months of pay and benefits through September if they resigned by Feb. 6.

The American Federation of Government Employees and two other unions filed the lawsuit arguing that the administration lacks any statutory basis for the \"unprecedented offer.\"\n\nThe Trump administration’s lawyers had argued that extending the deadline on the very last day would “markedly disrupt the expectations of the federal workforce, inject tremendous uncertainty into a program that scores of federal employees have already availed themselves of, and hinder the administration’s efforts to reform the federal workforce.”\n\nAlso on Feb. 6, the administration ordered all federal department and agency heads to produce lists of their lowest-performing employees.\n\nThe order from OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell also asked departments and agencies to identify potential barriers to ensuring \"the ability to swiftly terminate poor performing employees who cannot or will not improve.\"\n\nFeb. 7: Trump fires head of the federal agency dedicated to guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions\n\nAn aide to Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of the Special Counsel, on the night of Feb. 7 in a one-sentence email. Dellinger sued, arguing that 1978 federal law creating his position states he can only be removed from his job because of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\n\nProbationary employees largely rely on the Special Counsel to back them when challenging a dismissal through the proper government channels rather than suing.\n\nFeb. 10: Trump fires leaders of two internal boards employees use to protest firings\n\nWithin a matter of minutes Trump fired the leaders of two other boards that federal workers can turn to as an avenue to contest their firing. Union challenges to the firings have been rejected because they have not first gone through these boards.\n\nTrump fired Merit Systems Protection Board chair Cathy Harris, just before 11 p.m., leaving the board with two members – Raymond Limon, a Democrat whose term expires Saturday, and Henry Kerner, a Republican. A court temporarily reinstated Harris, whose term doesn't expire until 2028, after she sued. The Merit Systems Protection Board is tasked with protecting federal workers against partisan politics and illegal employment practices. It cannot operate without a quorum.\n\nTrump also fired the Federal Labor Relations Authority board chair, Susan Grundmann, three and a half minutes before he fired Cathy Harris. The authority handles certain complaints with federal workers’ labor unions.\n\nShe’s suing to be reinstated, but for the time being, Trump named Colleen Kiko, a Republican member, as chair, presiding over only one other member, Democrat Anne Wagner.\n\nAlso on Feb. 10, a court temporarily reinstated Dellinger, who promptly asked the Merit Systems Protection Board to pause the terminations of six probationary employees at six agencies, and reinstate them while he investigated their cases. The Supreme Court has declined to take up the administration's case while Dellinger's challenge goes forward.\n\nFeb. 11: Trump signs executive order to make major cuts to federal work force\n\nTrump signed an executive order Feb. 11 that seeks to significantly reduce the size of the government by instructing heads of federal departments and agencies to undertake plans for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"\n\nA White House summary of the order said agency heads were ordered to \"coordinate and consult with DOGE to shrink the size of the federal workforce and limit hiring to essential positions.\"\n\nUnder the order, federal agencies aren't allowed to hire more than one employee for every four employees who depart. It also instructed the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to create new rules to ensure future federal hires are subject to additional conduct standards, such as U.S. citizenship and filing federal tax returns on time.\n\nFeb. 12: Judge allows buyouts to move forward\n\nO'Toole, the Boston-based federal judge, restored Trump's buyout project, deciding federal employees unions that sued to stop the program lacked standing to bring their challenge and that his court does not have jurisdiction to hear their complaint.\n\nIn total, about 75,000 federal employees accepted President Donald Trump's buyout offer. That equaled about 3.3% of the federal government's 2.3 million workers, coming in below the White House's projections that 5% to 10% of the workforce would accept. Congress has not yet approved spending for the next year or said spending for buyouts would be included.\n\nFeb. 13: Thousands of probationary employees are fired across the government\n\nThousands of recently hired federal workers received notice that they had been fired.\n\nProbationary workers are easier to fire because they lack the bargaining rights that career employees have to appeal their terminations. Firings were government-wide: from the Department of Education and Small Business Administration to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Forest Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the agency that oversees the nation's fleet of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe firings have continued in the weeks since, including more than 880 probationary employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – which forecasts the nation’s weather and protects ocean species - on Thursday.\n\nFeb. 20: Unions sue over firing probationary employees\n\nA coalition of federal employee unions sued the administration, alleging that officials misused the probationary period to eliminate staff and that the Office of Personnel Management directed federal agencies to use a standardized termination notice falsely claiming performance issues in firing tens of thousands of employees.\n\n\"OPM, the federal agency charged with implementing this nation’s employment laws, in one fell swoop has perpetrated one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country, telling tens of thousands of workers that they are being fired for performance reasons, when they most certainly were not,” the unions argued in court documents.\n\nFeb. 24: Office of Special Counsel says firing of probationary employees was illegal\n\nDellinger, who leads the Office of the Special Counsel, said firing probationary employees was illegal because it used boilerplate language blaming their performance rather than specific concerns and asked the Merit Systems Protection Board to decide whether to reinstate six employees while he investigates further.\n\nFederal law generally requires 60 days' notice for a reduction in force (what the federal government calls layoffs) and prohibits probationary employees from being fired for reasons unrelated to performance or conduct.\n\nFeb. 25: Merit Systems Protection Board reinstates some probationary employees\n\nThe Merit Systems Protection Board orders six fired federal employees to be rehired at least through April 10, while Dellinger's office investigates.\n\n\"I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the six agencies engaged in a prohibited personnel practice,\" stated the order. The Office of Special Counsel has said it is considering ways to seek relief for a broader group of federal employees similarly fired in recent weeks.\n\nFeb. 27: California judge blocks firing of probationary employees\n\nJudge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern California District temporarily blocked the Trump administration from its mass firing of probationary federal employees.\n\nAlsup said the mass firings were likely unlawful and ordered the Office of Personnel Management to halt the action, saying the agency acted out of bounds by telling other agencies – including the Education Department, the Small Business Administration and the Energy Department – to fire employees.\n\n“OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire or fire any employees, but its own,\" Alsup said. The judge did not order the rehiring of anyone who had been terminated.\n\nWhat is ahead?\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered heads of federal departments and agencies to prepare to initiate \"large-scale reductions in force\" by March 13 as Trump shifts to a more aggressive phase of cutting the federal workforce beyond recently hired or promoted employees.\n\nA memo sent by the Personnel Management and Management and Budget offices has also instructed federal departments to eliminate and consolidate duplicative positions, reduce their property footprints and produce reorganization plans for their agencies.\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Joey Garrison, Bart Jansen, Maureen Groppe, Kayla Jimenez, Erin Mansfield and Tom Vanden Brook contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/12/trump-doge-federal-layoffs-timeline/82240271007/", "title": "Mass federal layoffs two months into Trump's term: A timeline", "text": "President Donald Trump's mass firings of permanent federal employees have already begun and are expected to accelerate over the next few weeks with tens of thousands more employees terminated. But the layoffs didn't come out of nowhere.\n\nThis week, federal agencies face a deadline to provide Trump administration officials with plans for a reduction in force, a dramatic downsizing of the nation's more than 2 million federal workers that will occur over the next few months. Along with layoffs, some agencies are expected to indefinitely extend their hiring freezes, eliminate currently vacant positions and consolidate offices as ways to reduce headcount.\n\nGuided by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department Of Government Efficiency aides, Trump has spent his first eight weeks in office focused on dismantling the federal government, including shutting down and laying off the staff of the United States Agency for International Development and taking steps to do the same to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Trump has also begun dismantling the Department of Education with cuts to about half of its workforce.\n\nAfter a buyout offer was accepted by fewer federal employees than expected, tens of thousands of probationary federal workers were laid off. Probationary workers include employees in their first year or two on the job, people who have recently moved between federal agencies and people who were recently promoted.\n\nThe firings have affected all 50 states and include employees at agencies that Americans frequently interact with, including the National Park Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, Internal Revenue Service, National Institutes of Health and many others.\n\nThe White House has not responded to repeated requests from USA TODAY for a precise number of fired employees. Here's a timeline of how Trump's workforce firings have taken shape, starting with Inauguration Day.\n\nJan. 20: Trump signs executive order changing job classifications\n\nAmong his first actions as president, Trump signed an executive order that revives a policy from the final days of his first administration known as Schedule F. The directive creates a new employment classification for tens of thousands of nonpartisan career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections by reclassifying them as at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.\n\nA separate executive order froze hiring of federal civilian employees in the executive branch. It stated that any federal civilian position vacant when Trump took office may not be filled, and no new position may be created - with rare exceptions.\n\nJan. 28: Buyout offer made to federal employees\n\nTrump's administration offered buyouts to nearly all 2.3 million federal employees. The offer came in a surprise email that hit inboxes at 6:04 p.m. on Jan. 28 with the subject line: \"The Fork in the Road.\"\n\nIn the email, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management offered all federal employees eight months of pay and benefits through September if they resigned by Feb. 6. Unions warned workers considering Trump’s offer that there is no guarantee the president can or will stick to it because Congress hasn’t approved funding for federal agencies beyond March 14.\n\nJan. 29: Union sues over reclassifying federal employees\n\nUnions representing federal employees sued the Trump administration to block the schedule F executive order, alleging that it aimed to politicize the federal government by stripping federal workers of job protections.\n\nFeb. 4: USAID employees placed on administrative leave\n\nAbout 10,000 employees of the United States Agency for International Development ‒ two-thirds of whom work overseas across 60 countries ‒ were notified that they will be placed on administrative leave at the end of the week as part of Trump's move to dismantle the foreign aid agency.\n\nFeb. 5: Government warns of furloughs\n\nThe Trump administration warned federal employees that they could be furloughed if they did not accept the buyout offer, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe email warned employees that many will be stripped of civil-service protections and suggested there may be loyalty tests for those who remain.\n\nFeb. 6: Boston judge temporarily halts deadline to accept buyout offer\n\nU.S. District Judge George O’Toole issued a temporary restraining order pausing the Trump administration’s deadline to accept the buyout in order to allow time for labor unions to challenge the plan's legality.

U.S. Postal Service workers, positions deemed necessary for law enforcement, national security and border and immigration obligations, as well as military personnel in the armed forces are exempted.\n\nThe memo also instructs federal departments to submit new organizational charts by April 14 as well as any proposed relocations of agency offices or headquarters from Washington to \"less-costly parts of the country.\"\n\nFeb. 27: California judge blocks firing of probationary employees\n\nJudge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern California District temporarily blocked the Trump administration from its mass firing of probationary federal employees.\n\nAlsup said the mass firings were likely unlawful and ordered the Office of Personnel Management to halt the action, saying the agency acted out of bounds by telling other agencies – including the Education Department, the Small Business Administration and the Energy Department – to fire employees.\n\n“OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire or fire any employees, but its own,\" Alsup said. The judge did not order the rehiring of anyone who had been terminated.\n\nFeb. 28: A second five things email\n\nThe administration sent a second round of emails to federal workers instructing them to list what they've accomplished that week. The new directive came from agency leaders instead of DOGE.\n\nMarch 5: Firings are up to agencies\n\nIn response to Alsup's ruling, the Trump administration informed federal departments that any firings of their probationary workers are up to the agencies themselves.\n\nThe revised guidance from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management states that \"OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees,\" adding that \"agencies have ultimate decision making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"\n\nThat same day, the Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to reinstate a fired worker, as well as \"numerous\" other probationary employees who were fired Feb. 13 and later.\n\nThe ruling at the request of the Office of Special Counsel who argued the firings violated federal laws related to probationary employees and reductions in force because they used a form letter that the Department of Agriculture also sent to nearly 6,000 other probationary employees.\n\nMarch 6: Trump allowed to fire special counsel\n\nA federal appeals court ruled that Trump did have authority to fire Dellinger, the Office of the Special Counsel leader who said firing probationary employees was illegal because agencies used boilerplate language. Dellinger said he would not appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will replace Dellinger with Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins. His agency is laying off workers whose main avenue to contest their firing is to turn to the Office of the Special Counsel for help.\n\nMarch 12: Member back on the Federal Labor Relations Authority\n\nU.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan reversed Trump's Feb. 10 removal of Grundmann, a Democratic member from the Federal Labor Relations Authority, by issuing a permanent injunction requiring the rest of the board to treat Grundmann as if she had not been removed.\n\nThe authority hears disputes between federal agencies and their employees' union and could play a significant role in expected legal fights over the mass layoffs.\n\nWhat is ahead?\n\nHeads of federal departments and agencies have until Thursday to prepare and present plans to initiate \"large-scale reductions in force\" as Trump shifts to a more aggressive phase of cutting the federal workforce beyond recently hired or promoted employees.\n\nAmong the planned reductions, reported by USA TODAY, are terminations of 76,000 workers from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 1,300 workers from the Department of Education, and more than 1,000 workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Trump has also openly discussed cuts of 65% to the Environmental Protection Agency’s workforce.\n\nLayoffs are not immediate. Agencies must give employees 30 or 60 days notice.\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Joey Garrison, Bart Jansen, Maureen Groppe, Kayla Jimenez, Erin Mansfield and Tom Vanden Brook contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/11/trump-federal-agencies-layoff-plans-march-13/82235201007/", "title": "Next wave of federal layoffs is here. What to expect from Trump's plan", "text": "Just a month after President Donald Trump's administration fired over 100,000 early-tenure federal government employees, his administration is undergoing a larger slashing of the workforce across the country, the details of which are becoming clearer by the hour.\n\nThe job cuts to the U.S. government - one of the largest employers in the world - come as economists are increasingly worried about the risk of a recession due to Trump's trade war with Canada and Mexico. The war has battered stock prices and left Americans worried about their retirement savings.\n\nThe Department of Education is laying off one-half of its staff. The nation's leading weather forecasting agency is laying off 20% of its workforce. NASA is shuttering three key offices, and plans have leaked for laying off 76,000 employees in the Department of Veterans Affairs. Trump has floated the idea of cutting more than half of the staff at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nOn paper, the big deadline is Thursday for agencies to submit plans for large-scale layoffs, called a reduction in force. But agencies have been getting those plans in early, and telling employees ahead of that deadline that their jobs are about to expire.\n\nTrump called for a layoff plan on Feb. 11\n\nWith his cutter-in-chief Elon Musk by his side, Trump signed an executive order Feb. 11 calling for federal agencies to “promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force,” referencing the legal term for a mass layoff, and called for the separation of temporary employees who would likely be subject to the layoffs.\n\nThe offices' priorities for layoffs were anything the Trump administration suspends or closes, functions that are considered nonessential during government shutdowns, and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The language specifically exempted public safety, immigration enforcement and law enforcement.\n\nAdditionally, the order gives agency heads 30 days to submit reports to the budget office that “discuss whether the agency or any of its subcomponents should be eliminated or consolidated,\" and tells agencies they can hire only one new worker for every four who leave.\n\nA broader exception in the order exempts military personnel and allowed agency heads to exempt “any position they deem necessary to meet national security, homeland security, or public safety responsibilities.”\n\nHuman resources asked for plans by March 13\n\nAbout two weeks later, the government’s human resources arm, called the Office of Personnel Management, issued formal guidance for what it called “Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans,” and reiterated that they would be due March 13, which is 30 days after Trump’s executive order.\n\nThe memo says plans should include “a significant reduction” in full-time positions, less use of real estate, and a smaller budget. It calls for eliminations of functions the law doesn't require and efficient delivery of the ones that are.\n\nThe memo said the layoffs may be effective before the plans is actually due, signaling that layoff notices could be coming anytime. Agencies can use layoffs, attrition, removal of underperforming employees, and renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements, among other things.\n\nWill Social Security or Medicare be affected by layoffs?\n\nThe human resources memo tells agencies that provide direct services — including Social Security, Medicare, and veterans’ health care — not to implement their reductions in force until the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management can review the plans to “certify that the plans will have a positive effect on the delivery of such services.”\n\nPost Office employees, who are independent from the executive branch, are exempt. So are employees in the Executive Office of the President. This is in addition to the broader exemption of military, border security, national security, immigration enforcement, and public safety.\n\nLayoffs will require 30 to 60 days’ notice\n\nFederal law generally requires agencies to give employees 60 days’ notice before they are laid off, but the law also allows the Office of Personnel Management to shrink this notice period to 30 days. In its memo to agencies, the office outlines a timeline that includes this 60-day notice period that can be shortened to 30 days if the office gives a waiver.\n\nLayoff procedures already underway\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs was one of the first to create its layoff plan. A March 4 memo obtained by USA TODAY outlined a plan to cut 76,000 workers. That amounts to about 16% of the 483,000 workers government data shows the department had in September.\n\nThe memo said the Department of Veterans Affairs would publish a reorganization plan in June 2025 and have a department-wide reduction in force by the end of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The memo calls for the department to \"coordinate actions with\" Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe Department of Education, which Trump has promised to shutter altogether, offered buyouts to people who accepted by March 3, ahead of \"very significant\" workforce reductions. On Tuesday night, the department announced it would slash its workforce in half, laying off or accepting resignations of about 2,100 of its 4,200 employees.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is laying off more than 1,000 people, or about 20% of its staff. Likewise, NASA told employees Monday it would shutter three offices, including the office of the chief scientist. Cheryl Warner, a spokesperson for NASA, said the agency is giving workers 30 days’ notice.\n\n“This accelerated timeframe allows the agency to address these necessary adjustments quickly, in line with the government's larger efficiency goals,” Warner said in an email. “This decision supports NASA's ability to continue meeting its mission needs while adhering to the mandated restructuring process.”\n\nContributing: Sarah D.

He’s on a mission to re-engineer the agency’s culture by returning power to states and away from the Washington bureaucrats and coastal elites he said have led it astray.\n\nThe EPA, for example, is doing away with the “sue-and-settle” approach that Pruitt said improperly allowed the Obama administration to circumvent laws by rewriting regulations behind closed doors with friendly environmental groups who filed lawsuits.\n\nThe agency also has rewritten membership rules for the agency’s advisory boards, so that both industry advocates and academics from Midwestern and Mountain states — which Pruitt said were under-represented — have greater influence when counseling agency leaders on new rules.\n\nAnd he’s adopted a “red team/blue team” model designed to challenge climate change assumptions that global warming is occurring and humans are the primary cause — a view endorsed both by the vast majority of scientists and by a massive federal report the White House issued earlier this month.\n\nPruitt, who challenged the Clean Power Plan as Oklahoma attorney general, said he’s plowing ahead with the rollback of the rule designed to curb carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants despite the report’s conclusions.\n\nAnd he said the red team/blue team approach that promotes “curious inquiry and continued analysis” is integral to the rigorous self-analysis he believes the EPA has been lacking in recent years.\n\n“I’m an attorney. I believe in bringing people together in an open process to encourage peer review, that’s what science is,” Pruitt said during a recent interview in his office. “We shouldn’t run from that ... That’s something we ought to embrace as a culture and I think as an agency.”\n\nRed Team/Blue Team\n\nOf all Pruitt’s moves to reshape an agency whose authority he frequently challenged in court, the red team/blue team strategy has raised some of the loudest alarm bells among his many critics who consider it an attack on settled science.\n\nThe exercise was designed at the height of the Cold War to assess Soviet reactions to various scenarios. And that’s where it belongs — not to relitigate the proven facts of climate science, said former New Jersey GOP Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who served as EPA administrator under George W. Bush.\n\n“That Mr. Pruitt seeks to use the power of the EPA to elevate those who have already lost the argument is shameful, and the only outcome will be that the public will know less about the science of climate change than before,” she wrote in a opinion column for The New York Times entitled \"How not to run the EPA\"\n\nKen Cuccinelli, a Pruitt ally and former Republican attorney general from Virginia, said the EPA administrator rightly believes the agency needs to return to its roots and abandon quixotic pursuits Obama conducted on global warming embodied by the Clean Power Plan and the decision to sign on to the international treaty known as the Paris Accord.\n\n“The previous administration weaponized this agency,” Cuccinelli said. “They were assaulting America through the EPA. Scott believes in clean water and clean air. There’s never been any doubt about that. But all of the other creative stuff is the kind of stuff that political elites want to spend their time on and if it affects Americans all it does is reduce their opportunities.”\n\nChanging a culture\n\nPruitt arrived at EPA under a mutual cloud of hostility.\n\nHe had sued the agency 14 times on behalf of Oklahoma challenging a variety of regulations and billing himself as “a leading activist against EPA’s activist agenda.” A month after he took the helm in February, the budget released by President Trump, an ardent EPA critic, proposed gutting the $8.2 billion agency by nearly a third.\n\nIn turn, Pruitt was opposed loudly by hundreds of former EPA employees, and more quietly by some current ones. They feared he would assist the petrochemical industry he grew close to in Oklahoma while ignoring the carefully constructed science that served as the foundation of many public health protections.\n\nSubsequent cuts in pollution enforcement and the departure of hundreds of veteran EPA staffers through a buyout program have given environmental groups more reason to worry.\n\nNearly a year into his tenure, Pruitt still feels the resistance from employees who have yet to buy into his message that the EPA ought to work more with business to find mutually acceptable solutions when it comes to public health.\n\n“The most challenging thing that we encounter (at EPA) is this thinking, this attitude that we as a country have to choose between growth and jobs and being good stewards of our environment,” he recently told an audience at the conservative Federalist Society National Lawyers Convention. “We can do both. But the past few years, we’ve been told it’s prohibition, it’s put up a fence, it's do not touch. And frankly I don’t think that’s consistent with the law. I don’t think that’s consistent with how we’ve done business as a country.”\n\nHis many critics say that’s code for giving the energy industry and other polluters carte blanche to maximize profit with little regard for environmental damage.\n\nNormally soft-spoken Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, described Pruitt during his confirmation process earlier this year as “hostile to the basic protections to keep Americans and our environment safe.”\n\nBack to basics\n\nAs part of his effort to change the culture at EPA, Pruitt is touting a “back-to-basics “ agenda that emphasizes partnerships with states and issues he calls central to the agency’s mission when Congress created it in 1970.\n\nHe’s prioritizing cleanup of toxic Superfund sites, lead-tainted drinking water systems, and abandoned mines.\n\nThose issues, he said, took a back seat the previous eight years as the Obama administration engaged in regulatory over-reach on climate change and the “Waters of the U.S.” rule that spelled out that streams, rivers and other bodies can be regulated by the federal government.\n\n“Our job is to administer statutes,” he said in the interview. “We have to act based on the authority given to us by Congress. When this agency and other agencies in the past have gone askew is when they’ve created and filled in the vacuum. That’s what they did with the Clean Power Plan ... We’re correcting that.”\n\nPruitt points to Superfund as an area that previous administrators should have taken more time to address. He’s visited a lead-contaminated site in East Chicago, Ind., and the Gold King mine in Colorado (where a mistake by an EPA contractor in 2015 led to a major spill) to emphasize the program’s importance.\n\nHe often talks about the problems at the West Lake Landfill near St. Louis and how the EPA still hasn’t decided how to proceed 27 years after it was tagged as a Superfund site.\n\n“Not clean it up. Not fix the problem. But just simply decide,” he told the Federalist Society.\n\nMore than half of the original 406 sites from 1983 remain on the list. On average, it takes about 19 years for a site to be removed from the list, according to to the Government Accountability Office.\n\nGina McCarthy, who served as EPA administrator during Obama’s second term, brushed aside the notion that Superfund was not a priority under her watch. And she said Pruitt’s view of his agency’s role is so narrow it’s imperiling public health.\n\n“It is just ridiculous to think that you can ignore the most significant threats to public health today while chasing Superfund sites that have been around for 20 years,” she said. “You don’t make those choices. You do both.”\n\nShe said Pruitt’s plan to address the nation’s most toxic sites will be much tougher if Congress goes along with Trump’s 2018 budget proposal to slash by $330 million the nearly $1.1 billion Superfund received this year.\n\n“The challenge has been resources constraints,” she said. “So for an administrator to say he’s going back to basics and even caring about doing a better job with Superfund while he’s defending a budget that would dismantle the agency and reduce Superfund, it doesn’t seem like a very consistent message to me.”\n\nFederalism\n\nCuccinelli acknowledges that it is an odd pairing to have Pruitt, someone from “fly-over country,” heading an agency “favored by the cocktail party set.”\n\nBut he thinks it will take someone like the Kentucky-born, former Cincinnati Reds baseball prospect to shake up an agency in need of cultural re-orientation.\n\n\"God forbid we have an administrator of the EPA who thinks it’s important to obey the law and Scott does.\" he said.\n\nPruitt doesn't use the term political elites when he describes his predecessors at the EPA but it's clear he considers himself someone attuned to the needs of states, especially the red ones that resented much of the Obama environmental agenda.\n\nIt's one reason he took the unprecedented step last month of barring scientists who receive EPA grants from serving on any of the agency's nearly two dozen advisory boards. The move to eliminate what Pruitt described as \"political science\" opened up seats for researchers representing industries and institutions based in the middle of the country whose input he said hasn't always been valued.\n\nRobert Johnson, an economics professor at Clark University in Massachusetts and a past member of the EPA Science Advisory Board, criticized Pruitt's decision.\n\nThe advisory board \"has always been bastion of truth and independent scientific advice that withstood changes in political administrations and differences of political opinion,\" Johnson. \"That changed (with Pruitt's act).\"\n\nPruitt also speaks of the importance of restoring \"federalism\" where states have an equal seat at the table when it comes to implementing clean air and water programs.\n\nMcCarthy pushed back on his interpretation.\n\n\"Federalism does not mean that the agency doesn't do its work in accordance with Congress. And Congress, on issues like the Clean Air Act, did not give states the role of primacy,\" she said.\n\nNonetheless, members of Congress who clashed with Obama are clearly delighted that Pruitt is driving an agenda that many of their constituents back home like.\n\nWhen Pruitt last month told an audience of coal miners in Hazard, Ky., that \"the war on coal is over\" as he announced the administration's plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., seemed clearly tickled.\n\n\"It's great to have an administrator of the EPA,\" McConnell said as he introduced Pruitt, \"who's not afraid to come to Kentucky.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/25/white-house-epa-power-plant-rules-address-climate-change/73441669007/", "title": "New EPA rules are a coal power plant pollution crackdown", "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency released long-awaited updated power plant standards Thursday, aiming to further reduce air pollution that makes people sick and the greenhouse gases emissions warming the planet.\n\nFederal officials said Wednesday that the rules would deliver on the Biden administration's commitment to provide health protections for communities, including those confronted with decades of environmental injustices.\n\n\"Since the start of this administration President Biden has made it clear that we are committed to the integrated priorities of ensuring U.S. energy security, protecting people from pollution and fighting the climate crisis,\" said EPA Administrator Michael Regan.\n\nThe four new rules will do that by reducing pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants, protecting communities from pollution and improving public health, Regan said, all while \"supporting the long-term reliable supply of the electricity needed to power America forward.\"\n\nThe Department of Energy also announced a new rule designed to make the permitting process for building energy transmission infrastructure \"more efficient and effective,\" said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.\n\nTogether, the rules are expected to provide up to $370 billion in climate and public health net benefits over the next two decades while providing a more predictable regulatory outlook for power companies, the officials said. The EPA said it doesn't expect any erosion of electricity generation or grid reliability.\n\nSeveral trade groups, however, defended the electrical industry and expressed concern about some aspects of the new rules.\n\nWhat are the new power plant rules?\n\nThe EPA said the four new rules:\n\nRequire all coal-fired power plants that plan to run in the long term, and all new natural-gas-fired plants, to control 90% of their carbon pollution.\n\nStrengthen and update mercury and toxic air standards for coal-fired power plants, tighten the emissions standard for toxic metals by 67%, and reduce emissions of mercury and other contaminants that are important for children and others who regularly consume fish with high levels of pollutants from power plants.\n\nReduce pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired power plants by more than 660 million pounds a year by setting wastewater discharge standards.\n\nRequire the safe management of coal ash placed in areas previously unregulated at the federal level, including at previously used disposal sites.\n\nWhat's the impact of the new rules?\n\nThey are \"a big deal,\" Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, told USA TODAY on Wednesday. \"They're saying power companies are going to have to do a much better job of being a better neighbor.\"\n\nThe nation has made major improvements at improving air quality and reducing emissions in recent decades by shutting down 382 coal-fired power plants, Jealous said. The newer standards are expected to advance those efforts even further.\n\n\"Bad-actor power plant operators will now have to think twice about continuing to operate their dirty polluting power plants,\" Jealous said. He added the rules also \"will accelerate our movement to transition the country towards renewables.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is this will add up to fewer kids having asthma attacks and fewer adults having heart attacks,\" he said. \"Millions of people will have cleaner air and cleaner water.\"\n\nDespite the gains, the \"State of the Air\" report released by the American Lung Association this week said 131.2 million people across the nation still live in places with \"failing grades\" for ozone levels and particle pollution.\n\nWhat are the health benefits of the rules?\n\nThe administration projects the following outcomes by 2035:\n\nUp to 1,200 people avoided premature deaths.\n\n870 avoided hospital and emergency room visits.\n\n1,900 avoided cases of asthma onset.\n\n360,000 avoided cases of asthma symptoms.\n\n48,000 avoided school absence days.\n\n57,000 avoided lost workdays.\n\nQuestions raised about the rule\n\nIn a statement, Dan Brouillette, chief executive officer for the Edison Electric Institute, said its member companies are proud that carbon emissions from the nation's power sector are \"as low as they were nearly 50 years ago, while electricity use has more than doubled.\"\n\n“EPA’s suite of new regulations will affect the generation sources that will be used to reliably power America’s increasingly electricity-dependent economy, and we appreciate the agency’s efforts to align compliance deadlines to help companies make informed resource planning decisions that minimize customer costs,\" Brouillette said. \"Affordable, reliable, and resilient clean energy is essential for America’s economic security, and we appreciate EPA’s efforts to include additional compliance flexibilities that will help EEI’s members address reliability concerns in the years ahead.\"\n\nAmerica's Power, a partnership of coal power-related industries, slammed the rule dubbed the Clean Power Plan, which sets emissions limits. Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO, said it's an \"extreme and unlawful overreach that endangers America's supply of dependable and affordable electricity.\"\n\nRep Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., sent a letter to Regan this week questioning the EPA's authority to regulate power plant emissions.\n\nHe cited a 2022 decision by the Supreme Court, which ruled against the agency in a case about its efforts to do so. That decision is \"a red light flashing at EPA,\" Garbarino wrote, because it said new standards should be determined by legislation rather than agency rule. His letter also chided the agency for relying on \"antiquated, inefficient command-and-control regulatory mechanisms.\"\n\nBloodworth said the EPA's Clean Power Plan is the \"same kind of overreach\" that led to the court's 2022 decision.\n\n\"Already, utilities have announced plans to shut down more than 60,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation over the next five years,\" she said. The new rule will accelerate those retirements, and Bloodworth said it represents a \"clear and present danger to our electricity supply and our economy.\"\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters, however, said that the EPA is following the guidelines established by the court's decision and that Congress has reinforced its intent for the EPA to regulate power plants by amending the Clean Air Act through the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nWhat's the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.?\n\nAbout 30% of carbon dioxide emissions comes from the electricity sector, according to the EPA's website. The largest share – 35% – comes from the transportation sector, which generates about 24% of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA reports that burning coal produces more carbon dioxide than natural gas or oil.\n\nMoving along efforts for energy transmission and 'clean' vehicles\n\nThe new electrical transmission line rule sets a binding two-year timeline for federal agencies to issue authorizations and permits, cutting in half the average time a developer spends to acquire permits, Granholm said. The rule also requires developers of transmission lines to develop public participation plans when they apply for permits, she said.\n\nThe EPA announced the launch of a nearly $1 billion grant program, funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, to replace heavy-duty vehicles with zero-emission vehicles. The program will support projects bringing electric school buses, garbage trucks and delivery vans to neighborhoods across America, said John Podesta, a senior adviser to Biden on international climate policy.\n\n“These announcements are a huge step toward electrifying trucks and buses across the country, especially in communities disproportionately impacted by toxic tailpipe pollution, said Darien Davis, the government affairs advocate for climate and clean energy for the League of Conservation Voters.\n\nEstefany Carrasco-González, senior director of the Chispa League of Conservation, said the funding and tax credits for clean vehicles mean \" there’s never been a better time to replace aging diesel buses with a clean ride for kids.\"\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and the environment for USA TODAY.

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/10/16/supreme-court-biden-power-plant-emissions-climate-change/74863987007/", "title": "Supreme Court rejects Republican state AGs bid to stay Biden's ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined for now to halt the Biden administration’s plan to reduce climate-changing emissions from coal-fired power plants, despite having blocked a previous plan from the Obama administration.\n\nThe court rejected an emergency request from Republican states and energy industry groups to keep the deep reduction requirements on hold while they’re being litigated.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas said he would have granted the request.\n\nJustices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch said the states and industry groups are likely to eventually win some of their arguments. But there's no urgency for the Supreme Court to step in before the appeals court issues its opinion, they said, because compliance efforts don’t need to start until next year.\n\n\"So this Court understandably denies the stay applications for now,\" Kavanaugh wrote in a brief statement. \"Given that the D.

Circuit Court of Appeals in July declined to pause the rules.\n\nThe appeals court said a pause wasn’t needed because power plants won’t have to comply until years after the challenge has been resolved.\n\nThe court also said that, unlike the EPA’s previous plan struck down by the Supreme Court, the current version “falls well within EPA’s bailiwick.”\n\nAfter the Obama administration’s rules were blocked by the Supreme Court in 2016, the Trump administration repealed them the next year. But Democratic states challenged the repeal, leading to the high court’s 2022 decision that the EPA had overreached.\n\nPower plants account for nearly a quarter of the nation’s greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nCut or capture 90%\n\nUnder the rules, existing coal and new natural gas power plants would have to either cut or capture 90% of their greenhouse gas pollution by 2032.\n\nThe EPA said the Supreme Court should not second-guess its technical and scientific analysis that it’s possible to achieve that reduction level by capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing them underground. But opponents say the technology is still developing and hasn’t yet shown it can be deployed as quickly or as extensively as the administration suggests.\n\nAnd the EPA has projected that most coal power plants will likely close by 2045.\n\nOf about 220 operational coal plants remaining today, dozens have already announced plans to retire in the next decade.\n\nWhile some power companies challenged the EPA – including the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned utilities – some sided with the agency.

It rescinds or triggers a review of more than a half-dozen measures in an effort by Trump to boost domestic energy production through fossil fuels, especially coal.\n\n\"That is what this is all about: bringing back our jobs, bringing back our dreams and making America wealthy again,\" Trump said, during a ceremony at the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency, attended by a number of coal miners.\n\nEmissions from out-of-state coal-fired power plants have long had a significant impact on New Jersey, contributing to both the region’s poor air quality and a sea level rise in a state that has 127 miles of coastline. The overwhelming majority of peer-reviewed studies and climate scientists agree the planet is warming, mostly due to man-made sources, including carbon dioxide.\n\n“It’s sending the message that we can go back to coal,” said Monica Mazurek, a Rutgers professor who specializes in air quality. “We no longer have to look at efficiencies at our power plants. So it’s a very regressive action based on politics and the economic interests of a few, rather than reality.”\n\nTrump’s order initiates a review of the 2015 Clean Power Plan, which put restrictions on emissions at coal-fired power plants. Those plants generate significant amount of carbon dioxide — a leading contributor to global warming — along with soot and the chemicals that cause smog.\n\nThe American Lung Association, which consistently gives New Jersey failing grades for air quality, said the Clean Power Plan would have prevented 90,000 asthma attacks and 3,600 premature deaths every year nationwide if fully implemented.\n\nSens. Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, both Democrats, said the order could do serious damage to New Jersey, which as a coastal state is threatened by beach erosion, destruction of waterfront property and other effects of a rising sea. Since the devastation from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the state has tried to protect its developed coastline with continuing massive beach and dune replenishment projects.\n\nBen Horton, a Rutgers professor who specializes in calculating sea level rise, said the order could have a direct impact on New Jersey’s coastal communities. “It’s important to make the right decisions now, and this is not one of them,” he said of Trump’s order. “You’re looking at a rise in excess of 3 to 4 feet by 2100. You have a hope that the New Jersey Shore will remain a place to live, work and play on. We only have one.”\n\nTrump’s order drew praise from business groups and condemnation from environmental groups. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue applauded the president for taking \"bold steps to make regulatory relief and energy security a top priority.”\n\nPressure building in debate over releasing balloons\n\nTrump targets rules early with executive order\n\nBut federal data show that U.S. mines have been shedding jobs for decades under presidents from both parties as a result of increasing automation and competition from natural gas, which has become more abundant through hydraulic fracturing in places like Pennsylvania. Coal mining accounts for fewer than 75,000 U.S. jobs, according to an Energy Department analysis released in January.\n\nMany coal plants have converted to cleaner-burning natural gas because prices have decreased in recent years with a rise in domestic production. More than 200 aging plants have closed because of costly upgrades required through the Clean Power Plan. In New Jersey, PSEG Power will close its two remaining coal-burning power plants by June, saying cheap natural gas doesn’t justify keeping them around.\n\nTim Dillingham, executive director of the American Littoral Society, a coastal advocacy group based in New Jersey, said it would be all but impossible for plants that have invested tens of millions in converting to natural gas to go back to coal. “But this order may rescue these old, creaky, out-of-date coal plants that are barely hanging on,” he said. “It’ll give them a few more years of polluting life before the economy catches up with them.”\n\nZach Lees, a policy attorney for Clean Ocean Action of Sandy Hook, said there is a chance to stall the changes from the executive order while the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency attempts to rewrite its climate rules.\n\n“That’s something that will take years and be subject to legal challenges,” he said. “There’s a whole lot of process that needs to take place to implement what Trump wants.”\n\nThis story contains material from The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/26/donald-trump-epa-doge-lee-zeldin-job-cuts/80524919007/", "title": "Donald Trump says EPA planning job cuts; DOGE eyes reductions", "text": "This story has been updated to add new information.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signaled Wednesday that big cuts are coming at the Environmental Protection Agency, saying EPA administrator Lee Zeldin is contemplating a significant workforce reduction.\n\n\"I spoke with Lee Zeldin, and he thinks he's going to be cutting 65 – or so – percent of the people from environmental, and we're going to speed up the process too at the same time,\" Trump said during his first Cabinet meeting.\n\nA White House official said Trump was referring to overall spending cuts at the EPA with the 65% number, and that will include staff cuts.\n\n\"Administrator Zeldin is committed to eliminating 65% of the EPA’s wasteful spending,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nThe agency is tasked with safeguarding the environment and human health by enforcing federal clean air, water and land regulations, along with other environmental rules.\n\nThe EPA had 15,130 employees in the 2024 fiscal year and submitted a budget in October to increase the workforce by 2,023 employees \"to continue rebuilding the Agency’s core capacity to carry out its vital mission.\"\n\nA major reduction of the EPA workforce could impact the agency's core functions.

Zegler also angered some Disney fans by describing the love story in the original \"Snow White\" as \"weird,\" and she made headlines with her outspoken views on the Israel-Hamas war and the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAfter thanking fans for watching the \"Snow White\" trailer last year, the \"West Side Story' star wrote on X, \"And always remember, free palestine.\" Zegler later posted on Instagram in November that she hoped President Donald Trump and his supporters \"never know peace.\" She apologized for the latter remarks.\n\n'Snow White' in 2025: The major differences from the animated movie\n\nIn a since-deleted Instagram comment last week, Jonah Platt, son of \"Snow White\" producer Marc Platt, blamed Zegler's political statements for the film's box office disappointment. He slammed the actress for \"dragging her personal politics into the middle of promoting the movie\" and said this \"clearly hurt the film's box office.\"\n\n\"Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation for her own immature desires at the risk of all the colleagues and crew and blue collar workers who depend on that movie to be successful,\" Platt added.\n\nIt's unclear if the \"Snow White\" performance could also suggest audiences are starting to lose some interest in Disney live-action remakes.

The Paramount Pictures film is the sequel to a movie that won the best picture Oscar two decades ago.

(This time last year, \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" was inundating theaters.) Instead, a wide array of films – among them \"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,\" \"The Boys in the Boat,\" \"Migration,\" \"Ferrari,\" \"The Iron Claw\" and \"Anyone But You\" – sought to break out over the year's most lucrative box-office corridor.\n\nThe top choice, though, remained \"Wonka,\" the musical starring Timothée Chalamet as a young Willy Wonka. In its third weekend, the film collected an estimated $24 million Friday through Sunday and $31.8 million factoring in the Monday holiday, for a domestic total of $142.5 million.\n\nThat bested \"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,\" which, like previous DC superhero films, is struggling. James Wan's \"Aquaman\" sequel starring Jason Momoa took in $19.5 million in its second weekend to bring its two-week haul to a modest $84.7 million including New Year's Day estimates.\n\nNeed a break?

Internationally, \"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\" added $50.5 million.\n\n\"The Color Purple,\" Blitz Bazawule's adaptation of the 2005 stage musical from Alice Walker's novel, debuted on Monday and led all movies on Christmas with $18 million. Through the week, the film has grossed $50 million, including $13 million Friday through Sunday. That's a strong start for the crowd-pleaser starring Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson and Danielle Brooks.

It's nominated for several Golden Globes and expected to be in the Oscar mix.\n\n\"We saw this opportunity to go wide at Christmas, since there were so few movies, and we were confident the movie would be well received,\" says Jeffrey Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. \"The excitement of awards season could really help ignite a bigger box office.\"\n\nThe last weekend of the year pushed the industry past $9 billion in box office for the year in U.S. and Canadian theaters for the first time since before the pandemic. Ticket sales were up 21% from 2022, according to data firm Comscore.\n\nStill, it was a mark that seemed more easily within reach during the summer highs of \"Barbenheimer,\" when both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were breaking box-office records.\n\nThe enormous success of those two films changed the trajectory of Hollywood's 2023, but so did the actors and writers strikes. Those forced the postponement of some top films (most notably \"Dune: Part Two\"), diminishing an already-patchwork fall lineup with few guaranteed ticket-sellers. One exception was the last-minute addition of \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\" which set a new record for concert films.\n\nWhat was the best movie of 2023? From 'Barbie' to 'Poor Things,' these are our top 10\n\nThis year, Hollywood needed Swift and every penny to reach $9 billion. It crossed that threshold Saturday, with one day to spare. That total, though, still doesn't come close to the $11 billion-plus years that preceded the pandemic.\n\nThe production delays caused by the strikes could have an even greater impact on 2024. Several top releases have already been postponed until at least the following year, including \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Spider-Verse\" sequels. After a rocky year for Marvel, Hollywood will have to hope it can adapt to changing audience tastes – and that another \"Barbie\" is lurking somewhere.\n\n\"This final push of the year provided great insight into what audiences are looking for,\" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \"It's movies big and small. It's different types of movies.\"\n\nThough \"Wonka\" won out as the family movie choice for the holidays, \"Migration\" is attracting young audiences, too. The animated movie from the maker of \"Minions\" notched $17.2 million in its second weekend, and $59.4 million since opening.\n\n\"The Boys in the Boat,\" the George Clooney-directed sports drama, grossed $24.6 million since opening Dec. 25. The movie, about the U.S. men's crew in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, wasn't a smash with critics (58% \"fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes) but audiences gave it an \"A\" on CinemaScore. \"The Boys in the Boat,\" which cost about $40 million to make, could hold well in coming weeks.\n\nThough romantic comedies have largely migrated to streaming platforms, \"Anyone But You\" is proving the genre can still work in theaters.

The question for Disney now is whether families will turn out in theaters for an original animated movie, such as next summer's \"Elio,\" or whether they will reserve their theatergoing for large sequels.\n\nDisney also faced multiple live-action failures last year, from \"The Marvels\" to \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" casting a pall over its 100th anniversary.\n\nBut even outside of animation, the company has fared better in theaters in 2024. Its Marvel brand also rebounded with \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" which set a record for highest grossing R-rated film.\n\nBut \"Moana 2\" represents a unique case of a movie setting box office records after not being intended to play theatrically at all. The sequel was originally imagined as a Disney+ streaming series, but in February, Disney made the surprise announcement that the show would be a theatrical release instead. It was a rare instance of a blockbuster movie being announced and released in the same calendar year.\n\nAfter the success of \"Moana 2\" and \"Inside Out 2,\" audiences can expect Disney to continue doubling down on sequels.

And it was a banner weekend for both films, with \"Deadpool\" netting $54 million domestically and \"Us\" coming in just behind with $50 million.\n\nBesides evidence that both movies are hits, these totals also make Lively and Reynolds the first married couple since Bruce Willis and Demi Moore 34 years ago to go one and two at the box office. Back in 1990 Willis' \"Die Hard 2\" and Moore's \"Ghost\" were also in first and second one weekend in the box office race. Moore would win the overall competition, however, with tear-jerker \"Ghost\" grossing more domestically than any other film that whole year (plus nabbing some Oscar nominations and wins).\n\nSo far superhero crossover \"Deadpool\" has made $494.3 million at U.S. theaters since its July 26 release, making it one of the biggest movies of the post-pandemic era. \"It Ends With Us,\" a mid-budget film about ending the cycle of domestic violence, outperformed expectations with its $50 million in one weekend, a huge win for Lively, also a producer on the film.\n\nThere's room on the couch!

Online sleuths have pointed to awkward moments as the cast and director and star Justin Baldoni (\"Jane the Virgin\") promoted the movie that might point to on-set tension. There were no photos of the full cast at the film's premiere, and Baldoni has been doing press for the film solo. Lively said that husband Reynolds actually scripted one of the movie's pivotal scenes, which was news to screenwriter Christy Hall. Fans have also criticized the lighthearted marketing for the movie, which can make it look like a romantic comedy, when the subject matter is so serious.\n\nLively and Reynolds first starred together onscreen in 2011 box office bomb \"Green Lantern,\" but 2024 has been much kinder to them.

He also could wind up as the NL’s starting pitcher in the game since he’ll be on normal rest.\n\nThe players, managers and coaches opted for the veterans who have excelled the first half and not the rookies, voting for starters Tyler Glasnow of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Chris Sale and Reynaldo Lopez of Atlanta, and starters Zack Wheeler and Ranger Suarez of the Philadelphia Phillies, but not Skenes or Cubs 30-year-old rookie Shota Imanaga. They chose relievers Jeff Hoffman and Matt Strahm of the Phillies, and Robert Suarez of the San Diego Padres.\n\nThe players and managers also did not vote for St. Louis Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, who leads MLB with 31 saves, San Francisco Giants ace Logan Webb, or Cubs ace Shota Imanaga. They were selected to the All-Star Game by MLB officials, who also picked New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, Giants center fielder Heliot Ramos and closer Tanner Scott of the Miami Marlins.\n\nThe addition of Alonso assures the Home Run Derby of star power with Shohei Ohtani, Aaron Judge and Juan Soto declining to participate.

They’ll be represented by Bryce Harper, who will be making his first All-Star appearance in a Phillies uniform (Harper missed the 2022 All-Star Game with a broken thumb). Other Phillies making the roster include third baseman Alec Bohm, shortstop Trea Turner, starter Zack Wheeler (who will be inactive) and relievers Hoffman and Strahm.\n\nThe Dodgers have six players, including injured shortstop Mookie Betts: DH Shohei Ohtani, first baseman Freddie Freeman, catcher Will Smith, outfielder Teoscar Hernandez, and Glasnow.\n\nEvery first-place team this year is represented by at least two players except for the Seattle Mariners, whose lone All-Star is starter Logan Gilbert.\n\nThe Texas Rangers and Arizona Diamondbacks, who were in last year’s World Series and will have their managers and entire coaching staffs at the All-Star game, are represented by only three All-Stars: Shortstop Marcus Semien and closer Kirby Yates of the Rangers and second baseman Ketel Marte of the Diamondbacks.\n\nNearly half of the All-Star rosters are filled with 32 players making their All-Star team, including three on the Cleveland Guardians: First baseman Josh Naylor, outfielder Steven Kwan and DH David Fry. The Guardians have a league-leading five All-Stars, including third baseman Jose Ramirez and closer Emmanuel Clase.\n\nThe All-Star rosters feature 24 internationally-born players (35.8%), but with Betts being injured, there are only three Black active players on the All-Star teams: (Aaron Judge of the Yankees, Riley Greene of the Detroit Tigers and CJ Abrams of the Washington Nationals.\n\nFour rookies were selected to the All-Star Game with San Diego Padres 21-year-old center fielder Jackson Merrill being the youngest, along with Oakland A’s closer Mason Miller, Imanaga and Skenes. Merrill is the first rookie in Padres history to make the All-Star Game, while Imanaga is the first Cubs’ rookie pitcher to make it.\n\nThe AL players chosen in the player balloting were Royals catcher Salvador Perez and shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Naylor, Texas Rangers shortstop Marcus Semien, third baseman Rafael Devers and outfielder Jarren Duran of the Boston Red Sox, Greene, injured Houston Astros outfielder Kyle Tucker and Fry. They also voted in pitchers Corbin Burnes of the Baltimore Orioles, Tarik Skubal of the Detroit Tigers, Garrett Crochet of the Chicago White e Sox, Seth Lugo of the Royals, Tanner Houck of the Red Sox, Kirby Yates of the Texas Rangers, Clase and Miller.\n\nMORE: MLB midseason awards - MVPs, surprises, disappointments and more\n\nMLB officials used four of their six picks in the AL to assure that each team is represented, and selected starter Tyler Anderson of the Los Angeles Angels and Gilbert of the Mariners, Carlos Correa of the Minnesota Twins and Isaac Parades of the Tampa Bay Rays. MLB also selected Yankees closer Clay Holmes and Royals starter Cole Ragans.\n\nIn the NL, players chose the five Dodgers, with Ohtani winning the fan balloting; two-time hitting champion Luis Arraez of the Padres, Atlanta DH Marcell Ozuna, third baseman Ryan McMahon of the Colorado Rockies, Merrill of the Padres, and Bryan Reynolds of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Cincinnati Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz received the second-most votes among shortstops and will replace Betts.

Yet, while the temptation was always there to pitch for his hometown team, the Texas Rangers, he officially decided to return to the Dodgers for his 17th season.\n\n“His rehab is coming along really well,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said last weekend during their club's fan fest. “I think his thought process right now is dominate the rehab process.\"\n\nThe Dodgers, of course, certainly have the talent to wait until Kershaw’s arrival with their star-studded team after spending $1.2 billion on DH Shohei Ohtani, starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto, starter Tyler Glasnow and outfielder Teoscar Hernandez.\n\nThey will open the season with a rotation of Yamamoto, Glasnow, Bobby Miller, James Paxton, Emmet Sheehan, Michael Grove and Gavin Stone – the back end spots up for grabs in spring training.

With the addition of Ohtani, the emergence of Parker Bridwell and J.C. Ramirez and the return to full health of Garrett Richards, Andrew Heaney and Tyler Skaggs, the Angels could take a major step forward.\n\nThey could even consider going with a six-man rotation, which would facilitate Ohtani’s transition. It’s not yet clear whether that was a factor in his decision, announced unexpectedly on Friday.\n\n“This morning, after a thorough, detailed process, Shohei Ohtani has decided to sign with the Los Angeles Angels,’’ Ohtani’s L.A.-based agent, Nez Balelo, said in a statement. “Shohei is humbled and flattered by all the time and effort that so many teams put into their presentations and sincerely thanks them for their professionalism. In the end, he felt a strong connection with the Angels and believes they can best help him reach his goals in major league baseball.’’\n\nFor teams like the Mariners and Rangers – who were among the seven finalists for Ohtani’s services – the disappointment of missing out on a potentially transcendent star is further exacerbated by his choice of a division rival, making their road to the playoffs that much harder. His other four finalists were all in the National League.\n\nSeattle, where Ichiro Suzuki first became an icon in the major leagues, was prepared to move Nelson Cruz to the outfield to accommodate Ohtani. Texas, which nurtured his idol Yu Darvish through his transition to America, had longstanding ties to Ohtani and open spots in the rotation and at DH.\n\nNone of that swayed Ohtani, who will now be able to play alongside Trout – generally acknowledged as the game’s best player – while developing in a big market that doesn’t bring the same intense scrutiny bestowed on the L.A. Dodgers 30 miles to the northwest.\n\nOhtani’s presence may even help convince Trout, who has played in only one postseason, to remain in Anaheim after his current contract expires after the 2020 season. That was just one more reason for the Angels to be giddy about Friday’s news.\n\n“We are honored Shohei Ohtani has decided to join the Angels Organization,’’ the club said in a statement. “We felt a unique connectivity with him throughout the process and are excited he will become an Angel.’’\n\nGallery: Japanese two-way star Ohtani", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2024/09/08/mlb-standings-trade-deadline-michael-kopech/75128155007/", "title": "MLB trade deadline revisited: Dodgers found bullpen ace in Kopech", "text": "PHOENIX — There were no blockbuster deals and only a couple of All-Star players were even moved at the 2024 Major League Baseball trade deadline.\n\nYet despite the lack of star power, there are seven contenders who have greatly benefited from their reinforcements, and fear just where they’d be without them.\n\n\"I don’t want to even think about where we’d be,\" Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"These guys have been huge for us. They’ve already made a big impact for us.\"\n\nThe best under-the-radar gem found at the trade deadline was the discarded middle reliever from the Chicago White Sox, Michael Kopech. He was 2-8 with a 4.74 ERA for baseball’s worst team, and suddenly is 3-0 with a 0.59 ERA for the Dodgers, striking out 20 of the 57 batters he has faced.\n\n\"It’s like they have a magic formula over there,\" Arizona Diamondbacks reliever Paul Sewald says. “Look at what he’s doing.\"\n\nThe Dodgers, trying to wrap up their 12th NL West title in the last 13 years, struck gold at the deadline without touching any of their prized prospects, landing starter Jack Flaherty, super utilityman Tommy Edman and Kopech.\n\nFlaherty, who was with the Detroit Tigers, was on the verge of being traded to the New York Yankees until they balked after seeing his medicals, and tried to lower the price. The Dodgers snared him for the discount price of prospects Thayron Liranzo and Trey Sweeney. Flaherty is now the top starter on an injury-riddled staff, going 4-1 with a 3.18 ERA, and likely will pitch a Game 1 of the postseason. They also swung a three-way trade with the St. Louis Cardinals and White Sox, acquiring Edman and Kopech for nothing more than struggling outfielder Miguel Vargas, who’s hitting .116 with a .416 OPS since joining the White Sox.\n\nThey grabbed Gold Glove winner Kevin Kiermaier from Toronto, too.\n\n\"I think,\" Kopech tells USA TODAY Sports, \"it’s worked out pretty good for all of us. Really good.\"\n\nThe Dodgers, just 11-13 in July, have gone 21-11 since July 31, and even with having no idea who will comprise their starting rotation in October, may be the finest team in the NL.\n\nHere are the other teams who benefited the most with their under-the-radar moves at the trade and waiver deadlines:\n\nSan Diego Padres\n\nPadres GM A.J. Preller, who traded away 12 of his top 15 prospects during the season, went all-in at the trade deadline.\n\nHe assembled the best bullpen in baseball by acquiring relievers Tanner Scott and Bryan Hoeing from the Miami Marlins and Jason Adam from the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nJust like that, they have turned their games into six-inning affairs.\n\nThe Padres entered Saturday 23-11 since the trade deadline, and a major-league best 31-13 since the All-Star break. They are an MLB-best 60-7 when scoring at least five runs this season.\n\nSimply, with their late-inning bullpen reinforcements, they have as good a shot to win the World Series as any team in baseball.\n\nKansas City Royals\n\nThe Royals, in one of the greatest turnarounds in baseball history after losing 106 games last year, weren’t satisfied with just a winning record.\n\nThey made the most moves at the trade and waiver deadlines, coming up with infielder Paul DeJong, outfielders Tommy Pham and Robbie Grossman, starter Michael Lorenzen and reliever Hunter Harvey.\n\nThe Royals, in a stretch of playing 20 consecutive games against teams currently in a playoff spot, are hanging on for dear life but would be on the outside looking in without the moves.\n\nDeJong has been fabulous since leaving the White Sox, hitting six home runs and driving in 15 runs while the waiver claims of Pham and Grossman and minor-league acquisition of Yuli Gurriel have combined to hit .324 with a .500 slugging percentage.\n\nThe Royals have plenty of depth now, and although it may be too late to catch Cleveland, they will finally be back in the postseason after an aggressive winter and trade deadline.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\n\nThe Diamondbacks certainly didn’t plan to be aggressive at the deadline, but with a sudden rash of injuries, they jumped into the market and came out big winners.\n\nThey pounced on left-handed reliever A.J. Puk from the Miami Marlins, grabbed first baseman Josh Bell within 12 hours after losing Gold Glove first baseman Christian Walker, and signed Luis Guillorme in August after All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte went down.\n\nEven with injuries that could have ruined their season, the trio made sure that the D-backs didn’t skip a beat, going 21-12. Puk is yielding a 0.56 ERA in his 19 games since his arrival, striking out 26 of 59 batters. Bell hit four homers in his first six games with the D-backs. And Guillorme has played sensational defense.\n\nThey have Walker and Marte back in the lineup now, will return to the postseason again, and will be threatening to wreak utter havoc just like a year ago.\n\n\"It means a lot to us having an aggressive front office,\" D-backs third baseman Eugenio Suarez said. \"I mean, one day after Walker gets hurt, there’s Bell walking through the door.\n\n\"We know in our mind that we can play with the Dodgers. We know can play with anyone.\"\n\nBaltimore Orioles\n\nThe Orioles knew they needed help, particularly starting rotation depth, if they wanted to play deep in October.\n\nSo they decided to take a shot with Zach Eflin of the Tampa Bay Rays and Trevor Rogers of the Marlins, picked up Seranthony Dominguez and Gregory Soto for their shaky bullpen, and took a flier on struggling White Sox DH Eloy Jimenez.\n\nEflin has easily been the best starter moved at the deadline, going 5-1 with a 2.37 ERA, and slots in perfectly as the No. 2 starter in the postseason behind Corbin Burnes.\n\nIf not for Eflin, they wouldn’t be going toe-to-toe with the Yankees for the AL East title.\n\nHouston Astros\n\nEveryone was giggling at the trade deadline that the Astros gave up far too much for Yusei Kikuchi, sending prospects Jake Bloss, Joey Loperfido and Will Wagner to the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nWell, who’s laughing now?\n\nKikuchi is 4-0 with a 3.07 ERA, striking out 53 batters in 41 innings, while the Astros have won all seven of his starts.\n\nHe hardly looks like the same guy who was 4-9 with a 4.75 ERA with the Blue Jays, throwing fewer curveballs and more sliders while elevating his fastball.\n\nThe Astros rotation yielded a 2.51 ERA and the lowest batting average (.185) in a month by any team since 1968 after Kikuchi’s arrival. They have plenty of depth in a rotation featuring Framber Valdez, Justin Verlander, Hunter Brown, Ronel Blanco and Spencer Arrighetti.\n\nJust like that, the Astros could be headed to their eighth consecutive ALCS and perhaps another World Series to go with it.\n\nCleveland Guardians\n\nThe Guardians’ starting rotation has been awful and they took a gamble signing Matthew Boyd, who was recovering from Tommy John surgery, to a major-league contract four weeks before the deadline. They took a flier on injured starter Alex Cobb of the Giants, who hadn’t thrown a pitch in the major leagues all season, too.\n\nThe total cost: $5 million.\n\nWell, instead of providing a little stability, these two veterans have been instrumental in keeping the Guardians atop the AL Central.\n\nBoyd is 2-1 with a 2.20 ERA in his five starts and Cobb, who had been recovering from hip surgery, is 2-1 with a 2.76 ERA in his three starts.\n\nNot bad for two guys who hadn’t pitched a single inning in the big leagues until arriving in Cleveland.\n\nYou’ll see them on the national stage pitching in October for the Guardians.\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n– While there have been rumors swirling all season about front-office shakeups, there’s no evidence that any drastic changes will be made.\n\nThe Seattle Mariners are bringing back Jerry Dipoto, as the Seattle Times first reported, even though they likely will miss the playoffs for the 22nd time in 23 years.\n\nA.J. Preller ended any speculation about his future with the San Diego Padres after slashing the payroll by $90 million, and having a dramatically improved team.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays could possibly shift GM Ross Atkins to a different role after failing to make the playoffs, but there’s no indication he will be dismissed.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates, who are enduring their sixth consecutive losing season, are much more likely to make changes with manager Derek Shelton or his coaching staff than with GM Ben Cherington.\n\nThere is internal friction in the Chicago Cubs’ front office, high-ranking officials say, but despite their disappointing season, Jed Hoyer, president of baseball operations, will return in 2025.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants climbed over the luxury tax, brought in manager Bob Melvin and still have a losing season, but if Farhan Zaidi is trusted to negotiate a long-term contract for third baseman Matt Chapman, he is expected to return for at least one more year.\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals could have a losing record in back-to-back years for the first time since 1958-59, but John Mozeliak, president of baseball operations, already announced that he will step down after the 2025 season, perhaps paving the way for Chaim Bloom. Responsibilities could shift, but no change is expected.\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds have not won a playoff game since 2012, but Nick Krall, president of baseball operations, should be safe while coaches on David Bell’s staff could be paying the price.\n\nThe Texas Rangers were expected to at least contend after winning the World Series a year ago, but it’s quite odd that GM Chris Young has yet to sign a contract extension. Still, it’s hard to believe he won’t be back.\n\nIf these teams don’t make the playoffs a year from now, well, that unemployment line could be rather long.\n\n– While the White Sox have performed worse with Grady Sizemore than Pedro Grifol, Marlins manager Skip Schumaker continues to be the White Sox’s first choice to manage their club in 2025, but Schumaker is expected to have several options.\n\n– No one outside Matt Chapman and his family is happier about his six-year, $151 million contract extension with the San Francisco Giants than Alex Bregman of the Houston Astros.\n\nWith Chapman off the free-agent board, Bregman is by far the top third baseman on the market with no real alternative.\n\n– The advertising on the Dodgers’ outfield wall is generating $6.5 million this year, thanks to Shohei Ohtani, compared to $500,000 in 2023.\n\n– Atlanta veteran Whit Merrifield says that there will be penalties for pitchers next season that hit batters with fastballs towards the head after the MLB Competition Committee’s latest meeting.\n\n“We’ll have something in place by the time the season starts next year,” Merrifield told Atlanta reporters. “I’d be shocked if we didn’t. … Everybody’s in agreement, it’s just about what is the punishment going to be, and how are we going to word it.”\n\nThe number of hit batters has skyrocketed with the increased velocity among pitchers. There were 657 batters hit by pitches in 1980. There were 2,112 hit batsmen last year, which could be eclipsed this year.\n\n– The San Diego Padres traded All-Star outfielder Juan Soto, lost Blake Snell, Josh Hader, Michael Wacha and Seth Lugo in free agency, but they’re a much better team than a year ago with players raving about manager Mike Shildt and the clubhouse culture.\n\nCertainly, they are much more resilient than a year ago when they were the most underachieving team in baseball.\n\nThe Padres went 2-12 in extra innings in 2023, hitting .169 in extras.\n\nThis year, they are 8-1 in extra innings, batting .412.\n\nThey have had four comebacks of at least five runs this season, and 21 victories in games they trailed by two or more runs, 13 more than a year ago.\n\n– The scouting industry took a massive hit this week, particularly in Chicago with the White Sox dismissing veteran pro scouts Billy Scherer, Joe Siers, Bruce Benedict and Duraka Shaheed, along with special assistant Marco Paddy, who was in charge of their international scouting. On the North Side, the Cubs fired four younger scouts while slashing their budget.\n\nThe Cubs also told their scouting department that they no longer will scout games at any level except the complex league and Dominican Summer League.\n\nBrutal.\n\n– The Houston Astros and New York Mets have gone from 11 games under .500 to 11 over .500, and if they remain 11 games over .500 it will mark only the third season where multiple teams accomplished the feat, joining the Houston Astros and Oakland A’s in 2005 and the St. Louis Browns and New York Giants in 1916.\n\n– Chris Sale, who is a shoo-in for the NL Cy Young award, now has 11 career games in which he’s pitched at least seven shutout innings, striking out nine or more batters, and allowing six or fewer hits with no walks.\n\nThe only other man to accomplish the feat?\n\nSale’s idol, Hall of Famer Randy Johnson.\n\n– Remember when the New York Yankees looked almost unbeatable and had an MLB-best 50-22 record on June 14?\n\nThey since have gone 32-38, even after winning the first two games of their series this weekend against the Cubs.\n\n– It’s hard enough for pitchers to throw no-hitters these days when they’re rarely facing a lineup three times in a game before their manager is ready to yank them.\n\nPitchers have been taken out of a game 45 times the last three years with a no-hitter though at least five innings, including 12 times this year.\n\n– The Yankees have just three weeks to figure out their closer situation before the playoffs start.\n\nClay Holmes, who had a 0.00 ERA in his first 20 games, has a 5.14 ERA dating back to May 20, blowing a major-league leading 11 saves.\n\n– How strong has the Padres bullpen been this season?\n\nWhen Robert Suarez gave up a game-winning, grand slam in the ninth inning Thursday to Parker Meadows of the Detroit Tigers, it was the first time the Padres lost a game when their starting pitcher handed their bullpen a lead since June 2.\n\n– You think Manny Machado plays a huge impact in the Padres’ success?\n\nThe Padres were 37-40 on June 18 with Machado getting off to the worst start of his career with a .661 OPS.\n\nSince then, he has a .919 OPS, and the Padres are 43-21. They are 24-0 this season when he drives in two or more runs in a game.\n\n“It has to be always me,” Machado told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “If we’re going to win, I have to perform. That’s just what it is.\"\n\n– Why was it so special for Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. to travel to the Oakland Coliseum one last time to say good-bye?\n\n“It’s where I got my first hit,” Griffey said.\n\nGriffey, the Mariners starting center fielder at the age of 19, hit a double off 20-game winner Dave Stewart for his first major-league hit.\n\n– Pretty cool company for Texas Rangers rookie Wyatt Langford.\n\nHe became only the second player in MLB history to hit a walk-off grand slam, an inside-the-park homer and hit for the cycle in the same season.\n\nThe other?\n\nJackie Robinson.\n\n– Texas Rangers veteran Nathan Eovaldi has been a godsend for Texas, going 23-12 (.657) in 50 starts in his two seasons with the club. It’s the third-highest winning percentage by a Rangers pitcher in his first 50 starts behind Cole Hamels and Kenny Rogers.\n\n– While Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal is a lock to be the AL Cy Young award winner, he has a chance to join an exclusive group: Leading the major leagues in victories, ERA and strikeouts.\n\nThe only two pitchers to win the pitching triple crown: Mets starter Dwight Gooden in 1985 and Mets starter Johan Santana in 2006.\n\n– Marcell Ozuna’s chances of winning the NL Triple Crown have evaporated, but he has been a model of consistency with on-base streaks of 27, 24 and 23 games.\n\n– If the Babe Ruth trade was the worst in Boston Red Sox history, the Sale trade to Atlanta may be the second-worst.\n\nSale will be the unanimous winner of the NL Cy Young award, leading every pitching triple crown category. He has yielded two or fewer runs in 15 consecutive games.\n\nThe Red Sox not only received just infielder Vaughn Grissom in return, but they included $17 million in the deal, paying Sale’s entire 2024 salary.\n\n– You know it’s ugly in Pittsburgh when first baseman Rowdy Tellez pitches three times in 12 days during the Pirates’ blowout losses while the team has now been limited to one run or less 30 times.\n\n– The White Sox might be a playoff team if only the games lasted six innings.\n\nThey are 27-22 when leading after six innings this year, and 5-88 when tied or trailing after six innings.\n\nThey have won one game since May 5 when tied or trailing after six innings.\n\n– Luis Arraez hasn’t struck out in 105 plate appearances, is hitting .368 with runners in scoring position and even has a .280 batting average with two strikes.\n\n– The Mariners may be spending all winter lamenting their failures in one-run games this season, going 6-17 in one-run games since June 19.\n\n– You knew there was something more than just a bruised shin that caused Astros outfielder Kyle Tucker to be out for three months until returning Friday.\n\nIt turns out that his shin was fractured.\n\n– The Dodgers have no idea who will comprise their starting rotation outside Jack Flaherty when the playoffs start now that Gavin Stone went on the injured list with an inflamed shoulder.\n\nThe Dodgers have used 17 starters this year, and 11 have gone on the injured list.\n\n– The Phillies have won 31 consecutive games in which the starting pitcher completes at least seven innings, the second-longest streak in baseball history behind only the 1942 St. Louis Cardinals’ (42).\n\n– Garrett Crochet, the only bright spot in the White Sox’s dismal season, will pitch the rest of the season without being shut down.\n\n– While Shohei Ohtani will be the first full-time DH to win the MVP award this season, let’s not forget, Don Baylor won the AL MVP with the Angels in 1979 when he started 65 games as the DH.\n\n– Congratulations to Darren Baker, son of Dusty Baker, who was the eighth son of a former big-leaguer to make his major league debut this year:\n\nHe joins Griffin Conine, Grant McCray, Will Wagner, Jacob Wilson, Angel Martinez, Jack Leiter and Jackson Holliday.\n\n– RIP Tony Attanasio, the longtime agent for stars ranging from Dave Stewart to Ichiro Suzuki, who passed away at the age of 84 in San Diego.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/dodgers/2024/11/01/los-angeles-dodgers-world-series-parade-updates-highlights/75969105007/", "title": "Los Angeles Dodgers World Series parade: Highlights from ...", "text": "The Los Angeles Dodgers are World Series champions again, and this time they got the parade the franchise never had when it last won baseball's Fall Classic.\n\nThe Dodgers overcame a 5-0 deficit to beat the New York Yankees, 7-6, in Game 5 Wednesday night to clinch their second World Series championship in four years. But their 2020 title came amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and public health protocols in effect in Los Angeles at the time prevented a parade from happening.\n\nThis year was different. The Dodgers were once again the best team in baseball and then backed it up in the 2024 postseason. Accordingly, the city of Los Angeles and the team had a huge celebration to commemorate this team's accomplishments on Friday. It even included a nod to Fernando Valenzuela, the franchise great who died right before the World Series began last month.\n\nThis was a memorable afternoon for Dodgers' players and fans alike, one that they all said afterwards exceeded even their grandest expectations. The team received its long-awaited parade treatment from throngs of fans that lined the streets of Los Angeles and a sold-out celebration ceremony at Dodgers Stadium in which all the team's stars spoke.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports chronicled all the best highlights and moments live and you can relive them below:\n\nSAVE THE MOMENT: Dodgers are World Series champions! Celebrate with stunning commemorative book\n\nDodgers' celebration is over, but Clayton Kershaw isn't done\n\nThe formal ceremony at Dodger Stadium is over as most of the members of the 2024 World Series champions took the stage and thanked the fans. But many fans, players and their families are lingering, with the MLB simulcast providing more interviews with the Dodgers. Clayton Kershaw was among those to appear and he used it to make sure everyone knew his emotions weren't a symbol for any sort of finality.\n\n\"I'll remember this the rest of my life,\" Kershaw said. \"I'm so thankful that I'm gonna get to retire with a Dodger jersey on my back. Not soon, but whenever that day comes.\"\n\nShohei Ohtani speaks at Dodgers World Series celebration\n\nNo interpreter needed for the Dodger Stadium celebration.\n\nClayton Kershaw: 'Dodger for life'\n\nThe mic went from Mookie Betts to a tearful Teoscar Hernandez and then to Clayton Kershaw. The moment sank in for everyone as the crowd roared. Kershaw, a member of the Dodgers for 17 years, looked overwhelmed with emotion. He missed the Dodgers' postseason run due to injury.\n\n\"I've waited for this day for so long. I've waited to celebrate a long time,\" Kershaw told the crowd. \"I didn't have anything to do with this championship but it's the best feeling in the world.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I love you guys. Dodger for life,.\" Kershaw added before posing once more with the World Series trophy along with the entire team.\n\nDodgers celebration features expletives, 'Fat Joe' jokes\n\nKiké Hernandez, shirtless during the Dodgers' parade, just came out and dropped something akin to a wrestling promo as Dodgers players come up one-by-one to speak to the Dodger Stadium crowd.\n\nManager Dave Roberts called for the team to run it back. Walker Buehler took the mic and simply declared the Dodgers champions with a little profanity mixed in. Then came Hernandez.\n\n\"Who has more championships in the 2020s than us?\" Hernandez asked rhetorically. \"Absolutely nobody.\"\n\nHe then thanked Ice Cube, both for Friday's performance and the performance before Game 2. Hernandez said the Dodgers knew \"we'd already won it\" as soon Ice Cube came out. He then took a dig at the New York Yankees and Fat Joe's performance before Game 3 at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"He used to be fat, but he's not fat anymore,\" Hernandez said. \"After that performance, we'd already won.\"\n\nIce Cube opens Dodger Stadium World Series celebration\n\nActor, rapper and entrepeneur Ice Cube opened the Dodger Stadium World Series celebration Friday with a performance, just like he did during Game 2 of the World Series. Wearing a No. 24 Dodgers jersey, he performed a couple of his songs and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts eventually joined him dancing on the stage set up in the outfield.\n\nThe rest of the Dodgers and their families are beginning to make their way out to the stage now.\n\nKiké Hernandez lost his shirt; Shohei Ohtani won't\n\nDodgers outfielder Kiké Hernandez was at the front of his doubledecker bus during the Dodgers parade moving to the music without a shirt on.\n\nDodgers teammate Shohei Ohtani was subsequently asked from atop his bus on the MLB Network simulcast whether he might take his shirt off at some point during today's celebration.\n\n\"No,\" Ohtani said immediately in English, bypassing his translator. \"Never.\"\n\nEarlier in the interview, Ohtani expressed astonishment at the number of Dodgers fans in attendance along the parade route. The players are starting to arrive at Dodger Stadium for today's sold-out celebration ceremony.\n\nDodger Stadium sings happy birthday to Fernando Valenzuela\n\nWith Friday’s festivities occurring on Fernando Valenzuela’s birthday, the Dodger Stadium crowd made sure to pay tribute to the late pitching legend.\n\nActor Edward James Olmos took the mic and talked about Valenzuela’s legacy to Los Angeles and he started singing happy birthday before the rest of the crowd joined in. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJack Flaherty wants to stay with Dodgers\n\nDodgers pitcher Jack Flaherty was acquired at the trade deadline to add depth to the pitching staff for the final push toward the postseason.\n\nFlaherty pitched Game 1 and Game 5 of the World Series to help the Dodgers’ win their first title since 2020.\n\nThe right-hander will be a free agent this offseason.\n\n\"I love this city and I never want to leave,\" Dodgers pitcher Jack Flaherty said from the parade on Spectrum SportsNet LA.\n\nThe Harvard Westlake alum grew up a Dodgers fan but mentioned that he had no idea just how much the team meant to the city of Los Angeles. Multiple players have stated that 2 million fans were expected out for the celebration today. — James H. Williams\n\nOrel Hershiser sweater\n\nOrel Hershiser, who helped pitch the Dodgers to the World Series championship in 1988 and is currently a broadcaster for the team, was seen at Friday's parade in familiar if not nostalgic attire.\n\nHershiser was wearing the same sweater (or at least something eerily similar) that he wore to celebrate the Dodgers' championship 36 years ago.\n\nHershiser's fashion sense is certainly up for debate.\n\nShohei Ohtani's dog, Decoy, ready for parade\n\nWith the Dodgers players bringing their families along for the championship parade, star Shohei Ohtani made sure to bring his.\n\nThe slugger’s famous dog, Decoy, joined his father on the route. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWalker Buehler beer bong at Dodgers World Series parade\n\nThe parade is underway as the buses move through downtown Los Angeles and we've already seen a candidate for the Dodgers player enjoying himself the most. Pitcher Walker Buehler was captured on camera atop his doubledecker bus using a beer bong while wearing the 1988 game-worn Orel Hershiser jersey he wore walking into Dodger Stadium for Game 1 of the World Series.\n\nIt was given to him by Hershiser, who won the 1988 World Series as a Dodgers pitcher and was laughing along during the MLB Network broadcast of the parade as this all played out. Hershiser declared he no longer needed or wanted the jersey back.\n\nThey're having a lot of run in the streets of L.A. today.\n\nDodgers parade will also be Fernando Valenzuela tribute\n\nThe first Dodgers World Series championship parade since 1988 is being held on what would have been Fernando Valenzuela's 64th birthday. The Dodgers legend, who was a member of that 1988 team, died last month and the team did not initially announce a cause of death or more details. Tributes came from far and wide during the World Series and they'll continue for today's celebration given the circumstances.\n\nA memorial in Valenzuela's honor is being filled with a new wave of messages – including Happy Birthday balloons – as fans flood Dodger Stadium for today's celebration.\n\nDodgers arriving soon on doubledecker buses\n\nThe Dodgers' players, staff and their families are aboard doubledecker buses while on the parade route, and aerial coverage from the USA TODAY live stream of today's events captured their departure from Dodger Stadium and impending arrival for the start of the parade. The streets are filled with Dodger blue at this point. Horns are beeping as the buses get closer to all the fans. What a scene.\n\nDodger Stadium crowd growing\n\nLOS ANGELES — If the crowd at the parade in downtown Los Angeles wasn’t already a frenzy, just a few miles north, Dodger Stadium is already getting packed for the championship celebration. People started entering the parking lots at 8 a.m. PT and, in just one hour, long lines outside the stadium gates and stores already formed. — Jordan Mendoza\n\n2025 MLB World Series odds\n\n*All odds via FanDuel\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers (+400)\n\nNew York Yankees (+750)\n\nAtlanta Braves (+800)\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies (+1000)\n\nBaltimore Orioles (+1100)\n\nHouston Astros (+1200)\n\nNew York Mets (+1200)\n\nSan Diego Padres (+1500)\n\nCleveland Guardians (+2500)\n\nChicago Cubs (+2500)\n\nTexas Rangers (+2500)\n\nSeattle Mariners (+2500)\n\nThe complete list of 2025 World Series odds.\n\n2025 MLB power rankings\n\nFor the next 100 days, 30 Major League Baseball franchises will change their shapes, increase their ceilings, dream big and buy low, all in service of improving by the time pitchers and catchers reassemble in February.\n\nA look at Gabe Lacques’ post-World Series rankings.\n\n2025 MLB World Series favorites\n\nA way-too-early look by USA TODAY Sports’ Jesse Yomtov at where every team stands in the hierarchy for 2025, starting with those World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nFreddie Freeman delivers after months of anguish\n\nFreddie Freeman had just won the World Series championship.

Freeman had to leave the team for eight days in July. He seriously considered the possibility of not coming back until next spring.\n\nRead the full column by Bob Nightengale.\n\nHow many fans expected at Dodgers World Series parade?\n\nThe official start of the Dodgers’ World Series parade is still almost two hours away, but fans have already lined the streets around City Hall in downtown Los Angeles. Mayor Karen Bass indicated in a social media post Friday morning the city is expecting “tens of thousands” of people to come downtown for the day’s festivities and the first Dodgers’ championship parade since 1988.\n\nWhen is Dodgers World Series parade?\n\nThe Dodgers and their fans will celebrate the 2024 World Series title on Friday, Nov. 1, which is also Fernando Valenzuela’s birthday. The Dodgers' legend died on Oct. 22 due to an undisclosed illness. The Dodgers last paraded in Los Angeles after winning the 1988 World Series.\n\nWhat time is Dodgers World Series parade?\n\nThe Dodgers' parade in downtown Los Angeles is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. ET (11 a.m. local). Following the parade, a special ticketed ceremony at Dodger Stadium will begin at approximately 3:15 p.m. ET (12:15 p.m. local).\n\nWhat will Dodgers World Series parade feature?\n\nThe Dodgers' parade commemorating their 2024 World Series title will begin at Gloria Molina Grand Park on Spring Street in front of City Hall in downtown Los Angeles. Mayor Karen Bass will officially kick off the parade, according to the team, and it will then continue on a 45-minute route from 1st Street to Grand Avenue to 5th Street, culminating at the intersection of 5th and Flower Street. Dodgers' players will be traveling atop double-decker buses.\n\nThe victory parade is free for fans to attend. The ticketed celebration at Dodger Stadium follows soon after the parade is completed. Team officials have indicated it is logistically impossible for fans to attend both events. Dodger Stadium parking gates will open at 8:30 a.m. PT, and stadium entry gates will open at 9 a.m. PT for the celebration ceremony.\n\nHow to watch Dodgers World Series parade\n\nBoth the Dodgers' World Series parade and Dodger Stadium celebration will be broadcast nationally in their entirety on the MLB Network. MLB Network's coverage will be simulcast on MLB.com, Spectrum SportsNet LA and other local television channels in Los Angeles.

Fans sprinted towards the seats, some towards the gift shops, others to the concession stands, making sure they were in prime position to capture memories from the historic spring training game.\n\nThis was the first time Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto played together in the same game with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a preview of what the Dodgers will look like for the next decade.\n\nYamamoto is under contract for 12 years. Ohtani is signed for 10 years. Together, the celebrated duo from Japan hope to lead the Dodgers to multiple World Series championships before their careers are over.\n\n“It’s pretty cool to see,’’ Dodgers veteran reliever Ryan Brasier said. “I didn’t even realize it was the first time. That’s a pretty cool lineup card to keep.’’\n\nFans shrieked and took pictures when Yamamoto took the mound, and again when Ohtani stepped to the plate. And the gifts shops were packed with $200 Ohtani jerseys, $45 Ohtani T-shirts, the Ohtani beer holders and key chains flying off the shelves.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like it,’’ said veteran starter James Paxton, who has spent the past 10 years pitching for the Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. “I’ve never seen so many fans in spring training. You’re out in the back fields, you hear a big cheer go up, and you know it’s for Ohtani or Yamamoto.\n\n“There’s so much attention, but you’re talking about superstars who are going to be around for the next 10 years.’’\n\nThe Dodgers’ players are nearly as mesmerized as the fans with Ohtani and Yamamoto. They study and marvel at their routines, particularly Yamamoto, who throws a javelin instead of playing long toss.\n\n“I love watching his routine,’’ Dodgers 24-year-old starter Bobby Miller said. “The way he goes about it. I might try to throw the javelin one day, too. I've seen a couple guys try to do it and it's hard to. It's so hard to throw, it’s wobbling.’’\n\nThe Dodgers already are embracing the idea they will be like a traveling rock show during the season. They are beefing up security on the road. The identity of their hotels will be kept as quiet as possible. Still, they know fans will find them.\n\n“I remember being with the Angels (in 2013), and there’d be about 100 fans waiting for Mike Trout,’’ says Brasier. “I can’t even imagine what it’s going to be like this year with Ohtani and Yamamoto together. It’s going to be crazy.\n\n“But when you think about it, here are two of the biggest stars ever to come from Japan, and they’re both here.’’\n\nYamamoto, making his second start of the spring, struggled with his control after an electric debut in which he threw 16 of 19 pitches for strikes. He gave up six hits and five earned runs in three innings Wednesday, walking three with just four strikeouts. He constantly was behind, and paid the price, taking little solace that his curveball improved as his 58-pitch outing progressed.\n\n“He’s still a human being,’’ Dodgers catcher Austin Barnes said. “Sometimes, you just don’t have prestige command like he always (has). Guys aren’t always going to have their 'A' stuff.\n\n“But I think it’s good to go through a little rough patch. He usually never gets hit around. I think he’ll learn from it and move on.’’\n\nIf nothing else, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts says, Yamamoto can gain valuable experience from the struggles, and pitching out of trouble with runners on base.\n\n“I think it’s a good sign that he adjusted,’’ Roberts said. “The second inning was better than the first. The third inning better than the second inning. Also, a chance to pitch with guys on base, and pitch with stress.\n\n“That was a good opportunity for him.’’\n\nOhtani, meanwhile, continued his sizzling spring. He reached base all three times he came to the plate with two hits and a walk, raising his batting average to .583 this spring with an unworldly 1.667 OPS. He announced that his rehab from his September elbow surgery is officially over. Now, he’s simply getting ready for the season.\n\nCertainly, Freddie Freeman is taking full advantage of Ohtani’s offensive exploits, hitting a grand slam and finishing with five RBI while hitting behind Mookie Betts and Ohtani.\n\n“It seems like the pitcher is in the stretch more the last couple of weeks because I’m hitting third with those guys in front of me,’’ Freeman said, laughing. “So far, things are going well for us.’’\n\nThis is a team that is now 10-3 after beating the Chicago White Sox, scoring at least seven runs in eight games.\n\nYep, life sure is different at Camelback Ranch with the Dodgers’ traveling All-Star show, featuring Ohtani and Yamamoto. The last time they were in a lineup together was a year ago when they led Team Japan to the World Baseball Classic title over the United States, culminating with Ohtani striking out Trout for the final out.\n\nOhtani and Yamamoto’s close friendship is now on full display at the Dodgers’ camp. Ohtani drove to watch Yamamoto’s first start against the Texas Rangers last week, and Ohtani requested to be in Wednesday’s starting lineup with Yamamoto on the mound, despite playing in Tuesday night's game.\n\nIt was Ohtani who helped recruit Yamamoto to the Dodgers in the first place, saying he would be honored to have him as a teammate.\n\n“I think he was huge, obviously,’’ Roberts says. “When you’re talking about the Japanese players, there’s always speculation, do they want to play with each other? Which nobody ever knows. But I certainly believe when you have a person of Shohei’s caliber saying, 'We want you here. I want to be a teammate of yours,' that was a good selling point for Yamamoto.’’\n\nNow, here they are together.\n\n“It's been great,’’ Roberts says. “I think that obviously Shohei coming over here six years ago, and not having anyone kind of help support him as a fellow countryman was different, and difficult at times. But for Yoshinobu to come here and have a former teammate, a fellow countryman come over here and kind of show him the ropes and support him ... I think is great.’’\n\nHaving someone to relate to and hang with, who speaks the same language and shares the same culture, could bring out the best in both of them.\n\n“I think it’s enormous,’’ Roberts said. “I really believe comfort leads to performance and confidence. So, to have someone that speaks your language, it just makes things more comfortable and more familiar. I do believe that’s going to help Shohei more, I really do, and not just Yoshinobu.’’\n\nWho knows, maybe it helps the entire Dodgers’ team, too? The more attention on Ohtani and Yamamoto, the less on the rest of their star-studded roster. The huge Japanese contingent of reporters aren’t breathlessly following every move of the other players.\n\n“It’s certainly much different than we’ve ever seen,” Roberts told reporters Tuesday. “I think you’ve brought in, to be quite honest, an entire country, essentially another continent. You’ve brought in two superstars from Japan.\n\n“So, with the media, I mean, it’s two to three times what we’ve ever had. I think it’s just great for our game.’’\n\nYes, and particularly for a certain Southern California team that plans to have two of the greatest players to ever come from Japan playing for them for the next decade.\n\n“Pretty special time,’’ Paxton said, “to be a Dodger.’’\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @BNightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2023/12/26/mlb-rumors-updates-bellinger-snell-dodgers-news/72033248007/", "title": "MLB rumors: Latest on Bellinger, Snell, Dodgers and more", "text": "With both Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto off the table, MLB free agency is down to its last few stars. The biggest names still available are reigning National League Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell and former MVP Cody Bellinger.\n\nAfter the Los Angeles Dodgers spent over a billion dollars on Ohtani and Yamamoto, several teams considered to be big players coming into free agency still have a lot of money to spend. That means there's a good chance guys like Snell, Matt Chapman, and Josh Hader all get more than what they are expected to receive. These upcoming weeks could be very hectic as teams who missed out on their top priorities scramble to grab their second and third options, throwing everything at their new targets in the hopes of salvaging something from this offseason.\n\nHere are the latest rumors surrounding MLB's top remaining free agents.\n\nJosh Hader looking for over $100 million\n\nJosh Hader remains the biggest reliever on the free agent market. He's a five-time All-Star and just came off one of the best seasons of his career. At just 30 years old, there's a chance that Hader maintains his elite status as a closer for years to come. Any team would be thrilled to have him, but he will cost a pretty penny. Reports indicate that Hader wants to set the new market standard for closers. He wants more money than Edwin Diaz got prior to the 2023 season.\n\nIs Hader worth it? Maybe. Despite being one of the best closers in baseball for years, he has seen his ball control dwindle recently. In 2023, Hader posted the worst strikeout-to-walk ratio of his career, and allowed more walks per nine innings (4.8) than he had in any other season. Of course, that doesn't matter if Hader can avoid contact, but Hader also posted his lowest strikeouts per nine innings (13.6) since 2017. In 2022, his fastball sat at 97.4 mph. In 2023, it dropped over a whole mile to 96.1 mph.\n\nOn the bright side, Hader did generate more weak contact than he has in recent years. However, if you're going to pay big money for a closer known for his ability to make hitters whiff, opting for someone who has seen their velocity decline so drastically in one season is a bit of a risk. Hader is absolutely talented enough to overcome that dip in velocity though.\n\nCurrently, the Yankees are one of the favorites to sign Josh Hader, per Jon Morosi. Other teams in the running include the Los Angeles Dodgers and Texas Rangers.\n\nCody Bellinger drawing interest from multiple clubs\n\nFormer National League MVP Cody Bellinger remains arguably the biggest free agent hitter on the market. After subpar 2021 and 2022 campaigns, Bellinger rebounded in 2023 to finish top-ten in NL MVP voting.\n\nReports indicate that the Toronto Blue Jays and Chicago Cubs are heavily invested in landing Bellinger.\n\nBellinger obviously provided tremendous value for the Cubs in his first season with the team. The Cubs are young and looking to return to relevancy after disbanding their entire 2016 World Series core a few years ago.\n\nThe Blue Jays arguably need Bellinger more. After trading away Teoscar Hernandez ahead of the 2023 season, the Blue Jays outfield recorded a mediocre 8.0 fWAR last season, ranking 15th in MLB. And most of that value came on defense, where the Blue Jays recorded 13.7 runs above average. On offense, they were 12.1 runs below average. While there is hope that George Springer and Daulton Varsho can rebound after underwhelming seasons, Toronto would almost certainly prefer having Bellinger as another option in case things do not improve.\n\nThe Keirmaier signing does not mean the Blue Jays are out on Bellinger. If anything, Kiermaier's signing is just good baseball. The defensive-minded veteran was one of the best nine hole hitters in MLB. Moving Bellinger away from center field to a corner outfield position could potentially give Bellinger more time to focus on his swing as well. Plus, having two high-end defensive outfielders never hurt anyone. It would also give the Blue Jays the opportunity to move Varsho to the bench after he put up a sub-.300 OBP in 2023.\n\nGiants may have interest in Bellinger as well\n\nGiants beat writer Susan Slusser told MLB Network this morning that the Giants should go after Bellinger if they do not sign both Snell and Chapman.\n\nBellinger is the only top-tier outfielder in the free agent pool. The Giants desperately need to improve their offensive production from those outfield spots. Bellinger would be a massive help with MVP-caliber upside. His poor exit velocity in 2023 is a sign for concern though, and may be why some teams are hesitating on giving him $300 million.\n\nRounding out the rotation: 2024 Los Angeles Dodgers starting rotation: How Yamamoto signing impacts pitching staff\n\nGiants may have competition for Blake Snell\n\nThe San Francisco Giants came into the offseason with a lot of money burning a hole in their pockets. After missing out on both Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto though, the team has reportedly set their eyes on reigning Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell.\n\nThe Giants' Logan Webb finished second in NL Cy Young voting in 2023 to Snell, so theoretically, pairing the two of them up would give the Giants a rotation among the best in the National League. However, the Giants are pretty thin outside of those two. 2023 All-Star Alex Cobb is set to miss the beginning of the season, meaning outside of Cobb, the Giants have Anthony DeSclafani and Ross Stripling. Even with Snell, the Giants would not have a full rotation, but they do have money to spend on another arm if need be.\n\nThe Giants' top competition for Snell appears to be the Los Angeles Angels. Ken Rosenthal reports that the Angels have checked in on the two-time Cy Young winner and have spoken with Snell as recently as Dec. 19.\n\nThe Padres and Red Sox are likely in the running for Snell as well.\n\nThe Mets showing strong interest in Lucas Giolito?\n\nAfter failing to acquire any of the biggest arms on the free agent market, the Mets are turning to their next best options, and have reportedly shown interest in former White Sox starter Lucas Giolito, the NY Post reports.\n\nGiolito spent 2023 with three different teams, recording an 8-15 record and 4.88 ERA. In the second half of the season, Giolito fell off tremendously, posting a 7.13 ERA across 72 innings.\n\nGiolito was considered one of the best pitchers in the American League between 2019 and 2021, finishing top-11 in Cy Young voting each of those three seasons. The former All-Star has posted two consecutive seasons with ERAs over 4.80 since then, though there is hope that he can regain his form from three years ago.\n\nDodgers not done dealing?\n\nAfter acquiring Ohtani, Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow, and Manuel Margot, the Dodgers are not done making the rest of the league cry in terror.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal, the Dodgers are still looking to bolster what is quickly turning into a fearsome rotation.\n\nHere is what the reporter wrote regarding Clayton Kershaw's future: \"The other option for Kershaw is a return to the Dodgers, who, even after acquiring Tyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, want to add depth to their rotation.\"\n\nTeoscar Hernandez market heating up\n\nOutside of Bellinger, the free agent outfield options are thin, yet the market seems to be heating up for former Seattle Mariner Teoscar Hernandez. The Boston Red Sox, Dodgers, and Angels appear to be the favorites.\n\nNo official offers have been made but Hernandez has been in contact with at least the Red Sox and Angels as of late according to Ken Rosenthal. Hernandez even liked a recent tweet that had a picture of him photoshopped in a Red Sox uniform.\n\nThe Dodgers are also supposedly \"monitoring\" the Hernandez market. The team is not considered the favorites to land Hernandez just yet though.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2024/09/15/another-world-series-hangover-rangers-fail-to-repeat/75228742007/", "title": "Another World Series hangover. Rangers fail to repeat", "text": "PHOENIX − The Texas Rangers got off the plane at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, boarded two buses, and drove to their sprawling resort.\n\nThe Arizona Biltmore.\n\nThe Rangers broke into smiles, a little laughter, that brought back a lot of long lasting memories.\n\nThe last time they were here was 10 months and 6 days ago, partying into the night in the courtyard, and then the ballroom until the wee hours of the morning.\n\n\"It was the greatest time,\" Rangers GM Chris Young said. \"I’ll never forget it. Seeing all of the joy, all of the happiness, the families all celebrating together.\"\n\nThe Rangers had just become World Series champions, the first in franchise history, and when they flew back to Dallas the next day, they believed they could be right back for an encore in 2024.\n\nThis time, when the Rangers departed Phoenix, they left in silence, swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks, and coldly reminded they won’t be participating in the postseason.\n\nOnce again, for the 24th consecutive year, no team will be repeating as World Series champions.\n\n\"I wish I knew what the answer was,\" Rangers manager Bruce Bochy told USA TODAY Sports. \"Obviously, I don’t have it figured out.\"\n\nBochy has won four World Series championships as manager − 2010, 2012 and 2014 with the San Francisco Giants − and last year with the Rangers.\n\nBut never once has Bochy’s team reached the postseason the following season after winning the title, let alone even reaching the World Series in back-to-back seasons.\n\n\"So, you’re talking to the wrong guy,\" Bochy said, slowly breaking into a grin.\n\nThe Rangers, despite winning 15 of their last 25 games heading into Sunday, likely won’t even finish with a winning record this season, spending October at home wondering what went wrong.\n\n\"There’s been a number of reasons why we’re not where we want to be,\" said Bochy, sitting on the visiting bench at Chase Field, looking straight ahead to the spot where he was hoisting the World Series trophy 10 months ago. \"Every season is different. It takes a life of its own whether guys aren’t having their normal year or injuries.\"\n\nBochy closes his eyes, reflecting back on the seasons after World Series championships, trying to come up with answers. No team since the New York Yankees in 1999 and 2000 have won back-to-back titles, and no National League team has repeated since the Big Red Machine days when Cincinnati won in 1975 and 1976.\n\n\"It shows how difficult it is to win a championship,\" Bochy says. \"To repeat, a lot of good things have to happen. You need your guys to have a similar year to the year before. You need to avoid injuries. And you need a surprise or two.\n\n\"We didn’t hit on any of them, just being honest.\"\n\nThe Rangers’ high-powered offense never came close to hitting on all cylinders. The only person who remotely came close to duplicating the same numbers as their championship year was shortstop Corey Seager − hitting .278 with 30 homers, 74 RBI and a .864 OPS − but his season is over after undergoing hernia surgery.\n\nEverywhere you look, up and down the lineup, they failed to get the production of a year ago.\n\nOutfielder Adolis Garcia, who hit 39 homers and drove in 107 runs in 2023, winning the ALCS MVP award, is hitting just .216 with 22 homers and 75 RBI. His .663 OPS is 173 points lower.\n\nCatcher Jonah Heim has had a nightmare of a season, hitting just .227 with a .587 OPS.\n\nCenter fielder Leody Taveras had 14 homers and 67 RBI with a .733 OPS last season, which has plummeted to 10 homers, 41 RBI and a .632 OPS.\n\nSecond baseman Marcus Semien is hitting .238 with a .704 OPS, compared to an .826 OPS in 2023.\n\nAnd there were the injuries.\n\nOutfielder Evan Carter, the Rangers’ prized rookie who was instrumental in their World Series run, was plagued with back problems and played in just 45 games, hitting .188.\n\nThird baseman Josh Jung missed the first three months of the season with a broken wrist.\n\nThree-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer made just his ninth start Saturday.\n\nStarter Jon Gray pitched in only 102 ⅔ innings before being shut down with groin and foot injuries, going 5-6 with a 4.47 ERA.\n\nAnd two-time Cy Young winner Jacob deGrom made his season debut on Friday.\n\n\"If we had been able to stay a little bit healthier, especially myself,\" Scherzer said, \"we’ve been a lot more competitive. That’s what’s tough. Baseball is an ultra-marathon. This is six months every day, and then you play another month of baseball, and after a short turnaround, you’re in another ultra-marathon. That’s why it’s so hard to repeat.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be an absolute challenge coming in, and unfortunately as a team, we haven’t played our best, and with certain guys injured, like myself, it’s frustrating. I feel like if I was healthy, and out there making my starts, that would have given the team a lot better chance.\n\n\"We’re still very good, very talented, but everybody’s got to look into the mirror after the season and wish they could have done more.\"\n\nWhen virtually every position player has a down year, with 28 different stints on the injured list, the recipe to repeat is burned in the kitchen.\n\n\"Injuries are not an excuse, every team has to deal with them,\" Bochy said, \"but they hit us pretty hard with our core players. And our guys will tell you they haven’t had the years they had last year. We weren’t the same team offensively, and it’s hard to explain why. We just didn’t have that same slug as we did last year.\"\n\nThe Rangers, who received about $20 million less than the $111 million they expected in their TV contract, also didn’t jump into the deep waters of the free-agent pool and allowed postseason hero Jordan Montgomery to walk away. They fortified their bullpen with the signings of Kirby Yates and David Robertson, but largely ran the same team back again.\n\n\"I think we’re all surprised what’s happened there,\" said Montgomery, who signed a two-year, $47.5 million contract with the Diamondbacks. \"I thought they’d be back, but I remember being with the Yankees and (Anthony) Rizzo kept talking about the World Series hangover they had with the Cubs. Maybe it’s real.\"\n\nThe team that loses the World Series, well, they still have that burning hunger. The Kansas City Royals lost the 2014 World Series in seven games to Bochy’s Giants, but returned the next year to beat the New York Mets and win it all. The D-backs are in position to pull off the same feat.\n\n\"I think it just speaks to how competitive the game is,\" D-backs first baseman Christian Walker said. \"It’s not like the Rangers did something wrong to put themselves in a bad situation. You’re talking about a team that had a really, really good season last year. It’s not that they can’t repeat that, but it’s difficult to expect everybody on the team to go out and have another really, really good year.\n\n\"There’s a lot of expectations that come along with winning, and I think it gives the optics that a team didn’t play up to their standards. But it’s just a difficult game and how fast it moves. That team was looked at as an underdog last year, just like we were, and it’s hard to expect that standard every year.\"\n\nIndeed, it wasn’t as if anyone expected anything from the Rangers last October. They lost the AL West title the last day of the regular season in Seattle, hit the road and were underdogs against Tampa Bay in the wild-card series, the Baltimore Orioles in the AL Division Series, the Houston Astros in the ALCS until reaching the World Series. Who could have imagined they’d go 11-0 on the road in the postseason?\n\nAnd who could have imagined their nightmare this year, the latest World Series champion who failed to return to the dance.\n\n\"It’s not as much as to why teams don’t repeat,\" Young said, \"but how magical it is when it does happen and have everything go right. So, to have all of those things go right for consecutive years, it’s really hard. We certainly experienced that this year whether it be injuries or underperformance. It just hasn’t lined up for us.\"\n\nNow, with only two weeks remaining, the Rangers are left hoping to finish strong, perhaps giving them a carryover into spring training next year.\n\n\"Nobody’s happy or satisfied with the way this year has gone,\" said Young, who signed a multi-year contract on Friday to return to the Rangers. \"But it’s important that we build momentum through the end of the season, which we hope will carry into 2025.\n\n\"If we can have a respectable finish here, we can look back and say that with everything that went wrong, we’re still not far off and be back next year.\"\n\nBochy pulled off the feat three times in San Francisco.\n\nSo, why not one more, in what could be the final season of his glorious managerial career?\n\nLet the mantra begin: \"One for the thumb.\"\n\nSlump buster\n\nAaron Judge, baseball’s greatest slugger who ended his career-long 16-game homerless streak Friday night with his grand slam, has a history of annual slumps.\n\nBut when he comes out of them, look out.\n\nJudge, who entered Saturday with 52 homers, has had 11 slumps in his career in which he has hit two or fewer homers in a stretch of 17 to 28 games.\n\nIn those slumps, he has hit 19 homers in 268 games, spanning 1,142 plate appearances and 964 at-bats, one homer every 50.7 at-bats.\n\nThe rest of his career, he has hit 290 home runs in 712 games, spanning 3,129 plate appearances and 2,561 at-bats, one homer every 8.8 at-bats.\n\nThis season, in 105 games from April 24-Aug. 25, he hit 48 home runs in 469 plate appearances and 370 at-bats, one homer every 7.7 at-bats.\n\nIn his two bookend slumps, totaling 40 games, he has hit three homers in 179 plate appearances and 147 at-bats, one homer every 49.0 at-bats.\n\nAround the bases\n\n≻ While the Los Angeles Dodgers are not ruling out the possibility of Shohei Ohtani taking the mound if they reach the NLCS or the World Series, the simple idea reeks of desperation.\n\nOhtani just underwent his second elbow surgery last September, and while he’s rehabbing now, he still has yet to face a single batter.\n\nIs a postseason relief appearance or two really worth a $700 million gamble and a potential third surgery? Oh sure, it would make a nice Hollywood story, and while Ohtani has continually defied the odds in his career, putting him into a situation without pitching in a game since Aug. 23, 2023, would be nothing short of reckless.\n\n≻ Major League Baseball should suspend former Minnesota Twins Class A catcher Derek Bender for at least two years after throwing a game on Sept. 6 against Class A Lakeland when he informed opposing hitters what pitches were coming from starter Ross Dunn so that Fort Myers’ season would end.\n\nThe Twins immediately released him after the investigation, and with his horrendous actions so egregious, no organization should ever sign him to play baseball ever again.\n\n≻ Two weeks remain and the San Francisco Giants ownership group still has not decided whether to bring Farhan Zaidi, president of baseball operations, back for the 2025 season in the final year of his contract.\n\n≻ Chicago Cubs outfielder Cody Bellinger, who’s in the first year of a three-year, $80 million contract, is fully expected to remain with the Cubs instead of opting out of his contract. He’ll be paid $27.5 million next year.\n\n≻ There are five teams expected to make bids for free-agent outfielder Juan Soto in free agency this winter, baseball executives believe: the New York Yankees, New York Mets, Toronto Blue Jays, San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n≻ While John Mozeliak, president of baseball operations for the St. Louis Cardinals, plans to step down after the 2025 season, special assistant Chaim Bloom is expected to have much greater authority next season, perhaps even become the top baseball decision-maker.\n\n≻ The Chicago White Sox, who should break baseball’s all-time record of 120 losses this week, plan to cut payroll in 2025 after sustaining substantial losses in revenue during this horrific season.\n\n≻ While Alex Bregman should be the highest-paid infielder in free agency this winter, Milwaukee Brewers shortstop Willy Adames may be the second-highest, with executives believing he’ll earn close to Matt Chapman’s recent six-year, $151 million deal with the Giants.\n\n≻ Enough with all of the wild rumors and speculation. The Oakland A’s are playing in Sacramento next year, and at least through 2027, and no one is going to profit more than the Giants, who never returned the territorial rights the A’s gave them when they nearly moved to Tampa 30 years ago.\n\n≻ When infielder Jose Iglesias was called up by the Mets on May 31, they were 23-33. They have since gone 58-33 and are fighting for a wild-card berth.\n\nMaybe he’s their real MVP.\n\n≻ The Minnesota Twins, whose collapse down the stretch (8-16) has enabled the Seattle Mariners, Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox to hang around the AL wild-card race, played Saturday for only the 18th time this season with Carlos Correa, Byron Buxton and Royce Lewis in the same lineup.\n\n≻ The Tigers’ decision to dump Jack Flaherty for a modest prospect package from the Dodgers may haunt them all winter. While Flaherty has emerged as the ace of the Dodgers’ staff, the Tigers can’t help but wonder if the trade cost them a legitimate shot to make the playoffs.\n\n≻ Kudos to Tennessee Tians owner Amy Adams Strunk for flying defensive line coach Tracy Rocker and his wife, Lalitha, to Seattle after their practice to watch their son, Kumar Rocker, make his major-league debut with the Texas Rangers.\n\n≻ Arizona Diamondbacks bench coach Jeff Bannister, instrumental in the D-backs’ turnaround from their 110-loss season in 2021, should be on everyone’s short list of managerial candidates this offseason.\n\n≻ There are two weeks of the season remaining, and only five teams have been officially eliminated. The Brewers, the smallest market in baseball, should be the first team to clinch a division title this week with a magic number of five entering Saturday.\n\n≻ While the Dodgers will soon be celebrating their 12th consecutive playoff spot, manager Dave Roberts concedes that much of the joy is stripped with the expectations of his club every year.\n\n“I think whatever is expected,’’ Roberts said, “it certainly takes the elation out of whatever outcome versus if it’s not expected.\n\n\"It’s our cross to bear. It’s where we’re at. We still expect to win and try to win. But I do think it does take the joy out.’’\n\n≻ The National League batting race is virtually over with, yep, Padres infielder Luis Arraez winning it again. He’ll be the first player to win a batting title with three different teams, and, in three consecutive seasons, too.\n\n≻ The Executive of the Year award belongs to Kansas City Royals GM J.J. Picollo, and it shouldn’t even be close, making shrewd moves during the winter and at the trade deadline, turning a 106-loss team to a dangerous postseason team.\n\n≻ The Miami Marlins have used an MLB-record 70 players this season, so, almost two entire 40-man rosters.\n\nNo wonder manager Skip Shumaker will be bolting the minute the season ends.\n\n≻ The baseball gods have a curious sense of humor.\n\nIt’s quite possible the Mets could wind up spending an entire week in Milwaukee while the Padres spend a week in Phoenix.\n\nThe Mets end the regular season in Milwaukee, and if they win the final wild-card berth, they likely will open the postseason one day later against the Brewers in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Padres end the regular season in Phoenix, and if they wind up with the second wild-card spot with the D-backs having the top spot, the Padres will open the postseason in Phoenix.\n\n≻ NL Rookie of the Year favorite Jackson Merrill of the Padres is just the sixth player 21 or under to hit at least 23 homers with 25 doubles and six triples. He joins an illustrious group: Hall of Famers Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Frank Robinson along with Mike Trout, Ken Keltner and Hal Trosky.\n\n≻ Kudos to Xander Bogaerts, who reluctantly moved from shortstop to second base at the start of the season for Ha-Seong Kim, swallowed his pride and now is back at shortstop for the Padres.\n\nHe agreed to the move simply to get Donovan Solano in the lineup at first base, shifting Jake Cronenworth to second base.\n\n“Everything,” Bogaerts told reporters, “is about winning. I don’t see any other way that you can put it.’’\n\n≻ Congratulations to Tampa Bay Rays infielder Christopher Morel, who received his high-school diploma this week after leaving school at the age of 16 in the Dominican Republic to pursue his baseball career.\n\n“It was more so for my mom,” Morel, 24, told reporters. “I’m the first one born in the family, and I’m the last one getting it. My two younger siblings have already graduated. So, I wanted to do it for her.”\n\n≻ Bowden Francis, meet Dave Stieb.\n\nDave Stieb, meet Bowden Francis.\n\nStieb had three no-hitters and a perfect game spoiled in the ninth inning during his career with the Blue Jays before his first no-hitter on Sept. 2, 1990.\n\nIt’s still the only no-hitter in Blue Jays history.\n\nNow, Francis is trying to join him, flirting with three no-hitters in three weeks, losing two no-hitters in the ninth inning and another in the seventh inning.\n\nFrancis is one of only five pitchers with multiple no-hit bids lasting at least eight innings since 1974, joining Max Scherzer (2015), Nolan Ryan (1974 and 1989), Tom Browning (1988), and Stieb (1988).\n\n≻ Just when you didn’t think the White Sox could get any worse, they are 6-44 since the All-Star break, and have lost 28 of their last 29 home games.\n\n≻ Comeback Player of the Season: Say hello to Diamondbacks third baseman Eugenio Suarez.\n\nHe is hitting .328 and has a major-league leading 22 home runs and 60 RBI since July 1. The first three months: He was hitting .196 with six home runs, 32 RBI and was nearly released.\n\n≻ The last time Atlanta was healthy and able to put their opening-day lineup on the field? Opening day, which lasted only seven innings.\n\n≻ What a cool moment for Twins reliever Griffin Jax, a graduate of the Air Force Academy, to see his brother (Capt. Parker Jax) and his sister-in-law (Capt. Chandler Jax) completing an F-35 flyover before the Twins game against the Los Angeles Angels at Target Field.\n\nWhen the flyover was completed, Griffin Jax’s twin brother, Capt. Carson Jax, threw out the ceremonial first pitch caught by Griffin.\n\nFor an encore, with Jaxes’ parents in attendance, Jax pitched two scoreless innings in the Twins’ 6-3 victory.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2024/09/22/home-field-advantage-mlb-postseason-overrated/75331164007/", "title": "Home-field advantage in MLB postseason is overrated", "text": "(This story has been updated to correct a factual error.)\n\nPHOENIX− You’re the Arizona Diamondbacks, the defending National League champions, and you’ve got a huge decision looming.\n\nYou’re facing the San Diego Padres the final weekend of the season at Chase Field in Phoenix. If you win the three-game series, you’ll likely open the postseason at home against these Padres. Lose the series, and you’ll likely open on in San Diego.\n\nSo, how do you play it?\n\nDo you go all-in and use top starters in Zac Gallen or Merrill Kelly, or do you make sure they’re fresh for the playoffs?\n\nDo you exercise caution or are you aggressive with the bullpen?\n\nJust how important is it to win the series and secure home-field advantage in the best-of-three wild-card round?\n\nThe New York Yankees will be facing a similar dilemma. How hard will they go this final week against Baltimore and Pittsburgh to assure they have home-field advantage throughout the American League playoffs, if not the World Series?\n\nIf you’re the Los Angeles Dodgers with a depleted starting rotation, how important is it to keep the foot on the gas to make sure you have a better record than the Philadelphia Phillies in case they meet in the NL championship series?\n\nWell, if these teams step inside their analytics room, they may discover they’re wasting their time and energy if they really believe home-field advantage is worth fighting for, except for providing a few extra bucks in their owners’ pockets.\n\n“If there’s anybody to tell you that home-field advantage is overrated, three-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer of the Texas Rangers tells USA TODAY Sports, “I’m your guy.\n\n“Really, it’s almost the opposite.\"\n\nTrust him.\n\nScherzer was on the 2019 Washington Nationals team that lost every home game during the World Series, and still won it all by winning four games against the Astros in Houston.\n\nScherzer was also on the Rangers team that lost all three games at home during the ALCS last year but won all four games in Houston to reach the World Series, with the Rangers winning their first championship by going a record 11-0 on the road.\n\n“Baseball is a team sport, but there’s a very individual component to it,\" Scherzer says. “You’re not relying on necessary communication on like other sports where crowd noise affects that. The field conditions are the same, too. Because of that, baseball is played the same way, whether you’re home or road.\n\n“So, this home-field advantage hasn’t made a bit of a difference in my experience.\"\n\nGo ahead, take a good hard look at the numbers yourselves.\n\nThe home team in last year’s postseason went 15-26 (.366), the worst of any postseason in 53 years, dating back to 1970 when there were only four teams in a postseason (4-7, .364).\n\nIn the last five full years, excluding the 2020 postseason when games were played at neutral sites, more series were won on the road (27) than at home (22).\n\nEven when the pressure is the greatest, and the stakes the highest, home teams were just 6-10 in winner-take-all games since 2018.\n\n“I can’t explain it,\" says Rangers manager Bruce Bochy, who has won four World Series titles in his career, never clinching at home. “We didn’t just lose, we got pummeled at home last year against the Astros. We go to their place and play lights out. I looked back and tried to make sense of it, but I couldn’t.\n\n“Last year wasn’t an advantage for any team.\"\n\nTimes are different now, negating home-field advantage in the postseason. It’s not like the days of the 1987 and 1991 World Series when the Minnesota Twins won every home game at the old Metrodome and lost every road game, leaving opposing managers like Whitey Herzog of the St. Louis Cardinals convinced the Twins were cheating by adjusting their air conditioning system.\n\nIt’s not like the days in Detroit when the infield grass was so thick that it slowed the ball down. Or the days of the cold, dark visiting clubhouse in Arlington, Texas, where you struggled trying to stay warm inside, and then felt like it was 140 degrees when you stepped outside. Or the chilly nights at old Candlestick Park in San Francisco where the Giants had portable space heaters for their dugout and the visiting team had to fend for itself.\n\nLife on the road is so comfortable nowadays that it can feel like a spa day.\n\n“The one thing about being on the road is that it’s just you,\" Bochy says. “There’s less distractions. You’re all in the same hotel together. You’re hunkering down as a group. So maybe that does play a role.\n\n“When you’re at home, you’re going your own way, and nobody sees each other until you get to the park.\"\n\nThe Diamondbacks, who have won more games on the road (44-35) than at home (42-33) this season, insist that winning home-field advantage is important to them. They even have a glossy postseason road resume, starting every series on the road last year and going 7-3 in Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Texas.\n\nStill, they’re not changing their minds.\n\n“You want home-field advantage,\" Diamondbacks first baseman Christian Walker says. “It’s not about scaring the visiting team or anything like that, it just makes you feel more comfortable. When we walked into Philly last year, we weren’t nervous or intimidated at all, but when we came home and had 48,000 people cheering for us, it gives you a little energy.\n\n“But really, just get in, and it really doesn’t matter where you play.\n\n“I think history has proven that.\"\n\nAgain and again.\n\n“I know it’s nice being at home,\" Scherzer says, “but speaking from personal experience, the road can be a beautiful place.\"\n\nNext level technology\n\nAre you tired of watching position players digging into their back pockets for cheat sheets? Sick of pitchers studying notecards underneath their caps before every pitch? Scream at the TV every time there’s a delay because the PitchCom device stops working?\n\nWell, three former college coaches say they have a solution. They’ve developed the “GoRout\" technology system that enables coaches to have instant communication with their players, transmitting everything from pitches to defensive positioning to hit-and-run plays.\n\nThis advanced technology, with players wearing a device similar to a smartwatch that visualizes everything, is being used by more than 2,000 football, baseball and softball teams at the collegiate and high school levels.\n\n“We obviously pay a lot of attention to what Major League Baseball is doing,\" GoRout founder Mike Rolih says, “and we think we provide a very unique and varying perspective on what the coach/player communication can be from a visual perspective versus just having an audio in the pitcher’s cap or the catcher’s ear.\n\n“Since it’s a smartwatch type of component, with our technology system, we’re not limited.\"\n\nRolih, a former collegiate football coach at Eastern Illinois, has brought in several former coaches into his company like Drew Robinson, a former assistant football coach at Rutgers, Syracuse and Western Michigan, along with Adam Boiurassa, a former scout with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Diego Padres. Together, they believe they can provide the next technological advancement that makes PitchCom look like a rotary telephone.\n\n“We know that when a catcher calls a fastball away, it’s just not a fastball away,’’ Rolih says, “there’s this whole other level of context that goes with it. There are adjustments to the middle infield, adjustments to the outfield, shading, and different things. So our technology allows coaches to not only send in what that pitch could be, but also send in all of the other scouting reports that’s pertinent to that pitch. We have the capability of having spray charts and live heat maps, displaying content live in real time.’’\n\nIt may be a long, long time before MLB ever permits realtime devices into the dugouts, still scarred by the Houston Astros scandal, but you get the idea.\n\n“We’re looking at communication differently than everybody else, understanding that it’s more than just your pitcher and catcher,\" Robinson said. “I’m a Yankee fan. I watch them every night and you constantly see them pull the cards out of their hats or their back pockets telling them where to shift and things. This system gives coaches and player the ability to send that communication digitally. You don’t need the paper cards and archaic communications.\"\n\nWill the system lead to more sign stealing and cheating in baseball?\n\n“It should mitigate that,\" said Bourassa, “because instead of signs coming from the dugout and the third-base coach’s box, you simply have to touch a button to communicate with the baserunner and the hitter. It removes the ability to steal those signs.\"\n\nWhile it could certainly lead to innovative teams trying to illegally tap into a cellular system, the GoRout executives say it would work similar to the NFL, which created a private cellular network in every NFL stadium.\n\nThe company, which has primarily worked with Division I baseball and softball teams, high school programs and travel teams, says it hopes to reach out to MLB officials one day. For now, it will keep receiving feedback, making adjustments, and updating the system to ensure it’s foolproof.\n\nWho knows, perhaps one day there’ll even come a time where you can watch an entire baseball game without cheat sheets or pitchers frantically signaling that their earpieces don’t work.\n\nCrazy, right?\n\nAround the bases\n\n≻ MLB and the Oakland A’s are beefing up stadium security for their final game at Oakland Coliseum on Thursday with players and staff instructed not to loiter on the field after the game in case of fan violence.\n\nManager Mark Kotsay, who had planned to thank the crowd after the game, was advised to instead retreat to the clubhouse, according to one of his peers.\n\n≻ If the San Francisco Giants dismiss Farhan Zaidi, president of baseball operations, at the season’s conclusion, look for them to reach out to former Miami Marlins GM Kim Ng and Minnesota Twins GM Thad Levine as potential replacements. The Giants have missed the postseason in all but two years since winning the 2014 World Series.\n\n≻ Marlins manager Skip Schumaker, who was widely praised for his decision not to pitch around Shohei Ohtani in his record-setting 50 homer-50 steal day last week, is expected to inform the Marlins that he is officially leaving after the season where he will become the hottest free agent manager in baseball.\n\n≻ Andrew Friedman, Dodgers president of baseball operations, put to rest the idea they would risk having Shohei Ohtani pitch in relief in the postseason\n\n“We aren’t even thinking about that right now,” Friedman told the Orange County Register. “This is like January for him. He’s just barely a year out from Tommy John. To me, he’s not really an option.”\n\n≻ While Giants minority owner Buster Posey met privately with third baseman Matt Chapman the day before signing his six-year, $151 million contract, it had little to do with contract negotiations but everything to do about answering Chapman’s questions about the future of the franchise.\n\nPosey assured him that the Giants plan to spend, and spend big, turning the organization around as quickly as possible.\n\nThe only contractual issues that were unresolved before Posey’s involvement was agreeing to give Chapman a complete no-trade clause and compromising on a $1 million signing bonus. Chapman was originally seeking a $2 million signing bonus since he had a $2 million buyout in his original three-year, $80 million deal with a buyout.\n\n≻ Billy Eppler, the former New York Mets GM who was suspended from MLB for fabricating injuries to place players on the IL to open roster spots, will officially be reinstated after the World Series.\n\nEppler, who was GM of the Angels when they landed Shohei Ohtani and has strong ties in Japan, could be a shrewd hire for a team making a run at Roki Sasaki, Japan’s most talented pitcher who has teams drooling.\n\n“He is a healthy Jacob deGrom,\" one executive said, “only better. He might have the best stuff I’ve ever seen.’’\n\nIt remains unknown whether Sasaki will leave Japan this winter or wait one more year.\n\n≻ Umm, that NL Most Valuable Player award debate sure ended quickly. Shohei Ohtani will run away and perhaps win his third unanimous MVP award.\n\n≻ While Pete Alonso of the Mets will be the highest-paid first baseman on the free agent market, club executives insist that Diamondbacks first baseman Christian Walker will draw much more interest at perhaps half the price. The Milwaukee Brewers are one of several teams that have interest if first baseman Rhys Hoskins opts out of his contract.\n\n≻ The Chicago White Sox quietly hired well-respected scout David Keller from the Mets to run their international scouting department. He will be one of GM Chris Getz’s top confidants.\n\n≻ The Boston Red Sox were willing to provide free agent starter Jordan Montgomery a four-year contract in the winter, but negotiations never materialized as Montgomery kept waiting on the Texas Rangers, where he badly wanted to return. He was left signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks where he’s expected to stay instead of opting out of a $22.5 million contract in 2025.\n\n≻ Minnesota Twins outfielder Manny Margot quietly broke an MLB record. He is now 0-for-30 as a pinch hitter this season.\n\n≻ How great is the Cleveland Guardians bullpen with sensational closer Emanuel Clase?\n\nThey have lost only two games when leading after six innings and will be a serious threat in the American League playoffs.\n\n≻ The Dodgers won’t pitch starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto on less than five days’ rest in the postseason, manager Dave Roberts says, meaning they will need four starters, even in the best-of-five series.\n\n≻ The Baltimore Orioles’ decision to give fading 36-year-old closer Craig Kimbrel a one-year, $13 million contract badly backfired when they dumped him before the start of the postseason. The Orioles had no choice but to release him after watching him implode since the All-Star break, yielding a 11.50 ERA, giving up 23 hits, 17 walks and five homers in his final 18 innings.\n\nKimbrel had a fabulous career but falls short of the Hall of Fame threshold, particularly considering his postseason woes.\n\n≻ Just how great of a season is Chris Sale having for Atlanta en route to his unanimous NL Cy Young award? He not only leads MLB in wins, ERA and strikeouts, but hasn’t permitted more than two earned runs in any his last 18 starts, dating to June 7.\n\nIt’s the longest single season stretch by a full-time starter since earned runs became an official statistic in 1913.\n\n≻ This could be the second time in the last 25 years that only two AL teams finish with 90 or more victories. The AL has had three or more teams win at least 90 games every year since 1998 with the exception of 2015 when the Kansas City Royals won 95 games (and the World Series) and the Toronto Blue Jays won 93 games.\n\n≻ It seems almost mathematically impossible, but Red Sox outfielder Tyler O’Neill somehow leads the team with 31 home runs but has only 61 RBI. He will join Felix Mantilla in 1964 (30 homers, 64 RBI) as the only Red Sox players to hit 30 or more homers and drive in fewer than 80 runs.\n\nO’Neill has hit 20 solo homers this year.\n\n≻ It’s hard to believe the AL Central will be the only division in baseball with three postseason teams, the first time it sent three teams to the postseason since the division was formed in 1994.\n\nThe division has produced only two World Series champions, however, the Chicago White Sox in 2005 and the Royals in 2015.\n\n≻ Red Sox third baseman Rafael Devers’ season ends in one of the worst slumps of his career, hitting just .188 with a .564 OPS in his last 30 games, failing to homer since Aug. 25.\n\n≻ Kudos to the Detroit Tigers players who refused to give up on each other when the front office gave up on them, dumping four players at the trade deadline, including Jack Flaherty, who has become the Dodgers’ ace.\n\nThose trade deadline moves could haunt them all winter.\n\nMeanwhile, the future is certainly bright for the Tigers. They owe a debt of gratitude to former GM Al Avila and his staff for drafting and signing much of the young talent.\n\n≻ If the Seattle Mariners are sitting home this winter, they can blame two of the strangest baserunning blunders you’ll ever seen on their downfall.\n\nMariners outfielder Victor Robles actually tried to steal home on a 3-0 count with the bases loaded on a pitcher in the first inning and was easily thrown out against the New York Yankees.\n\nAnd Mariners outfielder Julio Rodriguez tried to top the boneheaded move one night later by getting picked off third base with one out in the 10th inning. He was scrambling out of the way when Randy Arozarena’s bat slipped out of his hand toward him, but forgot the play was still live and was easily thrown out.\n\n“That’s one I’ve never seen,’’ Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, “and I don’t know if I’ll ever see it again.”\n\nThe two blunders will live forever in Mariners’ lore, failing to make the postseason for the 22nd time in 23 years.\n\n≻ Chicago Cubs manager Craig Counsell didn’t hold back letting everyone know that it wasn’t a fluke that the Brewers left the Cubs in the dust yet once again.\n\n“I think the message sent is that there’s a big gap,” Counsell told reporters. “They’re ahead of us by a lot. And it’s a talented team on and off the field. It’s a talented team, but there’s a big gap. And we’ve got room to make up. There’s no question about it. …\n\n“We’ve got to get better, man. …We’ve got a ways to go.”\n\nThe terrifying part for the Cubs?\n\nThe Brewers, who were devastated by injuries this season, should be even better in 2025.\n\n≻ San Diego Padres All-Star third baseman Manny Machado made his World Series prediction: Padres-Houston Astros.\n\n“We’re going to see them again,” Machado said after last week’s series.\n\nIf they do meet, it’s becoming likely that it will be without future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander on the postseason roster. He has yielded an 8.89 ERA in six starts since returning from the IL and conceded Friday that he may have returned too early from his neck injury.\n\n≻ Rangers starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi can vest a $20 million player option in his contract when he passed the 300-inning threshold the past two seasons, but considering his season, he’ll hit the free agent market.\n\n≻ The Chicago White Sox played just good enough on their road trip that they now are assured of breaking the all-time record of 120 losses in front of their own hometown fans this week. If the White Sox were a college football team, they’d be everyone’s homecoming game.\n\n≻ The Padres are so much more of a complete team than they were a year ago with their abundance of stars.\n\nWhen they were down in games last year, their team seemed to quit. When they are down this year, they fight back.\n\nThey are 10-1 in extra-inning games, compared to 2-12 of a year ago.\n\nThey are 31-22 in games in they’ve lost a lead, compared to 8-33 a year ago.\n\nThey are 22-18 in one-run games compared to 9-23 a year ago.\n\n“It’s just a hungry group that loves to play baseball,’’ Padres manager Mike Shildt says, “and loves to compete.”\n\n≻ The Philadelphia Phillies will have an interesting dilemma in the postseason. Do they start Cristopher Sanchez in Game 2 to ensure that the Phillies are home, or Game 3 on the road? In 16 home starts, Sanchez is yielding a 2.05 ERA with a 0.959 WHIP and 95 strikeouts in 105⅓ innings. In 14 starts on the road, he has a 5.02 ERA and a 1.661 WHIP, with 54 strikeouts in 71 ⅔ innings.\n\n≻ Remember the ridicule Astros GM Dana Brown took for trading away three prospects for struggling Blue Jays starter Yusei Kikuchi.\n\nIt turned out to be a stroke of genius, with the Astros winning all of Kikuchi’s nine starts. He is yielding a 3.00 ERA and a .189 opponent’s batting average, with 68 strikeouts in 54 innings.\n\n≻ Mets starter Sean Manaea is heading for a nice free agent payday. He has permitted three runs or fewer in 17 of his last 19 starts, pitching at least 6 ⅔ innings in 10 of his last 11 starts.\n\n≻ The Padres are starting to become concerned with closer Robert Suarez, who has surrendered a go-ahead or game-tying homers in three of his last six appearances and at least one run in eight of of his last 18 games, with a 5.40 ERA since Aug. 8.\n\n≻ Fabulous seeing Atlanta pitching coach Rick Kranitz return after being out since early July to deal with the health of a family member.\n\n≻ Congratulations to Dan Adair, Art Howe’s former teammate at the University of Wyoming, who became a commercial airline pilot while Howe went on to play 11 years and manage 14 years in the major leagues. Adair’s grandson, Billy Cook, hit his first big-league homer on Wednesday for the Pittsburgh Pirates and his second Saturday.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/cleveland-guardians/2024/07/16/mlb-all-star-game-score-2024-paul-skenes-cleveland-guardians-jose-ramirez-steven-kwan-josh-naylor/74413613007/", "title": "2024 MLB All-Star Game live score updates, full rosters, starters", "text": "The Guardians sent a large contingent to Arlington, Texas for the All-Star Game, and all five took the field Tuesday night, with three of the Cleveland players making an impact in the American League's 5-3 win.\n\nThird baseman Jose Ramirez, left fielder Steven Kwan, closer Emmanuel Clase, catcher David Fry and first baseman Josh Naylor represented Cleveland on the American League All-Star team. They each have played a big role in the Guardians entering the break with the AL's best record (in addition to being able to select Travis Bazzana with the No. 1 overall pick in the draft).\n\nRamirez and Kwan are in the starting lineup as voted upon by baseball fans, with Kwan leading off. Ramirez also took part in Monday's Home Run Derby. Kwan scored a run during the AL's three-run rally in the third, which Fry capped with an RBI single. Clase, the MLB saves leader since 2021, closed out the AL victory.\n\nHere's how the 2024 MLB All-Star Game unfolded through our updates.\n\nJarren Duran named All-Star Game MVP\n\nYoung Boston Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran was named the game's MVP following the 5-3 American League win, winning the award named in honor of Red Sox legend Ted Williams.\n\nDuran went 1-for-2, with the hit being his decisive two-run home run in the fifth inning to break a 3-3 tie.

Emmanuel Clase closes it out for the American League\n\nGuardians closer Emmanuel Clase finished it off for the American League in the ninth inning, striking out Bryan Reynolds to end it. It's Clase's second All-Star save, along with closing out the 2022 AL win.\n\nThe AL has beaten the NL 5-3. The AL has now won 10 of the past 11 All-Star Games.\n\nAll-Star Game live stats: Kirby Yates pitches a scoreless eighth inning\n\nThe American League could have had Kirby Yates try to close out the game in front his home crowd in Texas, but instead, he pitched the eighth inning, which has likely set up Emmanuel Clase to pitch the ninth.\n\nSo instead of watching their favorite reliever end the All-Star Game, Rangers fans might actually watch the elite closer that Texas gave up for one inning of Corey Kluber close it out.\n\nMLB All-Star jerseys are still bad\n\nSeriously, MLB, never again.\n\nAll-Star Game update: Freddie Freeman steps on Josh Naylor's ankle\n\nIt's everything a team doesn't want to see during an All-Star Game, but it appears as though everyone is OK.\n\nFreddie Freeman grounded to a ball to Josh Naylor in the sixth inning. Naylor threw to second to get the runner and then received the throw back to first base, but his foot missed first base. Freeman accidentally stepped on Naylor's ankle and was called out after a review.\n\nFreeman checked on Naylor, who appears to be fine.\n\nThe A.L. still leads 5-3.\n\nNaylor then swung at the first pitch he saw in the seventh inning and grounded out.\n\nAll-Star Game score: Jarren Duran drills home run to give American League the lead in the 5th inning\n\nThe AL is on top for the first time tonight.\n\nJarren Duran absolutely crushed a two-run home run off Hunter Greene, and the AL has taken a 5-3 lead in the fifth.\n\nDavid Fry followed with a popout to end the inning, making him 1-for-2 with an RBI tonight.\n\nAll-Star Game live stats: David Fry ties it with RBI single\n\n\"It's Fry Day\" now has an All-Star edition.\n\nDavid Fry checked into the game as a pinch-hitter to face Logan Webb, and he tied it up, 3-3, with an RBI single to left field to score Juan Soto.\n\nWebb then struck out Jose Ramirez, who is now 0-for-2 tonight, to end the inning.\n\nGuardians left fielder Steven Kwan drew a walk in his second All-Star at-bat, this one against Logan Webb in the third inning. He later came around to score on Juan Soto's two-run double that has cut the National League's lead to 3-2.\n\nWho's winning the All-Star Game? Shohei Ohtani crushes home run\n\nShohei Ohtani just obliterated a three-run home run off of Tanner Houck in the top of the third.
