But in a February executive order, Trump said the U.S. would establish a plan to resettle \"Afrikaners\" and their families as refugees in the United States.\n\nAfrikaners are mainly of Dutch descent. The Trump administration has accused the South African \"government-sponsored race-based discrimination\" and pledged to cut off all aid and assistance.\n\nThe dispute between the Trump administration and South Africa dates back to the president's first term. More recently, the country drew Trump's ire by signing a law that allows the South African government to seize property, in some cases with compensating the owner. Most of the country's land is owned by white South Africans, who make up a minority of the population. South Africa's government says its law is not aimed at any particular race.\n\nAlthough apartheid rule by the white minority ended with the country's first free and fair election in 1994, the typical Black South African household has just 5% of the wealth of the typical white household, according to a 2024 study.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, a group of 54 Afrikaners were due to depart from Johannesburg on Sunday. The Washington Post reported that a group of 60 Afrikaners would be arriving on a State Department plane on Monday to an airport just outside of Washington.\n\nThe State Department declined in an email to confirm the reports or say how many South Africans would be coming and when they would arrive.\n\nA spokesperson said in response to a request for comment that the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa had been conducting interviews and processing applications of individuals who have expressed interest in moving to the United States. The State Department said in its statement that it is prioritizing Afrikaners in South Africa who it views as victims of unjust racial discrimination.\n\nTrump's executive order: Trump stops South Africa aid over land act intended to address apartheid legacy\n\nTrump adviser and Telsa chief Elon Musk, who is from South Africa, has also been openly critical of the Expropriation Act. He met with South Africa's president to discuss it days before Trump signed a Feb. 7 executive order prioritizing Afrikaners for resettlement through the United States' refugee program.\n\n“To go a step further, any Farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship. This process will begin immediately!” Trump wrote on March 7.\n\nSouth Africa has responded forcefully. It accused the United States of \"entirely politically motivated\" actions in a May 9 statement that it said are \"designed to question\" the laws of a constitutional democracy that has worked since apartheid to prevent widespread discrimination.\n\nUnited States law defines refugees as individuals located outside of the country who can demonstrate they were persecuted, or have a fear persecution, due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. International refugee law lays out similar conditions.\n\nThe South African government argued in its statement that Trump's order does not meet that description.\n\n\"There are sufficient structures available within South Africa to address concerns of discrimination. Moreover, even if there are allegations of discrimination, it is our view that these do not meet the threshold of persecution required under domestic and international refugee law,\" the South African government said.\n\nIt said it will not it prevent its citizens from moving to the United States but has sought to vet the individuals leaving to make sure they do not have criminal charges pending against them.\n\nThe White House defended Trump's order at a May 9 briefing, where press secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the administration's stance that white South Africans are facing \"racial persecution\" through the land seizure law. Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller also said South African farmers were facing \"race-based persecution\" and told reporters that under the Trump administration, the U.S. would no longer be favoring refugees from poverty-stricken nations.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. admitted 60,050 people to the United States as refugees. The primarily came from the war-torn countries of Congo, Syria, and Afghanistan.\n\n(This article has been updated to include additional information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/13/mixed-market-response-us-china-deal-the-excerpt/83602017007/", "title": "Mixed market response after US-China deal | The Excerpt", "text": "On Tuesday’s episode of The Excerpt podcast: U.S. Stocks surged Monday after this week's US-China tariff deal.

Fluorescent lights were always on in the basement holding area. Space was so tight that he laid his sleeping mat next to a toilet.\n\nThe 36-year-old from El Salvador soon reunited with his wife and three sons, ages 6, 4 and 10 months, who were in another cell, and the family returned to Tijuana, Mexico, to await asylum hearings in San Diego. They were one of the first families to contend with a radical U.S. policy shift that makes asylum seekers stay in Mexico while their cases wind through immigration courts. Looking rattled hours later, Perla said he would skip his court date and instead settle in Mexico.\n\n\"Our fear is that we lose our case and get deported\" back to El Salvador, Perla said. \"That's suicide for me, my wife and my children.\"\n\nPerla told a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer that he and his family abandoned their small bakery in the Salvadoran capital after he missed a monthly extortion payment to the 18th Street gang. They beat him and threatened to kill him and his family if he failed to pay the next installment, according to an interview transcript.\n\nIf his family's experience is a sign, the policy may be having its intended effect of discouraging asylum claims, which have helped fuel a court backlog of more than 800,000 cases and forced people to wait years for a ruling. Trump administration officials say they want to deter weak claims, freeing up judges to consider more deserving cases.\n\nA federal judge in San Francisco has scheduled a March 22 hearing to consider a request by advocacy groups to halt the practice.\n\nChange is being introduced slowly — 240 people were returned to Tijuana from San Diego in the first six weeks. The administration expanded its \"Migrant Protection Protocols\" strategy on Monday to a second border crossing, in Calexico, California, and officials say the practice will grow along the entire border.\n\nThe shift comes as more asylum-seeking families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador arrive at the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nBorder Patrol agents in San Diego have been told to target people who speak Spanish and come from Latin America, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe memo says pregnant women and LGBT migrants are to be spared. The administration has said all along that Mexicans are exempt, as are children traveling alone.\n\nWaiting in Tijuana is an unanticipated setback for asylum seekers who had hoped to be released in the U.S. while awaiting a judge's ruling. In Mexico, they lack the family connections they have in the U.S, and some say they feel unsafe.\n\nSelvin Alvarado, his partner and their children from previous relationships stayed at a Tijuana shelter for about six weeks while waiting to be called on an informal list of asylum seekers seeking to enter the U.S. at the San Diego crossing. To earn money, Alvarado unloaded ceramic tiles from delivery trucks in Tijuana while his partner watched their boys, ages 10 and 7.\n\nAfter claiming asylum, Alvarado was separated from his family and put in an all-male cell with fluorescent lights that were always on and made him lose track of night and day. He told a CBP officer the next day that that he was \"afraid of paramilitary groups in Honduras\" and that he fled with his family after he discovered the head of his farming collective was stealing money and someone threatened to kill one of his children, according to an interview transcript.\n\nAlvarado, 29, who came with a police report and other documents explaining work-related threats, was sent back to Tijuana with his 10-year-old, while his wife and her son were released in the U.S. and settled with Alvarado's cousin in Houston. He says he cannot work in Tijuana because he has no one to care for his son.\n\nMany immigrants' struggles are compounded by the scarcity of legal advice. Customs officials offer a list of potential legal aid providers, but Alvarado said his calls to those groups elicited no response. Al Otro Lado, a Los Angeles-based legal group working out of a building in downtown Tijuana, gave him an overview of U.S. asylum procedures but no individual advice.\n\nFor immigration attorneys, it can be difficult to extend help to people who are on the other side of the border.\n\nThe American Bar Association's Immigration Justice Project of San Diego cannot afford to go to Tijuana and will not pursue grants without insurance and license to practice in Mexico, said Adela Mason, the group's director.\n\nCatholic Charities of the San Diego Diocese had to overcome worries about safety and not having license.\n\n\"It's a fine line between going down there and providing assistance in a way that is legal but not practicing law in Mexico,\" said Nadine Toppozada, the group's director of refugee and immigrant services.\n\nInitial asylum hearings in downtown San Diego are scheduled within 45 days, and administration officials hope to put them on a fast track. When their day arrives, asylum seekers are told to report to the border crossing for temporary admission to the U.S. for a bus ride to court.\n\nDr. Juan Ramon Molina, a primary care physician in Honduras' Nacaome Valley, told a CBP officer that government forces twice tried to kidnap him for his role in an opposition political party and that he did not seek asylum in Guatemala or Mexico because he has family in the U.S. They are in Los Angeles. Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Miami and West Virginia.\n\nMolina, 35, has been looking online for legal help at a Tijuana migrant shelter ahead of his April 8 court date and says he fears that his political adversaries will track him down. Still, he says it is better than being detained in the U.S., where he spent two days in a basement cell at the San Diego crossing that he said was overcrowded and cold.\n\n\"The treatment was inhumane,\" he said.\n\nBefore he gave up and returned to Mexico, Perla had arranged for a pastor in Berkeley, California, to give him a room, find legal advice and arrange schooling for his children. In Tijuana, his family is living in a tent inside a migrant shelter.\n\n\"My case is a lost cause,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The troops stayed in Czechoslovakia for over two decades, with the last leaving in 1991.

Wexler/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network In pictures: The world rallies in support of Ukraine Prev Next\n\nTensions between the two countries had been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/25/afghanistan-news-evacuations-hit-88-k-week-until-withdrawal-deadline/5583587001/", "title": "Afghanistan live updates: State Department issues travel advisory", "text": "Afghanistan updates: State Department issues travel advisory to Americans at Kabul airport\n\nThe U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs tweeted out a warning late Wednesday for U.S. citizens at Kabul airport gates, advising people to \"leave immediately.\"\n\nThe warning comes the same day that Secretary of State Antony Blinken said as many as 1,500 Americans may still be in Afghanistan, as the deadline for U.S. withdrawal looms.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the White House said about 19,000 people were evacuated from Afghanistan by U.S. and allied military forces on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Tuesday that the U.S. is on track to evacuate all American and allied citizens, as well as Afghans eligible for special immigrant visas or otherwise at risk of persecution by the Taliban, out of the country by Aug. 31.\n\n“The sooner we can finish, the better. Each day of operations brings added risk to our troops,” the president said.\n\nTo meet the Aug. 31 deadline, U.S. military forces will need to stop evacuating people out of the airport days before their final troop withdrawal, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Tuesday. That means the window for evacuating refugees and others is even closer than the official end of American presence on the ground.\n\n'They should say yes': Advocates see hope in GOP governors offering Afghan refugees aid\n\nState Department warns US citizens at Kabul airport\n\nThe U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs warned Americans at three gates of the chaotic Kabul airport to \"leave immediately.\"\n\nThe full tweet, sent around 7 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday, read:\n\n\"#Afghanistan: Due to threats outside the Kabul airport, US citizens should avoid traveling to the airport and avoid airport gates unless you receive instructions to do so. Those at the Abbey Gate, East Gate, or North Gate now should leave immediately,\" the tweet read.\n\nThe tweet included a link to a larger alert.\n\nAustralia offered similar advice to its citizens, with an alert reading: \"Do not travel to Kabul airport. If you're in the area of the airport, move to a safe location and await further advice.\"\n\nThe alert comes as the Biden administration has increasingly warned about the threat of an ISIS-K terrorist attack at the Kabul airport as the Aug. 31 U.S. deadline to withdraw draws near.\n\n\"We're operating in a hostile environment in a city and country now controlled by the Taliban, with the very real possibility of an ISIS-K attack,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday afternoon. \"We're taking every precaution, but this is very high risk.”\n\n--Luciana Lopez and Joey Garrison\n\nAid groups: People still being blocked from the airport\n\nU.S.-based organizations, speaking on background to discuss sensitive matters, cite accounts from witnesses on the ground in Afghanistan as saying some American citizens, and family members of Afghans with green cards, still were having trouble pushing and talking their way into the Kabul airport for flights.\n\n“We still have 1,200 Afghans with visas that are outside the airport and haven’t got in,” said James Miervaldis with No One Left Behind, one of dozens of veterans groups working to get out Afghans who worked with the U.S. military during America’s nearly 20 years of combat in the country.. “We’re waiting to hear from the US. government and haven’t heard yet.”\n\nMarina LeGree of Ascend, a U.S.-based nonprofit that worked to develop fitness and leadership in Afghan girls and young women, described getting calls from U.S. officials telling the group’s interns and staffers to go to the airport for evacuation flights, only to have them turned away by American forces keeping gates closed against the throngs outside.\n\n--The Associated Press\n\nReport: Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, offers $6,500-a-seat flights from Afghanistan\n\nMichigan-born military contractor and former Navy SEAL Erik Prince is offering chartered flights out of Afghanistan at $6,500 a seat, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.\n\nPrince, who is the brother of former U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and grew up in west Michigan, told the Journal it would cost more if people needed his aid in getting out of their homes and to the airport with the Taliban in control of the country.\n\nThe article, which described the scramble underway by both American forces and private rescue operations to evacuate Afghans, U.S. citizens and others ahead of an Aug. 31 withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country, said it was unclear whether Prince — who founded the military security firm formerly known as Blackwater — was capable of carrying out such rescue missions and flights.\n\n--Todd Spangler\n\nRand Paul: U.S. should have left Afghanistan earlier\n\nSpeaking during an \"agriculture roundtable\" with constituents at the Nelson Country Farm Bureau in Bardstown on Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that the U.S. should have left Afghanistan earlier and called the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal after 20 years of war \"incompetent.\"\n\nWhen asked by an attendee how many Americans remain in Afghanistan as evacuations continue amid the withdrawal of U.S. troops and what Kentuckians can do to help, Paul said his main concern is with the fate of military equipment he believes could fall into the wrong hands.\n\n\"To me, what's probably the most disturbing is that there's like thousands of Humvees being left behind, dozens if not hundreds of tanks,\" he said. \"Even at this point, when (the withdrawal) is a complete disaster, I'd still blow up all that stuff.\"\n\nHe added that he believes many of the Afghan people who are trying to leave the country now under the control of the Taliban should stay and try to improve conditions there.\n\n--Mary Ramsey\n\nAustin to host nearly 200 Afghan refugees by end of September in largest intake across Texas\n\nAustin is expected to welcome nearly 200 Afghan refugees by Sept. 30, according to officials with Refugee Services of Texas.\n\nRefugee Services of Texas announced last week that it expected to resettle more than 300 Afghans in the next few weeks across Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and Amarillo. That number has now increased to 574.\n\nAt least 30,000 Afghans might be resettled in the United States in the coming weeks, and many will be temporarily housed at Fort Bliss in El Paso, officials previously reported.\n\n--Luz Moreno-Lozano\n\nGeneral says 7,000-plus evacuees flown to Europe\n\nWASHINGTON — The head of the U.S. military’s European Command says that so far more than 7,000 evacuees from Afghanistan have been flown to eight locations around Europe, mainly in Germany and Italy.\n\nGen. Tod Wolters said Wednesday that 55 evacuation flights from Afghanistan have flown into Ramstein Air Base in Germany and three into Naval Air Station Sigonella in Italy. He says the flights brought nearly 5,800 evacuees from Kabul to Ramstein and 662 to Sigonella.\n\nSmaller numbers of flights and people have gone to six other European locations, largely bases in Germany. Flights will soon be going into the base at Rota, Spain.\n\nWolters says there have been few medical or security problems. He says fewer than 100 individuals have needed additional medical screening, and of those fewer than 25 needed medical attention at the military hospital. More than half of them have already returned to Ramstein for further processing and travel onward to more permanent destinations.\n\n--The Associated Press\n\nCalifornia students, families stuck in Afghanistan as Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline nears\n\nEL CAJON, Calif. (AP) — A school district in a San Diego suburb that is home to a large refugee population said many of its families who had taken summer trips to Afghanistan to see relatives have gotten stuck there with the chaos following the withdrawal of U.S. troops.\n\nThe Cajon Valley Union School District said the families of 24 students from various schools had reported they would not able to start the school year on Aug. 17 because the children and their parents were unable to get through the throngs of people at the Kabul airport. Thousands have been converging on the airport, desperate to escape since the Taliban seized control of the country. The district is in the suburb of El Cajon, east of San Diego.\n\nThe families had traveled separately to Afghanistan for summer vacations to see their grandparents, cousins and other relatives. Most of the families came to the United States on a special immigrant visa after having worked for the U.S. government or U.S. military in Afghanistan, officials said. The visa allows in only the person and their spouse and children.\n\nRead the rest of the story here: California students, families stuck in Afghanistan as Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline nears\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nWomen in a changed Kabul\n\nThe beating began shortly after the American flag was lowered at the U.S. embassy in Kabul.\n\nTaliban fighters tracked down a women’s rights activist and politician in Afghanistan. They covered her face and bound her hands, she recalled, as they ripped her from her home.\n\nWhen it was over, blood streaked down her forehead and over her eyes, matting her hair as it gushed from the fresh wound on her scalp.\n\nThen came the second beating. After it was over, she was dropped near the airport in Kabul and given an ultimatum, she said: Leave or be killed if the Taliban found her again.\n\nThe activist – who recounted her story on Wednesday to USA TODAY – is among millions of women facing an uncertain future in Afghanistan, where the backdrop of the Taliban’s history of oppressive and violent treatment of women looms darkly against the organization’s promises to respect their rights as it regains control of the country.\n\nEvacuations in Afghanistan: What to know\n\nSince the Taliban seized the Afghan capital on Aug. 14, more than 82,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan in one of the largest U.S. airlifts in history. While the pace has picked up in recent days, it’s still a chaotic scramble as people seek to escape. Afghans trying to reach the Kabul airport face a gauntlet of danger, and there are far more who want to leave than will be able to do so.\n\nThose who do make it out will face the many challenges of resettlement, either in the U.S. or somewhere else. And time is running out. President Joe Biden set an Aug. 31 deadline to complete the U.S.-led evacuation.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 as part of an effort to end what he called the “endless wars” in the Middle East. He agreed to a May 1 deadline to have all troops out of the country. Biden, who says he no longer wants to risk American lives in a civil war among Afghans, kept with the withdrawal plan but extended the deadline to September. The Taliban quickly seized control of most of the country as the U.S. withdrew air support to the Afghan military. Afghans, fearing retribution and the harsh rule of the Taliban, rushed to the airport in hopes of getting out of the country.\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nBlinken: At least 500 U.S. citizens still in Afghanistan want to leave\n\nAbout 1,500 Americans remain in Afghanistan, and the U.S. is in contact with 500 of them who want to leave, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday, less than one week before the U.S. deadline to withdraw from the country.\n\nYet even after the military exits Aug. 31, the Biden administration says it will not end its mission to evacuate Americans out of the country.\n\nBlinken said the U.S. has evacuated 4,500 U.S. passport holders since Aug. 14 out of 6,000 Americans the State Department believes were in Afghanistan at that time. He said the department is “aggressively reaching out” to the other 1,000 Americans in Afghanistan but said many of them may not want to leave.\n\nOf that group, Blinken said the number actively seeking assistance to leave Afghanistan is “likely significant lower.”\n\n\"Since Aug. 14, we've reached out directly to every American enrolled with us in Afghanistan, often multiple times,” Blinken said.\n\nHe added that the State Department is working on how to facilitate departures for Americans in Afghanistan who wish to leave after Aug. 31.\n\n\"Those who want to leave, it does not end with the military evacuation plan on Aug. 31. We are very focused on what we need to do to facilitate the further departure of people who wish to leave Afghanistan. That is primarily going to be a diplomatic effort,\" he said.\n\nThe Biden administration had previously declined to estimate the number of Americans still in Afghanistan because of registration discrepancies at the U.S. embassy when Americans arrived in the country or left.\n\nBlinken said said 82,300 people – a combination of Americans and Afghan allies – have safely departed Afghanistan since the U.S. and coalition forces began the evacuation. That includes 19,000 in the last 24 hours. More than 10,000 people are currently at the Kabul airport awaiting departure, according to the Pentagon.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Tuesday the U.S. is on pace to meet its Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline but said the state and defense departments have back-up contingency plans in case the Taliban does not cooperate with evacuations.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWorld Bank cuts off funding for programs in Afghanistan\n\nWASHINGTON – The World Bank is suspending funding for programs in Afghanistan amid concerns over the Taliban’s return to power.\n\n“We are deeply concerned about the situation in Afghanistan and the impact on the country’s development prospects, especially for women,” a World Bank spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Washington-based financial institution, which provides loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income countries, has committed $5.3 billion for development and emergency reconstruction projects in Afghanistan since 2002. The support includes more than $4.8 billion in grants and $436 million in no-interest loans.\n\nThe decision to withhold the funding follows the Biden administration’s move last week to block the Taliban’s access to billions of dollars in assets Afghanistan’s central bank holds in the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banks. Barring access to those assets deprives the Taliban of crucial financial resources as it tries to establish a new government.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund also announced last week it was cutting off Afghanistan’s access to emergency currency reserves, citing a “lack of clarity” within the international community concerning recognition of a government in Afghanistan.\n\nThe World Bank said it is closely monitoring events in Afghanistan and will continue to consult closely with the international community and its development partners.\n\n“Together with our partners, we are exploring ways we can remain engaged to preserve hard-won development gains and continue to support the people of Afghanistan,” the spokesperson said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nPentagon: 20 Americans rescued as evacuation effort continues\n\nPentagon officials further detailed evacuation efforts on Wednesday. About 19,000 people were evacuated from Afghanistan in the last 24 hours by U.S. and allied military aircraft and charter flights, they said.\n\nThere were about 4,400 American citizens on those flights, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. Kirby did not have an estimate on the number of Americans who remain in Afghanistan before the end of evacuation flights, scheduled for Aug. 31.\n\nOvernight, U.S. troops mounted an operation to rescue U.S. citizens and bring them to the airport, said Army Maj. Gen. William Taylor, director of regional operations for the Joint Staff. About 20 Americans were retrieved by helicopter, the third such rescue since the evacuation began, Kirby said.\n\nThe unscheduled visit by two congressmen required U.S. forces to take time away from their duties in order to protect the lawmakers, Kirby said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUganda takes 51 Afghans at request of US\n\nKAMPALA, Uganda – Uganda's government said that 51 people evacuated from Afghanistan arrived in the East African country Wednesday at the request of the United States.\n\nAuthorities said in a statement that the group, transported on a chartered flight, included men, women and children.\n\nUgandan officials said last week that the country would shelter up to 2,000 people fleeing the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. They said the Afghans would be brought to Uganda in small groups as a temporary arrangement before being relocated elsewhere.\n\n“The decision to host those in need is informed by the government of Uganda's consistent policy of receiving refugees and persons in distress as well as playing a responsible role in matters of international concern,\" the statement said.\n\nUgandan officials have repeatedly said the United States would pay the cost of caring for people evacuated from Afghanistan, and groups such as Mercy Corps are offering to help.\n\nThe U.S.-based humanitarian group said it would support Ugandan authorities “to respond to the most immediate needs” of the evacuees.\n\nUganda has long been an ally of the U.S., especially on security matters in the region.\n\nBut some activists and opponents of President Yoweri Museveni, who was reelected in January, say the U.S. arrangement with Uganda is problematic because it appears blind to allegations of rights abuses and bad governance in a country that has never had a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nPelosi admonishes Moulton, Meijer over Kabul trip\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi rebuked two congressmen who said Tuesday they had gone to Kabul on a secret trip to examine the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n\"There's a real concern about members being in the region ... The resources necessary to facilitate their visit, and to protect them, was an opportunity cost of what we needed to do to be evacuating as many people as possible. So it's not just about them going to Afghanistan, going to the region because there's a call on our resources diplomatically, politically, militarily in the rest of the region as well. So this is deadly serious,\" she said at a Wednesday morning press conference.\n\n\"We do not want members to go... It was not in my view a good idea (for the two members to go).\"\n\nPelosi added that she'd not spoken with Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., and Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich.\n\nOn Tuesday, the speaker issued a letter to her House colleagues, addressing travel to Afghanistan.\n\n\"Given the urgency of this situation, the desire of some Members to travel to Afghanistan and the surrounding areas is understandable and reflective of the high priority that we place on the lives of those on the ground,\" Pelosi wrote. \"However, I write to reiterate that the Departments of Defense and State have requested that Members not travel to Afghanistan and the region during this time of danger.\"\n\nShe noted that briefings and calls would continue to be organized to keep members informed.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nCongressmen visit Afghanistan\n\nAmid the efforts to evacuate Americans and allies, two congressmen are drawing criticism for their unannounced visit to the Kabul airport.\n\nOfficials said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., and Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., flew in on a charter aircraft and were on the ground at the Kabul airport for several hours.\n\n“As Members of Congress, we have a duty to provide oversight on the executive branch,’” the two said in their statement. “We conducted this visit in secret, speaking about it only after our departure, to minimize the risk and disruption to the people on the ground, and because we were there to gather information, not to grandstand.”\n\nHow many American citizens are in Afghanistan?\n\nPresident Joe Biden said on Tuesday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to give an update on Afghanistan on Wednesday. That briefing should include a number on how many U.S. citizens remain in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Biden administration has not yet offered a firm count. On Thursday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told \"CBS Evening News\" that the US doesn't have an accurate number because of how citizens are tracked while in Afghanistan.\n\nUpdated evacuation numbers\n\nThe latest round of evacuations brings the number of people ferried from Hamid Karzai International Airport to 82,300 people since Aug. 14, when the Taliban first took control of Kabul, the capital city, and 87,900 evacuated people since late July, the White House said.\n\nThe operation Tuesday involved 42 U.S. military flights that carried around 11,200 people out of the country collectively alongside another 48 flights from U.S. coalition allies that took around 7,800 people out of Kabul.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly stressed that the withdrawal operation is on pace to be the largest U.S. air evacuation in history. \"There is no other country in the world who could pull something like this off, bar none,” National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a Monday press briefing.\n\nYet the administration has also face fierce bipartisan criticism from the members of Congress and the national security community, who see the chaotic scenes of withdrawal as calamitous and avoidable. It is also unclear how many Americans and eligible Afghans remain in the country.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nChina builds ties with Taliban\n\nBEIJING — China says it has established an “open and effective communication and consultation with the Afghan Taliban,” following a meeting between representatives of the group and Beijing’s ambassador to Kabul.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin gave no details about the Tuesday meeting between the deputy head of the Taliban’s political office, Abdul Salam Hanafi and Ambassador Wang Yu.\n\nBut he said China considered Kabul to be an “important platform and channel for both sides to discuss important matters of all kinds.”\n\nChina hosted a delegation led by senior Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar for talks last month, prior to the group’s lightning sweep to power in Kabul.\n\nChina has kept its embassy in the city open and says it has no plans for a wholesale evacuation of its citizens in Afghanistan, while relentlessly criticizing the U.S. over the chaotic scenes at Kabul airport.\n\n“We have always respected Afghanistan’s sovereign independence and territorial integrity, pursued a policy of non-interference in Afghanistan’s internal affairs and adhered to a policy of friendship toward the entire Afghan people,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing Wednesday in Beijing.\n\n“China respects the Afghan people’s independent decision on their own future and destiny, supports the implementation of the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned principle, and stands ready to continue to develop good-neighborly relations of friendship and cooperation with Afghanistan and play a constructive role in the peace and reconstruction of the country,” Wang said.\n\n– Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2025/05/07/rides-with-border-patrol-show-how-quiet-the-arizona-border-is-now/83334228007/", "title": "Arizona border, once the busiest in the nation for illegal immigration ...", "text": "YUMA — Brent Smart buckled into the cockpit of an A-Star four-seater helicopter, pulled a green pilot's helmet over his head and prepared for takeoff.\n\nA former U.S. Army Black Hawk pilot, Smart has flown helicopters for the Yuma branch of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations for 16 years.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/uk/uk-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-intl-gbr", "title": "Rishi Sunak pledges to fix Truss' 'mistakes' after becoming third UK ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nRishi Sunak officially became Britain’s third prime minister in seven weeks on Tuesday, acknowledging that “mistakes were made” by his predecessor as he sought to bring stability to the UK after months of political and economic turmoil.\n\nHe was appointed by King Charles III at Buckingham Palace in London shortly after Liz Truss tendered her resignation to the monarch following a shambolic 50-day tenure which shook Britain’s economy to its core.\n\nSunak becomes the first person of color and the first Hindu to lead Britain after winning a fast-tracked Conservative Party leadership contest on Monday. At 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nAfter being invited to form a government by the King, Sunak returned to Downing Street where he made a speech aimed at alleviating some of the concerns of the public and laying out aspects of what his premiership will look like.\n\nIn his first speech as Britain’s new prime minister, Sunak said the nation was in “profound economic crisis,” before paying tribute to Truss.\n\n“I admired her restlessness to create change. But some mistakes were made. Not borne of ill will or bad intentions. Quite the opposite in fact, but mistakes nonetheless,” he said. “And I have been elected as leader of my party, and your prime minister in part, to fix them. And that work begins immediately.”\n\nKing Charles III appointed Sunak as prime minister and invited him to form a new government on Tuesday. Aaron Chown/AP\n\nSunak highlighted his experience as finance minister during the pandemic to illustrate how he intends to tackle the challenges ahead.\n\n“You saw me during Covid doing everything I could to protect people and businesses, with schemes like furlough. There are always limits, more so now than ever. But I promise you this: I will bring that same compassion to the challenges we face today,” he said.\n\n“The government that I lead will not leave the next generation – your children and grandchildren – with a debt to settle that we were too weak to pay ourselves. I will unite our country, not with words but with action.”\n\nSunak added: “I will work day in and day out to deliver for you. This government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level.”\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Truss delivered her outgoing speech at the Downing Street podium before making the short car journey to Buckingham Palace.\n\nDespite a disastrous tenure which saw her become Britain’s shortest serving prime minister in history, Truss appeared full of confidence and smiling, as she called her time in office a “huge honor,” later adding that “brighter days lie ahead.”\n\n“We simply cannot afford to be a low growth country where the government takes up an increasing share of our national wealth, and where there are huge divides between different parts of our country,” Truss said on the economy. “We need to take advantage of our Brexit freedoms to do things differently. This means delivering more freedom for our own citizens and restoring power to democratic institutions.”\n\nTruss concluded by wishing Sunak “every success for the good of our country.”\n\nRishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after he became British prime minister in October 2022.

Claudia Greco/Reuters In pictures: Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nTuesday afternoon saw Sunak begin to form his new cabinet, bringing back lawmaker Dominic Raab as deputy prime minister, justice secretary and lord chancellor, and keeping Jeremy Hunt in the role of UK finance minister.\n\nHunt was appointed as chancellor earlier this month after Truss sacked his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng. Hunt subsequently reverted most of Kwarteng’s main policies proposed in September’s controversial “mini-budget.”\n\nSunak brought Suella Braverman back as Home Secretary, a role she resigned from last week under Truss’s government, hastening the end of the former Prime Minister’s term. James Cleverly and Ben Wallace will remain in their roles of Britain’s foreign secretary and defence secretary, respectively.\n\nChallenges ahead for new PM\n\nTuesday’s developments are a stunning turnaround for the man whose resignation as finance minister was instrumental in bringing down Boris Johnson’s government earlier this year, but then lost the summer leadership race. At that point, it appeared Sunak’s ambitions for the highest political role in the country were over.\n\nAnd yet, when Truss’ premiership imploded last week, Sunak quickly became a frontrunner to take over the party once more. Now in the top job, he faces an overflowing in-tray of challenges to steer the country out of crisis.\n\nHis own party is divided and has lost ground to the opposition Labour party in opinion polls following four months of political mayhem and financial market chaos. At the same time, Britain is facing major economic crisis, with many economists believing it is already in recession.\n\nHe is already under intense fire from opposition politicians, who are calling for a general election.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer congratulated Sunak on becoming the first British-Asian prime minister on Tuesday, but reiterated calls for a public vote.\n\n“The Tories have crashed the economy, with low wages, high prices and a cost of living crisis. The public needs a fresh start and a say on Britain’s future,” Starmer said.\n\nSunak, like Truss, has not had to win a general election to become prime minister because the Conservatives are still the largest party in the House of Commons, therefore their leader automatically becomes prime minister.\n\nIt’s not unusual for a prime minister to come into office without an election – four of the last five British prime ministers first entered the role without a general election. But the fact that Sunak is the UK’s third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 and the second to come into power without a public vote adds to the pressure.\n\nAccording to the law, the next general election must happen no later than in January 2025. With Labour way ahead in opinion polls, it is very unlikely he will take that step.\n\nSunak is under no obligation to call a vote and appeared to rule out the possibility in his Downing Street address when he said that he’d “always be grateful to Boris Johnson for his incredible achievements.”\n\nHe added: “I know he would agree that the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual. It is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us.”\n\nJohnson later offered his congratulations to the new prime minister in a post on Twitter, calling his appointment a “historic day.”\n\n“This is the moment for every Conservative to give our new PM their full and wholehearted support,” Johnson said.", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Ivana Kottasová", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/28/trump-mexico-border-policy-adopted-biden/6128327001/", "title": "Trump Mexico border policy adopted by Biden could put migrants at ...", "text": "NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico – Oscar Aviles Ochoa, 32, fled Michoacan, Mexico, in August with his wife, Brenda Figueroa, 26, and their two sons, José, 3, and Jesus, 1, after men brandishing long rifles showed up at the avocado farm where he worked and tried to extort money from him and threatened to kill him.

Censori, who arrived alongside her husband Ye, the rapper previously known as Kanye West, caught a large degree of backlash for the fashion choice, with many categorizing it as a sexist stunt.\n\nHalle Berry's cutout dress at the Met Gala had the internet up in arms. Why?\n\nBerry, for one, is not opposed to the nudity ban.\n\n\"I'm not going to break the rules,\" she said of her outfit change. \"The nudity part is also probably a good rule.\" Her comments come in the wake of a mini-outcry over her recent Met Gala look, which featured highly revealing cutouts in her LaQuan Smith gown.

If you want to attend Cannes this year, you're going to have to wear clothes.\n\nThe illustrious Cannes Film Festival, which kicks off May 13 in France, has released its dress code for this year − including an explicit instruction not to wear anything, well, explicit.\n\n\"For decency reasons, nudity is prohibited on the Red Carpet, as well as in any other area of the Festival,\" the festival's website reads.\n\nThe stipulation may come as a disappointment to some celebrities, especially those who've made waves recently for ultra-revealing red carpet fashion, like Censori, who hit the Grammys' red carpet in January with her husband Ye, formerly Kanye West, in an entirely see-through dress that pretty much exposed her entire naked body to photographers and anybody else nearby.\n\nWhat health & wellness means for you:Sign up for USA TODAY's Keeping It Together newsletter\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFashion and sociology experts previously told USA TODAY the red carpet trend of nudity for nudity's sake speaks a lot to gender, agency and power in our culture. The fact it seems to have reached its extreme in Censori and Ye, however, may signal the trend is finally about to die − and that a new one could be on the horizon.\n\n\"The only thing you can count on in fashion is that what goes up must come down,\" Lorynn Divita, a professor of apparel design and merchandising and the author of the book \"Fashion Forecasting,\" previously told USA TODAY. \"Eventually, people will get tired and the cycle will change.\"\n\nIs the Cannes dress code a signal of that change?\n\nThe significance of red carpet nudity\n\nNudity is a fraught topic, and it often means different things to different people. To some, it's a symbol of sexual empowerment and liberation. To others, a symbol of degradation and objectification.\n\nFashion and sociology experts previously told USA TODAY that, when examining the significance of any bold fashion statement, context is key − and with nudity it's no different.\n\nFor instance, remember when Rose McGowan wore a see-through dress to the MTV Video Music Awards in 1998? One of the first major advocates of the Hollywood #MeToo movement, McGowan said she went with the nearly naked look to reclaim a sense of agency over her body after she was assaulted by disgraced film producer, and now-convicted sex offender, Harvey Weinstein.\n\n“It was my first big public appearance after being sexually assaulted,\" she told Yahoo! Entertainment years later. \"It was like at the end of 'Gladiator' when he comes out and he's like, ‘Are you not entertained?’ And if you look at me, I did it with power. I didn't do it with my hand on my hip to be sexy.\"\n\nShe got a lot of flak for it at the time, but McGowan said her critics missed the point. Some of her supporters have too: \"Most of the women that have done homages or dressed kind of like that on the red carpet, it's a calculated, sexy move to turn people on. Mine was like, 'I’m gonna (mess) with your brain.'\"\n\nYe and Censori, however, likely had different intentions. Shira Tarrant, a women’s, gender and sexuality studies professor and the author of \"The Pornography Industry: What Everyone Needs to Know,\" previously told USA TODAY that the image of a naked Censori next to a full-clothed Ye was likely meant to signal the rapper's power over her.\n\nNot only did it show Ye's power over Censori, Tarrant added − it also showed his power over you, the viewer. After all, no one on the Grammys red carpet consented to seeing Censori naked when she decided to drop her coat. Neither did anyone who opened social media that week, only to be bombarded with images of the moment.\n\nThe Cannes dress code and why the nudity trend may be dying\n\nIf you're sick of seeing nude or nearly nude looks at major fashion events, the Cannes announcement is a signal that nudity for nudity's sake could be on its way out.\n\nFor decades, it seems clothing in American pop culture has grown more and more revealing − to the point where the last thing left to do that's shocking is appear naked.\n\nWith nowhere left to turn, fashion might finally need to find a new trend, something Divita calls \"the pendulum of fashion.\" It's one of the only things you can count on in an otherwise fickle and unpredictable industry − that, once a trend gets exhausted, it means its opposite is probably on the horizon.\n\nThis isn't just happening on red carpets either; club attire is changing too. On TikTok, a new Gen Z fashion trend has taken hold: wearing long, flowing dresses− dubbed \"milkmaid dresses\" − out clubbing. Kendall Jenner even seems to have gotten in on it, turning heads in one of these types of dresses at Weekend 1 of Coachella.\n\n\"We have gotten to a point with clubwear that we are so used to tight, revealing clothing that we're fatigued of it,\" Divita previously told USA TODAY. \"We've seen it. We've been there. We've done that.\"\n\nThe same thing also happened with skinny jeans, Divita said: They kept getting skinner and skinner until, seemingly all of a sudden, flared and baggy pants were back in.\n\nDoes Cannes banning nudity now mean that trend is over too?\n\n\"The one thing that we can always know is that nothing in fashion lasts forever,\" Divita said. \"It's always in flux.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/04/11/netflix-pulls-all-films-cannes-film-festival-escalating-dispute-over-treatment/508237002/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatoday-newstopstories", "title": "Netflix pulls all films from Cannes Film Festival in escalating dispute ..."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/05/12/cannes-film-festival-selfies-ban/27060309/", "title": "Selfies under attack at Cannes 2015", "text": "Bryan Alexander\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCANNES, France — The Cannes Film Festival is aiming to go anti-Kardashian.\n\nOrganizers for the international film festival, which kicks off Wednesday in France, are seeking to cut down on time-wasting, self-obsessive snaps during the long walk to the famed Palais for nightly premieres.\n\nFestival director Thierry Frémaux put a shot across the Selfie Nation bow by decrying the practice on the glamorous Cannes red carpet, calling the photos \"ridiculous and grotesque.\"\n\n\"You never look as ugly as you do in a selfie,\" Fremaux told the media during an April press conference announcing the 2015 festival film lineup.\n\nFestival attendees, and even some of the film stars themselves, do slow down the red carpet entrance with selfie-taking.\n\nNeed a break?

Slamming the decision, Sarandos pulled all of his films from the schedule.\n\nSuch jockeying left films like Solo, Spike Lee’s political dramedy BlacKkKlansman, Lars von Trier’s fetishized murder flick The House That Jack Built and David Robert Mitchell’s trippy Under the Silver Lake as the festival’s marquee Hollywood-infused events.\n\nHot international titles included French director Christophe Honoré's gay drama Sorry Angel and Argentinian director Gaspar Noé's horror dance party, Climax.\n\nThe quieter festival went unnoticed by precisely no one. Here’s a look at this year’s winners and losers.\n\nWINNER: Shoplifters\n\nJapanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda took home Cannes' most prestigious prize, the Palme d'Or, for his latest film. Shoplifters dives into the struggles of a low-income family that survives by stealing. Their lives change forever after they take in a young runaway child. The drama bested BlacKkKlansman, which came in second place.\n\nWINNER: Cold War\n\nThe Polish love story from director/writer Pawel Pawlikowski (set for release by Amazon in December) topped almost every critic’s list during an informal poll by this writer. Pawlikowski won the best director prize at the festival.\n\nWINNERS: Female filmmakers\n\nSix months into the Me Too and Time’s Up movements, women in Cannes refused to take a backseat. Up and down the Croisette, they marched for parity, made demands for change and walked away with a signed pledge from Frémaux to be more transparent about how films are accepted to the male-dominated festival.\n\nAttitudes on the ground are definitely changing: When French director Eva Husson hoisted her young son on her hip as she walked to her seat at the premiere of her Kurdish war film Girls of the Sun, the audience cheered.\n\nWINNER: Cate Blanchett\n\nThis year’s jury president was omnipresent, from her moving leadership during the women’s march alongside Agnes Varda to Frémaux's pledge, which happened on her birthday. And on a purely sartorial level, Blanchett’s glamorous turns on the red carpet were pretty magical, too.\n\nWINNER: Spike Lee\n\nThe Brooklyn filmmaker had one of the best debuts at this year’s festival with BlacKkKlansman, his 1970s-era dramedy based on the true story of a black Colorado cop infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan. The film won the Grand Prix at Cannes, the runner-up prize to the Palme d'Or. BlacKkKlansman hits theaters Aug. 10.\n\nWINNER: Young love\n\nBella Hadid and The Weeknd, now on again, were just about everywhere, from Naomi Campbell’s annual Fashion for Relief show to von Trier’s gala premiere for The House That Jack Built. A haute rekindling if there ever was one.\n\nWINNER: Jessica Chastain\n\nChastain came to Cannes on assignment. The actress/producer made a huge splash with a starry sales presentation for the all-female spy thriller 355, alongside co-stars-to-be Penélope Cruz, Lupita Nyong’o, Fan Bingbing and Marion Cotillard. Mission accomplished: Backed by Universal for a U.S. release, the film quickly sold out internationally with a string of million-dollar deals. \"Buyers were ravenous\" for this film, Deadline reported.\n\nLOSER: Lars von Trier\n\nThe controversial Danish filmmaker’s latest work was so steeped in sadism and violence against women and children, it prompted more than 100 people to walk out, with many tweeting their disgust.\n\nLOSER: Under the Silver Lake\n\nThough many a critic hoped to like the Andrew Garfield-led trippy noir film, most left the theater wholly underwhelmed.\n\nLOSERS: The parties\n\nThis year gave way to a series of supposedly glamorous bashes that were, in person, more of a D-list wreck. From the insanity surrounding Chopard’s “Secret” bash (which took hours to get into for most invited guests) to blank calendar spaces left by Vanity Fair and Netflix, the late-night circuit was duller than the Croisette demands. Thank Disney for Solo: The film's massive bash, held beachfront under fireworks with Stormtroopers guarding the gates, provided a much-needed shot of electricity as the festival neared its close.\n\nLOSER: Civility\n\nIt may be Time’s Up in Hollywood, but festival attendees in Cannes need a time-out. This reporter was shoved and pushed at many screenings and events, including Christopher Nolan’s masterclass.

Lasers may be the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter dealing with thousands of crows roosting in downtown, Sunnyvale, California, for years, the city is taking a note from nearby Silicon Valley and going high-tech with lasers.\n\nMayor Larry Klein told CNN crows have roosted in the downtown area for generations, but during the pandemic the numbers have grown. The birds have become a problem for restaurants and other businesses, as well as a noise nuisance for the residential areas.\n\nWhen it comes to eating outdoors, “I’ll go inside unless I’m under an umbrella,” resident Frank Hampton told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. “Thing is, they’re not here during the day, it’s just at night. It’s just when they start coming around when the sun goes down.”\n\nThe city has tried everything to get the birds to find a new spot, but all success has been short lived.\n\n“We have had a falcon previously, a hawk, but it has had limited success and the crows return,” Klein said.\n\nReflectors were also a failure, given the crows tend to congregate at night. Now, the town is moving to laser pointers.\n\n“The cost of bringing in a falconry person is actually fairly high long term, and here we are mainly talking about a $20 solution and some staff time, to have a pilot program to try to resolve the problem,” Klein explained.\n\n“It’s a health problem we’ve had to deal with, and at the cost of the city, so if we have a cheap solution, there’s no reason to try it, right?” Klein said.\n\nThe mayor got the idea from a friend who has been using a green laser to disperse birds squawking in his yard. He learned other towns with bird problems were using the same technique, since it is deemed safe by the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nThe program will start at the end of the month. City staff and residents will be armed with the lasers in hopes of success.\n\n“If the green lasers don’t work by themselves, then we start looking at the sound of crows in distress or other opportunities that present themselves, but this is the first step in trying to deal with the birds,” Klein said.\n\nHowever, not everyone is a fan of trying the technique. The Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society told Klein they are worried the lasers will blind the birds and cause harm to humans and aircraft.

After Cannes and Venice and just before New York, Toronto is a prime-time spot for awards season, and most of the real contenders stop in before the big push at the end of the year. Even JLo was here! \"The Boss,\" too! And after sitting through dozens of films and celebrity-filled Q&As, I'm psyched to see which projects ride a wave to the Academy Awards and tell you what to keep an eye on so you can see the good stuff for yourself.\n\nHere are my favorite things from this year's fest:\n\n'Conclave,' 'The Life of Chuck' are tops in Toronto\n\nMy absolute favorite thing to do at film festivals is keep a running list of everything I see. (And it's usually a lot. I like movies, what can I say?) The top of my chart at Toronto '24 is \"Conclave,\" a papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes as a stressed-out cardinal that has elements of a taut courtroom drama, detective yarn and political thriller. (It's also got a murderer's row of supporting actors, including John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini.) I'm no Oscar night Carnac the Magnificent, but \"Conclave\" has a darn good shot of winning best picture.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAnd my second choice? \"The Life of Chuck,\" director Mike Flanagan's adaptation that nails the quirks and emotional heft of the fantastic Stephen King novella. It's a character study, told backwards, of what happens in the life of a seemingly ordinary accountant (played by Tom Hiddleston) and includes one apocalypse, multiple dance extravaganzas and a haunted attic.\n\nActress transformations are having a moment\n\nOne thing I noticed about a lot of the movies at TIFF this year are the interesting transformations by actresses. Amy Adams turning into a dog in \"Nightbitch,\" for example. Or Demi Moore embracing her body-horror era with the gonzo must-watch \"The Substance.\" Among them, as well as Alicia Vikander in \"The Assessment\" and Pamela Anderson in \"The Last Showgirl,\" we might see one or two in the hunt for the best actress Oscar.\n\nSebastian Stan makes a pretty good Donald Trump\n\nThere was a surprise special screening of the Donald Trump biopic \"The Apprentice\" north of the border. It'll definitely anger a certain former president, guaranteed. More of a reason to watch is the pair of strong leads, Sebastian Stan as young Trump and Jeremy Strong as his mentor Roy Cohn, performing a tightrope walk with their character arcs.\n\nBruce Springsteen talks being 'The Boss' of the E Street Band\n\nUnlike some of my colleagues recently, I have never been in the presence of Bruce Springsteen. That was remedied at the premiere of his new Hulu documentary \"Road Diary,\" where he sat a few rows down from me in the theater. (Watching him bop his head to \"Glory Days\" before the film started was pretty cool.) The movie follows the E Street Band on its recent world tour, and is an intriguing behind-the-scenes look at how Springsteen works as a band leader and the way he looks at age and mortality as a still-vital rock legend. “We have the only job in the world where the people you went to high school with, at 75, you're still with those people,\" he said.\n\nEven more Toronto goodness to check out!\n\nGot thoughts, questions, ideas, concerns, compliments or maybe even some recs for me?

But as 36-year-old Adrian Modesto got his long dark hair trimmed last week at Anderson Barbershop three blocks away, he said he wasn't sure whether he will vote in November.\n\n\"If I were to vote, it would probably be Kamala,\" said Modesto, a Walmart distribution manager who previously backed independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before he dropped out. He applauded Harris' proposals to boost housing and her middle-class-focused tax policies but said he just doesn't know enough about the vice president to commit.\n\n\"She hasn't done a lot of interviews,\" said Modesto, who moved to the area from New York and whose parents are from Mexico. If he does vote for Harris, he said, \"It would be more so just not voting for Trump.\"\n\nPennsylvania is widely considered the most important battleground of the 2024 election between Harris and former President Donald Trump, with their respective paths to 270 electoral votes severely limited if they don't carry its 19 electoral votes – the most of any of the top seven battleground states.\n\nTo duplicate President Joe Biden's narrow 2020 victory in Pennsylvania, Harris needs to rack up big numbers in the commonwealth's urban centers of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, and build on Democrats' recent success in surrounding suburban counties.\n\nTo flip it back in the Republican column, Trump is looking to further expand his massive margins in Pennsylvania's rural counties that he carried with more than 70% in 2020, while chipping away at Harris' strength in cities and suburbs.\n\nYet the state could come down to undecided voters in Northeast Pennsylvania and its emerging \"Latino Belt.\" That includes Lehigh Valley, home of Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton and several smaller townships, along with blue-collar Scranton and Wilkes-Barre further north.\n\nBiden carried the valley's Lehigh County, where Allentown is the county seat, 53%-47% in the 2020 election. A tighter bellwether – often predictive of who will win Pennsylvania – is neighboring Northampton County, which Biden won by less than 1 percentage point in 2020 after Trump carried it by 4 percentage points against Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\"The Lehigh Valley is the swing region of a swing state. Northampton is a bellwether county. We know it flipped to Donald Trump in 2016, Joe Biden flipped it back,\" said Democratic Pennsylvania state Rep. Josh Siegel, a Harris supporter whose district includes Allentown. \"So goes the Lehigh Valley, so goes Pennsylvania.\"\n\nHarris campaign seeks to turn out Pennsylvania's Latino belt\n\nAllentown is the valley's Democratic stronghold, with a mix of Latinos, particularly from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, working-class and college-educated voters, and New York and Philadelphia transplants. Although Allentown's steel industry has collapsed from its peak in the mid-20th century, manufacturing still makes up about 16% of the Lehigh Valley's economy, with health care and retail other top sectors.\n\nThe Harris campaign has deployed a Latino outreach effort aimed at Pennsylvania's more than 1 million Hispanic voters – 615,000 who are expected to vote in November – that includes paid media blitzes in Spanish and a WhatsApp channel for Latinos.\n\nHarris leads Trump in Pennsylvania 49%-46%, an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll taken after last week's debate found. And she is up 50%-45% in Northampton County, a more isolated USA TODAY/Suffolk poll found. But the results are within the margin of error, and 5% of voters statewide are still undecided.\n\nIn Northampton, which is 13% Latino, Harris leads Trump among Latino voters 60%-25%, the poll revealed.\n\nYet the Harris campaign must turn them out to vote. And after securing the Democratic nomination in rapid fashion without a traditional primary, Harris still has work to convince undecided voters leaning her way but not yet committed. Eight percent of Latino voters in Northampton County said they are undecided.\n\n\"I don't like the person Trump is,\" said Chris Rodriguez, a 31-year-old barber at G&A Barbershop in Allentown, but added that he doesn't know much about Harris other than that she's a former prosecutor. \"That's it. Other than that, I don't know what they bring to the table.\"\n\nMost undecided Lehigh County voters point to the economy and inflation as top issues, while others cite access to abortion.\n\n\"I'm still not quite decided but I'm leaning more toward Harris,\" said Jessica Leibenguth, 47, as she took a break from her insurance sales job to read a book on a public bench in downtown Allentown. \"I'm not a huge fan of her,\" she said of Harris, \"but I like how she is for women's reproductive rights. She is more caring, nurturing ‐ not 'screw everybody.' More for the people.\"\n\nLeibenguth planned to watch last week's first presidential debate between Harris and Trump to help form her decision. The Harris campaign has sought to capitalize on the vice president's strong performance – in which she baited Trump throughout and put him on defense – to bring more uncommitted voters her way.\n\nA split county\n\nBiden won Pennsylvania in 2020 over Trump by 1.2 percentage points, while Trump carried the commonwealth by less than 1 percentage point over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAmong the three so-called \"blue wall\" Rust Belt states this year, polling throughout the 2024 campaign has shown Pennsylvania to be the tightest, with Harris holding razor-close leads in most polls over Trump in the other two – Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nThe presidential candidate who carried Pennsylvania has also won Michigan and Wisconsin in every election since 1988.\n\nThe partisan split of Lehigh County, which leans more conservative outside of Democratic-heavy Allentown, isn't hard to find.\n\n\"No way in hell I'm voting for someone with 34 convictions,\" Tom Watson, a 62-year-old forklift operator, said as he finished his haircut at G&A Christian Barbershop, making clear he will vote for Harris over Trump. \"I like everything about her. She's more honest than he is. I just hope we pull it off.\"\n\nServing slices of pizza next door at Delicioso Pizza & Subs on Allentown Hamilton's Street, 47-year-old Vivian Nunez said she's a \"Trump supporter 100%.\"\n\n\"I feel like it was safer when he was president. I felt that the economy was better. I had more money in my pocket,\" said Nunez, who will be making her third vote for Trump after doing so in 2016 and 2020.\n\nAs part of its path to win Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign believes it can peel away some Black and Latino voters from Harris by appealing to minority voters who are socially conservative and worry about the state of the economy.\n\nJorge Camacho, a 60-year-old Puerto Rican who moved to Allentown from New York nearly five years ago, said he is \"not the greatest fan of Donald Trump personally\" but plans to vote for him anyway. Camacho said his \"personal values\" as a Christian are reflected by the Republican Party and said he was \"doing a lot better\" financially during Trump's presidency.\n\nBut at a different table at La Vida Cafe, where Camacho was enjoying a coffee, Andrene Brown-Nowell applauded Harris' new proposals to aid small businesses owners with incentives and boost affordable housing. \"She's very clear on what she's going to do,\" said Brown-Nowell, who chairs the Allentown School District's board of directors.\n\nBrown-Nowell said the Harris campaign has activated on the grassroots level to turn out Lehigh County voters in a way that reminds her of Barack Obama in 2008. \"It's refreshing right now,\" she said. \"Young people are more interested because she's got them engaged, where Biden kind of lost that a little bit. The reconnection is happening.\"\n\n'It's going to be incredibly close'\n\nPennsylvania's crucial status is reflected in both nominee's repeated visits. Harris prepared in Pittsburgh for her debate with Trump. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff visited Allentown on a recent weekend for a \"Latinos con Harris\" event. Harris campaigned in Johnstown and Wilkes Barre, Pa. on Friday. Her trip to Johnstown came after Trump held a campaign rally there last month.\n\nDuring last week's debate, held in Philadelphia, Harris made an appeal to the 800,000 Polish-Americans who reside in Pennsylvania as she criticized Trump's dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. She also reiterated her opposition to a ban on fracking for natural gas – a major issue in parts of the commonwealth.\n\nIn Allentown, Harris has a strong ally in Mayor Matthew Tuerk, an energetic 49-year-old Cuban-American who rides his bike to and from work and is stopped by almost everyone he passes along the way.\n\n\"It's changed a lot, and I think I'm part of the story of that change,\" said Tuerk, who grew up in Eastern Pennsylvania, moved away as a child and returned 20 years ago not thinking he would stay.\n\nTuerk is optimistic about Harris' chances in Pennsylvania. \"We know it's tight. It's going to be incredibly close,\" he said.\n\nFormer Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell predicted Harris will carry Pennsylvania following a strong debate performance and said Trump doesn't have much room to expand his voting base in the mostly white rural parts of the state. Conversely, he believes Harris will win big among independent women in the seven counties within the Philadelphia media market including Lehigh County.\n\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found a stark gender gap in Pennsylvania, with Harris leading women voters 56%-39% and Trump ahead of male voters by a slimmer 53%-41%.\n\n\"There's very little room for Trump to grow,\" Rendell said. \"When it was Biden versus Trump, enthusiasm was on Trump's side. But now enthusiasm seems to be greater on Harris' side than Trump's side.\"\n\nBut David Urban, a former Trump senior adviser who helped lead Trump's efforts in Pennsylvania in 2016 and 2020, said he doesn't believe Harris will match Biden's performances in the president's hometown of Scranton or nearby Luzerne County.\n\nHe said Trump can also \"run up the score\" even more in the state's dozens of small rural counties to match the margins Trump had against Clinton in 2016 – producing a net-gain of \"500 votes here\" and another \"1,000 there,\" Urban said.\n\n\"To paraphrase Al Pacino in 'Any Given Sunday,' this is a game of inches,\" Urban said, adding that he believes the 2024 race in Pennsylvania is \"more like '16 than '20.\"\n\nAs Harris and Trump debated last week, downtown Hamilton Street in Allentown was the site of three separate Democratic debate watch parties including one on the second floor of Brü Daddy's, where more than 50 supporters cheered on Harris.\n\nSeveral Harris fans yelled, \"Liar!\" when Trump claimed he had nothing to do with Project 2025. They roared in laughter when Harris baited Trump to defend the crowd sizes of his campaign rallies. And they gave their biggest round of applause when the vice president slammed Trump's role in overturning Roe v. Wade with his appointments of three Supreme Court justices.\n\nMuch like most reviews across the nation, the room was convinced Harris won the debate.\n\nTuerk, the Allentown mayor, turned down the volume of the television and addressed the crowd during the final intermission before the candidates' closing remarks. He made an appeal for everyone \"not to leave without a plan\" to both vote and volunteer.\n\n\"No matter how much we all like this,\" Tuerk said, gesturing toward the television, \"we still have a shi---d of work here in Allentown to make sure we elect Kamala Harris.\"\n\nBut earlier that afternoon, Mario Peralta, one of the artists who has painted some of the new murals in downtown Allentown, said he will vote for Trump.\n\n“I see the problems that we've been facing right now with the economy and everything, and I think he might do better work,” Peralta said as he watched fellow muralist Hector Castro fill in spots of an unfinished mural.\n\nPeralta, a 54-year-old Dominican immigrant who has lived in Allentown for 20 years, added: \"The most important issue for me is the cost of life.”\n\nPeralta and others – like the people immortalized in Joel's song – are still waiting here in Allentown, for the Pennsylvania they never found.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/13/trump-leads-harris-ukraine-israel-poll/75658769007/", "title": "Trump leads Harris on handling wars in Ukraine, Middle East: new poll", "text": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds an edge over Democratic rival Kamala Harris when it comes to swing state voters' confidence about navigating the U.S. through foreign wars, a new Wall Street Journal poll shows.\n\nThe survey of seven battleground states, released Sunday, finds Trump ahead of Harris 50% to 39% when respondents were asked who is best able to handle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump holds a larger 48% to 33% lead over Harris when those voters were asked about the Israel-Hamas war, which has pulverized much of the Gaza strip and threatens to expand in the Middle East. The states cited in the polling included Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nWhat's happening overseas has become an increasingly important subject in the 2024 presidential election, with both contenders arguing they have the better vision for America's role in the world.\n\nTrump, who asserts the U.S. is on the brink of World War III, has pulled the GOP in a more isolationist direction in recent years and has been skeptical of additional U.S. aid to Ukraine. He has been especially critical of NATO, a North American-European coalition that stems from World War II, particularly in terms of funding and the alliance.\n\nNATO members are asked to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense, but not all members have reached this goal. However, it's a budget formula that Trump has repeatedly mischaracterized during his years in public life.\n\nThe former president has declined to say whether he wants Ukraine to win the bloody conflict against Russia, but has asserted repeatedly without evidence that Russia would not have invaded if he was still in the White House.\n\nHarris, for her part, alleges Trump is weak on foreign policy and leaned into the historic importance of America’s international alliances. The Biden administration has spent more than $100 billion on aid and weapons toward Ukraine.\n\nDuring the presidential debate in September, Harris talked about the need to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom the vice president said, \"would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland\" if Trump were still in charge.\n\nIn terms of the Middle East conflict, Harris and Trump share the view that the U.S. should support Israel in its war against Hamas, which killed more than 1,200 Israelis in a terror act last year.\n\nBut the two candidates hold very different beliefs on how the U.S. should help bring an end to the war, which has claimed the lives of roughly 42,000 Palestinians and wounded about 96,800, according to a Reuters report citing the Palestinian enclave's health ministry.\n\nTrump initially lashed out at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the days after the terror attack, but the former president cooled on those criticisms in the months after. He has offered few specifics on ending the Israel-Hamas war, but as of late he has called for the U.S. ally to \"get it over with.\"\n\nWhen he was president, Trump made the decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and ended opposition to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the Biden administration later reversed. He claims without evidence that Israel would \"cease to exist\" if Harris becomes president.\n\nHarris has walked a tightrope to capture the nuance of the longtime clash, saying she supports continued military aid to Israel while ducking questions on whether Netanyahu was a \"real close ally.\" She has called for an \"immediate cease-fire\" in Gaza and Lebanon and criticized the number of civilians killed while emphasizing the Biden administration's continued pursuit for a diplomatic resolution.\n\nBut like many Democrats, the VP has been intensely pressured by grassroots activists on the political left who argue the Biden administration, and by extension Harris, hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu's hand in deescalating the conflict.\n\nHarris has said she both sympathizes with the Palestinian people and supports Israel's right to defend itself against the Hamas militants who killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took approximately 250 hostages last year.\n\nAccording to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry, more than 40,000 Palestinians have died and 200,000 housing units destroyed in the ensuing war. Nearly 2,000 Lebanese have been killed and more than 1.2 million displaced by Israeli attacks, Reuters reported, citing Lebanese officials.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's poll was conducted between Sept. 28 and Oct. 8.

Nevada is the only battleground state that Trump still leads, the poll found.\n\nThe poll, conducted by the Democratic polling firm BSG and Republican polling firm GS Strategy Group, has a margin of error that ranges by state from +/- 4.7 percentage points to 4.9 percentage points. Harris' leads in three states – Arizona, Michigan and North Carolina − are within that range.\n\nThe findings suggest multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election have opened for Harris, the vice president and Democratic nominee, after Biden's struggles in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina forced his campaign to increasingly bank on the so-called \"blue wall\" states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump led Biden in six of the seven battleground states, and was tied with Biden in Wisconsin, in a survey the same pollsters conducted in May. But Harris has now largely consolidated the Democratic base, the survey found, with 91% of voters who backed Biden in 2020 now saying they will vote for Harris, compared to 82% of this group in May who said they would vote for Biden.\n\nHarris leads Trump head-to-head among independent voters across the seven battleground states, 48% to 40%, whereas Trump previously led Biden 41%-38 among independents. And perhaps most significantly, Harris leads \"double hater\" voters − those who say they don't like Biden or Trump − by a wide 30 percentage points, 54% to 24%. Trump had previously led with this group as well.\n\n\"In many ways, Harris is unburdened by what has been,\" Amy Walter, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report, wrote in an analysis of the results. \"She is the sitting incumbent, yet 56% of battleground state voters say she represents a chance to 'turn the page of the Trump/Biden era' and 59% see her as representing a 'new generation of leadership.'\n\nThe Trump campaign has sought to slow down Harris' momentum by alleging she's \"dangerously liberal\" and trying to tie her to Biden, whose approval rating has hovered around 40% for much of his term.\n\nHarris, who conducted a multi-battleground state blitz last week with her new running-mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is still calling herself \"the underdog\" in the race.

Voting in the Sept. 10 primary began Wednesday, Aug. 28 and continues this week, running through Sunday, Sept. 8.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Editorial Board of DelawareOnline.com and The News Journal met with five of the six candidates seeking the state’s highest office. Each candidate brings strengths to their campaigns; each offers a different vision for the First State’s future.\n\nIn our conversations, each candidate acknowledged — and in some cases, shared — our ongoing frustrations about the pace at which legislation and change alike move in Dover. Most acknowledged that Delaware can do far better on issues like government transparency. And each of the five candidates we spoke with expressed a strong desire to move the Delaware electorate forward from the political polarization that has defined national politics over the last decade.\n\nWhile we will not endorse in the primary race — most Delawareans in both parties already likely know their own minds, we believe — we do offer undecided readers these impressions of the candidates we interviewed.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMeet the candidates: These 4 statewide races have contested primaries in Delaware\n\nThe Democrats\n\nDelaware Democrats have managed through a summer that has been defined by a highly competitive contest for the top of the state ticket. Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, the political veteran who enjoys the support of the Delaware state party and many other establishment organizations within the Democratic milieu, faces competitive challengers in New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer and former state environmental secretary Collin O’Mara.\n\nAn August poll, conducted by Citizens for a New Delaware Way PAC, found Meyer leading the race, with the support of 27% of likely Democratic voters. Hall-Long netted the support of 23% and O’Mara followed with 11%. Still, some 31% of voters in the poll, conducted Aug. 8, were undecided. A later poll found Hall-Long's support slipping while O'Mara gained.\n\nThe Democratic race has been bruising, by all accounts. Hall-Long has faced bruising questions about her campaign finance and its history. In addition, developers unions and a New York compant with a longtime grudge have amplified attacks and pressure on all sides. The race has attracted considerable interest from donors — both in Delaware and outside the First State. In all, the campaigns have collectively raised more than $7 million, making the campaign one of the most expensive in state history.\n\nHere are some of our impressions of each candidate:\n\nCollin O’Mara\n\nThe former Delaware Secretary of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, O’Mara is a Bear resident who is now the CEO of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington. He left DNREC in 2014 and has waged an uphill battle with Democratic voters as a relative outsider.\n\nThat said, O’Mara represents a breath of fresh air for a Delaware Democratic Party steeped in custom and power. While Meyer and Hall-Long have gone on the offensive, O’Mara has preferred to position himself as a candidate who would challenge the First State’s long-held political norms.\n\nWe were especially taken with O’Mara’s interest in redefining the so-called Delaware Way. He supports — as do we — a rethinking of the way businesses is conducted in Dover both in terms of speed and transparency.\n\nO’Mara also said he’d use the powers of the Delaware governorship — among the more powerful in the country — to set an agenda that would tackle education funding, increased investment in climate change mitigation and clean energy jobs.\n\nDoing so, he said, would quicken the pace in Dover.\n\n“There’s not a will to get it done here if there’s pushback,” O’Mara said of the dynamic between the General Assembly and the administration of outgoing Gov. John Carney. “We don’t look at the benefits, so everything looks more expensive but that’s weaponized.”\n\nBethany Hall-Long\n\nThe lieutenant governor is always happy to share the story of her Sussex County roots and how they have shaped her perspectives as a leading Delaware Democrat. In our conversation, she cited her long experience as a nurse, educator, research scientist and politician and said her background and her longstanding service to the First State would guide her as governor.\n\nIndeed, Hall-Long’s command of the systems that deliver progress in Dover and Washington are strengths. Again and again, she mentioned collaborative efforts she’s mounted with lawmakers across the state and the nation to point to her capacity for success.\n\nTo her credit, too, she met our questions about the scrutiny she’s faced over questions about the history of her campaign finance. Forward-looking, Hall-Long said there was “no fraud” and expressed her hopes that Democratic voters would join her in an effort to “move forward.”\n\nOn policy, Hall-Long said she would focus on job growth and supporting Delaware’s small business. She spoke of her goal for Delaware to deliver on universal childcare and said she would create a cabinet-level position to address the needs of First State veterans and active-duty military personnel.\n\n“It’s not just about the policy,” Hall-Long told Delaware Online/The News Journal's editorial board members on Wednesday, Aug. 28. “It’s about having the capacity and the leadership to know where to take Delaware next.”\n\nMatt Meyer\n\nThe New Castle County Executive, first elected to office in 2016 as a political newcomer, is now the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for governor.\n\nMeyer’s ambitions for Delaware and for his own potential term as governor, shone through clearly in a conversation with our editorial board. He pledged to tackle education funding, to expand access to child care and affordable housing and discussed his desire to see Delaware become home to a medical school.\n\nMeyer also expressed frustration about the political culture in Dover — which he characterized as overly focused on catering to the needs of special interests rather than to cause of progress for average Delawareans.\n\n“It takes elected leaders who understand that our job, and my job, is to represent the people who don’t have a seat at the table, who don’t have a moneyed special interest in some decision making,” Meyer told us.\n\nAcknowledging that his resume does not include service in Dover, Meyer pointed to his success in building relationships with the New Castle County Council and with key players in county government to deliver progress. If elected, he said he would work quickly to build relationships with leaders in the General Assembly and in state government to build consensus around an agenda to drive progress.\n\nThe Republicans\n\nRepublicans also face a three-way choice as they select a nominee for governor. Members of the Delaware GOP will chose between state House Rep. Mike Ramone, former New York City police officer Jerrold Price and lifelong Bridgeville resident Bobby Williamson.\n\nOur editorial board met with two of the three candidates as voting got underway in the primary: Ramone and Price. Williamson, after repeated inquiry, did not respond for requests for an interview until this week — and cited his campaign’s inability to meet with us virtually due to bad WiFi access, an issue Williamson said was central to his campaign.\n\nGiven the Democratic Party’s longstanding grip on power across statewide office, the Republican race has attracted less attention — and far less financial support. Still, both Ramone and Price expressed their hopes to cool partisan rancor if elected. Neither mentioned former President Donald Trump in our conversations, even when asked about partisan alliances.\n\nHere are some of our impressions of each candidate:\n\nMike Ramone\n\nA veteran legislator in Dover who has long served in the state House of Representatives — he is now the House Minority Leader — Mike Ramone enjoys the endorsement of the Delaware Republican Party.\n\nRamone takes deep pride in his roots as a native Delawarean and said he believed his many — and sometimes controversial — experiences as an entrepreneur, along with his capacity for building relationships his party and across the aisle, would make him an effective governor. Indeed, at times, Ramone openly harkened back to a pre-Trump Delaware in which a socially moderate, fiscally conservative mindset prevailed among Delaware Republicans. Ramone said he believed that truly is still the case, even now.\n\n“I’m not deep blue, and I’m not scarlet red,” Ramone said, echoing stump speeches. “I’m Delaware yellow,” which he explained to be squarely in the middle of the political spectrum.\n\nRamone’s challenge, as we see it, will be to prove himself right — that Delaware Republicans, many in the thrall of the former president for much of the last decade — will accept a turn back to the political center.\n\nRamone made reasonable assertions about the state’s need to rethink its funding for education, investment in youth and in job growth when we talked policy. In addition, Ramone talked about what he characterized as an ongoing need for Delaware: he is committed to making the state more friendly to business at every level by reconsidering tax policy.\n\nJerry Price\n\nA former New York city police officer who retired to Lewes, Jerry Price told us his top priority as governor would be to focus on what he described as an ever-present crisis in public safety.\n\nPrice, who largely veered away from partisanship during our conversation, said that, if elected, he would work to convice Dover lawmakers to make significant investments in public safety and proposed adding police officers in departments across the state in an effort to create a more responsive and collaborative public safety network that could respond situationally to shootings and narcotics-related crimes, especially in Dover and Wilmington.\n\nOn social issues, though, it’s clear that Price is aligned with Republican culture warriors who want to roll back the clock on social issues like transgender rights. Price said he could not support transgender athletes competing in Delaware.\n\nOn policy, Price talked about the need for the First State to significantly reconsider the way it handles education funding and expressed his belief that schools are essential to building public safety. He has supported access to reproductive healthcare and for higher salaries for Delaware teachers.\n\nBobby Williamson\n\nWilliamson, who was unable to meet with our editorial board, has framed his candidacy around his deep roots in the First State. The Bridgeville resident is a fourth-generation Delawarean, according to his campaign website.\n\nAs DelawareOnline.com and The News Journal have reported, he has billed his candidacy around his identity as a political outsider who advocates for parental freedoms, children and small business. He has also said he supports preservation efforts across the state.\n\nWhen is the state primary election day in Delaware?\n\nThe primary election is Tuesday, Sept. 10.\n\nWhen is Election Day 2024?\n\nThe general election day is Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nIs there early voting in Delaware?\n\nEarly voting continues until Sunday, Sept. 8.\n\nWhat do I need to vote early in Delaware?\n\nAt the polling site, a worker will ask you for proof of identity.

Democrats hope so.", "text": "Will Democrats wake up to a blue miracle in a red state this November?\n\nThat’s the question looming over the party as former NFL linebacker and Rep. Colin Allred faces off against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the closely watched Texas Senate race. Cruz, a Trump-endorsed two-term incumbent, has held the seat since 2013.\n\nAnd Democrats have been eyeing the seat as one they could possibly flip to keep control of the Senate, pouring millions of dollars into the race. Vice President Kamala Harris is also coming to Houston Friday to rally with Allred and speak on abortion rights. Famous pop star Beyonce is expected to make an appearance.\n\nThough Republicans are confident that Cruz will prevail again this year, some polls show it’s going to be a tight race as both candidates are in a virtual dead heat less than two weeks out from Election Day, which is Nov. 5. An Emerson College Poll released Oct. 23 found that 48% of likely Texan voters support Cruz while 47% support Allred. Cook Political Report changed the race from likely Republican to lean Republican.\n\nOther polls show Cruz leading by a narrow margin - even though former President Donald Trump is leading the state in the presidential race by seven points or more.\n\nIn the final homestretch of the race, both candidates are trying to court undecided and middle of the road voters, brand themselves as bipartisan and defend their immigration records (a top issue in the state).\n\n“Overall, I think the race has remained very stable. It has been within striking distance, but Allred hasn't been able to close that gap,” said Mark Jones, a professor in the department of political science at Rice University.\n\nThe Cruz campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIt’s a different time, Allred says\n\nThe only time a Democrat came close to beating Cruz was during his last re-election bid in 2018. Beto O’Rourke, the challenger, had earned 48.3% of the vote while Cruz earned 50.9% of the vote.\n\nIt marked a significant contrast from Cruz's 2012 election bid, where he won against Democratic challenger Paul Sadler by 16% of votes.\n\nBut Allred told USA TODAY in a phone interview he’s running a different campaign against a different candidate from the 2018 Ted Cruz.\n\nHe cited Cruz's position on abortion, his decision to vote against certifying the electoral votes for the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden, and his 2021 trip to Cancun during a Texas winter storm blackout as reasons why Cruz has lost popularity among Texans.\n\nKatherine Fischer, who worked on O’Rourke’s 2018 campaign, said the Senate seat was viewed as a “long shot” at the time, which is why O’Rourke ran an active campaign strategy in which he visited all 254 Texas counties to make that race less of a longshot and boost his name recognition. The outcome showed that Cruz was in a vulnerable position, she said.\n\nAllred has mainly focused on courting voters in suburban or urban areas, Fischer noted. His approach has included appealing to select audiences - including moderates.\n\nThe changing demographics in the state, with more minority groups moving in, could give him a slight edge.\n\nBut with the Biden-Harris administration in power, Allred also faces more scrutiny as polls show voters have been dissatisfied with Democrats’ handling of key issues like immigration and the economy.\n\nAllred defended himself, saying the race isn’t about political parties - it’s about the candidates, and his record is distinct from his opponent’s.The two faced off in a combative debate on Oct. 15, knocking each others' records and sparring over issues including transgender rights, abortion and immigration.\n\nTrump's margin likely to pull Cruz to finish line despite fundraising efforts\n\nSenate Democrats have been making last minute investments into the race to give Allred a boost. The Senate Majority PAC, a group aligned with Sen. Chuck Schumer, announced a $5 million TV investment last week following a multi-million dollar digital and radio investment.\n\nLast month, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced a multi-million dollar investment in the Texas and Florida Senate races.\n\nCompared to Allred, Cruz hasn’t received as much support from his own party.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, hasn’t invested at all in the Texas race. Cruz has been critical of McConnell and once even said he should lose his leadership role in 2015.\n\nBut even with the fundraising, Democrats are still facing an uphill battle, said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist who did consulting work for Cruz’s 2018 Senate bid.\n\n“I think in the end, Trump's margin in Texas is likely to pull Cruz over the line,” he said.\n\nAllred, Cruz brand themselves as bipartisan\n\nAs both candidates travel across the Lone Star state, they’ve tried to paint themselves as bipartisan. Cruz, in particular, was rated as the one of the most partisan members of the Senate in both terms.\n\nHe voted against the bipartisan immigration bill and a Democratic in-vitro fertilization access bill. Both bills have been championed by Allred.\n\nThough Allred was voted as one of most bipartisan members of Congress by the nonpartisan Common Ground Committee, he has taken a vocal stance on abortion rights. Earlier this month, he released an ad featuring Kate Cox, a Texan who drew national attention after leaving the state to get an abortion.\n\nBut he’s also taken stands against Democratic positions. He voted to condemn Biden's handling of the border and urged the Biden administration to end the pause on permitting new liquefied natural gas export projects in an op-ed.\n\nEven if Allred doesn’t win, it may not be a total loss for Democrats. Jones pointed out his presence on the ticket is enough for Democrats to potentially pick up seats in other local Texas races.\n\nFischer, the director of Texas Majority PAC aimed at electing Democrats to statewide office, said her group will continue putting in the work to unseat Cruz in the next election cycle, including raising money and building high voter turnout.\n\n“Win or lose, this is not over for Texas Democrats,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/10/25/exit-poll-right-wing-party-wins-polands-parliamentary-vote/74598082/", "title": "Exit Poll: Right-wing party wins Poland's parliamentary vote", "text": "anessa Gera and Monika Scislowska\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWARSAW, Poland - Poland took a decisive turn to the right in its parliamentary election Sunday, tossing out the centrist party that had governed for eight years for a socially conservative and Euroskeptic party that wants to keep migrants out and spend more on Poland’s own poor.\n\nAn exit poll showed the conservative Law and Justice party winning with 39 percent of the vote, enough to govern alone without forming a coalition.\n\nThe pro-European Civic Platform party received 23 percent of the vote, according to the exit poll. Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz of Civic Platform conceded shortly after the exit poll was released.\n\nOfficial polling results are expected Monday.\n\nIf the exit poll results are confirmed, the Law and Justice will take 242 seats in the 460-seat lower house of parliament and 58-year-old lawmaker Beata Szydlo will become Poland’s next prime minister.\n\nCivic Platform had led the country through a period of strong economic growth and political stability, even during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and a 2010 plane crash that killed Poland’s president and dozens of other top state officials. It is the only party that has governed for two successive terms in the democratic post-1989 era.\n\nBut the presidential vote in May signaled problems for Civic Platform when Law and Justice candidate Andrezj Duda edged out incumbent Bronislaw Komorowski.\n\nA victory by Law and Justice gives the party a chance to implement a brand of politics that is strongly pro-NATO but also somewhat Euroskeptic. The party opposes adopting the euro currency and is strongly anti-migrant, positions that are expected to have a broader impact on the 28-nation European Union, of which Poland is a member.\n\nThe Catholic Church was seen as backing Law and Justice, as were many Poles who have not benefited from the country’s strong economic growth, expected at 3.5 percent this year.\n\nLaw and Justice has promised to reverse an unpopular rise in the retirement age and put more money into the pockets of struggling families with tax breaks, monthly cash bonuses for children under 18 and free medication for people over 75. It also wants to raise taxes on the mostly foreign-owned banks and big supermarkets in Poland and give tax breaks to smaller local businesses and those that adopt Polish technologies.\n\nCritics, however, slam its economic policies as irresponsible.\n\n“If they win it could end up looking like Greece here,” said Arkadiusz Skrodzki, a 22-year-old law student at a Civic Platform party.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/09/04/presidential-odds-2024-election-odds-trump-harris/75017505007/", "title": "Presidential election odds: What bettors and polls say about 2024", "text": "As the stretch run begins in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, overseas betting markets have put former president Donald Trump in a position he's never enjoyed after Labor Day: Ahead.\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, holds a slight lead over Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in two of the largest betting markets: Betfair Exchange, the biggest peer-to-peer U.K. betting platform, and Polymarket, a crypto-trading platform.

He points out, \"The market price at any given time reflects the collective opinion of the market based on the information that's available.\"\n\nAnd the information to compare Trump and Harris has been limited – besides their campaigns' verbal jabs. Bettors may be circling Sept. 10, the first 2024 presidential debate for Harris, as their next best opportunity to rethink their wagers.\n\nGamblers aren't the only ones interested in next week's debate. A recent survey from Prolific, an online research platform, found 7 out of 10 of their respondents said they planned to watch. Younger and Black voters expressed the highest interest in watching, according to the poll.\n\nHow betting odds for Donald Trump winning the 2024 presidency changed\n\nOdds that Trump would win the presidency this year peaked on the first day of the Republican National Convention, according to Betfair and Polymarket data. In the past week, bettors also gave him a slight edge over Harris. It's the first time gamblers gave Trump the edge over a competitor in an election year after Labor Day.\n\nThe betting favorite has only lost twice since 1866, according to the Conversation, a nonprofit news organization. One of those longshots was Trump in 2016. Even on Election Day, bettors gave Trump just a 17% chance of defeating Hillary Clinton, according to Betfair's historical data.\n\nHow Harris' and Trump's odds of winning the 2024 presidential election changed\n\nThe 2024 election odds are sure to swing in the two months before Election Day on Nov. 5, considering Betfair has taken already $78 million in bets. Still, that's just a fraction of the record $2.23 billion wagered on Betfair during the 2020 election.\n\nSo what has slightly opened the odds gap between Harris and Trump in the past few days?\n\nIn five of the last 19 days, the margin between Trump and Harris has been two percentage points or less, but the gap has widened slightly in recent days on Polymarket.\n\nPerhaps bettors see Harris' slim lead nationally, but they are more focused on reports like those from the Silver Bulletin where Nate Silver estimates that Trump has a 56% chance of winning the Electoral College vote.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/13/kamala-harris-trump-florida-polls/74770114007/", "title": "Latest Harris-Trump poll highlights danger for former president in ...", "text": "The red wave that washed over Florida in recent years might not be as large as it once seemed, if a new presidential survey is any indication.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is within “striking distance” of former President Donald Trump in Florida, according to the pollster behind a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University/WSVN-TV survey of 500 likely voters released Tuesday.\n\nTrump leads Harris by 5 percentage points in the survey, but that’s closer than other recent polls and much less than Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 19-point blowout in 2022. It’s also within the poll’s +/- 4.4% margin of error and another sign of the enthusiasm Harris has generated nationwide within the Democratic Party since she entered the race.\n\nTrump received the support of 47% of those in the USA TODAY/Suffolk/WSVN-TV Florida survey, compared with 42% for Harris and 5% for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with 5% undecided or refusing to disclose their choice.

Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nFlashing yellow\n\nWhile not exactly a flashing red warning light for Trump, the survey is a caution sign for anyone who thinks the race is sure to be a blowout in Florida, Paleologos said.\n\n“What was an easy drive through the Sunshine State is drive with caution,” he said, adding that Harris is \"still the underdog, but she's a little bit closer than people might expect.\"\n\nIn a bad sign for the GOP nominee, Harris' Florida voters are matching the former Republican president's supporters in enthusiasm, with 89% of each group saying they are very or somewhat excited to vote for their candidate.\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk national poll from June found that just 60% of Biden's supporters nationwide were excited to vote for him. Biden dropped out of the race last month and Harris took his place at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nHarris also is viewed somewhat more favorably than Biden in Florida. Forty-four percent of voters say they have a favorable opinion of her compared with the president's 39%, though that is also within the poll's margin of error.\n\nHarris has energized the Democratic base since taking over for Biden, raising large sums of money and drawing big crowds at rallies across the country last week.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has struggled to define his new opponent and is lashing out with personal attacks that some in his party view as counterproductive. He received significant backlash for comments questioning the racial identity of the first Black and Indian American vice president. Florida has a significant population of Black voters.\n\nTrump has a higher favorability rating than both Harris and Biden in Florida, though, at 50%, and his job approval rating during his time as president also is higher than Harris' as vice president.\n\nTrump is losing independent voters in Florida by 7 points in the USA TODAY/Suffolk survey. He lost independents by 11 points to Biden in Florida in 2020, according to exit polls, but easily won the state anyway.\n\nVoices of voters\n\nIndependent voter Janie Brookbank, 72, is eager to cast her ballot for Harris. Brookbank is a retired small business owner who was born in Michigan, spent much of her adult life in California and moved to Florida a decade ago, settling in Dunedin. She is active in voter registration with the League of Women Voters.\n\nBrookbank said she was once a registered Republican and admires Republicans such as Sen. Mitt Romney but no longer identifies with the party. She strongly opposes Trump and supported his Democratic opponents in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\"He’s mean. He’s cruel. He treats women badly. He lies. He cheats. There is not one cell of that man that I can respect, nothing. He’s abysmal,\" Brookbank said.\n\nThough not enthusiastic to vote for Biden, Brookbank was prepared to support him to keep Trump away from the White House. She is much more excited about Harris. Never a big fan of the vice president, Brookbank has been impressed with her performance since Biden dropped out.\n\n“She’s a force, she has energy, she can put a little fear into opponents,\" Brookbank said.\n\nOcala resident Barbara Oppenheimer, 79, also had harsh words for Trump, saying he is coming across \"like a dictator.\"\n\nShe was particularly upset after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n“I thought that wasn’t right,\" said Oppenheimer, a Republican. \"He encouraged these people to do it, and that shouldn’t have happened.\"\n\nAbortion rights also are important to Oppenheimer, and she doesn't believe Trump will protect them. Florida has an amendment on the ballot this year that would put abortion protections in the state Constitution.\n\nOppenheimer voted for Trump in 2020, saying \"I wanted to give him a chance.\" She plans to vote for Kennedy this time. Harris is \"OK,\" she said, and would make a good president, but she likes the Kennedy family. (Most of Kennedy's relatives have come out against his candidacy.)\n\nThough there still is plenty of anti-Trump sentiment in Florida, the former president also has a strong group of supporters. Retired Clearwater physician David Pittenger, 86, is one of them.\n\nPittenger cited illegal immigration and inflation as among his biggest concerns and says he likes Trump's approach to those issues. Harris \"hasn't done anything,\" said Pittenger, who moved to Florida in 2010 from Missouri.\n\n\"She says she's for the small people, but she hasn't done anything to show she is for the average man.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/01/will-vatican-elect-progressive-or-conservative-pope/83339568007/", "title": "A battle for the soul of the Catholic Church: What's at stake in ...", "text": "The Roman Catholic cardinals from around the world gathering May 7 in Vatican City to elect a pope must untangle a complex web of issues as they consider candidates to lead the church's 1.4 billion followers across all seven continents.\n\nThe most globally representative group of cardinals in history will be weighing such factors as geography, international political trends, the candidates' age and the lingering fallout from years of controversy surrounding sexual abuse by the clergy.\n\nAnd they will determine whether the adage \"fat pope, thin pope\" holds true or whether the next leader of the Catholic Church will continue and expand the reforms that gained traction during the 12-year reign of Pope Francis, who died April 21.\n\nThe conclave, which starts May 7, will include a maximum of four voting rounds each day until a candidate obtains a two-thirds majority. A compromise candidate could ultimately emerge, but for the first few rounds of voting the cardinals may each be willing to repeatedly vote for their preferred candidate and see whether he gains momentum.\n\nProgressives have an edge. There are more than 250 members of the College of Cardinals but only 133 of them are under age 80 and otherwise meet the requirements for voting. More than three-quarters of those eligible voters were appointed by Francis.\n\nFrancis championed the importance of listening to everyone, from clergy to people in the pews, and he put a particular emphasis on those who have been marginalized. Still, some Catholics believe Francis' effort to build a more welcoming and inclusive church actually fueled division among many of the faithful who have little interest in building bridges with LGBTQ+ Catholics or easing rules for divorce and remarriage within the church.\n\nDisagreements among the cardinals have already emerged in the media. Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller of Germany, a conservative ousted by Francis from a top Vatican position in 2017, is among those who have discussed \"division\" in the church and called for \"unity.\" Cardinal Michael Czerny of Canada, a close adviser to Francis, has dismissed division as an issue for the conclave.\n\n\"Will there be strong disagreements? We’ve already seen competing understandings of the word “unity” from Cardinals Müller and Czerny,\" Daniel Cosacchi, author of “Great American Prophets: Pope Francis's Models of Christian Life,\" told USA TODAY. \"I would suspect that it is unlikely that those two cardinals would be voting for the same person in the first couple of ballots.\"\n\nWhat do Catholics believe? Pope chosen in conclave will lead one of the largest religions.\n\nNew pope likely won't be 'clone of Pope Francis'\n\nFrancis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, a national Catholic outreach group advocating for LGBTQ+ acceptance and equity, says he expects a compromise candidate will ultimately draw the white smoke from the Sistine Chapel signaling the selection of a new pope. But he says he is not concerned that the church could backpedal from Francis' efforts.\n\n\"I'm expecting that while the new pope will not be a clone of Pope Francis, he will be someone who maintains a great deal of his inclusive approach,\" DeBernardo told USA TODAY. \"Even if the cardinals elect a pope who is the opposite of Pope Francis, I think it will be very hard to undo all the good that Pope Francis had on people in the church.\"\n\nA closer look: What to expect from the conclave that will choose Pope Francis' successor\n\nWill the next pope take up immigration issues?\n\nThe next pope must navigate the rise of far-right extremism and authoritarianism. Global politics come with the job. Francis was outspoken against the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration and was a fierce critic of the Ukraine-Russia war and the Israel-Hamas war. His successor will either continue the trend of speaking out or recede into the shadows of international political issues.\n\nWithin the church, Francis shifted the pastoral focus toward a more hospitable, welcoming attitude championing those who had long felt excluded. He allowed clergy to bless same-sex couples. He eased the annulment process for divorces, promoted flexibility for church participation in second marriages and encouraged allowing those spouses to receive Communion in some cases.\n\n\"It would be hard to backpedal on these shifts without causing real alienation,\" said Susan Reynolds, interim director of Catholic Studies at Emory University in Atlanta whose work has focused on race, culture and migration.\n\nHow geography could play a role\n\nThere has been an effort to expand the reach of the Vatican to emerging Catholic strongholds in Asia, Africa and elsewhere. Francis, an Argentinian, was the first Latin American pope. By 2050, almost one-third of all Catholics will likely live in Africa, according to the World Christian Database.\n\nSome of those emerging Catholic populations, particularly in Africa, are more conservative than Catholics in Europe and the U.S. Culture and geography could play a role in selecting a pope this time around, says the Rev. James Bretzke, a theology professor at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio.\n\nPart of being a world church means that the papacy needs to be seen as \"representing the cross-section of the world and not just Europe\" or Italy, he said.\n\n\"Will there be a power struggle among European cardinals vs. non-Europeans?\" Bretzke mused. \"Will racial and or ethnic differences be unnamed tensions or biases for or against some of the candidates that are otherwise considered papabile?\"\n\nHow long will the conclave take?\n\nThe conclave will continue until a pope is elected. One vote is expected the first day, then two each morning and two each afternoon until a candidate claims the two-thirds majority. If the electors fail to reach an agreement after three days, a break of up to one day is allowed \"for prayer, free discussion among voters and a brief spiritual exhortation.\"\n\nThere is no set time limit for the conclave, but recent conclaves have lasted only a few days. The longest conclave in modern times, in 1903, ended when Pope Pius X was chosen after five days. In the 13th century, the papacy was vacant for almost three years before the election of Gregory X, who tightened up conclave rules.\n\nThe Rev. Patrick Flanagan, associate professor of theology and religious studies at St. John’s University in New York, says Gregory X made it clear that conclaves should be focused − and expeditious.\n\n\"According to the original prescription, if a pope had not been elected after three days, a cardinal was restricted to one dish at their meals,\" Flanagan said. \"After eight days, only bread, wine and water.\"\n\nDespite some conflicts over the direction the church should take, most experts don't expect the conclave to stretch beyond a few days. Reynolds noted that Francis was elected in less than two days.\n\n\"I would be surprised to see another conclave quite so brief, but I don't anticipate that it will drag on,\" she said.\n\nHow long does it take to elect a pope? It depends on the century\n\nWho are the top pope contenders?\n\nSome of the names frequently mentioned as candidates to succeed Francis include Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, 67, of the Philippines, a liberal sometimes referred to as \"Francis 2,\" and Cardinal Peter Erdo, 72, of Hungary, who is considered a favorite among the more conservative cardinals.\n\nThere have been 266 popes, and 217 of the have been Italian. Italy has strong contenders again: Matteo Zuppi, 69, a close associate of Francis, and Pietro Parolin, 70, the Vatican Secretary of State who is considered a moderate.\n\nFlanagan says he has seen some of the internet buzz, including reviews of the “elite eight, fabulous four, and the latest May Madness chart.\" But he emphasized the adage “in pope, out cardinal,\" meaning anyone who goes into a conclave thinking they will become pope usually exits the conclave still a cardinal.\n\n'After a fat pope, a thin pope' not always true\n\nNo one \"runs\" for pope, and campaigning is a bad idea and prohibited anyway, Reynolds said.\n\n\"Anything that feels too much like campaigning is seen as gauche. The old wisdom goes, anyone who acts like they want to be pope shouldn't be pope,\" she said. \"Given the diverse makeup (of the voters), it's hard to predict where the wind will blow.\"\n\nIf the voting drags out, the age of the next pope could become an issue to those who feel compelled to compromise for the sake of a consensus.\n\n\"How long do we want this guy in power? This one becomes more important the longer it takes to get consensus,\" said Melissa Wilde, a sociologist of religion and inequality and chairperson of the Department of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nCosacchi, the author who serves as vice president for Mission and Ministry at the University of Scranton, said the adage that “after a fat pope, a thin pope” is elected to alter the direction of the church is not always the case. He said it is unclear how it will play out this time around but that there could be a \"potential impasse.\"\n\nCosacchi says those who could serve as \"kingmakers\" include older cardinals such as Giovanni Battista Re, 91, of Italy; Stanislaw Dziwisz, 86, of Poland; Francis Arinze, 92, of Nigeria; Angelo Scola, 83, Italy; Oswald Gracias, 80, of India; and Christoph Schönborn, 80, of Austria.\n\n'Ugly' U.S. image hinders chances for American pope\n\nThere has never been a pope from the United States, a trend that is likely to continue, Bretzke said. A pope is a diplomat who must be accepted globally, he said.\n\n\"These considerations will continue, in my opinion, to prevent any American from being elected the next pope, even if otherwise he might be well qualified,\" Bretzke said. \"America’s image in the world simply is too powerful − and to be blunt, ugly.\"\n\nThe Rev. Brian E. Konkol, vice president and dean of Syracuse University’s Hendricks Chapel, is not a Catholic. But Konkol says the election of a new pope is not only a massive moment for Catholics, it also impacts people of all faiths from all areas of our world.\n\n\"I suspect a healthy tension will exist between tradition and innovation, yet ultimately it will be about the person they believe is being called upon by God to serve,\" Konkol said. \"The world is indeed watching and waiting, because whoever emerges will immediately become one of the most influential leaders of our generation.”\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, is one of the few cardinals who participated in the election of Francis 12 years ago. Speaking on FOX News Channel’s The Story with Martha MacCallum, he said the cardinals don't view each other as conservatives or progressives but as \"believers, as disciples, as brothers.\"\n\nDolan said the cardinals do feel pressure when making the decision. But he cited 2013, when the conclave was opened with a prayer from a Franciscan preacher.\n\n\"He said, 'Eminences, you're all scared because you have a tough job to elect the next pope.' He said 'let me put your mind at ease. It's easy. The Holy Spirit has already chosen the next pope. Your job is to find out who it is.'\n\n\"We all chuckled and said, 'Hey, that's kind of nice to hear,'\" Dolan said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/10/22/q-a-what-leader-osce-election-monitoring-group-thinks-us-voting/5976926002/", "title": "Q&A: What leader of OSCE election monitoring group thinks of US ...", "text": "A global election monitoring group will be deployed across the U.S. for the presidential election on Nov. 3. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, an intergovernmental organization, has been monitoring elections among its 57 members in North America, Europe and Asia for two decades. Its mission is to assess how well a democratic vote is functioning and to make recommendations for improvements in areas that touch on transparency, accountability and voter pluralism.\n\nThe OSCE has observed eight previous U.S. elections, beginning in 2002 with the mid-term Congressional elections that followed 2000's presidential election of George W. Bush. OSCE called the 2000 vote \"highly controversial, divisive and litigious.\"\n\nUrszula Gacek, a former Polish politician who is leading the OSCE's international delegation to monitor the U.S. presidential election, spoke to USA TODAY about the approaching vote, what her team of observers has noticed so far and the difficulties of being an international observer of fiercely contested elections.\n\nThe following conversation has been lightly edited.\n\nWhat do your observers specifically do?\n\nPeople often think that observers are only focused on watching voting at polling places on election day. In fact, our observation is for a much longer period and has a much wider scope. The fact that we arrived in the U.S. five weeks prior to election day is the best indicator of that. We start by covering the pre-election period, looking at candidate and voter registration, preparations for elections by election officials, the technologies used for casting and counting ballots, election legislation and ongoing court cases, the campaign environment, campaign finance – how money is raised, spent and accounted for, how the elections and candidates are being portrayed in the media. The list is quite long.\n\nFor this, we have a team of 15 experts based in Washington, D.C,, as well as 30 observers out in the field. Altogether, we plan to visit 30 states before or during election day. Our observers are talking with all the players in the elections. While many meetings are inevitably (because of COVID-19) taking place online this year, some things must be seen in person, such as:\n\nin-person voting\n\nvoter access to different voting methods, including for persons with disabilities\n\nballot storage, equipment storage and set-up processes\n\nballot processing by election officials, ballot processing at USPS offices\n\ntraining of poll workers and poll watchers\n\nOn election day we will be joined by 100 observers from our partners in the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE.\n\nWhat challenges are you seeing in the U.S. vote?\n\nODIHR (Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the OSCE unit that deals with elections) spoke several months ago to a large number of people involved in these elections in a wide variety of roles. The message we came away with was that the 2020 U.S. elections would be both technically and politically challenging.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic poses problems for election officials such as the need to keep voters and poll workers safe and increased volume of postal ballots. For candidates and parties, there's adapting campaigns to COVID-19 restrictions, greater use of media, and fewer large rallies and door-to-door campaigns. And for the voters themselves, they need to be kept informed as regulations change rapidly, often in response to health concerns.\n\nCOVD-19 has impacted our own operations. We had hoped to bring in (about 500) observers specifically to observe election day, and with the smaller presence we now have, the assessment of election day will be qualitative, more anecdotal, rather than statistical. However, the rest of our work carries on more or less as planned, including observing early in-person voting wherever possible. I am therefore confident that we will deliver a meaningful and comprehensive assessment that is completely impartial.\n\n(The OSCE will publish an interim report about its work on Nov. 3's vote later Thursday.)\n\nAre you concerned about calls by President Donald Trump for his supporters to watch polls?\n\nWe don't comment on remarks made by specific politicians or parties. It is important to understand, though, that in principle we welcome the presence of domestic poll watchers, both partisan and non-partisan, as we believe their presence contributes to the transparency of the process. However, and this is a big however, they need to abide by strict standards, just as our observers do. They may in no way intimidate voters or election officials for that matter, through their behavior. They should identify themselves to election officials and then simply watch, nothing more. We are not jumping to conclusions here – we have to wait and observe and only then we will be able to assess.\n\nAmong the things that count as voter intimidation, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy institute that is part of New York University:\n\n\"baseless or abusive challenges to voters eligibility\"\n\ndirect confrontation of voters\"\n\n\"use of insulting, offensive, or threatening language or raised voices in and around polling places\"\n\n\"blocking polling-place entrances\"\n\n\"following and photographing voters, recording license plate numbers\"\n\n\"brandishing weapons in front of voters\"\n\nIf the U.S. election does not end on Nov. 4, but counting goes on and both sides claim victory how long will monitors to stay on the job?\n\nOur job never stops on election day or the day after. We will be following the count, which is expected to continue for some time this year due to the many postal ballots. We will also follow any complaints and appeals made by voters and candidates to the courts. I’m due to stay in Washington, D.C. until mid-November together with key experts, but if it becomes necessary, we may stay longer or will otherwise continue to watch developments remotely. We will see the process through to the end.\n\nHow well has the U.S. implemented previous OSCE election recommendations?\n\nRecommendations are one of the most important aspects of our work. We are currently looking at how and to what extent past recommendations have been implemented and this will be summed up in our final report, which is due to be published early in the New Year.\n\n(After the 2016 presidential vote, the OSCE recommended the establishment of independent redistricting commissions to draw district boundaries free from political interference, \"Congress should give urgent consideration to establish the formula to identify jurisdictions to be subject to Section Five of the Voting Rights Act\" so that minority groups are not blocked from voting, and improvements to campaign finance transparency.)\n\nWhat are some of the toughest voting environments your observers work in?\n\nMongolia with nomadic people of no fixed address voting in yurts out on the steppe is a good example of some of the more unusual environments we have worked in. Vast distances, as in Kazakhstan, or complex electoral systems such as here in the U.S. are also examples. But each country is unique and poses distinctive challenges. On substance, the experts who work with me must be knowledgeable and able to grasp the key issues in a matter of weeks, while setting their own personal views and opinions firmly aside.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/22"}]}

It goes into effect on May 7.\n\nNaturally occurring in water, soil, plants, rocks and even the air, fluoride was discovered as a useful tool for preventing cavities and tooth decay by the late 1930s. In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first city to fluoridate its community water, adjusting existing levels in the supply to the therapeutic 1.0 parts-per-million (ppm).\n\nSince then, the levels have been adjusted to a maximum of 0.7 ppm or 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water, which is considered optimal for preventing tooth decay.\n\nWhile the CDC maintains that fluoridated water is both safe and cost-effective, questions as to potential hazards introduced by water fluoridation have existed as long as the practice has been popular.\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. who has no formal medical training and is a long-time proponent of misinformation related to health topics such as vaccines, has led a renewed charge against fluoridated water, saying in November 2024 that the second Trump administration would \"advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,\" citing unsubstantiated health concerns.\n\nCox did not cite these same health claims, but previously claimed that with only about half of the state (43.6% as of 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control), did not drink fluoridated water and that he had not seen a significant discrepancy in oral health between the two halves, the New York Times reported. He also previously claimed the addition of fluoride to public water was the same as being “medicated” by the government, reported AP.\n\nThe bill would also allow pharmacists to prescribe fluoride tablets as an alternate means of consuming the mineral.\n\nOther states, including North Dakota, Tennessee and Montana, also have anti-fluoride bills on the table.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Gov. Cox's office for comment.\n\nThe fluoride fight: Data shows more US cities, towns remove fluoride from drinking water\n\nFluoridated water by the numbers\n\nIn 2022, the CDC reported that 72.3% of the U.S. population on a community water source received fluoridated water, a percentage fairly consistent with 2020's 72.7%. Still, growing anti-fluoride sentiments in some communities echo concerns that have circulated since the practice became widespread.\n\nThe potential for fluoride toxicity does technically exist, for example, but would require consuming an amount of fluoridated water that would kill a human via water intoxication before the amount of fluoride could become harmful or deadly, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nOther arguments have included a theorized connection between fluoridated water and increased cancer risk, a topic studied extensively. According to the National Cancer Institute, the most recent population-based studies found no evidence of an association between fluoride in drinking water and an increased risk of bone cancer.\n\nOther topics have been explored as science has evolved, including the impact of fluoride consumption on pregnancy, arthritis, IQ, and kidney disease. Results have been mixed and scientists say more research needs to be done to come to a strong conclusion. Thus far, however, no definitive link has been found between fluoridated water supplies and these conditions.\n\nSome have also begun to speculate about the need for fluoridated water with so many dental hygiene products now available in stores. Detractors argue that there is no need to add more of the compound on top of what naturally occurs in water and that distributing it via drinking water is an imprecise and uncontrolled way of dosing residents.\n\nThe CDC says, however, that while hygiene products can help reduce tooth decay, the greatest protection comes when they are used in tandem with fluoridated water. And, a wealth of studies have found that water fluoridation was related to a significant (up to 30%) decrease in cavities among adults and children.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/30/florida-fluoride-ban-bill/83375769007/", "title": "Florida to ban fluoride despite overwhelming scientific support", "text": "The Florida House approved a bill that is setting the state up to become the second in the country to ban fluoride from being added to water supplies.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House passed the bill (SB 700) in an 88-27 vote on Tuesday, which also prevents the sale of plant-based products “mislabeled” as milk, meat, poultry or eggs.\n\nUtah became the first state in the United States to pass a bill banning fluoride on March 29. Health and Human Services Sec. Robert F. Kennedy has endorsed claims that fluoride is behind a host of health conditions including ADHD, lower IQ, and hypothyroidism. Dentists and epidemiologists have hit back at those accusations as scientifically unproven, and have warned that removing fluoride from water systems could take a serious toll on public health.\n\nKennedy has praised Utah's ban and he took another swipe at the mineral in a Cabinet meeting on April 30.\n\nBrett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, called the claims that fluoride is harmful and unnecessary a \"myth.\"\n\n\"When government officials, like Secretary Kennedy, stand behind the commentary of misinformation and distrust peer-reviewed research it is injurious to public health,\" he said in a statement on Monday.\n\nOver the past 80 years, the U.S. adopted the practice of adding fluoride to water supplies, which the Centers for Disease and Prevention has listed as one of the 10 great public health achievements between 1900-1999.\n\nYet despite its careful adoption and a mountain of scientific evidence supporting its benefits to public health, American support for fluoride seems to be waning as many water utilities have started to move away from the practice amid growing public pressure.\n\nHere is what to know about Florida’s proposed fluoride ban, dubbed the “Florida Farm Bill” and the effects of fluoride.\n\nWhat does Florida’s fluoride ban bill (SB 700) do?\n\nThe Florida Farm Bill is a 111-page piece of legislation that touches on nearly two dozen aspects related to agricultural and consumer services, such as adopting rules for electric vehicle charging stations, allowing drones to be used to manage and eradicate plant and animal disease and more.\n\nThe legislation never mentions fluoride. Instead, it seems to add a new section to Florida Statutes that defines water quality additives and prohibits local governments from adding any additive that doesn’t meet the definition.\n\nUnder the bill, a water quality additive is any chemical, additive or substance used in public water systems for the purpose of:\n\nMeeting or surpassing primary or secondary drinking water standards\n\nPreventing, reducing or removing contaminants, or\n\nImproving water quality\n\nAdding fluoride to public water supplies does not fall under the newly proposed definition and is largely seen as a public health measure.\n\n“Not only is it (water fluoridation) safe, it’s a game-changer for dental health,” Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, said.\n\nProponents of the bill argue that it shouldn’t be up to the government to decide whether to put drugs and chemicals in people’s bodies.\n\n“This is not about fluoride,” said bill co-sponsor Rep. Danny Alvarez, R-Hillsborough. “This is about your liberty.”\n\nWhat is fluoride?\n\nFluoride is a mineral that can be naturally found in soil, all water and even many foods, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nEven prior to its first trial in 1945, fluoride had undergone decades of study. In 1901, dentists in the United States and Italy separately found that certain populations with distinctively stained teeth had lower rates of dental decay. The discovery was later described as “dental mottling.”\n\nResearchers spent years trying to understand the correlation between dental mottling and tooth decay, often going back and forth between whether or not it increases someone’s chance of experiencing tooth decay.\n\nG.V. Black, dean of Northwestern University Dental School, and Dr. Frederick S. McKay began studying the correlation in 1915. A year later, they published a paper revealing that “Contrary to what might be expected [mottling] does not seem to increase the susceptibility of the teeth to decay.”\n\nThe studies didn’t end there, however. In 1931, Dr. H. Trendley Dean, U.S. Public Health Service officer and founder of the Dental Hygiene Unit at the recently established National Institutes of Health, correlated mottled enamel with too much fluoride intake. After publishing a long-running series of epidemiologic studies exploring the relationship between fluoride intake, dental fluorosis, and tooth decay, he declared fluorosis an “an acute and urgent public health problem.”\n\nDean’s intent wasn’t to vilify the use of fluoride. After his declaration, he pivoted his studies toward whether fluoride at levels too low to cause fluorosis might provide resistance to cavities. He discovered “a strong inverse relation” between the conditions.\n\nIn 1942, Dean published the findings of an NIH study of 7,200 children spanning 21 cities. He found that 1 ppm fluoride in drinking water reduces rates of tooth decay with negligible risk of fluorosis. His revised fluorosis index remains in clinical use to this day, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat are the benefits of fluoride?\n\nAfter more than 80 years of study, fluoride’s benefits are pretty clear-cut. When a community is able to precisely adjust the level of naturally occurring fluoride in its water supply, it leads to the single most effective, safe and cost-effective way to prevent dental decay and repair early tooth decay, according to the Florida Dental Association.\n\nThe CDC estimates that fluoridation has reduced tooth decay in children by 40-70% and reduced tooth loss in adults by 40-60%. Community water fluoridation is listed in the CDC’s 10 great public health achievements between 1900-1999.\n\nA lot of studies focus on the benefits fluoride provides children, but it helps adults in several ways, too.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic says that fluoride can help treat dry mouth, which makes people more prone to oral health issues like gum disease and cavities. It can help fight gum disease, which exposes teeth and gums to bacteria and increases your risk of tooth decay.\n\nFluoride also helps anyone with crowns, bridges, braces or removable partial dentures, which can also increase the risk of cavities.\n\nWhat are the arguments against fluoride in water?\n\nIn November, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo issued official guidance against public utilities putting fluoride in drinking water.\n\n“It is clear more research is necessary to address safety and efficacy concerns regarding community water fluoridation,” Ladapo said in November. “The previously considered benefit of community water fluoridation does not outweigh the current known risks, especially for special populations like pregnant women and children.”\n\nHowever, there have been more than 3,000 studies from the U.S. and across the world that address the safety and efficacy of community water fluoridation.\n\nOther claims link fluoride to cancer, lower IQs and an increased risk of childhood neurobehavioral problems.\n\nOutside of fluorosis, there have been no studies that link the CDC-prescribed amount of 0.7mg/L to things like an increase in kidney disease, bone cancer, ADHD or any other neurodevelopmental disabilities.\n\nThere have been studies that link greater concentrations of fluoride to lower IQ. However, those studies were from countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Mexico and Pakistan and involved fluoride levels at or above 1.5 milligrams per liter, twice the recommended U.S. limit. The authors said more research is needed to understand whether lower exposure has any adverse effects.\n\nIn the reports, researchers said they found no evidence that fluoride exposure adversely affected adult cognition.\n\nDo Brita filtration systems filter fluoride?\n\nNo. Brita filters are designed and certified to filter out several contaminates like chlorine, chloramine, lead, PFAS and microplastics but not fluoride. You can check the certification seal on your Brita and filter to better understand what contaminates are filtered.\n\nWhat does fluoride do to your brain?\n\nThe NIH-run National Toxicology Program’s (NTP) monograph on fluoride found with moderate confidence that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water with more than 1.5 mg of fluoride per leader, are associated with lower IQ in children. The study was criticized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and the American Dental Association for inadequate statistical rigor and other methodological flaws.\n\nThe study stressed that there was “insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children’s IQ.” The report also stated that there was no evidence of fluoride exposure having a negative impact on adult cognition.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy of USA Today.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/06/florida-legislation-flushes-fluoride/83483829007/", "title": "Florida will ban adding fluoride to water when DeSantis signs new law", "text": "TALLAHASSEE, FL — Florida is set to become the second state in the country to ban fluoride from being added to public water supplies after Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on May 6 that he planned to sign the bill into law.\n\nIn Miami, DeSantis, accompanied by Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, said he's signing the \"Florida Farm Bill\" (SB 700), which prevents local municipalities from adding fluoride to their water. The bill doesn't explicitly mention fluoride, but rather bans certain additives in the water system.\n\nThough the legislation also does other things, such as adding consumer protections and establishing the Florida Aquaculture Foundation, removing fluoride from local water supplies has drawn national attention and criticism from public health advocates.\n\nFluoride helps prevent tooth decay by strengthening enamel — the hard outer layer of teeth — making it more resistant to acid from bacteria and sugary foods. Dental and health care experts say removing fluoride from the public water supply could lead to increased dental problems, such as cavities, which could affect poorer residents, often rural populations without dental insurance or otherwise limited access to dental care.\n\nBut during the governor's news conference, behind a sign that said \"Free State of Florida,\" DeSantis said: \"It's forced medication when they're jamming fluoride into your water supply.\"\n\nDeSantis' comments come after Florida lawmakers gave final approval to the bill in late April. The new law is expected to take effect on July 1.\n\nHealth in America: As bans spread, fluoride in drinking water divides communities across the US\n\nFlorida officials and medical experts clash over fluoride guidance\n\nDeSantis spent time blasting former chief medical adviser to the United States, Anthony Fauci, and the COVID-19 vaccine before talking about \"studies that have raised concerns about physical and mental health risks that have been associated with overexposure to fluoride.\"\n\nMiami-Dade County commissioners also voted to override Mayor Daniella Levine Cava's veto and proceed with plans to remove fluoride from the county's water supply.\n\n\"I think they voted the right way, so thank you,\" DeSantis said. \"For the counties that voted the other way, the legislation that we'll sign is going to answer that question.\"\n\nThe legislative move to nix fluoride additive from Florida's drinking water isn't a surprise, as Ladapo, who heads the Florida Department of Health, has backed arguments the American Dental Association has called \"dangerous.\" Bill supporters maintain that fluoride is naturally occurring in water sources and adding more is unnecessary.\n\nIn November, Ladapo told communities to stop fluoridating their drinking water, citing concerns over fluoride causing \"adverse effects in children, reducing IQ, cognitive impairment, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\"\n\nBut the Florida Dental Association issued a statement saying Ladapo's guidance against fluoride was \"based on flawed and unscientific reports\" and said it continues to \"support ... community water fluoridation as an effective tool in reducing dental decay.\"\n\nThe fluoride fight: Data shows more US cities, towns remove fluoride from drinking water\n\nFlorida latest state to raise concerns about fluoride risks\n\nWater fluoridation has been proven to be so effective at preventing tooth decay that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named it one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century, a time when Americans' life expectancies rose by 30 years.\n\nDespite careful adoption and a mountain of scientific evidence supporting its benefits to public health, American sentiment surrounding fluoride appears to wane as many water utilities have started to move away from the practice amid growing public pressure.\n\nUtah became the first state in the United States to pass a bill banning fluoride in March after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. began targeting fluoride in drinking water — a move that public health experts have widely disagreed with.\n\nScientists and dental health organizations have warned that Kennedy's plan is disastrous for public health. The health secretary has said he will tell the CDC to stop recommending that cities and states add fluoride to public water systems.\n\nAdding fluoride to water, a process called fluoridation, is not required by law.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen, Hannah Yasharoff and Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, USA TODAY; Brandon Girod, Pensacola News Journal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/02/10/somerset-voters-stop-anti-fluoride-advocates-for-4th-time-in-2-years/78376289007/", "title": "For fourth time, Somerset votes on fluoride in their drinking water ...", "text": "Another citizens petition to remove fluoride from Somerset's drinking water was before Special Town Meeting on Saturday.\n\nThe measure was defeated, 192-154 votes.\n\nThe same or similar petitions have been before voters three other times in less than two years, and all have failed.\n\nThis story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.\n\nFor the fourth time in less than two years, Somerset voters have defeated a controversial citizens petition that would have removed fluoride from the town’s water supply.\n\nAt a Special Town Meeting held Saturday morning at Somerset Berkley Regional High School, voters were asked whether they favored having the town seek an exemption from state law governing the fluoridation of drinking water.\n\nThe item failed, 192 votes to 154.\n\nThe article, originally second-to-last on the meeting warrant, was second to be discussed after Selectman Jamison Souza successfully moved to have it heard much earlier in the lineup, with more citizens present — bringing the matter before voters about 20 minutes into what wound up a 4-hour, 30-minute event.\n\n“This article has been in front of us many times, and it’s always been at the end of the meeting,\" Souza said. “I feel it should be heard with the majority of the public here at the meeting.”\n\nThe fluoride fight: Data shows more US cities, towns remove fluoride from drinking water\n\nDiscussion of fluoride in Somerset water was limited\n\nOnly a handful of citizens were able to speak either for or against fluoridation before discussion was closed, among them Sandra Cronauer Mitra, a retired biology teacher, who said it was imperative that the town continue adding fluoride to its water supply.\n\n“It benefits the general public, as it helps to prevent ... tooth decay in the general population,\" she said. “As I have said previously, people of my generation are going to be the first generation in history to die with all our teeth.”\n\nOther speakers spoke in opposition, including Amy Rigtrup, who said she feels she has seen an increase of neurological disorders like dementia, Parkinson’s Disease and multiple sclerosis — \"I can't directly say it's from fluoride,\" she said, but said environmental toxins could be to blame and suggested the town remove fluoride to \"protect our health.\"\n\nTown Moderator Lucia Casey made it clear that, per the language of the article, “We’re not banning anything at this point. We’re sending it to the Legislature, and having the Legislature ban it. That’s the way it works.”\n\nWhen one speaker asked to hear from the town Water Department, Casey also noted that that was not within the purview of the article.\n\nWith a voice vote too close to call, a standing vote count was taken. As those opposed to the article stood, the crowd became audibly agitated and Casey had one person ejected from the auditorium.\n\nSomerset fluoride ban has failed four times\n\nSomerset voters have heard the same, or nearly the same, article three times before.\n\nPrevious petitions, all by Elizabeth Paskowski, made their way onto the annual Town Meeting agenda in May 2023, the Special Town Meeting agenda in November 2023, and the annual Town Meeting in May 2024.\n\nThe previous three votes failed by 54-80 votes (May 2023), 20-53 votes (November 2023), and 20-37 votes (May 2024).\n\nSaturday’s vote represents the largest vote Somerset voters have taken on the fluoridation issue in recent years.\n\nThe issue arises as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who has claimed, without scientifically valid evidence, that fluoride in U.S. water systems has been linked to a host of medical conditions — is being nominated for secretary of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump. Kennedy has promised to remove fluoride from water supplies nationwide.\n\nFluoride has been added to Somerset’s water supply since 1968.\n\nWhat does the Mass. state law actually say about fluoridation?\n\nMassachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 8C, governs fluoridation of public water by the Department of Public Health.\n\nThe law does not mandate a specific level of fluoridation — it says that if the state public health commissioner finds that the fluoride content of a city’s or town’s water supply “is not at optimum level for sound dental health, he shall so notify the local board of health of his findings.”\n\nThe local board of health, “shall, if it considers doing so in the best interest of the inhabitants of the city, town or district within its jurisdiction, order the upward adjustment of the fluoride content of the water supply available for domestic use in that city, town or district.”\n\nQuestions about fluoride: Is there too much fluoride in drinking water? New report raises questions\n\nHow much fluoride is safe in drinking water?\n\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral, appearing in varying levels in groundwater worldwide, shown to prevent cavities and tooth decay.\n\nA 2023 report from the Somerset Water Department shows that the town’s water supply had a fluoride range, tested monthly, from 0.0 to 0.929 parts per million, with the highest at 1 ppm.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service recommends a level of 0.7 ppm for public water systems. The most recent water quality reports available for Fall River and New Bedford show both cities maintain fluoride levels at 0.7 ppm.\n\nA recent review by the National Toxicology Program from 2024, and a meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics, suggested that high amounts of fluoride in excess of 1.5 ppm was associated with — but did not necessarily cause — slightly lower IQ scores in children.\n\nThe review looked at studies primarily from China and India, along with a few other studies from Canada, Iran, Mexico, and other countries.\n\n“An association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect,” the NTP monograph reads.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/07/florida-to-ban-fluoride-how-to-protect-teeth/83492661007/", "title": "Florida set to ban fluoride.

Instead, it creates a legal definition for water quality additives that prohibits local municipalities from adding any chemicals into local water supplies that do not meet the new criteria.\n\nAt the press conference, DeSantis brought up studies he said pointed to physical and mental health risks associated with overexposure to fluoride.\n\nThe Florida Dental Association previously issued a statement about the subject, calling the reports \"flawed and unscientific.\"\n\nThe U.S. began adding fluoride to its water supply around 80 years ago as a way to prevent tooth decay. Like water and oxygen, too much of anything can have repercussions. Overexposure to fluoride does have some minor risks, like slight teeth discoloration.\n\nAt the right amounts, fluoride strengthens teeth by hardening the outer enamel. This protects it from acid attacks from bacteria and ultimately prevents cavities, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nHere's what to know about Florida's fluoride ban and how you can keep your teeth protected.\n\nWhat does Florida’s fluoride ban bill (SB 700) do?\n\nThe Florida Farm Bill is a 111-page piece of legislation that touches on nearly two dozen aspects related to agricultural and consumer services, such as adopting rules for electric vehicle charging stations, allowing drones to be used to manage and eradicate plant and animal disease and more.\n\nThe legislation never mentions fluoride. Instead, it seems to add a new section to Florida Statutes that defines water quality additives and prohibits local governments from adding any additive that doesn’t meet the definition.\n\nUnder the bill, a water quality additive is any chemical, additive or substance used in public water systems for the purpose of:\n\nMeeting or surpassing primary or secondary drinking water standards\n\nPreventing, reducing or removing contaminants, or\n\nImproving water quality\n\nAdding fluoride to public water supplies does not fall under the newly proposed definition and is largely seen as a public health measure.\n\n“Not only is it (water fluoridation) safe, it’s a game-changer for dental health,” Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, said.\n\nProponents of the bill argue that it shouldn’t be up to the government to decide whether to put drugs and chemicals in people’s bodies.\n\n“This is not about fluoride,” said bill co-sponsor Rep. Danny Alvarez, R-Hillsborough. “This is about your liberty.”\n\nWhat is fluoride?\n\nFluoride is a mineral that can be naturally found in soil, all water and even many foods, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nWhat are the benefits of fluoride?\n\nAfter more than 80 years of study, fluoride’s benefits are pretty clear-cut. When a community is able to precisely adjust the level of naturally occurring fluoride in its water supply, it leads to the single most effective, safe and cost-effective way to prevent dental decay and repair early tooth decay, according to the Florida Dental Association.\n\nThe CDC estimates that fluoridation has reduced tooth decay in children by 40-70% and reduced tooth loss in adults by 40-60%. Community water fluoridation is listed in the CDC’s 10 great public health achievements between 1900-1999.\n\nA lot of studies focus on the benefits fluoride provides children, but it helps adults in several ways, too.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic says that fluoride can help treat dry mouth, which makes people more prone to oral health issues like gum disease and cavities. It can help fight gum disease, which exposes teeth and gums to bacteria and increases your risk of tooth decay.\n\nFluoride also helps anyone with crowns, bridges, braces or removable partial dentures, which can also increase the risk of cavities.\n\nIs fluoride toxic?\n\nFluoride can be toxic at high enough levels, but the same is true of most substances.\n\nEarth's atmosphere has just the right amount of oxygen to support life, which is toxic to every form of life as we know it at high levels.\n\nWater, another building block of life, can be toxic in large quantities, too. Drinking excessive amounts of water can cause your body's cells to swell, which can lead to serious health complications and death.\n\nLike water and oxygen, ingesting a dangerous amount of fluoride is only likely to happen in an extreme scenario like accidental contamination.\n\nWhat are the negative side effects of fluoride?\n\nHigh exposure to fluoride can cause a condition known as fluorosis, which is a fancy word for tooth discoloration, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nFluorosis is most commonly observed in people consuming naturally occurring fluoride, like well water. It often leads to spots on your teeth that can range from white to brown streaks.\n\nIn extreme cases, high exposure to fluoride can lead to denser bones, which can cause them to be more fragile and brittle, according to the CDC.\n\nHow can I make sure I'm getting enough fluoride?\n\nFlorida will be the second state in the U.S. to ban fluoride from its water supplies, but fluoridation adoption isn't 100% across the country. As a result, you can still find products with fluoride to make up the difference.\n\nOutside of your annual dentist visits, brushing twice daily and flossing, you'll want to make sure you're using fluoride toothpaste.\n\nFluoride toothpaste cause the mineral to stick to your teeth, rebuilding the material that is lost and added to the surface of your teeth naturally over the course of the day. It also increases the amount of fluoride in your saliva, which helps further strengthen your outer enamel layer, according to the CDC.\n\nYou can also purchase fluoride mouth rinse for daily or weekly use. The mouth rinse works to protect the enamel in the same way as fluoride toothpaste.\n\nFluoride gel, foam and supplements are also available from your dentist. Talking with your dentist about these treatments will be the best way to ensure your teeth are protected.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/02/27/utah-fluoride-water-ban/80674592007/", "title": "Utah may become first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water", "text": "Utah could soon become the first state to ban the mineral fluoride in public drinking water, according to legislation in the state.\n\nHouse Bill, 81 introduced by Rep.

But experts previously told USA TODAY they expected it would likely generate debate among anti-fluoride groups pushing for ballot measures to ban fluoride in water in local communities.\n\nDrinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter was \"consistently associated with lower IQ in children,\" the report said.

Ron DeSantis announced he intends to sign the bill, and once it becomes law it will go into effect July 1, making Florida the second state in the United States to ban it.\n\nECUA Board Member Vicki Campbell says the utility has been ordering less fluoride in anticipation of the new legislation.\n\nShe says they have about five weeks worth of fluoride left, which they intend to put in the drinking water because otherwise the chemical requires an expensive disposal process.\n\nOnce it’s gone, ECUA will not order more of the product.\n\nCampbell says the utility company uses about 750 gallons of fluoride a week in public drinking water at a cost of about $340,000 a year.\n\nECUA says about $190,000 of that number is the cost of the chemical itself. The remaining cost is in operations, including pump and tank maintenance and occasional replacement, as well as equipment and fuel for delivery to the wells each month.\n\nThat money will now be spent on the granular, active carbon filters used to remove PFOA’s and PFAS in the water.\n\nCarbon filters are installed on local wells to clean pollution. ECUA won a bellwether lawsuit in 2023 against 3M and other companies that sold products with cancer causing chemicals like PFOA and PFOS, which made their way into the water supply.\n\nMoney ECUA received from the lawsuit is being used to pay for and maintain the expensive filtration system and the money previously spent on fluoride will help cover some of those costs.\n\nCampbell says ECUA had intended to put the issue of keeping fluoride in water supplies back on the ballot in response to the revived debate, but now that won’t be necessary.\n\nVoters approved fluoride in 1998: 58% of Escambia voted to add fluoride to water in 1998, and could be asked again\n\nWhen nearly 60% of Escambia County voters approved adding fluoride to drinking water in 1998, Campbell says ECUA was lauded by the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency for a decision that was then considered “the best thing we did for public health in a hundred years.”\n\n“Times change,” Campbell said. “There's now fluoride in toothpaste.

The News Journal archives show the opinion pages that year were full of largely the same arguments being made today on both sides of the issue.\n\nDave Murzin is a former state legislator and member of the ECUA Citizens’ Advisory Committee. As the son of a dentist who supported fluoride in drinking water as a lower-cost alternative to improve public health, Murzin said he also supports keeping it in the water especially for people who can’t afford dental care or items like toothpaste.\n\n“Not everybody has the availability of toothpaste,” Murzin said. “Some kids don't have access to fluoride and dental treatments and going to the dentist every six months, so fluoride in the water was one of those things that helped kids and their teeth. I think overall it would be a great benefit to keep it in there, but these days in the Florida Legislature we’re doing interesting things.”\n\nFellow ECUA Citizens’ Advisory Committee member Dean Kirschner has mixed feelings about the issue. He said while he supports tooth decay prevention for people, especially children, he also supports government implementing the will of the people.\n\n“I'm not a scientist,” Kirschner said. “I don't really know. It seems to me that there are enough people who would rather not have fluoride than people who would rather have fluoride, and I think enough pressure was put on the legislature to stop the fluoride and in that regard, it's probably a good thing.”\n\nFluoride stopped then reinstated in some cities\n\nAccording to reports in some dental and scientific publications, cities in both America and Canada have previously stopped using fluoride in their water supplies, then later reintroduced it.\n\nSome discontinued its use because of cost, others over health concerns.\n\nFor example, Buffalo, New York, and Port Angeles, Washington, stopped and then resumed fluoridating their water.

But they also found these individuals were less susceptible to getting cavities, and in 1945 the first communities began adding controlled amounts of the mineral to their public water supply.\n\nBy 2010, about two-thirds of the U.S. population had access to the fortified tap water. People in these communities on average suffer from about 25% fewer cavities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC has recognized fluoridation as one of the nation’s most successful public health campaigns and estimates that it saves $6.5 billion in dental costs each year.\n\nWhy has fluoridation become controversial?\n\nSome people have viewed water fluoridation with skepticism since its inception.\n\nMore recently, the push to ban it has gained momentum with the publication of studies linking prenatal and childhood fluoride exposure to lower IQ scores. Other researchers have found no evidence the mineral has negative cognitive impacts.\n\nKennedy, a vocal opponent of fluoridation, has also helped vault the issue into the public discourse, and some states have already been taking action. Utah in March decided to ban public water fluoridation, and Florida is poised to do the same.\n\nThe ADA has denounced these reforms and insisted that fluoridation is safe and effective.\n\nTo find out if your water contains added fluoride, you can look up information about your supplier using a CDC search tool.\n\nBethany Rodgers is a USA TODAY Network Pennsylvania investigative journalist.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/09"}]}

The production engaged with multiple communities statewide, including El Reno, Chickasha, Midwest City, Spencer, Kingfisher, Calumet, Hinton, Fairview, Okarche, Kremlin, Burbank and Pawhuska.\n\nIn addition to the state’s film program, the production also used local film incentives administered by the newly launched Oklahoma City Film & Creative Industries Office, along with certified soundstage infrastructure at downtown OKC's Prairie Surf Studios.\n\nHow is 'Twisters' predicted to perform at the box office?\n\n\"Twisters\" is predicated to hit big at the box office.

There are so many factors behind what makes a movie a box-office success and those factors have changed since the earliest days of cinema.\n\nFrom Hollywood to Seoul: How #MeToo is upending Asian entertainment industries\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nDisney bought Marvel for $4 billion: It’s made over $18 billion since\n\nFor one, consumers have many more choices of what to spend their money on when it comes to entertainment. Even if you exclude sporting events, concerts and at-home entertainment such as streaming services and video games, just the sheer number of options of what movie to see in theaters is so much larger than 50 years ago.\n\nFor that reason, a film like “Gone With the Wind” sold more than 200 million tickets over the course of its initial release and additional seven re-releases in the U.S. For comparison, Disney’s “Endgame” sold around 94.8 million tickets domestically since its release in April.\n\nThe content of movies has also changed drastically. Three-hour dramas about the lives of Southerners during the Civil War wouldn’t be as popular in 2019 as they were in, say, 1939. So, it would be difficult to say with certainty that a film that thrived decades ago would still do so today.\n\nAnother major reason that Hollywood doesn’t adjust for inflation is the number of foreign markets films are now released in. Analysts would have to dive into each global market to determine the inflation rate in each country, a task that is nearly impossible considering most films are released in more than 100 markets during their initial run.\n\nStill, it’s an interesting exercise. So, CNBC contacted Comscore, a media measurement and analytics company, to work out how an adjusted figure could be determined. Paul Dergarabedian and his team devised a method wherein they divided the average ticket price for the year a film was released into the film’s gross to determine the estimated number of tickets the film would have sold. Of course, this gets tricky, especially considering so many high-grossing films are re-released long after their initial debut.\n\nFor instance, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” was released in theaters in 1937, 1983, 1987 and 1993. So for these films, Comscore used the average ticket price for each of those different years and divided them into the gross for each re-release.\n\nTo be sure, this isn’t a perfect method. Average ticket prices are just that, an average. There’s no way to break down the price of IMAX screenings and 3D screenings, or pricing based on region.\n\nNot to mention, ticket prices vary by year. In 2017, the average ticket price was $8.97. In 2018, it was $9.11. This year, it is $9.01. So if this adjustment had been done last year, the numbers would have been significantly higher.\n\nThat being said, here are the top 10 highest-grossing films in the U.S. if Hollywood did adjust the box office, based on modern ticket prices:\n\n10. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937)\n\nEstimated admissions: 109 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $982 million\n\nSince 1937, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” has garnered around $184.9 million at the domestic box office. The film was the first full-length animated feature from Disney.\n\nThe film has been re-released at least three times and made more money from those re-releases than it did from its initial 1937 release.\n\nComscore determined that since its debut, around 109 million tickets have been sold. At today’s average ticket price, the film would have made nearly $1 billion in the U.S.\n\n9. 'The Exorcist' (1973)\n\nEstimated admissions: 116.5 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.04 billion\n\nOne of only six horror films to be nominated for the Academy Award for best picture, “The Exorcist” has hauled in more than $232.9 million since its 1973 debut.\n\nThe film made the bulk of its money during its initial release. It was brought back to theaters in 2000 and 2010 with extended scenes.\n\nAdjusted for today’s ticket prices, “The Exorcist,” which sold an estimated 116.5 million tickets, would have made around $1.04 billion.\n\n8. 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)\n\nEstimated admissions: 124.6 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.12 billion\n\nReleased only in 1965, “Doctor Zhivago” earned $112.1 million during its run in theaters and won five Academy Awards.\n\nIt’s estimated that around 124.6 million tickets were sold for the film. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, that would be around $1.12 billion at the box office.\n\n7. 'Jaws' (1975)\n\nEstimated admissions: 128 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.15 billion\n\nSteven Spielberg’s “Jaws” was released in theaters in 1975 and earned $260 million. Like “The Exorcist,” it is one of six horror movies to be nominated for best picture. It did not win the award, however.\n\nComscore estimates that around 128 million tickets were sold during the film’s run. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.15 billion at the box office.\n\n6. 'The Ten Commandments' (1956)\n\nEstimated admissions: 131 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.18 billion\n\nThe 3-hour-and-40-minute feature debuted in 1956 and earned $65.5 million.\n\nThe iconic film, which featured famed actors Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses II, sold an estimated 131 million tickets during its run. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.18 billion at the U.S. box office.\n\n5. 'Titanic' (1997)\n\nEstimated admissions: 143.5 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.29 billion\n\n“Titanic” is regarded as one of the best films in industry history and is also one of the highest-grossing. Without adjusting for inflation, James Cameron’s masterpiece is the sixth highest-grossing film in the U.S. and the third-highest grossing film globally.\n\nThe film has been re-released twice in addition to its initial run, once in 3D and once to celebrate its 20th anniversary. During those runs, the film earned $658.6 million domestically.\n\nIt’s estimated that “Titanic” sold around 143.5 million tickets. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.29 billion at the U.S. box office.\n\n4. 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' (1982)\n\nEstimated admissions: 147.9 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.33 billion\n\nThe four-time Academy Award-winning “E.T.” hauled in $434.9 million since it was first released in 1982. Although it was re-released twice, once in 1985 and once in 2002, the film made the bulk of its earnings during its debut.\n\n“E.T.” sold an estimated 147.9 million tickets, which translated to around $1.33 billion in ticket sales using today’s average ticket price.\n\n3. 'The Sound of Music' (1965)\n\nEstimated admissions: 157.2 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.41 billion\n\n“The Sound of Music” was released twice in theaters. Once was its 1965 debut, where it made the bulk of its $158.8 million haul in the U.S., the other was a 2018 re-release.\n\nComscore estimated that the film, which won five Academy Awards, sold around 157.2 million tickets. That is around $1.41 billion when adjusted for today’s ticket prices.\n\n2. 'Star Wars' (1977)\n\nEstimated admissions: 178.1 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.6 billion\n\n1977′s blockbuster “Star Wars” has been reissued at least twice since its initial debut and has earned $460.9 million at the U.S. box office.\n\nIn the last four decades, the film has sold an estimated 178.1 million tickets, which equates to around $1.6 billion at the modern domestic box office.\n\n1. 'Gone With the Wind' (1939)\n\nEstimated admissions: 201 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.81 billion\n\n“Gone With the Wind” has been re-released at least seven times since its initial debut in 1939, Comscore said. During that time, it has grossed around $203 million.\n\nHowever, its popularity has resulted in more than 201 million tickets being sold in the last 80 years. If all of those tickets had been bought today, the film would have grossed around $1.8 billion at the domestic box office.\n\n©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

And while the box office belonged for a second time to “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” got off to a strong start in Apple Studios’ first major theatrical gambit.\n\nAfter a record-breaking opening weekend of $92.8 million, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” took in an estimated $31 million over the weekend from 3,855 locations, according to AMC Theaters. In an unconventional deal, the theater chain is distributing Swift’s concert film, and playing it only Thursdays through Sundays.\n\nMost Swifties rushed to see the film on opening weekend, when a large percent of sales were driven by advance ticketing. Sales dropped a steep 67% in its second weekend, potentially signifying that “The Eras Tour” was predominantly an opening-weekend phenomenon.\n\nBut “The Eras Tour” has still proved to be a movie event unlike any other. Within days, it became the highest grossing concert film ever in North America, not accounting for inflation. It’s quickly accumulated $129.8 million domestically.\n\nMore was riding on “Killers of the Flower Moon,” a historical crime drama about a string of murders against the Osage nation in the early 1920s. The film, which cost at least $200 million to make, is the largest production yet from Apple Studios. The streamer partnered with Paramount Pictures to release Scorsese’s adaptation of David Grann’s bestseller in 3,628 theaters, with plans to later stream it on a not-yet-announced date on Apple TV+.\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon” debuted with $23 million, marking the third best opening for the 80-year-old Scorsese, following “Shutter Island” ($41 million in 2010) and “The Departed” ($26.9 million in 2006). Though Scorsese’s latest opus, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, will have a hard road to reaching profitability, it’s a successful launch for a 206-minute-long adult-skewing drama – a type of movie that, outside “Oppenheimer,” has struggled mightily at the box office in recent years.\n\nAnd “Killers of the Flower Moon,” with rave reviews, an “A-” CinemaScore from audiences and the backing of a robust Oscar campaign, should continue to play well over the long haul. It added $21 million overseas.\n\n“Killer of the Flower Moon” also marks the best wide-release debut for a film from a streaming company. While Netflix (which backed Scorsese’s last narrative feature, “The Irishman,” in 2019) has charted a mostly limited approach to theatrical release, Apple and Amazon, which last year closed its purchase of MGM, have pursued more expansive theatrical strategies.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple said it plans to spend $1 billion a year making movies that will have theatrical releases before reaching its streaming service. Apple is also behind Ridley Scott’s upcoming “Napoleon,” with Joaquin Phoenix, which Sony Pictures will distribute Nov. 22; and has partnered with Universal for Matthew Vaughn’s “Argylle,” due out Feb. 2.\n\nParamount had initially signed on to produce and distribute “Killers of the Flower Moon,” but transitioned into the deal with Apple when costs of project — shot during the pandemic — rose.\n\n“If ‘flexibility’ is the new mantra of the theatrical movie business, then this is a significant success — it establishes a viable option for the companies,” David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, said of the “Killers of the Flower Moon” launch.\n\nAs dissimilar as “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” and “Killers of the Flower Moon” are, they’re alike in their extended run times. A double feature of the weekend’s top two movies would have taken six hours and 14 minutes, not counting ads and trailers.\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon\" also reeled in more young moviegoers than one might have expected. Paramount said 44% of ticket buyers were under the age of 30.\n\n“Exorcist: The Believer,” the horror sequel directed by David Gordon Green, came in a distant third with $5.6 million in its third weekend of release. The Universal, Blumhouse film has grossed $54.2 million domestically.\n\n“PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie” came in at No. 4 with $4.5 million in its fourth weekend. The fifth spot went to the rerelease of Tim Burton's “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” which collected $4.1 million 30 years after it first landed in theaters.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday are for U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” $31 million.\n\n2. “Killers of the Flower Moon,” $23 million.\n\n3. “The Exorcist: Believer,” $5.6 million.\n\n4. “Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie,” $4.5 million.\n\n5. “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” $4.1 million.\n\n6. “Saw X,” $3.6 million.\n\n7. “The Creator,” $2.6 million.\n\n8. “Leo: Bloody Sweet,” $2.1 million.\n\n9. “A Haunting in Venice,” $1.1 million.\n\n10. “The Blind,” $1 million.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the weekend gross of “Exorcist: The Believer” to $5.6 million and the weekend gross of “Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie” to $4.5 million.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/07/06/transformers-avatar-50-most-expensive-movies-ever-made/762931002/", "title": "From 'Transformers' to 'Avatar,' 50 most expensive movies ever made", "text": "Charles Stockdale and John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThanks to technological developments, shooting a movie is easier than ever before. Despite this, Hollywood has produced some of the most expensive films ever made over the last two decades.\n\nThese mega-budget films generally pay off from the studio’s perspective.

Since the rise of the “blockbuster\" Hollywood has trended towards producing a small number of movies that are extremely costly rather than many movies with smaller budgets. Not only do these big-ticket films frequently perform extremely well at the box office, but also they are more likely to produce other successful streams of revenue, such as merchandise.\n\nNeed a break?

There are four films from the Pirates of the Caribbean series, three Hobbit movies, and three installments of Transformers. Once a franchise has developed a devoted following, it becomes less risky for the studio to put money into a new installment because the fans will likely show up.\n\nThe growing importance of international markets also certainly has influenced Hollywood’s economic model. Some 23 of the 50 most expensive movies actually lost money in the domestic market.

Cleopatra (1963)\n\nProduction budget: $260,722,614\n\nWorldwide gross: $440,745,371\n\n“Cleopatra” is the yardstick by which Hollywood budget disasters are measured.

VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nProduction budget: $314,876,938\n\nWorldwide gross: $2,118,383,192\n\nAbout $40 million in production budget went to paying stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher.\n\n4.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007)\n\nProduction budget: $348,057,713\n\nWorldwide gross: $1,117,753,031\n\n“Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” was the costliest movie ever made when it was released in 2007 because of rising location, special effects, and star costs.\n\n2. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)\n\nProduction budget: $444,142,183\n\nWorldwide gross: $1,131,084,842\n\nOne of the biggest costs of making this fourth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was paying for staff and actors. Star Johnny Depp is believed to have received $55 million.\n\n1. Avatar (2009)\n\nProduction budget: $478,792,250\n\nWorldwide gross: $3,136,279,608\n\nAvatar is the most expensive movie ever made, with $150 million spent on marketing and promotion alone.

And while the box office belonged for a second time to “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” got off to a strong start in Apple Studios’ first major theatrical gambit.\n\nAfter a record-breaking opening weekend of $92.8 million, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” took in an estimated $31 million from 3,855 locations, according to AMC Theaters. In an unconventional deal, the theater chain is distributing Swift’s concert film, and playing it only Thursdays through Sundays.\n\nMost Swifties rushed to see the film on opening weekend, when a large percent of sales were pre-sold. Sales dropped a steep 67% in its second weekend, potentially signifying that “The Eras Tour” was predominantly an opening-weekend phenomenon.\n\nBut “The Eras Tour” has still proved to be a movie event unlike any other. Within days, it became the highest-grossing concert film ever in North America, not accounting for inflation. It’s quickly accumulated $129.8 million domestically.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMore was riding on “Killers of the Flower Moon,” a historical crime drama about a string of murders against the Osage Nation in the early 1920s. The film, which cost at least $200 million to make, is the largest production yet from Apple Studios. The streaming service released Scorsese’s adaptation of David Grann’s best-selling book in 3,628 theaters, with plans to stream it on a not-yet-announced date on Apple TV+.\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon” debuted with $23 million, marking the third best opening for the 80-year-old director following “Shutter Island” ($41 million in 2010) and “The Departed” ($26.9 million in 2006). Though Scorsese’s latest opus, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, will have a hard road to reaching profitability, it’s a successful launch for a 206-minute-long adult-skewing drama – a type of movie that, outside “Oppenheimer,” has struggled mightily at the box office in recent years.\n\n“Killer of the Flower Moon” also marks the best wide-release debut for a film from a streaming company. With rave reviews, an A- CinemaScore from audiences and the backing of a robust Oscar campaign, the movie should continue to play well over the long haul.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple said it plans to spend $1 billion a year making movies that will have theatrical releases before reaching the streaming service. Apple is also behind Ridley Scott’s upcoming “Napoleon,” starring Joaquin Phoenix, which will be in theaters Nov. 22, and Matthew Vaughn’s “Argylle,” expected Feb. 2.\n\n“If ‘flexibility’ is the new mantra of the theatrical movie business, then this is a significant success − it establishes a viable option for the companies,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, of the “Killers of the Flower Moon” launch.\n\nAs dissimilar as “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” and “Killers of the Flower Moon” are, they’re alike in their extended run times. A double feature of the weekend’s top two movies would take 6 hours and 14 minutes, not counting ads and trailers.\n\nTaylor Swift 'Eras' movie review: Concert film a thrilling revisit of her live spectacle\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon” also reeled in more young moviegoers than might have been expected: 44% of ticket buyers were under the age of 30.\n\n“The Exorcist: Believer,” the horror sequel directed by David Gordon Green, came in a distant third with $6.7 million in its third weekend. The film has grossed $54.2 million domestically.\n\n“PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie” came in at No. 4 with $4.3 million in its fourth weekend. The fifth spot went to the re-release of Tim Burton’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” which collected $4.1 million 30 years after it first landed in theaters.\n\n‘Maybe we’re all capable of this’: Martin Scorsese on chilling ‘Killers of the Flower Moon'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2022/07/05/the-gray-man-movie-netflix-book-author-mark-greaney-memphis/7710707001/", "title": "'The Gray Man': Meet Mark Greaney, Memphis author behind books ...", "text": "About a thousand copies of Mark Greaney books sell each day, according to the Memphis author.\n\nThat's a staggering number — and it's likely to jump dramatically this month, for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, Tuesday is the release date for Greaney's 20th novel, \"Armored.\"\n\nAccording to a synopsis on the author's website, the book is an \"explosive new action-adventure\" in which \"a rag-tag team of American security contractors fight for their lives in Mexico's mountainous cartel country.\"\n\nSecond, the first Greaney-inspired movie arrives soon — and it's a big one.\n\nDestined to propel Greaney awareness into what the author calls \"uncharted territory,\" \"The Gray Man\" hits theaters July 15 and makes its Netflix debut July 22. The movie is adapted from the first of 11 novels that showcase the action-espionage talents of Greaney's signature hero, the so-called \"Gray Man,\" a CIA agent turned assassin-for-hire.\n\n'The Gray Man' movie\n\n\"The Gray Man\" is being launched as the opening shot in what Netflix hopes will become a salvo: an action-adventure franchise to rival Jason Bourne and the Tom Cruise \"Mission: Impossible\" films.\n\nWith a production budget of $200 million, \"The Gray Man\" is the most expensive movie yet from Netflix. But what has raised expectations is not the film's budget but its pedigree: It was produced and directed by Marvel-associated brothers Joe and Anthony Russo, who previously helmed some of the biggest blockbusters of all time, including \"Avengers: Endgame\" (No. 2 on the all-time U.S. box-office chart), \"Avengers: Infinity War\" (No. 6) and two \"Captain America\" movies.\n\nThe cast is similarly high-powered. Ryan Gosling stars as Court Gentry, the \"Gray Man,\" while the former Captain America, Chris Evans, is Gentry's psychopathic nemesis, Lloyd Hansen. Supporting players include Alfre Woodard and Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nGreaney already has topped the New York Times best-seller list, but \"we really expect this will kick him up a serious notch,\" said Tom Colgan, Greaney's New York-based career-long editor at Berkley.\n\n\"No matter what we do in making people aware of the Gray Man, we can’t beat what a movie or TV show does,\" Colgan said. \"There are going to be people who have never heard of the Gray Man before they see the movie, but when they realize it's based on a book, we think many of them will want to read that book. And once they do, they'll be hooked — and then they've got 10 years of books to go through.\"\n\nTo meet the expected demand, two different paperback movie tie-in editions of \"The Gray Man\" become available July 12. Reading the blurbs printed on the opening pages suggest readers should beware of more than paper cuts.\n\n\"Jack Reacher\" creator Lee Child describes the 2009 novel as \"hard, fast and unflinching,\" while techno-thriller writer James Rollins compares it to \"a well-honed dagger: sharp, merciless, and deadly.\" Rollins adds that the book \"strikes with the impact of a bullet to the chest.\" Ouch.\n\n'He knows what he's writing about'\n\nIn any event, Greaney, 54, knows his way around bullets and the instruments that discharge them.\n\nUnlike some armchair adventurers whose names decorate book spines, Greaney — pronounced \"Grainy,\" not \"Greeny\" — is an inveterate world traveler.\n\n\"I like to get my own impression of a place and the people and the politics and how their police work,\" said Greaney, who has traveled for his books to such locales as China, Russia and what he calls \"probably the most dangerous space in the Western hemisphere,\" the drug cartel-influenced territory near the Mexican state of Sinaloa.\n\nAs a tall (6-foot-3), physically fit, cleancut and not exactly young lone male poking around off-the-beaten path locations, Greaney sometimes attracts attention, he said, including suspicious looks, tails and bugs. \"When I was in China working on a book, they know the books I write, they know it's going to be about Chinese intelligence or war with China, so, yes, they listen,\" he said, referring to listening devices he said were found in his hotel room and a car for tourists. \"Of course, maybe they listen to everybody.\"\n\nHe also has had extensive training in firearms, close combat, stunt driving and battlefield medicine. If you need a tourniquet to stop the bleeding or pneumothoracic treatment because you've been shot through the lung, Greaney can help, he says.\n\n\"The thing that sets Mark apart is his work ethic,\" said Colgan, 60, an editor for 30 years at Berkley/Penguin/Random House, where he specializes in mysteries and thrillers (his client list includes another Memphis author, Joshua Hood). \"He never takes the easy way out. It certainly pays off in his writing. He knows what he's writing about.\"\n\nLike such other popular fiction writers as Stephen King and Nora Roberts, Greaney is no slouch: He has published 20 novels in 13 years.\n\nEleven of these are \"Gray Man\" books, which carry such genre-identifying titles as \"Gunmetal Gray,\" \"Mission Critical\" and \"Ballistic.\"\n\nHe also wrote seven books in association with techno-thriller superstar Tom Clancy and the Clancy estate; three of these were billed as collaborations with Clancy, while the other four continued various Clancy series after that author's 2013 death. Greaney was introduced to Clancy by Colgan, who also was Clancy's editor; the connection greatly expanded Greaney's audience. \"It gets your name out there,\" Greaney said.\n\nGreaney also has penned two stand-alone novels, \"Armored,\" and 2019's \"Red Metal,\" a collaboration with H. Ripley Rawlings IV, a lieutenant colonel in the Marines. Like most Greaney books, \"Red Metal\" is speculative but grounded in persuasive political theory and factual geography and history; in this case, the plot anticipates the current Ukraine chaos by imagining a Russian invasion beyond its Western border.\n\nThe books generally range from 150,000 to 217,000 words in length. \"Armored,\" which retails for $28, is close to 500 pages. \"My problem isn't making them too short,\" Greaney said.\n\nColgan praised Greaney's technique, which a New York Times reviewer described as \"so propulsive, so explosive, that flipping the pages feels like playing the ultimate video game.\"\n\n\"There's a sense of propulsion, but Mark knows exactly where those beats are,\" Colgan said. \"He knows when to stop and let the reader catch his breath and then move quickly again.”\n\nA White Station High, Memphis State alum\n\nA lifelong Memphian whose local-legend father, the late Ed Greaney, spent more than half a century in news and public affairs at WMC-TV Channel 5, Greaney grew up on Cole Road, \"so I've made it about a mile, as the crow flies,\" he said. He now occupies a large home on a street in the heart of East Memphis that in the past decade has seen many of its 1960s ranch houses replaced with greatly expanded residences. He shares the home with his wife, Allison Anthony Greaney, a painter; his three teenaged stepchildren, Ava, Sophie and Kemmons; and four rescue dogs, named Lobo, Ziggy, Winnie and Mars.\n\nHe used to write at Starbucks, but he's too recognizable to do that now, he said: He can't get much work done because of the interruptions from readers and would-be authors seeking career advice. Instead, he writes in a large back house that is located past the swimming pool and decorated by his wife in what Greaney calls \"masculine\" fashion, with carved tusks, sculpted greyhounds, and an antler chandelier. One wall is dedicated to mementos and photographs of his father.\n\nThe wide couches and comfortable chairs allow Greaney to stretch his left leg, when necessary: Surgery after a soccer injury when he was in his early 30s left him with partial paralysis of that limb, a condition that scuttled his adulthood dream of joining the military. \"I turn myself into RoboCop below the left knee,\" he said, brandishing an orthopedic brace.\n\nBOOKS FOR YOUNG READERS: Meet Kathlyn J. Kirkwood, a South Memphis native who helped make MLK Day a federal holiday\n\nA 1985 graduate of White Station High School, Greaney majored in political science and international relations at what was then known as Memphis State University. \"Decades later, it proved useful,\" he commented, referring to the plots of his novels.\n\nAfter college, he spent years in the international import/export business, all the while continuing his lifelong habit of reading nonfiction books about the military and law enforcement. He began to pursue fiction writing seriously in the 2000s, and wrote three novels that remain unpublished. But they showed promise, and Greaney was able to acquire an agent, who brought Greaney's fourth completed book, \"The Gray Man,\" to the attention of Berkley. The first edition was a mass-market paperback.\n\nThe book sold well, leading to Greaney's longtime association with Berkley and earning him the opportunity to be the first author to extend the Clancy franchise. What's more, movie rights to \"The Gray Man\" sold before it even was published, \"so I've spent the entire length of my career waiting for this movie.\"\n\nMeanwhile, \"Armored\" has been optioned by Sony Pictures and \"Transformers\" director Michael Bay. \"It's basically half 'Apocalypse Now' and half 'Black Hawk Down,'\" Greaney says of the book. \"There's a lot of action but also a mysterious atmosphere.\"\n\nAll the while, Greaney has worked to stay current on technology and military strategy. He annually visits Tactical Response, a Camden, Tennessee-based company that provides \"the highest end firearms and tactical training possible to the legally armed,\" according to its website. As a successful author, \"I'm a novelty there now, but I started going even before my first book came out,\" he said.\n\n'Extraordinarily satisfied' with Netflix movie\n\nGreaney said he wasn't actively involved in the production of \"The Gray Man,\" although he met with the Russos to discuss the project before the start of shooting (an appropriate term, in this case, considering the movie's rat-a-tat firepower).\n\nHe said he's \"extraordinarily satisfied\" with the movie, based on what he's seen so far. \"The promises made to me by the Russo brothers, they absolutely lived up to everything they said they were going to do, which I didn't expect. They capture the heart and the soul of the story.\"\n\n\"Heart\" is a key to the character, according to Colgan.\n\n\"Unlike James Bond, stuff does not always go the way he planned,\" Colgan said. \"In a Gray Man story, he has all these obstacles to overcome, and he just keeps pushing.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to think about the psychology of someone who would be in this situation,\" said Greaney, pointing out that his assassin hero sleeps in a closet instead of a bed because of his \"paranoia issues.\"\n\n\"Every novel stands on its own, but there is a character arc,\" Greaney said. \"He's gotten a little more cynical but he's also gotten a little more adept at navigating relationships.\"\n\nGreaney and his wife are schedule to attend \"The Gray Man\" world premiere in Los Angeles on July 13. If the movie is a success, that trip could mark the start of many visits to Hollywood for the author. Even so, Greaney said he plans to remain in Memphis. \"I love to travel, I love to leave,\" he said. \"But I love to come back.\"\n\nMark Greaney\n\n\"Armored\": Greaney will give a talk and sign copies of his new novel at 2 p.m. Saturday, July 9, at Novel at 387 Perkins Ext.

Some industry analysts believe the film could break the $200 million opening barrier, which would make it the ninth film ever to do so.\n\nThe film made $90 million on Friday, its opening day, which included Thursday previews. That’s the 7th biggest opening day ever, and already tops the entire opening weekend of the original “Doctor Strange” film in 2016. The film has already made $229 million globally, per Disney (DIS).\n\nSuch a strong start could create some momentum at a time when theaters are finding themselves in a stronger position than they’ve been since the start of the pandemic.\n\n“It’s hard to overstate the importance of this summer”\n\nThe summer of 2020 was a catastrophe for Hollywood.\n\nFilms were scarce (and nonexistent), as theaters struggled to turn on their marquees and the US box office brought in only $176 million, according to Comscore (SCOR).\n\nThat’s $176 million total for the entire summer, or $4.1 billion less than the summer of 2019, less than what “Doctor Strange” alone could make this weekend. The movie business rebounded last summer, bringing in $1.7 million domestically, but it still lagged behind pre-pandemic numbers.\n\nThe box office so far this year is catching up, and it’s showing signs of recovery with hits like February’s “Uncharted,” March’s “The Batman” and April’s “Sonic The Hedgehog 2” leading the way.\n\nThe summer slate of films could boost the good box office vibes even more.\n\n“It’s hard to overstate the importance of this summer for the movie industry,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business. “We’ve seen clear demand for a return to big movies in theaters, but this summer presents the best test so far.”\n\nRobbins believes that the top earners of this summer may “approach or perhaps exceed pre-pandemic standards.”\n\nBeyond blockbuster Marvel films, which include “Doctor Strange” and July’s “Thor: Love and Thunder,” the summer is full of all types of films that could find success.\n\nThey start with “Top Gun: Maverick,” the sequel to the beloved 1986 action film starring Tom Cruise. “Jurassic World: Dominion,” is the latest entry in the dinosaur saga, and “Elvis,” a biopic about The King starring Tom Hanks as Col. Tom Parker. Notable family films include “Lightyear” from Pixar and “Minions: The Rise of Gru.” Then there’s “Nope,” Jordan Peele’s latest horror film.\n\nIt’s not just about money\n\n“We’re moving further away from a point when the pandemic alone can be blamed for under-performances,” Robbins said. “This summer may demonstrate how much balance there can be as the industry adapts and improves.”\n\nThat’s important not just for this summer’s box office, but for the rest of the year.\n\n“Summer has always been vitally important for theaters, and the success of these all-important 18 weeks sets the tone for the entire year’s performance,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN Business.\n\nHe noted that summer is “traditionally responsible for 40% on average of the annual box-office.”\n\nThis year the summer isn’t just about money, it’s about symbolism.\n\nThe pandemic is still ongoing and theaters have a long way to go before they truly bounce back. But analysts believe there’s reason for optimism.\n\n“The success the industry has seen so far this year is great news for theaters that have spent the past two years methodically and patiently creating building blocks of normalcy,” Dergarabedian said. “All of it was to get to something approaching a normal summer movie marketplace at the multiplex, and we may be finally getting there.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/12/03/beyonce-renaissance-debuts-number-1-box-office/71792273007/", "title": "Queen Bey's 'Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé' reigns at the box ...", "text": "Lindsey Bahr\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nBeyoncé ruled the box office this weekend.\n\nHer concert picture, “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” opened in first place with $21 million in North American ticket sales, according to estimates from AMC Theatres Sunday.\n\nThe post-Thanksgiving, early December box office is notoriously slow, but “Renaissance” defied the odds. Not accounting for inflation, it’s the first time a film has opened over $20 million on this weekend in 20 years (since “The Last Samurai”).\n\nBeyoncé wrote, directed and produced “Renaissance,” which is focused on the tour for her Grammy-winning album. It debuted in 2,539 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 94 international territories, where it earned $6.4 million from 2,621 theaters.\n\n“On behalf of AMC Theatres Distribution and the entire theatrical industry, we thank Beyoncé for bringing this incredible film directly to her fans,” said Elizabeth Frank, AMC Theatres executive vice president of worldwide programming, in a statement. “To see it resonate with fans and with film critics on a weekend that many in the industry typically neglect is a testament to her immense talent, not just as a performer, but as a producer and director.”\n\nNeed a break?

No one expected “Renaissance” to match “The Eras Tour,” which is wrapping up its theatrical run soon with over $250 million globally. Prior to Swift, the biggest concert film debuts (titles held by Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber for their 2008 and 2011 films) had not surpassed the unadjusted sum of $32 million.\n\nThe 39-city, 56-show “Renaissance” tour, which kicked off in Stockholm, Sweden in May and ended in Kansas City, Missouri in the fall, made over $500 million and attracted over 2.7 million concertgoers. Swift’s ongoing “Eras Tour,” with 151 dates, is expected to gross some $1.4 billion.\n\nBoth Beyoncé and Swift chose to partner with AMC Theatres to distribute their films, as opposed to a traditional studio. Both superstars have been supportive of one another, making splashy appearances at the other’s premieres. Both had previously released films on Netflix (“Miss Americana” and “Homecoming”). And both are reported to be receiving at least 50% of ticket sales.\n\nMovie tickets to the show were more expensive than average, around $23.32 versus Swift’s $20.78, according to data firm EntTelligence.\n\nCritics and audiences gave “Renaissance” glowing reviews – it’s sitting at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and got a coveted A+ CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences who were polled. EntTelligence also estimates that the audience, around 900,000 strong, skewed a little older than Swift’s.\n\nLionsgate’s “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” fell to second place in its third weekend with an estimated $14.5 million. The prequel has now earned over $121 million domestically.\n\n“Godzilla Minus One\" took third place on the North American charts with $11 million from 2,308 locations — the biggest opening for a foreign film in the U.S. this year. The well-reviewed Japanese blockbuster distributed by Toho International cost only $15 million to produce and has already earned $23 million in Japan. Toho’s 33rd Godzilla film is set in the aftermath of World War II, stars Ryunosuke Kamiki and was directed by Takashi Yamazaki.\n\n“This year, we made a concentrated effort to answer the demand of the marketplace and make Godzilla globally accessible across many different platforms,” said Koji Ueda, President of Toho Global, in a statement.\n\n“Trolls Band Together” landed in fourth place in its third weekend with $7.6 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.8 million.\n\nFifth place went to Disney’s “Wish,” which fell 62% from its underwhelming first weekend, with $7.4 million from 3,900 locations. Globally, it’s now made $81.6 million. The studio’s other major film in theaters, “The Marvels” is also winding down in its fourth weekend with a disastrous global tally of $197 million against the reported $300 million it cost to make and market the superhero film.\n\nIn its second weekend, Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” earned an estimated $7.1 million from 3,500 locations. Produced by Apple Original Films and distributed by Sony Pictures, the film starring Joaquin Phoenix has now made $45.7 million domestically against a $200 million budget.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/media/pixar-box-office?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_newsbreak", "title": "Which Pixar film has rocketed to the top of the box office? | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPixar is one of the most popular brands in animation as well as one of the most important studios in Disney’s media kingdom. But it has been a while since audiences could go to a theater to see one of its films.\n\nAfter releasing its last three features directly on Disney+, the studio returns to the cineplex this weekend with “Lightyear” — a film based on the popular toy space ranger, Buzz Lightyear.\n\nSince 1995’s “Toy Story,” Pixar’s first major film, the studio’s movies have made $14.7 billion at the global box office. But which of its movies made the most?\n\nHere’s a list of the franchise’s biggest blockbusters at the US box office, adjusted for inflation, according to Comscore (SCOR).\n\n5. Toy Story 2\n\n\"Toy Story 2\" found box office success by bringing back everyone's favorite animated toys Disney/Pixar/Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nYear: 1999\n\nBox office haul: $245.8 million\n\nAdjusted for inflation: $445 million\n\nIt would’ve been difficult for “Toy Story 2” not to be a blockbuster, given that the film is the sequel to “Toy Story” — one of the most beloved animated movies of all time.\n\nThe second installment not only brought back popular characters Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), it also added new characters to Andy’s toy chest, including Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl (voiced by Joan Cusack.)\n\n“Toy Story 2” didn’t mess with the winning formula of the original and it paid off. The film was a hit with audiences and critics, garnering a perfect score on review site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n4. Toy Story 3\n\n\"Toy Story 3\" was the first Pixar film to make $1 billion at the global box office. Disney/Pixar/Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nYear: 2010\n\nBox office haul: $415 million\n\nAdjusted for inflation: $481.8 million\n\nIn 2010, Pixar producers had to ask themselves, would audiences still care about the adventures of Woody and Buzz more than a decade after “Toy Story 2”? The answer was a resounding, “yes.”\n\n“Toy Story 3” — which has the toys dealing with a grown up Andy who is on his way to college — was the first Pixar film to take in $1 billion worldwide and is regarded by many fans as one of the studio’s best.\n\nThe film was also nominated for Best Picture and won two Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Animated Film.\n\n3. Finding Dory\n\n\"Finding Dory\" recaptured the box office magic of \"Finding Nemo\" more than a decade later. Disney/Pixar/Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nYear: 2016\n\nBox office haul: $486.2 million\n\nAdjusted for inflation: $514.9 million\n\nSequels have been good to Pixar at the box office. Case in point: “Finding Dory.”\n\nThe sequel to “Finding Nemo” — released 13 years after the original — brought audiences back to Pixar’s underwater world. This time the focus shifted to finding Dory — the forgetful Blue Tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nThe film reeled in the biggest ever opening for an animated movie at the time, and was Pixar’s second film to gross $1 billion worldwide.\n\n2. Finding Nemo\n\n\"Finding Nemo\" is the only non-sequel in Pixar's top five highest-grossing films. Disney/Pixar/Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nYear: 2003\n\nBox office haul: $339.7 million\n\nAdjusted for inflation: $516 million\n\n“Finding Nemo” is the only non-sequel among Pixar’s top five highest-grossing films, and with good reason.\n\nThe film — which told the tale of clown fish Marlin trying to find his son Nemo — was a sensation with both kids and adults. Critics loved it too. Roger Ebert gave the movie four stars and said, “the use of color, form and movement make the film a delight even apart from its story.”\n\n“Finding Nemo” just kept swimming at the box office, turning into a classic and one of Pixar’s biggest hits.\n\n1. The Incredibles 2\n\n\"The Incredibles 2\" holds the largest opening for an animated film ever. Pixar Animation Studios/Walt Disney Pictures/Zuma Press\n\nYear: 2018\n\nBox office haul: $608.5 million\n\nAdjusted for inflation: $611.9 million\n\nRemember when I said sequels have been good to Pixar?\n\n“The Incredibles 2” — the next chapter in the story of a superhero family trying balance raising kids with saving the world — is Pixar’s highest-grossing title at the global box office, bringing in more than $1.2 billion worldwide.\n\nThe Brad Bird film also notched the biggest ever opening for an animated film, debuting to $182 million in 2018.\n\nOf course that’s no surprise, since if Disney is good at anything, it’s animation and superheroes.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}]}

Thanks to its ambitious-looking previews, I expected the first Destiny to weave this great big narrative tapestry while providing exciting public events that would have players from all over organically come together to take out a spawning big bad as you explore the game’s world.\n\nAs someone who likes MMOs and cooperative PVE shooting, Destiny 2 was one of my most anticipated games of 2014. Then the game came out with surprisingly sparse content, a story you find out about mostly off-game, and public matchmaking that was MIA. It almost felt like the gaming equivalent of clickbait.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe game would eventually get its second wind with the release of “The Taken King,” thanks to some notable improvements. By that time, however, Destiny continued to be hobbled by the shortcomings of that initial launch, at least in the minds of players who left the game.\n\nThis makes the launch of Destiny’s follow-up a crucial time for the fate of the franchise. The first Destiny sold well due to the goodwill that Bungie built up with the Halo franchise. The sour taste from the original game, however, means Destiny 2 doesn’t have as much wiggle room. It had to start out with a bang.\n\nAnd start out with a bang it did, literally, as the campaign thrusts you into the middle of an all-out assault on The Last City. Spearheading the charge against humanity’s final remaining bastion is the Red Legion, led by the Cabal Empire’s brutal and charismatic leader Dominus Ghaul. The battle ends up as a power struggle for the Traveler, more specifically, the Traveler's Light. For Guardians, the Light is a source of power literally and figuratively — a blessing that bestows strength and recognition of humanity as the Chosen race. For the Red Legion, it’s something to be controlled, a gift that’s currently wasted on an unworthy race.\n\nThe initial result of the battle pushes the narrative of Destiny 2 as the power play between the Guardians and the Red Legion unfolds. It also tackles the theme of the haves and the have-nots in multiple ways, not just in the form of who controls the Light between the Guardians and the Red Legion but between humans imbued with the Light and humans who never received its power in the first place. I won’t delve into the story beyond this to avoid spoiling it to folks who want to experience it on their own.\n\nNeedless to say, it feels that Destiny 2 has more storytelling in its first hour than the entire original game did when it launched. This is a plus for someone like myself who still likes to play shooters for their campaign. The improved storytelling and more purposeful narrative made me want to keep pushing through the campaign to see what happens even after I‘ve unlocked the privilege to do co-op and dabble in the game’s online features.\n\nAnother plus is the ability to bring over your character from the first game, provided you reached Level 20 and finished the Black Garden. Destiny 2 was able to detect my save file from the previous game on my PS4, though you pretty much only get to keep your look and not much else. After the initial battle, you will eventually unlock one of the new subclasses in the game depending on the class you are using. Since my previous character was the mage-style Warlock, I ended up rocking the Dawnblade subclass at first, which replaces the Sunsinger and can launch solar blades from a distance and create either a healing or empowering circle. You can also unlock previous subclasses such as the Voidwalker and Stormcaller, with a few tweaks. The warrior-like Titan and rogue-ish Hunter classes also get one new subclass each, as well as a couple of returning subclasses.\n\nOther familiar touches from the previous game include patrols, public events, Crucible PVP and, of course, Raids. Heroic Public Events, for example, are unlocked in real time during such events by fulfilling prerequisites such as destroying other key targets before taking down a public event’s main objective. This makes the game harder but also gives you better loot — a big raison d’etre for any Destiny player — and more Glimmer currency points if you complete the mission. Just like the first game, Destiny 2 also doesn’t truly start until you finish the story. Raids continue to be the epitome of challenge and cooperation, boasting multi-phase mechanics that require players to not only know what to do but also coordinate with the proper timing lest they fail an objective or end up with a team wipe. In the case of the first raid event, Leviathan, you will need to do things like step on and hold objective points and shoot the right portal openings, all the while trying to survive against tough foes.\n\nOne improvement over the original is the inclusion of Guided Games. It isn’t quite full-fledged public matchmaking but it’s a helpful feature for solo players looking to get into a group (or vice-versa) for tackling endgame content without having to join clans or gather up friends. Do be warned that playing with random groups can make it tougher to finish strikes or raids — especially the latter — due to the coordination that they require. Nevertheless, Guided Games are a nice option to have.\n\nIn addition to patching up some of the holes from the previous game, Destiny 2 also builds on the things that the first game excelled at. At the top of the list is the gunplay, which continues to be rock solid. As much as certain aspects of the original Destiny fell short, one thing that was great was the actual shooting gameplay, which felt nice and tight. Another is the game’s sound, which remains impressive in Destiny 2. While talking with a friend who loves the game, I asked if anything about Destiny 2 stood out to him in particular and he responded by saying, “wear headphones,” and there’s good reason for that. From its excellent musical score to the top-notch sound effects, audio is one department where Destiny 2 does not disappoint. The visuals, meanwhile, continue to impress and I quite liked seeing more traditional Earth environs in addition to the game’s familiar galactic locales.\n\nThat being said, the game also suffers from its share issues, some of new and some carried over from the previous game. Microtransactions, for example, feel just a bit more pervasive this time around. You can use real money to buy Silver, which you can then use to trade for Bright Engrams with NPC Tess Everis, for example. These Engrams can then be used for a chance to unlock special loot. This includes your typical cosmetics but they also can unlock things that can impact gameplay, including weapon and armor mods that improve your stats.\n\nTo be fair, you can eventually earn Bright Engrams in-game each time you level up after hitting Level 20. Anything that affects gameplay, however, is often seen as a dividing line between “harmless” microtransactions and those that influence players to use real money to acquire a gameplay advantage. It’s not as blatant as Evolve but folks who don’t like microtransactions likely won’t appreciate the move.\n\nAnother related change that’s seen as unfriendly to players involves shaders. Instead of unlocking them permanently, they are now treated as one-time use items that also have to be applied individually to each piece of armor or gear, meaning you need more of them to have a matching colored set. Granted, you can acquire a bunch of them through the course of playing the game. Nevertheless, it can still be seen by critics as a cynical ploy to nudge people toward paying for microtransactions to acquire shaders via special loot as well. This also ties into the loot earned in raids, which some feel don’t reward players enough items for the time investment required to do them successfully, especially when RNG is being miserly toward you. The result is that you’ll either need to spend real money for a chance at getting stuff earlier or grind even more, with the latter being something that can get out of hand in Destiny 2 as the time investment required can skyrocket quickly. Speaking of time, some campaign missions require you to be at a certain level, requiring you to, well, grind in order to progress the narrative. On the plus side, the overall grind doesn't feel as draining as the previous game, particularly for end game.\n\nOverall, Destiny 2 is a step in the right direction for Bungie’s current shooting franchise. As such, I look forward to see how the game grows and continues to iterate on its solid foundation.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nDestiny 2 is a welcome follow-up that rights several of the wrongs that tripped up the original game when it launched. The grind can admittedly be draining at times and its treatment of microtransactions will disappoint some players. It’s excellent gunplay, however, combined with a more fleshed out narrative and a nice selection of online activities to tackle either solo or with teammates brings the series closer to realizing its own destiny — pun so totally intended.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/11/12/call-duty-black-ops-3-review-blops-technobubble/75651750/", "title": "Pedal to metal: Call of Duty Black Ops 3 review | Technobubble", "text": "Jason Hidalgo\n\njhidalgo@rgj.com\n\nTechnobubble covers games, gadgets, technology and all things geek. Follow Technobubble poobah Jason Hidalgo's shenanigans on Twitter @jasonhidalgo\n\nWhat do you do when it feels like everything has already been done before?\n\nThat's the conundrum that faces the popular Call of Duty franchise every time it drops a new entry to an audience that's seen it all when it comes to the first-person shooter genre.\n\nFor the most part, every iteration of the modern Call of Duty franchise relies on baby steps. There may be a few changes with perks here or the presentation there but the base shooting experience itself feels largely unchained.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWith the genre now past the saturation point combined with the appearance of new challengers such as Titanfall that have tried to shake up the old shooter formula, the need to iterate with extra purpose is even more crucial for Call of Duty. In that sense, I can understand the decision to double down on last year's release by going the ultra modern warfare route with \"Call of Duty: Black Ops III.\" After all, to really change gameplay, you'll need new mechanics that perhaps can't be done through your regular soldier. The question now is whether that decision pays off without diluting what I consider one of the Black Ops series's biggest strengths: its campaign.\n\nFor its latest tale, Black Ops III skips past the more traditional Cold War vibe of its predecessors and goes all futuristic with a dash of the metaphysical. This time, you play the role of a cybernetically enhanced soldier — which comes with a selection of cool tech and enhancements while also raising questions about one's own humanity. The mechanical augments make their presence on the battlefield via a smart HUD that tracks foes and hot spots, for example, and also have the ability to hack machines and other tech on the field. To customize your experience, you can use cyber cores and rigs to further improve your capabilities.\n\nThe campaign gets a touch of law and order as well with the half-human, half amazing appearance of Christopher Meloni and his cybernetic parts. I pretty much started hearing a gavel sound effect in my head every time he popped up because, well, I'm a strange man, that's why. Although the campaign is competent and employs the top notch production values that have become Call of Duty's calling card, I must admit that it's the weakest of the Black Ops games to date. As someone who's a big fan of campaign modes in shooters, I just didn't feel the requisite emotional connection with Black Ops III's characters, with all the virtual stuff leading to an almost detached experience for me. Ultimately, it felt just like a typical shooter campaign, especially when compared to the excellent storytelling of the first Black Ops game. I do appreciate the co-op mode for the campaign, though, which allows up to four players to tackle missions together.\n\nIn contrast to the campaign, Black Ops III's multiplayer modes are the main strength of the game. Thanks to the addition of various features to the series' solid shooting mechanics, multiplayer provides a fresher experience instead of feeling like a complete rehash of past games. At the top of the list is the addition of specialists. Each come with their own unique skill sets and abilities from the bruiser-style Ruin to the assassination specialist Spectre. Each of the nine also can be ranked up individually in addition to universal and weapons experience progression, providing variations on the stock shooting experience.\n\nBeantown blues: Fallout 4 review | Technobubble\n\nBlizzcon 2015 recap: From Warcraft movie to Blizzard game updates | Technobubble\n\nTales From the Borderlands Episode 5: Vault of the Traveler review | Technobubble\n\nIt's a nice change from the archetypal grunt you typically get from past games. Mobility, for example, is enhanced with the addition of a \"chain movement\" system that includes thrusts jumps, slides and Titanfall style wall running. This adds both speed and verticality to the traditional shooter gameplay, which work well with the game's new multi-level maps. It's fun to dive underwater near your spawn point, for example, swim behind enemy lines, pop off three enemy soldiers from behind their back, then thrust and wall run your way to safety. The game also comes with a new gunsmith system for extra weapon customization as well as a paint shop that allows for custom graphics.\n\nZombies mode also gets a reworked noir-style story involving four social misfits in Morg City who have, uh, certain debts to society. Production values are improved over the past with the addition of some recognizable personalities in the mix. I remember playing with my little cousin and saying, \"Is it me or does that dude look like Ron Perlman?\" My cousin asked who Ron Perlman was and I said he's the guy with the fancy shoes who — spoiler alert — got eaten in Pacific Rim. Naturally, he answers \"Oh, you mean Hellboy.\" Yup, that's what I meant, too. Then I go, \"By the way, does that magician guy look like Jeff Goldblum or what?\" Then my cousin goes, \"Who's Jeff Goldblum?\" I think I'm starting to feel old.\n\nZombies mode adds an extra element of Will Ferrell-level strategery and the ability to transform into a powerful creature for some added oomph against the undead. You can also manually unlock new areas the farther you get in rounds, though this also requires paying attention to coordination as it's easy to get wiped out once your team gets separated. All in all, zombies mode provides a deeper experience that breathes new life to Black Ops' trademark skirmishes with the undead, especially with its new experience progression. As far as my main complaints with Zombies mode, these include long loading times and — at least during the first week of the game's release — annoying connection hiccups.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III flips the script a bit by serving what's arguably the weakest campaign in the Black Ops series but redeems itself with a fresher and more content-filled multiplayer with its online and zombie modes. The addition of new specialists and faster, more fluid movement within more layered maps adds plenty of extra polish to the game's traditional mechanics. Zombies mode also gets extra depth in terms of both production and gameplay. Although it doesn't revolutionize shooters per se, it's one of the more polished entries in the genre this generation.\n\nRating: 4 out of 5\n\n4 out of 5 Cost: $50-60; PC, PS3, PS4, X360, XB1 (Review based on PS4 version)\n\n$50-60; PC, PS3, PS4, X360, XB1 (Review based on PS4 version) https://www.callofduty.com/blackops3\n\nThe Game Vault: Technobubble Video Game Reviews", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/11/01/big-brother-titanfall-2-review-technobubble/93091882/", "title": "Big brother: Titanfall 2 review | Technobubble", "text": "Jason Hidalgo\n\njhidalgo@rgj.com\n\nTechnobubble covers games, gadgets, technology and all things geek.

But after playing shooter after shooter for years, the genre’s newer offerings just weren’t holding my interest like they used to. A lot of it had to do with the holding pattern that new shooters seem to be stuck in. With the exception of a few games like the original Titanfall, I just wasn’t seeing any key changes or new mechanics that really propelled shooters forward, even though they certainly showed high levels of polish.\n\nFor 2016, I was expecting more of the same. Then this little game called Doom came out. A modernized take on the shooting franchise that arguably started it all, Doom represented the most fun I’ve ever had in a shooting campaign in a long time. Still, I thought Doom would simply be the exception to the rule. I’ve seen many a genre enjoy its time in the limelight from side-scrolling action games to Japanese RPGs, only to give way to the next big thing. Why would shooters be any different?\n\nThen came Battlefield 1. Although its mechanics did not see a significant change overall, the decision to base its campaign and overall aesthetic on World War I proved to be a much welcome breath of fresh air. Suddenly, my list of fun shooters for the year have grown to two. But as they say, two is an accident. In order for something to be a trend, it has to happen three times, right?\n\nNeed a break?

Then again — to use a figure skating reference — even triple axels are passe, these days. To really get attention, you have to do a quadruple axel.\n\nThis brings us to Titanfall 2. Back in 2014, the first Titanfall game generated plenty of buzz thanks to its faster and more vertical gameplay for soldiers, as well as the addition of giant Titan robots that you can call down from the heavens. Although the game looked like the next big thing for first-person shooters, however, the decision to stay exclusive to one console ecosystem in Xbox, combined with the lack of a campaign, took out some of the luster from the game.\n\nBlast from the past: Battlefield 1 review | Technobubble\n\nHomecoming: Gears of War 4 review | Technobubble\n\nGive 'em hell: Doom (2016) review | Technobubble\n\nIt’s a problem that Titanfall 2 definitely learns from as it launches on both Microsoft and Sony systems right off the bat. In addition to being more console agnostic this time around, the sequel also ties a bow around a full-fledged campaign to satisfy folks such as myself who still place great value on story modes for shooters. I say that even as someone who scored the first game highly despite my deep disappointment in its lack of a campaign due to its forward-looking mechanics.\n\nAlthough Titanfall 2’s campaign appears to be the same one-man jaunt through hostile territory that’s seen in many a shooting campaign, this is actually a buddy adventure at its core — pun so totally intended. You start out as Frontier Militia rifleman Jack Cooper, a young, promising recruit who aspires to become a Titan pilot someday. During a battle with industrial conglomerate Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation, however, Cooper suddenly finds himself taking over the reigns of a classic Vanguard-class Titan known as BT-7274, or “BT” for short. Let’s just say it’s a good thing they didn’t pick DT, at least as far as the Japanese market goes. Anyway, Cooper’s unlikely transformation into a pilot kicks off a six-hour campaign where he tries to survive while unraveling the IMC’s secret plans. Along the way, Cooper develops a bond with his AI partner, which adds an extra dynamic over the lone wolf approach seen in other shooter protagonists.\n\nI found Titanfall 2’s campaign to be quite solid, overall, thanks to an interesting story and well-designed locales that show off its unique gameplay. While shooting campaigns tend to be flat for the most part and typically use stairs, platforms and elevators for level variety, Titanfall 2 builds in verticality into its level design and mechanics. In addition to double jumps, you also encounter plenty of gaps and spaces that require you to do wall runs and wall jumps, sometimes consecutively in order to get to from point A to point B. This makes movement a more essential part of the gameplay that’s actually both challenging and exciting thanks to the use of platforming mechanics. The game also plays faster than your typical modern first-person shooter. It’s not quite as fast the fun third-person shooter from Platinum, Vanquish — a criminally underrated title in my book — but it has a tiny bit of an arena shooter feel to it.\n\nDespite its faster speed, the actual shooting remains excellent and has that familiar rock-solid feel that you get from Respawn games and the Call of Duty series. While I typically prefer the large-scale multiplayer approach of Battlefield, including its use of vehicles, over Call of Duty’s multiplayer design, I actually preferred the feel of COD’s shooting mechanics. It just seems more solid and comfortable for me and that shooting feel is replicated here — no surprise given the Respawn team’s COD pedigree prior to its split with Activision.\n\nLike its predecessor, Titanfall 2 also brings more to the table in multiplayer over COD due to its additional mechanics, larger levels and inclusion of Titan gameplay. Titan gameplay does get a few tweaks in multiplayer mode this time to change things up. One is the more controversial decision to eliminate regenerating shields, which changes Titan combat. This makes stringing kills more difficult while also adding more importance to strength in numbers in Titan vs. Titan encounters.\n\nTied to the loss of shields is the addition of battery-stealing mechanics when rodeo-riding enemy Titans. Successfully doing so lets you steal a battery, that you can then give to a friendly Titan for a health boost. As a defense, Titan pilots can discharge smoke to rid themselves of pesky rodeo riders, which can be built up to stack. You can also try to reclaim batteries by killing foes after they steal them.\n\nTitan types, meanwhile, double up to six instead of the three from the first game. Examples include the Scorch, an incendiary-based unit that’s a bit reminiscent of the original Ogre. Other Titans specialize in defense or using rockets. Personally, my favorite is the Ronin, which has excellent melee capabilities and allows aggressive players to get up close and personal.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also quite plentiful, including objective-based ones for folks who want to be rewarded for doing things besides killing. You also have Titan-free Pilot vs. Pilot matches or pilot-free Last Titan Standing mode for folks who want to focus on Titan vs. Titan battling. One bit of good news for multiplayer lovers is that I had no issues with the game’s online servers post-launch, with matches running fluid without disconnects and interruptions.\n\nDownsides include enemy AI, which can be brain dead at times for both campaign and multiplayer. If you disliked the presence of AI grunts in online multiplayer before, they return in Titanfall 2 as well, though it’s admittedly nice to have them if you’re a new player trying to get used to the game or simply having a bad day against human players. I also wish multiplayer offered more in the way of stages that really took advantage of the built-in vertical gameplay to separate the game from other shooters. The platforming sections, while enjoyable for me, also can be frustrating for folks who don’t quite get the knack for it, especially when trying to chain wall runs and jumps together. All that being said, I actually enjoyed this game’s multiplayer the most out of all those good shooters I mentioned earlier.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nTitanfall 2 returns with a more complete package this time around by supplementing its faster, more vertical gameplay with a much needed campaign mode. The new campaign is a huge improvement over the patchwork story from the first game and a wider selection of Titans makes multiplayer feel more diverse. Changes in Titan health mechanics, admittedly, might be a mixed bag for online players and the game’s multiplayer maps don’t fully take advantage of your pilot’s penchant for going vertical. Overall, however, Titanfall 2 is a fun romp for folks thirsty for a shooting experience that’s different from the norm.\n\nRating: 4.25 out of 5​\n\n4.25 out of 5​ Cost: $59.99; PC, PS4 and XB1 (reviewed)​\n\n$59.99; PC, PS4 and XB1 (reviewed)​ https://www.titanfall.com\n\nThe Game Vault: Technobubble Video Game Reviews", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2013/06/25/james-bond-to-master-chief-5-video-games-that-changed-a-generation/37436311/", "title": "james-bond-to-master-chief-5-video-games-that-changed-a ...", "text": "Ryan Hill\n\ncollege.usatoday.com\n\n\n\n\n\nBy James Woodson\n\nVideo games have grown into their own separate culture but which games have changed the culture?\n\n\n\n\n\nPong\n\nThe Grand Theft Auto series\n\nThere has been a lot of negative attention and comments toward Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto series (GTA). It makes sense why parents of younger gamers see the series in a negative light. It’s crude, gory and whatever other violent adjective you can think of. Though, there is something compelling about being able to live out your criminal underworld fantasies. The game revolutionized the aspect of open-world gaming and role-play gaming. The GTA series revolutionized certain aspects of being able to interact with the world’s AI and environment. In other words, if you decide break laws, the police are going to react and attempt to arrest you. The series has sparked lots of lawsuits and scrutiny for Rockstar Games, but this has not stopped them from furthering the GTA franchise. Rockstar plans to release Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013.\n\nGoldenEye 007\n\nGoldenEye 007 was one of the early popular first-person shooter games. The game was released exclusively for Nintendo 64 in 1997, two years after the release of the eponymous James Bond movie. The game included iconic James Bond movie weapons such as the standard-issue Walther PPK and the Golden Gun. It sold over eight million copies worldwide and become the third best-selling N64 game of all time. The game set many standards for what is common in first-person shooter games today: various maps in “death match” multiplayer mode, zoomable sniper scopes and extensive mission objectives. Nintendo launched a successor to GoldenEye 007 for the Wii console in 2010, but it was not nearly as successful as the original.\n\n\n\nRELATED: College gamers react to Microsoft’s Xbox One reveal\n\nMadden NFL Football\n\nThe Madden NFL Football franchise is probably one of the most popular sports video game in the United States. The game began humbly in two-dimensions and featured pixelated figures moving rigidly up, down, left and right across a green block. It has evolved into 3-D players with fluid control of their movement, customization of how they move and detailed stadiums of NFL teams. The franchise was originally known as John Madden Football when it was first launched 1988. Madden was one of the first video games that featured commentary similar to the live game commentary of legendary broadcasters like Pat Summerall, Al Michaels and John Madden every Sunday and Monday night. The game was also one of the first game franchises to feature professional athletes on the cover. The game has become a part of real-life sports culture; ESPN has hosted Madden tournaments and competitions.\n\nMadden 25 is set to release Aug. 27.\n\nHalo series\n\nHalo’s revolutionary single player storyline was great in its own right, but what made Halo so successful was the multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode had a variety of maps and new game modes that had never been seen before. Halo’s strong multiplayer encouraged users to keep playing long after they had finished the campaign. Microsoft unleashed Xbox Live in 2002, significantly altering how the franchise developed its sequels and expansion series. The Xbox Live was first incorporated with Halo 2, giving rise to the phenomenon of online Halo multiplayer. It lead to tournaments and competitive gaming leagues that would pay the contestants based on how well they did. The main Halo franchise, centered on Master Chief John 117, came to a conclusion in 2011 with Halo 4, though there are spin-offs in development. The Halo franchise will release a third-person shooter game for Window 8 and Windows 8 Phones via download.\n\nCall Of Duty series\n\nThe Call of Duty game series was first released in 2003 as a first-person shooter based in World War II and entirely changed that genre of video games. Call of Duty started to simulate mission-based objectives as the infantry of various Allied forces. The franchise produced seven WWII era-based games but the Infinity Ward series reached its influential apex with the Modern Warfare expansion series. The Modern Warfare series, like Halo, expanded online multiplayer and incorporated a modern setting.\n\n\n\nRyan Hill is a summer intern at USA TODAY College.

That was my initial reaction to “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,” which returns not just with a familiar name but also brings back a familiar mode to boot.\n\nIt’s a welcome return to form for the franchise, which served up a less than complete experience last time. When I reviewed “Call of Duty: Black Ops 4” last year, I found the multiplayer experience to be the best I’ve ever seen in the franchise thanks to a diversity of options for its online modes. Unfortunately, that also came at the expense of a full-fledged story, which made it feel like, well, half a game.\n\nAs a result, I called BLOPS 4 “almost the best” COD game at the time. Yes, I know I’m probably one of the few gaming dinosaurs who want my shooters to come with a dedicated campaign but I honestly just don’t think that any shooter is complete without it.\n\nThis makes the return of story mode in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare an interesting development indeed. While Call of Duty continues to be a mammoth seller in the industry, the COD entries of this console generation haven’t quite reached the highs set by previous entries. As such, it wouldn’t be surprising if Activision is banking on the positive vibes associated with the Modern Warfare name to jumpstart the latest entry in the franchise. After all, the Modern Warfare name calls back to a time when the series didn’t quite have the baggage that builds up after 16 years of continuous releases. Add the fact that the game features crossplay and dumps the traditional season pass approach for free weapon and map updates and it appears that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is definitely trying to garner player goodwill. This is especially true following the widespread backlash against exploitative loot boxes that got kicked off by EA’s Star Wars Battlefront 2 game.\n\nThe question now is whether the latest game simply piggybacks on the Modern Warfare name or actually builds on it. As someone who’s played various iterations of the series throughout the years, the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has a more classic vibe to it. Yes, its visuals are certainly modern — no pun intended — boasting incredibly detailed facial modeling and highly polished production values that would make Michael Bay put on sunglasses with a smile. The gameplay and overall presentation, however, has that familiar boots-on-the-ground feel that older COD entries had, especially when it comes to the game’s campaign. For longtime fans who have been turned off by entries such as Advanced Warfare and Infinite Warfare, this truly feels akin to a homecoming of sorts.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIt’s also weird how the return to a more current timeline feels, well, refreshing. For the latest iteration, the soft reboot centers on a geopolitical conflict that should feel familiar to many folks in a post-9/11 world (or even a post-Soviet-Afghan War world). Urzikstan might be a fictional country. But the familiar themes of Middle East conflict, terrorism and foreign influence feels like it comes straight out of today’s uncomfortable reality from Afghanistan all the way to the plight of the Kurds. Whether it be the use of female freedom fighters or the interference of global powers in the Middle East’s highly volatile powder keg, Modern Warfare’s campaign pretty much puts a mirror — albeit one with Hollywood-style movie touches — that lets the player face the more inconvenient truths of today’s world. Here we are in 2019 and we still have humans committing atrocities and fighting Old World conflicts that make you question why we haven’t progressed past such incomprehensible acts as a species.\n\nGranted, what you get from the Modern Warfare campaign largely depends on your own world view. Even as the game takes several fictional liberties, it’s just hard not to decry the problems presented in Modern Warfare, especially as a once-idealistic and hopeful youngster who has now pretty much come to accept that these conflicts likely won’t be finished in my lifetime as I’ve gotten older. Admittedly, the story doesn’t quite reach the narrative prowess of “Spec Ops: The Line.” But it’s a story mode that is still much welcome for a campaign lover such as myself, especially with its embrace of more complicated, morally gray themes.\n\nMultiplayer, meanwhile, tries to add more variety to the series’ typical run-and-gun modes by putting added focus on larger maps as well as the return of the co-op Spec Ops mode. You still have fast-paced, twitch-style modes such as the six vs. six mode Shoot House and the even more close-quarters Gunfight. You also have classic modes such as the capture-and-hold-based Hardpoint as well as the Deathmatch-style Free For All. But then you have interesting modes such as Night Vision, which requires you to fight in the cover of darkness. Ground War, meanwhile, tries for an approach that’s more reminiscent of the Battlefield series, featuring humongous maps as well as the use of vehicles. The goal is to basically push forward into enemy territory to capture and hold objective points, allowing you to unlock more locations to spawn into. It’s a great option for folks who are either overwhelmed by the run-and-gun modes or just want to try something different.\n\nAdmittedly, this change in focus, combined with the slower and more deliberate pace, won’t be for everybody. Ground War, for example, especially rewards more tactical play, including camping — something that likely won’t sit well with some folks. Personally, I prefer this more strategic, less frenetic pace but it can be frustrating to die within a second of spawning after being sniped by a camping player, which happened in my case multiple times. I also wish the game had featured the same emphasis on destructible environs in its larger maps like Battlefield does, which would help make things more interesting. It would have been nice if the game featured more modes and maps as well as they feel a bit sparse at launch. Hopefully, some of the Modern Warfare games' classic maps are added via a future update.\n\nAnother issue with the game involves glitches. In one multiplayer session, for example, my HUD just started spazzing out while I was playing on my PS4 Pro, resulting in a distracting, vibrating mess. Others have reported glitches involving claymores and the 725 Shotgun, though these are planned to be patched via an update. Speaking of updates, the game also requires a pretty huge one the first time you play, which will likely frustrate some folks. All I can say is, I hope you have a good Internet connection.\n\nDespite its issues, I still prefer Modern Warfare over BLOPS 4. As a more old-school player, I just like the feel of this game compared to the last few entries in the series. Add the return of a full-fledged campaign after its absence last year and Modern Warfare provides the better overall package for folks who want to have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nAfter punting on a campaign mode in BLOPS4, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare represents a welcome return to form for a franchise that appeared to be on a downward trend. The more deliberate pace for multiplayer, especially for Ground War mode, might feel clunky to folks who prefer more fast-paced action. This one, however, feels more like a complete game than its predecessor. It still might not be the best COD ever for a lot of folks. But it’s certainly the best COD in quite some time, especially if you’ve been disappointed by games such as Advanced Warfare and Infinite Warfare.\n\nRating: 8.5 out of 10\n\n8.5 out of 10 Cost: $59.99; PC, PS4, XB1\n\n$59.99; PC, PS4, XB1 https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare\n\nJason Hidalgo covers business and technology for the Reno Gazette Journal, and also reviews video games as part of his Technobubble features.

Heck, I even gave out my first ever perfect-10 score as a professional reviewer this year.\n\nIn that sense, I guess you can say that the Year of the Fire Rooster was “straight fire.” Yes, that was a terrible pun. You know what isn’t terrible, though? These games in the annual Technobubble Big Game List that’s what.\n\nLet’s start this shindig with my personal picks for the Top 25 Video Games of 2017. Note that this only includes new games and full remakes but not remasters or mildly updated versions of older games.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe top 25\n\n25. Sonic Mania: Boy, it’s kinda chilly today, huh? As someone who grew up playing the classic Sonic games, Sonic Mania’s retro 16-bit gameplay is a literal blast (processing) from the past. If you adore Sega Genesis-era Sonic and enchiladas, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.\n\n24. Monster Hunter Stories: Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon might be getting all the attention this year for cute monster games. Monster Hunter Stories, however, is the Pokemon game a lot of us have always wanted. You mean I can capture and ride my favorite Monster Hunter monsters, er, monsties into battle? Sign me up!\n\n23. Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia: One thing I love about Nintendo is its penchant for not just simply remastering games but putting in the extra effort to remake them properly. Shadows of Valentia is a perfect example, taking a classic entry in the highly regarded Fire Emblem strategy RPG series and giving it a fresh coat of paint for today’s modern times.\n\n22. The Evil Within 2: Poor Sebastian Castellanos just can’t seem to catch a break. Shinji Mikami’s post-Resident Evil opus about the power and horrific potential of the mind — and bathtubs — features the same eerie vibe plus the addition of a more open sandbox for you to play in. It’s an interesting twist in the classic Resident Evil-style formula that adds a touch of freshness to the concept.\n\n21: Destiny 2: Hey, maybe that spiritual medium from the 1982 Poltergeist film was right about the light after all. The shooting MMO returns with its solid mechanics plus a stronger focus on storytelling after skimping on its narrative in the previous game. Some issues remain with progression and microtransaction mechanics but folks who loved the first game will like this one.\n\n20. Gravity Rush 2: I’m not sure why but playing Gravity Rush 2 reminds me of all the wonderful times I spent playing PlayStation and PS2 games of yore. Maybe it’s the Mega Man Legends vibe I get from it. Regardless, a really likable protagonist combined with some nifty gravity mechanics make this action-adventure game akin to a day in the clouds.\n\n19. Cuphead: It takes a special game to erase my save data and still make it into my list of best games. But that’s just how good Cuphead is. It’s the same way its charming 1930s-style art and animation makes you forgive all the misery it puts you through with its brutal old-school difficulty. If you like games classic Contra and Gunstar Heroes, you owe it to yourself to try out this delightfully unique game.\n\n18. Little Nightmares: In a world where many games follow established, cookie-cutter formulas, I like to reward new games that try to fit a different mold from the first-person shooters and action adventure games that rule the day. Reminiscent of last year’s excellent Inside, Little Nightmares is a side-scrolling survival game with an eerie, unique art style that sets it apart from other games. This is a game for thinkers who love suspense.\n\n17. Toukiden 2: Mitama mia! With Monster Hunter XX not making it to Western shores, Toukiden 2 certain helps scratch that itch for monster-hunting lovers who don’t import, at least until the arrival of Monster Hunter World. This sequel melds its unique body part-slicing mechanic with a new open sandbox that distinguishes itself from its more popular rival’s hub-based world. It’s my favorite Monster Hunter clone by far.\n\n16. Tekken 7: Hey, it’s like the 1990s again! The well-adjusted members of the Mishima family are back to impose their family drama on the world once more as the popular 3D-fighting franchise reaches its seventh installment. In addition to the series’ tight fighting mechanics, Tekken also enables one of the community’s more memorable kumbaya moments with the addition of Akuma, Geese Howard and prince pretty bromancer Noctis. That’s not so “predictabo!”\n\n15. Nioh: I’m admittedly late to the Nioh party. But boy is this game a hoot. It’s like Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, Dark Souls and Bloodborne jumped into a blender and came out as one frothy cocktail. If you like punishing yet satisfying action games that also look nice and “purdy,” you’ll definitely want to check it out.\n\n14. Horizon Zero Dawn: Here’s another title I didn’t get to play at launch. But it definitely was in my must-play list this year after I caught up with my gaming backlog. With its compelling story and beautiful landscape, Horizon Zero Dawn pairs that style with some nice substance that lovers of action-adventure games will appreciate. It’s one of the best new IPs of this generation, for sure.\n\n13. South Park: The Fractured But Whole: There’s probably a special place in hell for people like me who enjoy South Park’s humor. Heck, it still makes me uncomfortable sometimes. Fractured But Whole, however, is a game based on a popular franchise that’s done right as opposed to being a blatant cash grab. If you love South Park and turn-based RPG fighting, this one’s a no-brainer.\n\n12. Metroid: Samus Returns: She’s baaaaack. A Gameboy classic gets new life on the 3DS with totally reworked visuals while retaining the classic feel of the 2D Metroid series. Folks who loved games like Super Metroid will love this Metroidvania-style game, which coincidentally was worked on by a studio that did the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow games. Now all we need is a new Metroid Prime game and we’re golden.\n\n11. Assassin’s Creed Origins: Just as the Assassin’s Creed series was starting to feel a bit long in the tooth, its latest game breathes new life into the franchise with a change of scenery and a tortured new protagonist. Origins features some gorgeous, breathtaking locales as well as the political intrigue the series is known for. Add polished mechanics and it’s a nice return to form for the franchise.\n\n10. Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle: As one of the few people who apparently likes the Rabbids and is older than 10, I was pleasantly surprised when this game was announced. Add Mario characters and XCOM gameplay and it became one of my most anticipated titles of the year. The good news is that the game delivered with its snarky whimsy and solid tactical RPG gameplay. It’s a family-friendly game with smarts.\n\n9. Injustice 2: At a time when the industry is seeing a fighting game renaissance, Injustice 2 is exhibit A of what a good fighter should look like. That’s coming from someone who prefers the mechanics of Capcom’s fighting games. Injustice 2 continues NetherRealm’s penchant for flashy visuals and a narrative that doesn’t take a back seat to the fighting. Do note that it can get violent and disturbing so this isn’t for the kiddies.\n\n8. Splatoon 2: OK, true confession, I love Splatoon 2. Perhaps more than the average person. For starters, it’s one of the few shooter-type games that I’m actually really good at. Add its colorful presentation, creative visuals and unique ink-based shooting mechanics and you have a game that’s easy to pick up and lots of fun to play for the young and young at heart. The addition of a horde mode is icing on the cake, er, batter on the calamari.\n\n7. Xenoblade Chronicles 2: As someone who pines for the golden age of JRPGs, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 really hits the spot. This checks a lot of the boxes for my JRPG fix from its wonderfully designed locales and colorful characters to its intriguing story and hours upon hours of gameplay. The English localization is a bit hit or miss but you can thankfully download a Japanese language option, bruzzah.\n\n6. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus: Despite being part of a genre that has been over-marketed, overplayed and overdone in the last few generations, I was dumbfounded by just how much Wolfenstein II surprised me at various turns of its narrative. I mean, some plot points are just so outlandish, I totally did not predict what was going to happen. This game, as well as Wolfenstein I and the new Doom, have basically made me fall in love with first-person shooters once more.\n\n5. Resident Evil 7: We’re now entering hallowed territory with Capcom’s survival horror reboot opening the Top 5. After getting a bit tired with the last few installments, Resident Evil 7 takes a risk by dropping its third-person tradition and going first-person to great effect. Heck, I prefer third-person games myself but RE7 manages to retain the claustrophobia of the series while ramping up the scares. Play it on VR and prepare to wet your “pantalones.”\n\n4. Nier Automata: Gosh, I love this game. I really, really, really love it. Chalk it up to the unusual decision to serve up an odd narrative while mashing up multiple genres into one unexpected package and actually making it work. It’s got side-scrolling shooting, top-down shooting, corridor action and even a grindy open sandbox. Honestly, how this pupu platter concept didn’t end up as a glorious disaster is beyond me. Just like being weird works well for Portland, Oregon and Santa Cruz, California, the same can be said for Nier Automata for sure.\n\n3. Mario Odyssey: The Mario series does it again by serving up a fun new adventure that manages to make a mascot that’s been around forever feel fresh once again. The twist this time around comes with the addition of sandbox gameplay that encourages more exploration and experimentation, as well as the ability to take over and control Goombas, Bullet Bills and even a, uh, tree. Honestly, this easily could have been my No. 1 game depending on what side of the bed I wake up in the morning.\n\n2. Persona 5: I was a nanometer away from giving this game a 10 out of 10. That’s how much I enjoyed playing what I now consider one of the best JRPGs I’ve ever come across. Persona 5 is a great example of a what a modern JRPG should be. It pays homage to the mechanics and design of the past but also adds a new kind of flair that takes out that stale derivative taste while adding a hip vibe to the game. You’ll never see it coming.\n\nGame of the year\n\nLegend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: Given the success of the critically acclaimed Zelda franchise, you’d certainly hate to be the one to kill the golden goose. Which makes the Zelda team’s decision to take a risk and introduce a massive open-world mechanic to the game even more commendable. Breath of the Wild takes the familiar Zelda conventions and thrusts it into a new open environment that encourages so much player creativity that it feels like a living world. And while the narrative is minimal as with past Zelda games, they still can tug your heartstrings at choice moments, with the Mipha arc literally making me cry. Dang it, I wanna cry right now just thinking about it. Hold up, I think I got something in my eye.\n\nAnd that’s this year’s list of top video games.

See, after playing my share of shooters for ages, the entries from the last three or so years just didn’t excite me the way games in the genre used to.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, many of the Triple-A shooters certainly featured a good amount of polish. Except for games like the original Titanfall, however, I pretty much got a been-there, done-that vibe from the whole lot of them. It’s like witnessing the beginning of the decline of the JRPG genre from its golden days all over again.\n\nThen the new Doom game came out. Surprisingly, it was a hell of a lot of fun, pun so totally intended. But hey, one good game does not a comeback make. I require more proof to placate my skepticism.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nJust a few days later, out comes Overwatch. A new take on arena shooting, the game’s fast gameplay and likable characters proved to be a smash hit on PC and consoles. OK, but two is an accident, as people say. It’s three that’s a trend, or is it a charm? Sorry, I tend to mix my stereotypical phrases like my metaphors sometimes.\n\nTechnobubble Wrap: Nintendo Switch turns on fanboy console wars anew\n\nGeekology: Loot Crate October 2016 Horror box review | Technobubble\n\nNASA, Reno university test system for managing drone traffic safely | Technobubble\n\nA few months pass after that and I found myself revving up the old Lancer chainsaw in Gears of War 4 in the fall. Not only was the new Gears a win for the general shooter genre, it was great news for starved fans of the oft-ignored third-person shooting sub-genre. Still, even triple axels are yesterday’s news now. These days, it’s all about the quadruple axel, baby.\n\nLike clockwork, out comes Battlefield 1, of course. Granted, its mechanics did not see significant progress in the grand scheme of things. Its multi-layered campaign and World War I aesthetic, however, proved to be quite refreshing and added to the year’s growing list of good shooters. As if that wasn’t enough, it was soon followed by Titanfall 2, which continues to bring its own unique take on the modern shooter with nimble soldiers and hulking robots.\n\nEven if Call of Duty Infinite Warfare simply performs average or even less than that when it comes out later this year, I think it’s safe to say that 2016 was good for shooters. It’s not just about the quantity, which wasn’t lacking even in some of the years when I felt underwhelmed. It’s also about quality. Personally, I thought each of the games mentioned above brought something new to the table after a few years when the genre seemed stuck in holding pattern.\n\nWill it cause fans to buy more shooters? What does it mean for 2017? And is this year’s bumper crop of shooters the indicator of a new trend or simply the calm before the upcoming famine? Like Vladimir and Estragon, I guess we’ll just have to wait — hopefully not in vain. Now onward to this week’s geeky reviews.\n\nTeeblox October 2016 Gamer Shirt\n\nLike my electric bill, every month comes with a new Teeblox gamer shirt mailed to my house. Unlike my power bill, however, the Teeblox pack is something I actually look forward to.\n\nAfter last month’s cool Diablo Demon Hunter shirt, we get another tribute to Blizzard lore with this month’s wearable offering. One thing I’ve noticed is that there are typically two kinds of Teeblox gamer shirts. You have the super obvious ones like August’s Kingdom Hearts design that prominently displays Sora on the front. Then you have more cryptic ones like the Demon Hunter and Heartless logo from July, that almost look like heavy metal-inspired designs. October’s green fantasy-inspired shirt definitely falls under the latter. You can basically wear it and get a nodding wink from geeks in the know while not totally announcing your geekdom to the unwashed masses.\n\nAs with every Teeblox pack, you get a comic book. This month’s is Sigil, which is admittedly an IP that I know nothing about. As someone who was really into comics all the way through college, my total devolution to comic book marmdom is admittedly embarrassing. The third item is a cool cut out of 8-bit Toad from the original Super Mario Bros. NES game.\n\n“Did you know there was a big debate on the Internet about whether 8-bit Toad was flipping you off?” my cousin said with a chuckle.\n\nI’m sorry but Internet logic must be in another castle.\n\nCost: $12.99; use code “RGJ24” to get 24 percent off\n\nOfficial site:http://teeblox.com/\n\nBattlefield 1\n\n— This is a summarized version of our full Battlefield 1 review\n\nEver since first-person shooters switched to modern warfare — pun most definitely intended — the Battlefield series has found itself playing catch up to the Call of Duty franchise.\n\nIt’s interesting then how Battlefield’s decision to step back all the way to World War I proves to be just the move it needed to make to push the franchise forward. It’s like killing the proverbial two birds with one stone.\n\nNot only does Battlefield 1 freshen up the stale feel of the modern first-person shooter, it also distinguishes Battlefield from its fierce rival, which doubled down on the modern approach by going farther forward to the future.\n\nIn contrast, Battlefield 1’s features older tanks and massive zeppelins, which, strangely enough, makes the game feel new. The older setting especially pays dividends in the campaign, which is often a weak spot for games in the Battlefield series. Don’t expect to find one fated man against the entire world in this one. Instead, the game takes a different approach by spreading its tale among several protagonists stretched across various fronts.\n\nThe actual shooting, meanwhile, feels pretty much the same as past Battlefield games despite the use of “older” weaponry. This includes firearms that perform like more modern weapons but it’s an understandable addition from a gameplay standpoint. Vehicles also continue to be a strength for the series. I especially loved tank vs. tank battles, which rewards both aim and strategy, including targeting weak points and outflanking foes.\n\nMultiplayer, meanwhile, worked pretty well. I played Battlefield 1 on the Xbox One and matches were smooth overall. With the exception of two disconnects, I didn’t run across any serious server-related issues during a weekend of play after release. Operations mode also was my favorite among the new online additions. This mode tries to recreate some classic World War I battles by splitting opposing forces between offense and defense, then letting battles play out in multiple stages over various sectors as objectives are met or lost.\n\nOverall, Battlefied 1 manages to inject new life to the series thanks to great World War I visuals and the best campaign in the franchise. Admittedly, the base shooting experience isn’t significantly changed and the campaign, while much improved, doesn’t give you time to create a bond with its protagonists. In a genre that has been mostly stuck in a holding pattern, however, this retro take on modern warfare is a much welcome one indeed.\n\nRating: 4.25 out of 5\n\nCost: $59.99; PC, PS4, XB1 (reviewed)\n\nhttps://www.battlefield.com/\n\nTitanfall 2\n\n— This is a summarized version of our full Titanfall 2 review\n\nBack in 2014, the first Titanfall game generated plenty of buzz thanks to its faster, vertical gameplay as well as the addition of giant Titan robots. Although the game looked like the next big thing for first-person shooters, however, the decision to stay exclusive to one console ecosystem combined with the lack of a campaign, took out some of the luster from the game.\n\nIt’s a problem that Titanfall 2 definitely learns from as it launches on both Microsoft and Sony systems right off the bat. In addition to being more console agnostic this time around, the sequel also ties a bow around a full-fledged campaign to satisfy folks such as myself who still place great value on story modes for shooters.\n\nAlthough Titanfall 2’s campaign appears to be the same one-man jaunt through hostile territory that’s seen in many a shooting campaign, this is actually a buddy adventure at its core — pun so totally intended. I found Titanfall 2’s campaign to be quite solid, overall, thanks to an interesting story and well-designed locales that show off its unique gameplay. While shooting campaigns tend to be flat for the most part and typically use stairs, platforms and elevators for level variety, Titanfall 2 builds in verticality into its level design and mechanics. In addition to double jumps, you also encounter plenty of gaps and spaces that require you to do wall runs and wall jumps, sometimes consecutively in order to get to from point A to point B. This makes movement a more essential part of the gameplay that’s actually both challenging and exciting thanks to the use of platforming mechanics.\n\nTitan gameplay, meanwhile, gets a few tweaks in multiplayer mode. One is the more controversial decision to eliminate regenerating shields, which changes Titan combat. Tied to the loss of shields is the addition of battery-stealing mechanics when rodeo-riding enemy Titans. Titan types also grow from three to six this time around.\n\nDownsides include enemy AI, which can be brain dead at times for both campaign and multiplayer. I also wish multiplayer offered more in the way of stages that really took advantage of the built-in vertical gameplay. All that being said, I actually enjoyed Titanfall 2’s multiplayer the most out of all the good shooters that I played this year. If you’re thirsty for a modern shooter experience that’s different from the norm, this is one game you’ll want to climb into.\n\nRating: 4.25 out of 5\n\nCost: $59.99; PC, PS4 and XB1 (reviewed)\n\nhttps://www.titanfall.com\n\nThe Game Vault: Technobubble Video Game Reviews", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/03/11/titanfall-review-xbox-one-technobubble/6305043/", "title": "Technobubble: Titanfall game review for Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PC", "text": "Jason Hidalgo\n\njhidalgo@rgj.com\n\nYou can never go wrong with adding robots to make something cooler. What would make vehicles better? Make them transform into robots and roll out. Want to freshen up the kaiju genre? Add robots. I'm sure Guillermo del Toro would agree.\n\nSo with the first-person shooting genre getting a bit long in the tooth in recent years, the original folks behind the Call of Duty franchise decided to add one key element to their inaugural game as a new studio. Yep, robots. Big, hulking robots. Add extra speed, some nice hang time and wall running along the lines of the aptly named \"Attack on Titan\" or \"Shingeki no Kyoujin\" manga and anime and you've got Respawn Entertainment's \"Titanfall\" for Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PC.\n\nOf course, with all the hype that preceded Titanfall's launch, it wouldn't be surprising if the final product failed to meet expectations. So is life truly better with a Titan? The good news is that, for the most part, Titanfall delivers the goods.\n\nThe shooting itself is quite solid, no surprise really given the studio staff's pedigree with first-person shooters. But it's the things added on top of the shooting that gives Titanfall that extra oomph. The added verticality and wall running, for example, improves on the mostly lateral play of shooters. Having robots meanwhile mixes up the gameplay a bit while adding a larger sense of scale.\n\nTitanfall is also one of the most accessible shooters I've seen in quite some time. It tries to allay the fears of newcomers and gamers not quite used to shooting games by adding a comprehensive tutorial as well as gameplay elements to help ease the transition. These include the addition of AI grunts that aren't quite as lethal as human players. Tools like the Smart Pistol also help with aim, particularly against AI grunts, but are still balanced enough to prevent abuse against humans.\n\nGood players will still dominate, especially against other humans but there are enough AI characters around to make the average or less-than-average Joe feel like they're contributing to the cause. Purists might decry this but for those interested in bringing more people into the fold and expanding the player base, this is actually a good idea. There's also enough to do in terms of various game modes and challenges, as well as various soldier and Titan types and loadouts to keep players busy. Fine tuning your Titan for various play styles is especially fun.\n\nStill, as someone who likes to play through the stories of games such as the Gears of War series, one big downside with Titanfall is its lack of a traditional campaign or offline mode. Instead the campaign is squeezed into the multiplayer mode, which lets you play as one of two factions. For folks who primarily play shooters for the online multiplayer, it isn't a big deal. For folks who like their shooters to come with a meaty story, however, the lack of a dedicated campaign will be disappointing. Limiting the game to the Xbox family and PC also means that a large number of shooter fans on the PlayStation ecosystem will be left out.\n\nStill, the game is a polished shooter that serves as a welcome addition to the genre, thanks to the extra wrinkles it throws into the first-person shooter formula or the fact that its design is conducive to both newcomers as well as skilled players.\n\nOne could argue that the most intriguing thing about Titanfall, however, is that as good as the game plays, it actually isn't quite there yet. Instead, it feels like the blueprint for something that could be bigger and better with time. Just adding a solid campaign and offline mode, for example, would do wonders for the game's overall package. So as far as a test case for a new IP goes, Titanfall is a fun romp. But what's even more exciting is the prospect of what Respawn could do with Titanfall 2.\n\nFinal rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nTechnobubble is a regular technology and gaming feature by Reno Gazette-Journal reporter Jason Hidalgo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/10/02/call-of-duty-games-timeline/70679995007/", "title": "Call of Duty games in order of release date: A full visual guide", "text": "A newer version of this article exists, click here to read.\n\nCall of Duty can still bring the heat after 20 years.\n\nActivision’s first-person shooter video game franchise is celebrating its 20th anniversary in October – the first Call of Duty game hit PCs in October 2003. Its latest entry, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, arrives Nov. 10 for Microsoft and Sony game consoles and PCs.\n\nA consistent blockbuster game release with annual editions every year since 2003, the initial Call of Duty games were based on World War II. Game designers and creators have constantly evolved the releases, changing the field of battle, moving to video game consoles, then to 24/7 online multiplayer games, and onto mobile devices. The settings have moved to the Vietnam War, to the present day and into the future – including space.\n\nWhat time period each Call of Duty game in the main series is set in\n\n“We’ve had so many great games and some big inflection points for us,” said Rob Kostich, president of Activision Publishing. “But it’s just continued to be a mainstay in culture.”\n\nCall of Duty has been the best-selling video game franchise in the U.S. market for 14 consecutive years since the 2009 release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, according to data from Circana Retail Tracking Service. The only years during that period where a Call of Duty game was not the best-selling individual title of the year were 2013 when the honor went to Grand Theft Auto V, and 2018, when another Rockstar Games release Red Dead Redemption II took the title.\n\nActivision Blizzard has sold more than 400 million Call of Duty video games over the years. Tens of millions play the annual video game release, which has grown to include single-player story campaigns and other modes including online multiplayer and cooperative games.\n\nBut Call of Duty is even bigger than that: Its free-to-play Call of Duty Mobile launched in 2019, has racked up more than 500 million downloads. Call of Duty: Warzone, a free-to-play game for consoles and PCs launched in 2020 and has topped 100 million players. A Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile game is in the works.\n\nWhen each Call of Duty game was released\n\nCall of Duty got its start when a squad of developers who had worked on the 2002 PC game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, left that development studio 2015 Inc., to form Infinity Ward. The LA-area studio would create a pair of World War II-based games including Call of Duty 2, which included a mission in which the player had to survive the D-Day invasion – inspired by the Normandy assault scene in the film \"Saving Private Ryan,\" directed by Steven Spielberg, who scripted and executive produced the initial Medal of Honor games.\n\n“We attempted to make the situation for the individual player as chaotic and stressful as it must have been for some people on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944,\" Dale Dye, a retired captain in the U.S. Marine Corps, who served as an adviser on the Medal of Honor games, told USA TODAY in 2002. \"The goal is to provide the player with some understanding and appreciation for a combat soldier's battlefield experience,” said Dye, who also served as a consultant on films such as “Saving Private Ryan,” “Band of Brothers,” and “Platoon.\"\n\nHere’s a look at where the Call of Duty games have taken players over the years:\n\nCall of Duty (2003)\n\nPlayers joined U.S., British and Soviet forces fighting their way through historic World War II battles such as the Battle of the Bulge and the Battle of Stalingrad. The game was awarded 2003 Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, the equivalent of the video game industry’s Oscars.\n\nCall of Duty: Finest Hour (2004)\n\nThis game for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, built on the original Call of Duty PC release, includes new missions in North Africa and Germany. You also get to drive tanks. AC/DC frontman Brian Johnson voices one of the characters.\n\nCall of Duty 2 (2005)\n\nA launch title for Microsoft's new Xbox 360, this game hit Windows PCs first and put players in a pivotal position during D-Day attempting to take Pointe du Hoc, a German-held clifftop between Omaha and Utah beaches. Better chips in PCs and the Xbox 360 allowed the designers to craft smarter squad mates and enemies. \"You can actually hear where (enemy and fellow soldiers) are on the battlefield,\" said Vince Zampella, who at the time was Infinity Ward's chief creative officer. \"To your left, you are going to hear them calling out, 'There's Nazis on your right-hand side, second window! They've got a machine gun,' or 'We are taking fire!'\"\n\nCall of Duty 2: Big Red One (2005)\n\nPlayers on GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox got to enlist in this additional World War II story line as part of the U.S. Army's famed 1st Infantry Division. The game introduced aerial combat, which would become a standard in subsequent releases. Mark Hamill provided voiceover commentary and several actors from the HBO series \"Band of Brothers\" voiced characters, too.\n\nCall of Duty 3 (2006)\n\nThis game, developed by Treyarch (a game development studio like Infinity Ward, acquired by Activision), featured digitally scanned actors and uniforms combined with squadron-sized motion-capture sessions. World War II veterans were consulted. New features aimed to get \"closer to what happens in a real fight,\" said retired Army Lt. Col. Hank Keirsey, a consultant on this and other Call of Duty games.\n\nCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007)\n\nThe first Call of Duty game to venture beyond World War II into modern-day geopolitical situations and international intrigue with nukes, an anti-U.S. Middle Eastern warlord and an ultranationalist Russian terrorist involved. The game's multiplayer mode established Call of Duty as a favorite for online players. Along with Call of Duty 2, this game is considered among the best video games of all time.\n\nCall of Duty: World at War (2008)\n\nActors Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman provided voices for characters in this World War II-based game with action on the Pacific and Eastern fronts including Russia and Germany. World at War was also the first to include a totally separate game mode where players battled zombies. Also released in 2008 was Call of Duty: World at War – Final Fronts, a counterpart to World at War and the last Call of Duty game developed for the PlayStation 2.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)\n\nThis picked up the story about ultranationalist Russians threatening world peace from 2007's Modern Warfare and included an episode involving a terrorist attack that got a lot of attention. It wasn't meant purely to shock, but to bring to players \"the shape of modern warfare these days: violence against citizens,\" said Jesse Stern, a writer and executive producer with the TV series NCIS who helped studio Infinity Ward on the game. Sales topped $1 billion, surpassing box office receipts for top films.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops (2010)\n\nThe first Call of Duty Black Ops game was set in the Cold War, with action in Cuba, Russia and Vietnam. Ed Harris, Gary Oldman, Ice Cube and Sam Worthington added voices and \"The Dark Knight\" screenwriter David Goyer consulted. At the time, the game went on to become the top-selling game ever, selling more than 25 million copies.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2011)\n\nThis completion of a trilogy begun five years earlier includes a Russian invasion of the U.S. At the outset of the game, you must fight your way through Wall Street to destroy a radar jamming tower. Players would feel \"the impact of fighting through New York,\" said Infinity Ward's creative strategist Robert Bowling. There was conflict behind the scenes too: During the making of the game, Activision terminated Infinity Ward co-founders Vince Zampella and Jason West. The two in March 2010 filed a suit, which was settled in 2012, and they started a new studio Respawn Entertainment, which created the new Titanfall franchise.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II (2012)\n\nThis game not only continued the story from 2010's Black Ops but also took players into the future with weaponized drones and other sci-fi technology – and it had different endings. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails created a theme song for the game too. And you could stream your game on YouTube.\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts (2013)\n\nThe first stand-alone game in the series in several years, Ghosts is set in the near future and included an outer space battle straight out of \"Moonraker,\" as well as an underwater mission and another played from the point of view of a military-trained German shepherd named \"Riley.\" A new perk: You could also create a woman soldier in the game's multiplayer game mode. This was the first Call of Duty game available for the Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2014)\n\nKevin Spacey played the head of a Blackwater-style private military company with imperialist ambitions in this game, set 40 years in the future. You don an exoskeleton, which gives you super-powered leaping and hovering power. This was the first game in the series developed by the studio Sledgehammer Games, which previously collaborated on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. \"The Hurt Locker\" writer and producer Mark Boal assisted on the story.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 3 (2015)\n\nBlack Ops 3 picks up the action from Black Ops 2 and moves to the year 2065 – a futuristic story totally separate from 2014's Advanced Warfare – when super soldiers have augmented body parts and built-in data jacks to connect to computer networks. The game also allowed for up to four to play and progress together, to help less-skilled players advance in the game. For the seventh consecutive year, Call of Duty was the top-selling video game in the U.S.\n\nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare (2016)\n\nMore future-based action, but this time with actor Kit Harington (\"Game of Thrones\") playing a villain bent on destroying Earth. Much of the combat takes place in space with starship battles à la \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars.\" The setting \"allowed for some incredible innovations like Zero-G combat and space dogfighting,\" said then-Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg.\n\nCall of Duty: WWII (2017)\n\nThe video game franchise returned to World War II for the first time in nearly a decade with actor Josh Duhamel (\"Transformers\") providing the likeness, voice and motion for one of the game's main characters. You again help the Allies advance on Normandy and, later, become immersed in a tank battle, and eventually make your way to occupied France and into Germany.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018)\n\nThe first edition to drop the single-player story campaign, this online multiplayer included \"Blackout,\" its own take on the \"battle royale\" game genre, popularized by \"Fortnite.\"\n\nCall of Duty: Mobile (2019)\n\nThis free-to-play game for Android and iOS devices included a battle royale mode for up to 100 players, plus other popular multiplayer games such as Team Deathmatch, Search and Destroy, and Domination on well-known maps from the games' history.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)\n\nA modern-day game – photo-realistic settings were created in 3D photogrammetry software – that brings back the characters from 2007's Modern Warfare. \"We wanted to reboot the franchise … with the characters we knew and loved,\" said Activision Publishing CEO Rob Kostich. \"We wanted to tell new stories in new ways and bring Modern Warfare to the modern day.\" In addition to reengaging with familiar characters, you also play part of the game as a female Middle Eastern freedom fighter.\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone (2020)\n\nA free game to compete with \"Fortnite,\" with crossplay across consoles and PCs with up to 150 players in its Battle Royale Mode. Quickly, the game grew to 100 million players and constantly gets new content.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War (2020)\n\nThe premise here is somehow, the Russians swiped a U.S. nuke in 1968 and now that mistake has come back to haunt the Reagan Administration. Familiar characters from previous Black Ops games appear too. The first installment of the series is playable on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.\n\nCall of Duty: Vanguard (2021)\n\nYou face missions as four different characters in this World War II-based game – one of them based on Ludmila Pavlichenko, Russia's most successful real-world female sniper known as \"Lady Death.\" New tough adversaries, nearly unstoppable soldiers called jagermorders, are deployed by the Führer's successor to thwart you.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)\n\nThis sequel to 2019's \"Modern Warfare\" reboot continues Task Force 141's fight against terrorists. Along the way you must guide a missile to its target, disarm another missile, provide air support to your squad and, at one point, you are hurt and unarmed and must use stealth to escape.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023)\n\nThis game, due out Nov. 10, is the first time the franchise has carried forward a story in back-to-back years – and picks up after the cliffhanger ending of \"Modern Warfare II.\" \"This is a first for us,\" Kostich said. \"You see this theatrically all of the time, 'The Avengers' have done it.\"\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone Mobile (2024)\n\nFour years after releasing Warzone, Activision adapted it into a free-to-play mobile game that allows players to link to their Activision ID and sync progression, weapons, friends and more if they've already played Warzone on a console or computer. \"We're using the same animation, movement and weapon systems, all that stuff is just adapted for a mobile device,\" said Chris Plummer, Activision's head of mobile.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/02/13/gutsy-move-resident-evil-7-review-technobubble/97869810/", "title": "Gutsy move: Resident Evil 7 review | Technobubble", "text": "Jason Hidalgo\n\njhidalgo@rgj.com\n\nTechnobubble covers games, gadgets, technology and all things geek. Follow Technobubble poobah Jason Hidalgo’s shenanigans on Twitter @jasonhidalgo\n\nIt’s funny how a change in perspective seems to always do wonders for the Resident Evil franchise.\n\nDeveloper Capcom’s decision to adapt a behind-the-shoulder view for Resident Evil 4, for example, reinvigorated the franchise to new heights after ditching the old template’s pre-rendered backgrounds. This time, the switch to a first-person perspective with Resident Evil 7 is pumping new life into a series that seemingly lost its way in its last major release.\n\nThat major release, by the way, would be Resident Evil 6, which was the perfect example of throwing a bunch of stuff against the proverbial wall to see if something sticks. On one hand, you had Leon Kennedy’s adventure, which at least tried to sprinkle in some tension and turned out to be the most enjoyable part of the game for me. But then you had a few other action-heavy modes that just soured the experience. Chris Redfield’s campaign, for example, felt like a wannabe cover shooter with poor mechanics. Jake Muller’s story mode was just as underwhelming, echoing the mindless action of Chris’ campaign.\n\nDespite an ambitious grand adventure spanning various areas around the globe, the disjointed design made RE6 feel like a DLC collection instead of a unified whole. This makes RE7’s more focused, less-is-more approach a much welcome change of pace. If anything, it actually makes it feel more old school. It’s an approach that was made on purpose, according to series producer Masachika Kawata when I interviewed him last year.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“Resident Evil 4, 5 and 6 were more in the action genre and had gotten very grand in scale,” Kawata said. “We asked ourselves what makes Resident Evil special, so we actually drew a lot of inspiration from the first Resident Evil game during the development of Resident Evil 7.”\n\nThe result is a more curated and intimate experience. Gone is the jetsetting to different locales from the previous game. Instead, you spend a lot of your time within the confines of the Baker estate and its surrounding environs.\n\nThe Baker family definitely plays a big role in the RE7 experience. In addition to their insane, dogged attempts to make your life miserable, they are also a terrifying force to be reckoned with. There’s a certain sense of despair that fills my mind when I find myself dealing with powerful, sturdy foes who can’t be reasoned with. Think Energizer Bunnies with a healing factor that would make Wolverine green with envy. At the same time, realizing that they used to be normal, salt-of-the-earth people also made me feel pity for them. What caused them to be this way? Are they victims of yet another viral incident? Who’s really pulling the strings? And how did your wife get dragged into this whole mess?\n\nIt’s a mystery that you have to slowly untangle as you venture deeper into RE7’s campaign. As with all the Resident Evil games, conspiracy abounds and there are a lot of loose ends to tie up, even after you’ve finished the game.\n\nOne thing that really helps with the mood and tension is the switch to a first-person camera. Not being able to see your character seems like a big departure for the series, but the change in perspective also comes with advantages. For starters, it makes the game feel more like a personal experience. You’re not simply a disembodied overseer controlling a character you see onscreen. The new perspective is designed to make you feel more like you’re actually there. It’s a big reason why I regret not being able to play this in VR mode. I could only imagine the added tension when I’m looking around and checking blind corners with a PSVR strapped on my noggin. Then again, I’m a big scaredy cat when it comes to horror games so maybe that’s a good thing.\n\nResident Evil 7 also distinguishes itself from other survival games such as Outlast by including one key precept of the Resident Evil series: the ability to fight back. The game includes various mechanics like blocking, which can reduce damage, especially when timed right, and you can also find weapons that help even out the odds a bit. Granted, you don’t feel quite as powerful as you did in RE6. Resource management comes into play once again and you need to be mindful of how you use your limited resources. Fans of the series will also appreciate the ability to unlock stuff, which continues the franchise’s tradition of encouraging multiple playthroughs. By the way, you’ll want to make sure you see the game’s different endings, including the “bad one,” as they add to the story.\n\nDo be warned that this is a bloody and violent game. If the sight of stab wounds and viscera makes you lightheaded, this might not be the game for you. I also wish there was a bit more variety in the types of foes that you encounter. Then you have the game’s puzzles, which aren’t quite as challenging, so fans of more intricate puzzling might be disappointed. Moments such as magically healing severe wounds by pouring medicine on them ruins the immersion at times, which is a bit of a shame given how good the game is at setting the mood. It actually made me think about Chris Rock’s joke about the wonders of rubbing Robitussin or “tussin” on everything.\n\nThat being said, RE7 is an excellent game that definitely feels more like classic Resident Evil. If you prefer a more old-school Resident Evil and didn’t care much for the action-oriented bent of the last couple of games, then you’d definitely want to listen to your inner Marguerite Baker and give this vicious, bloody treat a taste. Of course, the more intriguing question now is where the franchise goes from here.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nResident Evil 7 marks a return to form for the series after the much maligned Resident Evil 6. If you disliked the action of the last few main titles and prefer a more intimate, suspenseful experience, then make sure to eat up on this gory heaping of horror, just like Marguerite Baker tells you to do.\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nCost: $59.99; PC, PS4, XB1\n\nhttp://residentevil7.com/\n\nThe Game Vault: Technobubble Video Game Reviews", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/13"}]}

But they also represent a sea change in the mainstream conversation about American labor — and they could inspire more union efforts.\n\n“I think it’s very significant, even though it’s a small percentage of the workforces so far,” said Alexander Colvin, dean of Cornell University’s Industrial and Labor Relations School. “I do think that’s a real shift we’re seeing.”\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board reports that from October 2021 through last month, 1,174 petitions were filed at the agency seeking union representation.That’s up 57% from the same period a year earlier — and the highest level of union organizing in 10 years.\n\nThe Amazon and Starbucks victories are important to union organizing efforts, Colvin said. That sentiment is echoed by Chris Smalls, who went from fired Amazon employee to the the leader of the Amazon Labor Union, which recently became the first union to win a representation vote at one of Amazon’s facilities.\n\nSince that vote at Amazon’s Staten Island, New York, facility where Smalls used to work, he has talked to workers at 50 other Amazon facilities nationwide who want to hold their own union votes. Another vote is scheduled for later this month at a different Staten Island Amazon facility.\n\n“I think what we did … is a catalyst for a revolution with Amazon workers, just like the Starbucks unionizing effort,” he said on an interview on CNN+ last week. “We want to have the same domino effect.”\n\nDomino effect\n\nOver at Starbucks, since December workers at 17 stores from Boston to its hometown of Seattle have voted to be represented by Starbucks Workers United — a separate grassroots union effort that has filed to hold votes at more than 100 additional stores.\n\nStarbucks Workers United partners celebrate a victory after watching the union vote count in Mesa, Arizona. Alexandra Buxbaum/Sipa/AP\n\nStarbucks has about 235,000 workers spread across 9,000 company-operated US stores. Fewer than 1,000 workers at the 17 stores have voted for the union. It’s similar at Amazon, where some 8,300 hourly workers were eligible to vote at the Staten Island facility. That’s not even 1% of the company’s US workforce of 1.1 million employees, including both warehouse and office workers.\n\nBut the votes have grabbed headlines, and the Labor Board figures suggest the efforts Amazon (AMZN) and Starbucks (SBUX) may be inspiring others.\n\nUnion leaders talk of wanting not just better pay and benefits, also but improved job security, staffing levels and workplace safety measures — as well as better working conditions overall and a voice in how workers are treated. Employers generally tend to argue workers are better off with no “third party” standing between workers and management.\n\n“While not all the partners supporting unionization are colluding with outside union forces, the critical point is that I do not believe conflict, division and dissension – which has been a focus of union organizing – benefits Starbucks or our partners,” said CEO Howard Schultz in a message to the company’s employees, who are referred to as “partners,” shortly after reassuming the CEO position at the company.\n\nStill, the efforts seem to be having an effect. Starbucks recently announced it suspended repurchases of its stock, a move that would benefit primarily its shareholders, in order to invest more in its employees. The company also instituted two wage increases in the last 18 months, and in October said it would raise wages to at least $15 an hour for baristas, with most hourly employees earning an average of nearly $17 an hour by this summer.\n\nCovid-era changes\n\nMany of the unions’ demands stem from the difficulties of working during the pandemic during the last two years, said John Logan, professor of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University.\n\n“Part of what’s changed is we’re just in a different moment, [with] frontline workers feeling they were not rewarded or treated with respect during the pandemic,” said Logan. “I think something has really changed in the consciousness of young workers.”\n\nThe very tight labor market — with more job openings than there are job seekers and a record number of workers quitting — is making it easier to organize today, said Colvin. While workers don’t want to lose a job at the company they’re trying to organize, the fact that other jobs are available can make them more willing to take that risk.\n\nA more union-friendly NLRB under the Biden administration is also a factor. Amazon appealed the vote at the Staten Island facility, alleging the labor board acted “unfairly and inappropriately” and delayed investigating what it calls “frivolous” unfair labor practice charges.\n\nIn a statement Kayla Blado, the NLRB’s press secretary, said the board “is an independent federal agency that Congress has charged with enforcing the National Labor Relations Act,” and its enforcement actions against Amazon are “consistent with that.”\n\n“Things are changing for the better for workers. They’ve implemented remedies that make easier to organize,” said Amazon Labor Union president Smalls. “We still have a long way to go.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest potential change under the new, more labor-friendly NRLB is a recent opinion by its general counsel that management should no longer be able to require workers to sit through presentations about the company’s union stance, arguing that doing so violates workers’ right to refrain from organizing-related activities. Such meetings are central to management efforts to defeat union organizing efforts.\n\nSmalls called the compulsory meetings one of the biggest challenges the union faced. “They have 24-hour access to the workers. You can’t compare and compete with that,” he said.\n\nThe opinion doesn’t change current law, which allows for those meetings, although Colvin said it wouldn’t surprise him if the Democrat-controlled NLRB votes to change it. From there, it’s a likely court battle that could go all the way to the US Supreme Court, which has already indicated it is far less supportive of unions.\n\nDecline in union membership\n\nEven with the recent wins for unions, there are numerous long-term trends still in place that have reduced union membership to only 7% of private sector employees over the last 50 years. A main reason is the shift from manufacturing to service-sector jobs like those at Starbucks and Amazon, said Colvin.\n\nOther factors contributing to declining union membership include the rise of nonunion competitors, automation, the building of facilities in less union-friendly Southern states and shifting production overseas.\n\nFinding ways to organize at Amazon and Starbucks and other service sector companies in fields like technology, finance and retail is a key to turning around those long-term trends, experts say.\n\nIt’s an uphill battle for unions to win new members, but that doesn’t mean they can’t succeed, said Erik Loomis, a labor historian and associate professor at the University of Rhode Island.\n\n“Amazon is the GM or the US Steel of our time — and it took decades to organize those places,” he said last month, before the vote results at Amazon were known. “It took many different forms of campaigns led by different ideologies, different modes of organizing … before these kind of companies were finally successfully organized.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Sara O'Brien", "Chris Isidore", "Sara O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/michigan/2020/04/12/mackinac-island-delays-opening-summer-2020-amid-pandemic/2977414001/", "title": "Mackinac Island delays opening for summer 2020 amid pandemic", "text": "Todd Callewaert hopes he'll be able to open his seven family businesses on Mackinac Island as scheduled by May 22, but the situation is fluid.\n\n\"Normally, we'd be up there the last week in April and now it's the end of May,\" Callewaert said. \"I doubt that's going to happen.

In fact, some have pleaded publicly that families not visit their vacation homes for fear that they'd expose small communities and people with limited access to hospitals.\n\nAlso, the island now is unusually isolated because City of Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud has strongly discouraged travel on and off the island through April 30. Fewer than 1,000 residents live on the island year round.\n\nBusiness owners want to respect this years' heightened sensitivities.\n\n\"If this thing really ran rampant on the island, it would be a bad thing for everybody,\" Callewaert said. \"We don’t want any of that. We know we'll get some exposure at some point. But it's not going to be our negligence that spreads it. We are going to make sure everything is just right. We're going to take it nice and slow.\"\n\nThe Grand Hotel was originally scheduled to open May 1, for a season that generally runs to late October. This year, the calendar allows for Halloween celebration on the island, which happens about once every five years.\n\nThe island, named TripAdvisor's top summer destination spot in America in 2018, sees an estimated 1 million visitors a year.\n\n\"If we lose the month of May, we lose May,\" Callewaert said. \"The big picture is July and August. We're still getting reservations for people booking from the 4th of July to the end of August.\"\n\nBig picture\n\nTim Hygh (pronounced High), executive director of the Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau that represents 200 island businesses, told the Free Press that business owners are cautiously optimistic but public health comes first.\n\nLocal business owners hope that \"diligent adherence to directives instituted by governmental and health authorities will make that possible soon,\" he said.\n\nThe island will open only when \"it is deemed safe to do so by federal, state and local officials,\" including the City of Mackinac Island and the Luce, Mackinac, Alger, School District Health Department, Hygh said.\n\nIndividual business owners may make decisions independently but many follow direction from the Grand Hotel.\n\nNo question, people are cautious and even talking about pushing summer travel to the fall, Callewaert said. That can be very helpful to the island.\n\n\"This is the only way you can be,\" just flexible, Callewaert said. \"And we have to go on the offensive once we go.\"\n\nLife of fudge\n\nThe family's three Starbucks coffee shops in Chicago are closed now, along with a Jimmy John's in Stuart, Florida.

He called it Mackinac Island fudge and he had never been to Mackinac Island in his life.\"\n\nThen, in the early 1950s, Victor Callewaert met Ryba's daughter and started working for the fudge maker and they traveled America selling fudge. Until then, Callewaert was known for hawking copies of the Detroit Free Press in front of the shop.\n\n\"In 1959, they wanted to go to Mackinac Island and actually be legit and make Mackinac Island fudge on Mackinac Island. In the summer of 1960, I was in my mom's belly, and we moved to the island and rented a storefront and lived above it and made fudge below,\" Todd Callewaert said. \"In 1969, the Island House Hotel was about to be torn down for back taxes. ... My father, Uncle Jimmy and Grandpa Harry stepped in and took it over, renovated it and opened it in 1972. They saved it from the wrecking ball.\"\n\nThese days, a dozen family members are involved in the operation.\n\nHis sister, Mary Callewaert, 62, of Grosse Pointe is vice president of the family business and taking things day by day.\n\n\"We have no plans. We're not going to endanger anyone. And, for now, the island is on lockdown,\" she said. \"I have daffodils in the front yard I never realized I had,\" she said. \"I’m usually gone up to the island right about now. I've been in quarantine since I don't even remember. I am not in a rush to open. People want to work, and I get it. But I just want everyone to be safe.\"\n\nStaffing challenge\n\nAs visitors to the Mackinac Straits region know, many seasonal employees come from other countries as temporary non-agricultural workers with H2B visas and live in dormitory-style housing. Hygh said:\n\nAs of now, employees from other countries with H2B visas are not able to return to the U.S. based on travel restrictions. If and how this will evolve remains unknown. Businesses are monitoring the situation closely.\n\nSeasonal employees with H2B visas returning to the Northern Michigan region all currently reside within the U.S., and have not recently traveled internationally. Businesses are evaluating the arrival timeline for seasonal workers on a daily basis.\n\nAt this time, it is recommended that island businesses work with off-island partners to provide temporary accommodations to seasonal workers, preventing unnecessary travel to the island and to align with the Stay Home, Stay Safe Executive Order and regional health department advisories, which include a 14-day quarantine for those who do return monitored by each employer daily.\n\nThere is not significant concern regarding a staffing shortage, as H2B workers only account for 25% of the seasonal staff required to run the island during high season.\n\nOpenings delayed\n\nDelayed openings include the Grand Hotel and Mackinac State Historic Parks. Island events have been canceled, too. The Mackinac Policy Conference has been moved from May to August because of COVID-19.\n\nMeanwhile, Hart’s Inn, the Metivier Inn and Cloghaun Bed & Breakfast are scheduled to open on June 1.\n\nFor Mackinac Island updates: mackinacisland.org/2020-season-updates\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard at 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/09/tech/tech-downturn", "title": "Silicon Valley braces for the good times to end | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor much of the past two decades, the ethos of Silicon Valley was largely defined by Facebook’s former motto: “move fast and break things.” But in a sudden and dizzying shift, the current mood in the tech sector could perhaps best be described with a far more restrained mantra: “cut costs and try to survive.”\n\nThe tech industry is facing a new reality check as broader economic conditions have deteriorated. Each week seems to bring concerning headlines of tech companies laying off employees and implementing hiring freezes while tech stocks get battered, cryptocurrencies crash and people inside and outside the industry warn about a possible recession.\n\nSilicon Valley is also arguably more sensitive than some other industries to shifting economic conditions, including from rising interest rates, given how many tech companies rely on easy access to funding to pursue their ambitious projects before making a profit, or in some cases, even generating revenue.\n\nIn recent weeks, investors and industry vets have been trying to raise alarms about the economic environment with a number of memos, tweets and other public statements. “The boom times of the last decade are unambiguously over,” venture capital firm Lightspeed, an early backer of Snapchat, said in a recent blog post. “No one can predict how bad the economy will get, but things don’t look good,” tech startup accelerator Y Combinator warned in a letter to founders, before adding: “The safe move is to plan for the worst.”\n\nBill Gurley, a prominent venture capitalist, summed up the shifting mood in a tweet last month seemingly directed at tech startups who may be in denial: “The cost of capital has changed materially, and if you think things are like they were, then you are headed off a cliff like Thelma and Louise.”\n\nWhile nobody can predict the length or severity of the current market downturn – and most industry watchers don’t expect it to be as damaging as the 2000 tech crash – the new rhetoric marks a stark reversal in tone for a high-flying industry. The tech sector, already dominant in our lives, only seemed to expand even more as the pandemic pushed people to work, shop and socialize through a screen. The number of unicorns, or startups valued at $1 billion or more, topped 1000 globally in February, roughly doubling from before the pandemic. Access to easy money, thanks in part to the low interest rates meant to buoy the economy, only seemed to fuel even more buzzy, cash-burning ventures.\n\nThen came a seemingly perfect storm: inflationary pressures, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising interest rates and recession warnings have wreaked havoc on the stock market, and in the tech sector specifically. The S&P 500’s Information Technology sector shed 19% since the beginning of the year, as of Wednesday, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has fallen more than 20%. In one sign of the times, Apple was unseated last month by oil giant Saudi Aramco as the world’s most valuable company.\n\nThere are indications of pain points for private tech companies, too, from reports of valuation markdowns to tougher fundraising rounds. There has also been a wave of layoffs across the industry, including at trading platform Robinhood, fintech unicorn Klarna and multiple ultra-fast delivery startups.\n\n“These corrections are always vicious and sudden, and it is amazing how quickly all of the experts and pundits and gurus change their tune,” Vasant Dhar, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, told CNN. “The market always has amnesia.”\n\nDhar, who has worked in tech for decades, said he’s weathered several booms and busts during his career, including the Dot-Com Bubble in 2000 and financial crisis in 2008. But, he said, “it’s always the younger people coming in who, as Bob Marley says, don’t know their history and get ahead of themselves. And then things correct – and things correct very, very suddenly.”\n\n‘A major sea change’\n\nIt’s been so long since the last prolonged downturn in the tech industry that some elder statesmen in Silicon Valley are using their platforms to try to remind the many tech workers who may never have worked in that environment what it was like.\n\n“Nobody can predict what is going to happen over the next 12 months but we haven’t had a real bad tech downturn since 2000,” Mike Schroepfer, who founded a startup in 2000 and later served as CTO at Facebook, wrote in a Twitter thread last month. “I have no idea if now is going to be the same, better, or worse than the 2000s crash. But bad times can last multiple years and if you can make decisions now that extend your runway that’s probably the right call.”\n\nFor much of the last decade or so, access to easy money combined with the rise of smartphones helped power a wave of ambitious and disruptive tech companies able and willing to burn through millions, if not billions, in venture capital in search of fast, global growth. A slew of tech startups from Uber to WeWork became household names while never turning a consistent profit. This era inspired multiple recent Hollywood productions, all glamourizing the excess founders enjoyed amid what seemed like a never-ending bull market run. But in another sign of the times, Uber signaled last month that it, too, intends to cut costs and “treat hiring as a privilege” as investor optimism recedes.\n\nA trader works at his post on the New York Stock Exchange floor, Wednesday, June 1, 2022. Courtney Crow/New York Stock Exchange/AP\n\n“This is a major sea change,” said Matt Kennedy, the senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs. “For years, startups generally followed the same playbook, which was grow as fast as possible at whatever the burn rate. That’s what their investors wanted to see. Capital was cheap, so losses didn’t matter.”\n\n“But that’s changed. Once again, profits matter,” he added. “I think that investors are looking a lot closer at the bottom line.”\n\nA more difficult startup and fundraising environment is not necessarily detrimental for all companies, though it may be “worse for the frothy ones,” Dhar said. The riskier ventures and earliest stage startups tend to suffer in these difficult economic times, Dhar said, but late-stage VC-backed companies might find the sudden evaporation of “pesky competition” advantageous.\n\nKennedy added that many fast-growth tech startups “need funding to survive” and more pain could be in store for some. “They’ve operated only as high-loss businesses, and that’s a difficult pivot to make,” he said. “As a result, I think we’ll see layoffs and down rounds. Some of these businesses will fold, others will be acquired.”\n\nMore resilient than Dot-Com era\n\nWhile many comparisons have been made to the anguish wrought by the burst of the Dot-Com bubble, the tech sector is far more developed now than it was in the past, according to Dan Wang, an associate professor at Columbia Business School.\n\n“Large tech companies, even though they’re tightening their belts, are still in a financially advantageous position,” Wang said. “And furthermore, a lot of the services that tech platforms, especially, provide are ones that consumers regard as indispensable.”\n\nThis “makes it very difficult to compare the two eras, or to suggest that what happened 20 years ago might be predictive of what happens in the next several months,” Wang added.\n\nDespite the fearful rhetoric and concerning daily headlines in the tech world, Dhar said he still sees the sector eventually bouncing back. “In the long run, tech is the future,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, corrections can even be beneficial for the tech sector, both by ensuring more financially viable companies end up going public and by eliminating some of the froth and excess in the market.\n\n“To be honest, some of the pitches I’ve heard over the last year have sounded like completely absurd,” Dhar quipped. “I have no idea why they would have valuations like that.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/12/27/dave-barrys-2015-year-review/77356058/", "title": "Dave Barry's 2015 Year in Review", "text": "Dave Barry\n\nTribune Content Agency\n\nSometimes we are accused -- believe it or not -- of being overly negative in our annual Year in Review.

A week later, Washington is again shaken when a Florida mailman, making a powerful statement for or against something, lands a gyrocopter on the lawn of the Capitol Building. He immediately becomes a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nElsewhere on the political front, Hillary Clinton declares her candidacy for president and sets out to demonstrate that she is a regular human by riding to Iowa in a custom van driven by Secret Service agents. In Maumee, Ohio, she stops at a Chipotle for takeout, a news event that produces a spasm of political journalism. The New York Times (we are not making this journalism up) breaks the story, reporting that Clinton wore sunglasses and ordered a chicken burrito bowl. Bloomberg gets a follow-up scoop, reporting that the Clinton party's bill was \"$20 and some change\" but Clinton \"did not leave a tip.\" Politico runs a 1,200-word story headlined (we are still not making this up) \"The 'everyday people' who made Hillary Clinton's burrito bowl.\" Incredibly, nobody thinks to do a profile of the chicken.\n\nIn other journalism news, Rolling Stone apologizes for a discredited story about an alleged rape at a college fraternity and announces that it has disciplined its lead fact-checker, Brian Williams.\n\nResponding with drastic measures to California's worsening drought, Gov.

Mayweather wins the fight and takes home $220 million, which works out to a little over $70 million per punch actually landed, then celebrates by attempting to wake up his entourage.\n\nElsewhere in sports, the Kentucky Derby is won by New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady, riding tight end Rob Gronkowski. All the actual horses in the race mysteriously collapse at the starting line from what Coach Bill Belichick speculates could be \"allergies.\" Brady also wins the Indianapolis 500 driving a U.S. Army M1 Abrams battle tank that averages only 30 miles per hour but proves to be extremely difficult for the other vehicles to pass.\n\nAbroad, there is big excitement in England, where Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge produce another royal baby, who, in a sign of the changing times, is christened Princess Brooklyn Dakota.

Trump is deemed to have no chance by veteran Washington-based political experts with vast knowledge of what all the other veteran Washington-based political experts think. Also declaring his candidacy, and predicted by the experts to do far better, is Jeb Bush, whose official campaign slogan is: \"Jeb! -- The Exclamation Mark Denotes Enthusiasm.\"\n\nSpeaking of excitement, in...\n\n...the New Horizons interplanetary probe, having traveled more than three billion miles over nearly 10 years, finally reaches Pluto and transmits back data proving conclusively -- in a discovery that sends shock waves of bladder malfunction throughout the astronomy community -- that Pluto consists of both ice AND rocks.\n\nThe nation reacts with horror to the news that a Minnesota dentist has killed Cecil the World's Suddenly Most Beloved Lion.

Equally alarming is the fact that the other end of the tunnel turns out to be in Miami.\n\nBut the big international news comes from Vienna, where Iran signs a deal with the United States and five other nations under which Iran, in exchange for a lot of money, promises to stop trying to build a nuclear bomb. President Obama says the deal \"makes our country, and the world, safer and more secure.\" For his part, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says, quote, \"Death to America,\" but he says it in what U.S. negotiators describe as \"a softer tone.\"\n\nIn sports, the U.S. wins the Women's World Cup, defeating Japan 5-2, with three of the goals being scored by Tom Brady wearing a Brandi Chastain model sports bra.\n\nSpeaking of hot, in...\n\n...The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that July was the hottest month globally ever recorded.

Harding out at the far edges. Jeb Bush has an off night, falling asleep several times during his own answers. Ben Carson does better, except for when he identifies Pyongyang as \"a kind of lobster.\" Trump dominates the evening, at one point ordering everybody to shut up while he takes a call onstage from Beyonce. Savvy Washington-based political insiders agree, after conferring with other savvy Washington-based political insiders, that Trump's unorthodox behavior will alienate voters and he will be out of the race by fall.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton continues to have no choice but to roll her eyes over all these pesky scandals that her enemies keep dreaming up to prevent her from serving the American people, especially women. The current scandal involves the email server she used as secretary of state, which, in a deviation from government-security standards, was located in her home and had Mrs. Clinton's personal secret password (\"PASSWORD\") written on a sticky note stuck to the front. A Clinton spokesperson, speaking through another Clinton spokesperson who was briefed by a third Clinton spokesperson on condition of anonymity, denies that the server ever held classified emails, and promises that it will be turned over to the FBI \"as soon as it has been melted down to a softball-sized blob.\"\n\nIn financial news, the stock market unexpectedly plunges more than 1,000 points.

Congress, inspired to take rare bipartisan action but apparently confused by Francis' thick accent, votes unanimously to declare war on Greenland.\n\nIn political news, The New York Times runs the following actual headline: \"Hillary Clinton to Show More Humor and Heart, Aides Say.\" Clinton reportedly will display 17 percent more humor and 23 percent more heart, according to anonymous Clinton aides who were briefed by anonymous Clinton strategists who had direct access to what one source, who asked not to be named, described as \"a high-level Clinton confidante.\" The source said the Clinton team is also considering having her \"directly engage selected voters in banter.\"\n\nOn the Republican side, Rick Perry and Scott Walker drop out of the presidential race after polls show them both trailing the late Warren G. Harding. Meanwhile Donald Trump continues to present his vision for America's future in the form of a steady stream of hastily composed tweets insulting people who have offended him. This strategy has Trump easily leading the GOP field, to the consternation of knowledgeable Washington-based insiders with vast knowledge pertaining to the inside of Washington.\n\nExcited Apple fans line up to purchase the new iPhone 6s, which is identical to the iPhone 6, except it has a special alarm that will alert Apple fans exactly when to line up to purchase the next new iPhone, due out in approximately three months.\n\nIn business news, the Environmental Protection Agency accuses Volkswagen of cheating on emissions testing, precipitating an international scandal that ultimately forces VW's Martin Winterkorn to resign and take a job as equipment manager for the New England Patriots.\n\nSpeaking of scandals, in...\n\n...Hillary Clinton testifies for 127 straight hours before the House Committee On Investigating Benghazi Until The Earth Crashes Into The Sun. There are many testy exchanges between Clinton and Republican congressmen, but in the end the American public has a much clearer picture of the extremely high level of mutual loathing that makes our government work the way it does.\n\nIn other political news, a person calling himself \"Lincoln Chafee\" manages to get onto the stage of the Democratic presidential candidates' debate on CNN and make several policy statements before he is noticed by security and escorted out. This might have been embarrassing for the Democrats, but fortunately nobody is watching CNN, including moderator Anderson Cooper, who is openly playing Candy Crush.\n\nAfter much agonizing, Vice President Joe Biden announces that he will not run for president, stressing that the decision had nothing to do with the severed horse head wearing a HILLARY! button he found in his bed, which Biden says he believes \"was meant in a supportive way.\"\n\nMeanwhile the Republican candidates' debate on CNBC takes a lively turn when Ted Cruz, responding to a question about the federal budget agreement, throws a chair at moderator Carl Quintanilla, setting off a round of applause so loud that it awakens Jeb Bush, who notes that as governor of Florida he had a strong record of promoting furniture safety. Knowledgeable Washington insiders declare that the clear debate winners are Cruz, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie, so it is no surprise that Donald Trump and Ben Carson surge still farther ahead in the polls.\n\nIn sports, FIFA, the scandal-plagued governing body of international soccer, suspends its president, Sepp \"Sepp\" Blatter. Among those seeking to replace him is a South African businessman named -- we are not making this name up -- Tokyo Sexwale.\n\nA huge military blimp breaks loose from its moorings and rampages across Pennsylvania, wreaking havoc and knocking out power for thousands before being lured back into captivity by a Hello Kitty blimp hastily borrowed from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and positioned in what a Pentagon source describes as \"a provocative pose.\"\n\nSpeaking of havoc, in...\n\n...the world reels in shock after horrific terrorist attacks in Paris and Mali. With rumors of new threats coming daily, the U.S. State Department briefly considers unleashing Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand (code name \"Doomsday Duet\") to sing \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers,\" but elects instead to issue a Worldwide Travel Alert, warning American citizens to avoid potentially dangerous areas, \"especially the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\" The department assures Americans that \"there is no need to panic,\" stressing that they should \"remain in bed paralyzed by butt-puckering fear.\"\n\nBut November is not just a time for fear: It is also a time, as Thanksgiving ushers in the holiday season, for all Americans, regardless of ethnicity, religion or political views, to be deeply offended. Nobody is more offended than college students, who stage a series of protests over the racism, sexism, fascism, heteronormism and -- trigger warning -- insensitive Halloween costumes that constitute the festering hellhole of hurtful things that is the modern American college campus and THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT.\n\nAlso deeply offended in November are people who have taken time out of their busy lives to notice that the 2015 Starbucks holiday cup is just plain red and -- trigger warning -- does not have snowflakes or reindeer on it. This is yet another salvo in the War On Christmas, which has completely eliminated Christmas from our lives except for Christmas carols playing on loudspeakers everywhere and huge Christmas displays in every store and Christmas movies on TV constantly and numerous Christmas-related news stories and an endless stream of Christmas-themed commercials running 24/7 since approximately Labor Day.\n\nIn presidential politics, Ben Carson reacts angrily to CNN reports suggesting that he never tried to stab anybody or hit his mother with a hammer. Really. Donald Trump continues his two-pronged campaign of saying reprehensible things and then clarifying his statements by saying he didn't really say them so STOP HATING, YOU PATHETIC LOSERS, a strategy that continues to cost him vital support among knowledgeable Washington insiders. Jeb Bush seeks to revive his flagging campaign by unleashing an awesome new slogan -- \"Jeb Can Fix It! -- and immediately surges ahead in the coveted three-year-old-boy voter demographic.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton continues to execute spontaneous acts such as smiling while campaigning on the theme that she is both a human being and a woman who cares about other humans in the middle class and women specifically.\n\nIn a major sports upset, the seemingly invincible Ronda Rousey is defeated in a UFC title fight by Tom Brady, who uses a maneuver he calls the \"crowbar,\" although Coach Bill Belichick is quick to point out that, in fact, it is \"just a regular claw hammer.\"\n\nIn the World Series, the Kansas City Royals defeat the New York Mets. The payrolls of these two teams combined are less than the payroll of the New York Yankees, who were eliminated immediately from the playoffs in the wild-card game by the Houston Astros, whose payroll is less than a third of the Yankees'.\n\nAs the month draws to a close, tensions in the Middle East run high amid rumors that the Obama administration, in what would be a major escalation of American presence, is considering staging a Black Friday sale in Syria. Fortunately these rumors prove to be false and the worst retail violence is confined within U.S. borders. But the world situation remains troubling in....\n\n...when, with the menacing specter of global climate change looming like some kind of spectral menace or something, 150 world leaders, finally getting serious about this urgent threat to the planet's future, decide to stay home and confer via Skype.\n\nHa-ha! Seriously, the leaders all fly to Paris, where they and their security details and their vast minion entourages travel around in high-speed motorcades to attend dinners and make speeches about the importance of figuring out how to reduce these pesky carbon emissions. In the end they sign a Historic Agreement under which all parties commit to a concrete, legally binding and unbreakable schedule of potentially attending additional conferences at some point in the future, although skeptics note that Chinese President Xi Jinping signs his name on the official document as \"Phil McCracken.\"\n\nIn another feel-good story, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announces that he will give back the 45 billion hours that the average American has wasted on Facebook.\n\nOn a more disturbing note, the Food and Drug Administration confirms reports that genetically modified fruits and vegetables have been escaping from supermarkets and mating in the wild with other species. The FDA stresses that this is \"a manageable problem\" and downplays sightings in Florida of a so-called \"potator,\" half potato and half alligator, which according to terrified locals lurks underground, has huge jaws and dozens of eyes, and can be stopped only by bullets tipped with sour cream.\n\nSpeaking of potatoes: Tensions rise in Europe when the Russian government announces that it is launching a new business startup called \"Tuber,\" described as \"like Uber, except with tanks.\"\n\nIn entertainment news, 20th Century Fox denies rumors that in the movie \"The Revenant,\" the character played by Leonard DiCaprio is raped by a bear. \"The bear in the film is a female,\" states a Fox spokesperson, referring to a computer-generated bear nicknamed \"Judy,\" who on the same day is nominated for a film-industry animation award in the same category as the Hulk. This actually happened.\n\nIn presidential politics, Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump.\n\nBut with the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary just around the corner, analysts struggle to make sense of new polls showing that, suddenly, the clear leader in both states, for both parties, is Tom Brady.\n\nThe scary part is: That wouldn't be so bad.\n\nAs the year finally staggers to a close, Americans set aside their differences, if only briefly, and join together in the cherished, time-honored tradition of pretending that New Year's Eve is fun. So let's raise a glass to toast the demise of 2015. Then let's set the glass down untasted, in case, God forbid, it contains gluten. Then let's go to bed.\n\nHappy New Year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/27"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/957815/these-are-the-uks-most-poisonous-spiders", "title": "The scariest spiders in existence | The Week", "text": "There are close to 50,000 known species of spiders, with another 50,000 estimated to be undiscovered. While the creepy arachnids can be frightening to look at, many are harmless to humans. However, there are some that have the ability to cause nasty bites — and in some cases, be deadly. Here are six of the scariest spiders to look out for and steer clear of.\n\n1. Yellow sac spiders\n\nBlack-footed yellow sac spider (Image credit: Mark Dean / Getty Images)\n\nThere are many species of sac spiders, but the yellow sac spider (Cheiracanthium inclusum) is the most notorious. While not necessarily deadly, \"the spider's venom is a cytotoxin (a substance that destroys a cell or impairs its function) that can produce necrotizing lesions\" in more extreme cases, said Britannica . The species is indigenous to most of the U.S. except the northernmost states. Yellow sac spiders \"probably account for more human bites than any other type of spider,\" said Michigan State University . Humans usually incur bites outdoors while gardening in the summer.\n\n2. White-tailed spider\n\nWhite-tailed spider (Image credit: Natalia Marshall / Getty Images)\n\nIdentified by a \"dark reddish to grey, cigar-shaped body and dark orange-brown banded legs,\" the white-tailed spider (Lampona cylindrata) is native to Australia, said the Australian Museum . Their bites, while not deadly, can cause \"nausea, vomiting and a nasty headache,\" said the BBC . Most of the time, they just cause skin irritation, although their scary appearance has brought about misconceptions. \"Unlike other poisonous spiders, white-tailed spiders are common but not aggressive. They prey on other spiders, helping control harmful species,\" said Immediate Response . \"Despite this, urban legends have made them seem more deadly than they really are.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Brown recluse spider\n\nBrown recluse spider (Image credit: Peter Muller / Getty Images)\n\nThe brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa) is one of the only common spiders in the U.S. that is considered venomous — though their bite rarely, if ever, kills a person. Its venom \"destroys the walls of blood vessels near the site of the bite, sometimes causing a large skin ulcer,\" said Britannica . These spiders can be identified by their pale brown color and eye pattern where six eyes are \"arranged in three pairs in a semicircle pattern with a space between each pair,\" said the Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES). The brown recluse likes to hide and hunt prey. It can bite out of self-defense and release a harmful cytotoxin. While usually the bite heals in approximately three weeks, in some cases it \"can cause necrotizing wounds, so you'll want to see a doctor immediately if you think you've been bitten by one,\" said Prevention .\n\n4. Funnel-web spider\n\nSydney funnel-web spider (Image credit: Ken Griffiths / Getty Images)\n\nThere are several funnel-web spiders, but the most well-known is the Atrax robustus. These arachnids, found in Australia, are \"large, black aggressive spider[s] with large powerful fangs,\" said the University of Melbourne . Their bites can be incredibly dangerous. The spider's venom \"contains a toxin that attacks the human nervous system, so bites need immediate medical attention — otherwise, a victim can die within 15 minutes,\" said Live Science . The venom from this spider can cause \"numbness around the mouth and spasms of the tongue, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, acute gastric dilatation, profuse sweating, salivation, lacrimation [and] piloerection,\" said the University of Melbourne.\n\n5. Black widow\n\nFemale black widow spider (Image credit: Kimberly Hosey / Getty Images)\n\nWhen you think of a deadly spider, the black widow (Latrodectus genus) is likely the kind that springs to mind. There are several species of black widows, mostly native to North America. Both male and female black widows are dangerous, but the female ones are famous for their easily identifiable shiny black exteriors and red bowtie patterns. The spiders are \"formidable predators that feed on live insects, other spiders and arthropods, as well as on other members of their species,\" said the University of Tennessee .\n\nThe bite of a black widow can be extremely toxic and is \"known to disrupt signals in the nervous system, thus causing muscle pain and spasms, rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure,\" said Live Science . \"In some cases, it leads to inflammation that can ultimately restrict breathing.\" The name \"black widow\" comes from the female arachnid's tendency to eat the male after mating.\n\n6.

They also are adding a TV at the main bar and multiple on the mezzanine level for watching football or hosting private parties.\n\nThe Klonaris family will retain The Square Room, their event business behind Café 4.\n\nThe Klonaris family currently owns and operates Vida, The Vault and Kefi in downtown Knoxville, with plans to bring Jim's on Jackson steakhouse to the Old City.\n\nKlonaris said they have been asked to bring a new restaurant concept to downtown Maryville, similar to how they were recruited to downtown Knoxville 13 years ago.\n\nTheir new Italian-American concept, Bella, is expected to open in downtown Maryville in January. They plan to open a separate concept just next door.\n\nKlonaris said he likely will eat at Café 4 more than ever, no longer having to worry about the business during his meals.\n\n\"It was a little bittersweet to let your first-born, if you will, go and leave your household, which is the way I'm looking at it,\" Klonaris said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/18/winning-lottery-ticket-stray-cat-feeding-trial-booby-trapped-political-signs-news-around-states/50850039/", "title": "Winning lottery ticket, stray cat feeding trial, booby-trapped political ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nWetumpka: The trials for two women facing misdemeanor charges for feeding stray cats in the city have been delayed. The trials for Beverly Roberts, 85, and Mary Alston, 60, were set in Wetumpka Municipal Court for Thursday. The trials have been continued and a new date has not been set, said Terry Luck, one of the women’s defense attorneys. Luck and the women’s other attorney, retired Montgomery County Circuit Judge William Shashy, have scheduling conflicts, he said. The defense also asked city prosecutor Kenny James to recuse himself; he has a potential conflict of interest since he represented Roberts in a divorce case, Luck said. James has recused himself. Roberts faces charges of criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, and Alston faces charges of criminal trespassing and interfering with governmental operations, records show. In June both women were arrested on public property in downtown Wetumpka while they were attempting to feed and trap stray cats. Once the cats are trapped, the women pay to have them neutered and either work to get them adopted to return them to the stray colony. Officers arrived and arrested them, saying they had been previously trespassed and were told not to feed animals. Wetumpka Police Chief Greg Benton says the feeding of the animals created a nuisance because it attracts more cats to the area. Benton said both women were “repeatedly” warned not to feed the cats and could have prevented the arrests by heeding those warnings. Luck says the arrests are baseless and that the women were performing a service by working to neuter the animals and prevent the stay cat population from growing.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola reported raising $2.3 million in just over three weeks in September, leaving the Democrat with a large cash advantage over Republican rivals Sarah Palin and Nick Begich heading into the Nov. 8 election. Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka, a Republican challenger backed by former President Donald Trump, each raised just over $1 million from late July to Sept. 30, though Murkowski had about three times more cash available at the end of the period. The filings Saturday with the Federal Election Commission for the House race cover Sept. 6 through Sept. 30. Filings in the Senate race covered July 28 through Sept. 30. Peltola on Aug. 31 won a special election to fill Alaska’s House seat until January in a race that also included Palin and Begich. Next month’s election will decide who holds the seat for a two-year term, starting in January. Peltola, in the latest filings, reported having nearly $2.3 million available at the end of September. Palin, a former Alaska governor and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, reported bringing in about $230,000 during the latest period and having about $195,000 available. Begich reported raising about $57,500 and having just over $545,000 available. Begich loaned his campaign $650,000 earlier in the cycle.\n\nArizona\n\nSun City West: A father’s quick reaction kept a 12-year-old girl breathing after she was struck by lightning. Her father performed CPR three times after she was struck during Saturday’s storms in Sun City West. The girl, Ella, had stepped outside of her grandparent’s house to play with a friend when her father Steven Jorgensen heard loud thunder, saw a bright flash and saw her collapse. Jorgensen said he saw his daughter fall and immediately started performing CPR, which he learned while serving in the Marine Corps. “I got her heart back going, I got her breathing, and it was only for a short amount of time until I lost her again,” Jorgensen said. Jorgensen restarted CPR, got her heart to beat again and brought her inside the home while his parents were calling 911. While he was talking to the dispatcher, Ella’s heart stopped again. As Jorgensen started performing CPR for a third time, he said he was trying to remain calm and remembered a scene from the TV show “The Office” where they learn how to perform CPR. “You could hear me singing the Bee Gee’s ‘Staying Alive’ as I was giving her a resuscitation and then finally I got her going,” Jorgensen said. About three minutes later, emergency responders showed up and took over. Ella was taken to Banner Thunderbird Medical Center, and then she was flown to Valleywise Health Medical Center where she has been recovering “very well,” said Dr. Kevin Foster, Director of the Arizona Burn Center at Valleywise Health.\n\nArkansas\n\nVan Buren: A man who had been booked into the Crawford County Jail on Friday died in custody Saturday, an attorney representing his family said. Jacob Allen Jones, 26, was booked at the jail by Van Buren police on a complaint of failure to appear on prior drug charges at 4:12 p.m. Friday, jail records show. Attorney David Powell of Fort Smith said Jones died Saturday. He said Jones overdosed at the jail. He said Jones was in a cell for several hours without medical care. “I’m trying to get all of the information I can,” Powell said Sunday night. Efforts to reach Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante Sunday were unsuccessful. Jones’ body was taken to the state medical examiner’s office in Little Rock where the cause and the manner of death will be determined, the Crawford County Coroner’s office reported Monday. Powell said Jones suffered a medical episode at the jail. Other inmates stated they called for help from detention officers. Four detention officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, Powell said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California’s coronavirus emergency will officially end in February, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday, nearly three years after the state’s first confirmed death from the disease prompted a raft of restrictions that upended public life. The decision will have little practical impact on most people’s lives, as most of the nearly 600 pandemic-related orders Newsom has issued since the start of the pandemic have already been lifted. And it won’t affect public health orders – including a pending statewide vaccine mandate for schoolchildren that could take effect next summer. But it does signal a symbolic end for some of the most restrictive elements of the pandemic, as it will dissolve Newsom’s authority to alter or change laws to make it easier for the government to quickly respond to the public health crisis. “The State of Emergency was an effective and necessary tool that we utilized to protect our state, and we wouldn’t have gotten to this point without it,” Newsom said in a news release, adding that the declaration will formally end on Feb. 28. Newsom declared a state of emergency for the coronavirus on March 4, 2020, shortly after an elderly patient was the first confirmed death from the disease in California. At the time, there were just 53 cases of COVID-19 in California, and state officials were holding a cruise ship off the coast so it could test passengers before allowing them to disembark in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo County: Nearly 110,000 voters in a southern Colorado county will be receiving general election ballots that were mistakenly labeled as primary election ballots, a blunder that has led the state’s secretary of state to appoint a supervisor to oversee November’s vote in a county that also had issues with ballots in its primary election. The misprint on ballots that are being sent out to voters in Pueblo County was on a tear-off tab and does not effect the “legal validity” or accuracy of the rest of the ballot, Secretary of State Jena Griswold’s office said in a news release Monday. For that reason and because of the short time frame before the ballots were mailed, they will not be reprinted. It is the second time this year that the county has had problems with ballots.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: A commuter train struck a tractor trailer in Connecticut on Monday, authorities said. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said a Metro-North train headed to Bridgeport hit a tractor trailer at a railroad crossing in Waterbury shortly before 11 a.m. The MTA did not provide any information about injuries, but Lt. Ryan Bessette of the Waturbury police said the tractor driver and at least two train passengers were treated for injuries that appeared to be minor. Train service in the area was halted while police and the MTA investigated the crash.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A 29-year-old man who was fatally shot early Sunday in Dover has been identified by police. Jesse Holley marks the city’s first homicide this year. Police were dispatched to the 100 block of S. Bradford St. just after 1:10 a.m. Sunday after receiving a call for a shooting. Arriving officers found Holley there. Dover Police Master Cpl. Ryan Schmid said Holley had a gunshot wound to his lower body. Holley was taken to an area hospital, where he died. This is Dover’s first homicide since June 30, 2021, when 19-year-old Tysean Nelson was one of four people shot in the capital city’s 100 block of S. New St. So far this year, 14 people have been shot in Dover – one fatally. Last year at the same time, 36 people had been shot in Dover – three of them fatally. Holley’s fatal shooting investigation is ongoing and anyone with information should contact the Dover police.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Authorities said a maintenance worker brought a registered gun into a high school, WUSA-TV reports. The worker showed up to Anacostia High School with the gun in his bag after the school requested a worker for repairs, and the man was arrested. Police didn’t say if the gun was loaded, according to the news outlet. Having a firearm on school property is not allowed at any D.C. Public Schools campus. No injuries were reported. “Please be assured that no one was harmed, and the incident was promptly handled according to our security procedures,” DCPS Press Secretary Deborah Isaac said. “All students and staff remained safe and supervised during this incident.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: A winning lottery ticket worth a share of a $494 million Mega Millions jackpot was purchased in a city hammered by Hurricane Ian late last month. State lottery officials on Monday said one of the two winning tickets was purchased at a 7-Eleven in Fort Myers. The other winning ticket was bought in California. Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwest Florida as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 28 and has been blamed for more than 100 fatalities in the state. It was the third-deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland this century. More than half of the storm-related deaths in Florida were reported in Lee County, which includes Fort Myers. Lottery winners in the state have 180 days to claim their prize. Under a new state law, lottery winners can remain anonymous for 90 days from the day they claim the winnings, if their prize is worth $250,000 or more. Past winners have also set up legal trusts as a way to keep their identities anonymous.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTown: A college student died after being struck by the propeller of a small plane as he disembarked at an airport in southeast Georgia, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Board are investigating the death Sunday night at Statesboro-Bulloch County Airport, FAA spokesman Steve Kulm said. Sani Aliyu, of Atlanta, and a young woman had flown on the single-engine Cessna to nearby Savannah and back on a date, Bulloch County Coroner Jake Futch told the Statesboro Herald. He said the plane landed safely on the return trip to Statesboro. The woman “got off the plane and walked toward the back of the plane,” Futch said, “and he got off the airplane and walked toward the front of the plane, and when he did, the propeller hit him.” Aliyu was a sophomore enrolled at Georgia Southern University, school spokeswoman Melanie Simon said. A pilot and co-pilot had flown the couple, said Capt. Todd Hutchens of the Bulloch County Sheriff’s Office. He said deputies were sharing information they gathered with the FAA and NTSB. “Nobody is really at fault or anything,” Hutchens said. “It was an accident.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former building plans examiner pleaded guilty Monday to all charges in an indictment accusing him of participating in a scheme to take bribes in exchange for expediting projects. Wayne Inouye pleaded guilty to six counts of honest services wire fraud and one count of making a false statement. He did not have an agreement with U.S. prosecutors about what sentence they will seek. Prosecutors say Inouye took at least $89,000 in bribes from an architect and several thousand dollars from others to approve and expedite their projects ahead of others. Inouye lied to an FBI agent and federal prosecutor when he told them an architect loaned him $100,000, Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Nolan said. When asked by the judge at Monday’s hearing to describe what he did, Inouye didn’t use the words bribe or bribery. He said an architect offered to compensate him to review plans before submitting them so that he could ensure they were code-compliant. “These plans would have been approved anyway,” he said, but added that they were expedited. He also said he received compensation from a signage contractor to help them submit their application to the department. He said he made a misleading statement to an FBI agent and a federal prosecutor when he told them the compensation was a loan. Honest services wire fraud carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, while the false statement charge has a maximum sentences of up to five years.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State revenue from tax collections was $50 million below expectations for the first three months of the current fiscal year, but the state still has a $1.5 billion budget surplus, officials said Monday. The Legislative Services Office said September’s revenue was down about $11 million, with sales and corporate income taxes below predictions. That follows similar misses by small amounts on projections for July and August. Despite the $50 million drop, about 3.6%, in projected revenue for the first three months of this fiscal year, the state is still seeing revenue growth and bringing in more money compared to the same period last year – about $94 million more, or 7.5%. The Division of Financial Management also released a report earlier this month providing a snapshot of the state’s finances. Both reports include a $500 million income tax rebate this year approved by lawmakers in a special session in September, as well as an ongoing income and corporate tax cut that takes effect Jan. 1. The ongoing cut comes from creating a 5.8% flat tax that is expected to cut more than $100 million from revenue for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. Those tax cuts came out of a budget surplus then estimated at about $2 billion.\n\nIllinois\n\nSycamore: A mountain lion that was struck and killed last weekend along a highway will be analyzed by biologists seeking to uncover the rare animal’s origins, state wildlife officials said. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources said Monday the mountain lion died Sunday after being hit by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County. Illinois State Police recovered the carcass, which will undergo a necropsy and DNA analysis at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana. The DNR said that analysis will provide insight “about the animal, its place of origin, and exploratory movements across the Midwest.” DNR experts believe the mountain lion may be the same one recorded in late September by a trail camera on private property in northwestern Illinois’ Whiteside County, which abuts Iowa. Mountain lions were eliminated from Illinois prior to the 1870s due to habitat loss and hunting. They have been a protected species in Illinois since 2015.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch tested positive for COVID-19 after experiencing cold-like symptoms on Monday, according to her office. Crouch said in a Twitter post that she had “mild symptoms and will continue to work for Hoosiers from home while following all of Indiana’s COVID guidelines.” Crouch was at her home in Evansville after testing positive with the COVID-19 virus for the first time, said her office spokesman, Ron Green. Crouch, 70, received two initial doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021 and has since gotten a booster shot, Green said. Crouch has been lieutenant governor since 2017 as Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s running mate in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. She previously was state auditor for three years after serving nine years as a state legislator from Evansville.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson was released Tuesday morning from a Cedar Rapids hospital where she was being treated for a kidney infection, her office said. Hinson spent two nights in UnityPoint St. Luke’s Hospital after being admitted Sunday evening, according to her office. “I am feeling much better, will continue resting at home, and look forward to getting out on the road to be with Iowans soon,” Hinson said in a statement Tuesday morning. A debate scheduled for Tuesday night between Hinson, a Republican, and her Democratic challenger, Liz Mathis, was canceled in light of Hinson’s medical emergency. Iowa PBS, which was hosting the debate, said there are no plans to reschedule the debate.\n\nKansas\n\nFairway: The grounds of a former Native American boarding school will be searched to determine if any Indigenous children were buried there, state officials said. The Kansas Historical Society, which owns the site in Fairway, is contracting with the University of Kansas Center for Research to conduct a ground-penetrating radar survey of the 12 acres to search for unmarked graves, The Kansas City Star reported. The current Shawnee Indian Mission historical site was one of hundreds of schools run by the government and religious groups in the 1800s and 1900s. Thousands of Native American children were forcibly taken from their homes and placed in such schools, with a goal of assimilating them into white American culture and Christianity. Leaders of the Shawnee Tribe and other tribes had requested a search of the Fairway site. But tribal officials said in a statement that they were not consulted about the Historical Society’s project proposal before it was announced. “We have requested formal consultation to address serious concerns about the motives of this project, potential deficiencies in the process that may render incomplete findings, and what plans may be for utilizing any results from the project,” the tribe said. Patrick Zollner, executive director of the historical society, responded that the Shawnee Tribe was the “first to know” about the project proposal. He said the society also contacted other tribes, including the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, Kaw Nation, Osage Nation and others. Zollner and Erinn Barcomb-Peterson, a spokeswoman with the University of Kansas, emphasized that consultation with the tribes is ongoing and that work will not proceed until that process is completed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Education in Kentucky faces its own difficult recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a grim fact revealed Tuesday by statewide test scores showing that many students from elementary to high school struggled across a span of core subjects. Fewer than half of students tested statewide were reading at grade level, with even lower across-the-board scores posted in math, science and social studies. Education Commissioner Jason Glass acknowledged there’s “no quick fix” to overcome challenges caused by the pandemic, when schools shifted to virtual learning and staff shortages were common. The recovery in education will take “time and resources,” he stressed. “As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our students and our schools as they continue to recover from the interrupted learning that occurred over the past two years,” Glass said in a news release. “These assessment results will serve as the baseline from which we will move forward as we look to new and innovative learning opportunities for all of Kentucky’s students.” Kentucky has received more than $2 billion in federal funding through the Democratic-backed American Rescue Plan passed by Congress last year. The funding aims to help accelerate learning and provide additional support to districts and the students who need it the most. Kentucky’s results are consistent with what many other states are experiencing, Glass said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A shipwreck has emerged along the banks of the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge as water levels plummet – threatening to reach record lows in some areas. The ship, which archaeologists believe to be a ferry that sunk in the late 1800s to early 1900s, was spotted by a Baton Rouge resident walking along the shore earlier this month. The discovery is the latest to surface from ebbing waters caused by drought. During the summer, receding waters in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area revealed several skeletal remains, countless desiccated fish, a graveyard of forgotten boats and even a sunken World War II-era craft that once surveyed the lake. “Eventually the river will come back up and (the ship) will go back underwater,” said Chip McGimsey, the Louisiana state archeologist, who has been surveying the wreck during the past two weeks. “That’s part of the reason for making the big effort to document it this time – cause she may not be there the next time.” McGimsey believes that the ship may be the Brookhill Ferry, which likely carried people and horse-drawn wagons from one-side of the river to the other – before major bridges spanned the mighty Mississippi. Newspaper archives indicate that the ship sank in 1915 during a major storm. But this is not the first time the low water levels have revealed the ship. McGimsey said that tiny parts of the vessel were exposed in 1990s.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A police officer was justified in shooting a man in Bangor, despite a review of evidence that showed the officer was farther away from the man than previously thought, the state’s attorney general said. Attorney General Aaron Frey conducted a second review of the shooting of Brian Barker, who was shot three times and survived in 2018. Frey said Friday that his office determined that the officer was more than 37 feet away from Barker and not about 15 feet as it initially stated. Frey said Barker’s movements leading up to the shooting still represented enough of a threat to justify the use of deadly force, the Bangor Daily News reported. Bangor police officers were checking on Barker and saw that he had a knife, which they repeatedly asked him to put down. Frey said Barker’s movements before the shooting made it unclear if he was going to attempt to attack one of the officers on the scene, the Daily News reported. The 21-foot distance marker between officers and a suspect is sometimes referred to as “kill zone” because officers are taught that at that distance an armed person can quickly close the distance.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced an investment of $77 million on Monday for realignment and upgrades to the state’s section of U.S. 219 in Garrett County. Hogan said Monday that the plan advances his pledge to address Maryland’s portion of the U.S. 219 corridor between Interstate 68 and Meyerdale, Pennsylvania, to improve safety, expand economic opportunity, and reinforce the regional supply chain. Hogan also officially dedicated the portion of U.S. 219 in Maryland to retiring state Sen. George Edwards. He cited the senator’s support for improvements that benefit the region. The latest improvements to Maryland’s portion of U.S. 219 will renovate and expand the 1-mile segment between Old Salisbury Road and the Pennsylvania state line. In 2021, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration completed the first phase, which included nearly $65 million of upgrades along U.S. 219 between I-68 and Old Salisbury Road. Finishing the second phase has been identified as Garrett County’s top transportation priority.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlympton: Striking truckers used tractor-trailers to block the exits at New England’s largest wholesale food distributor Monday and prevented some employees from leaving, resulting in as many as 20 arrests, police said. More than 400 Teamster union members arrived at the Sysco facility in Plympton, Massachusetts, in the early morning and stopped about 100 employees from leaving, Police Chief Matthew Ahl said in a statement. Police spent two hours negotiating with picketers. “After the attempted negotiation to move union members out of the roadway to create a safe passable environment, unfortunately we had to respond by removing members of the crowd who were inciting a hostile picket line,” the chief said. Sixteen to 20 people were arrested on charges including disorderly conduct and assault and battery, he said. After the arrests, traffic started to flow safely. About 300 Sysco drivers represented by the Teamsters Local 653 started their strike Oct. 1 seeking better pay and benefits. Voicemails seeking comment were left with union representatives.\n\nMichigan\n\nSturgis: The U.S. Supreme Court has said it would hear arguments brought by a deaf Michigan man who wants to sue his former school district for failing to provide him a suitable teacher who knew sign language for more than a decade and inflating his grades when he could neither read nor write. Miguel Perez, an immigrant who moved to the U.S. with his family as a child and is now in his 20s, has been trying for years to press a claim for compensatory damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) against the Sturgis Public School District in southwest Michigan. But lower courts, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati, have rejected that claim, saying Perez never exhausted the administrative review required first under another federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). No date has been set for oral arguments before the Supreme Court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Enbridge Energy, the owner and operator of the Line 3 pipeline project in northern Minnesota, will pay more than $11 million after investigations identified water quality violations and three aquifer breaches related to the pipeline’s construction, state regulators said Monday. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Department of Natural Resources announced the results from investigations of water quality violations and aquifer breaches related to the construction project. Combined with the previous DNR actions, and in partnership with Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the investigations have resulted in more than $11 million in payments, environmental projects, and financial assurances from Enbridge, according to the state agencies. The Minnesota agency investigation found that Enbridge violated regulations when it discharged construction storm water into wetlands and inadvertently releasing drilling mud into surface water at 12 locations in June and August of 2021. The DNR also finalized agreements with Enbridge to address three aquifer breaches related to Line 3 construction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Congress is investigating the crisis that left 150,000 people in the capital city without running water for several days in late summer, according to a letter sent to Gov. Tate Reeves by two Democratic officials. Reps. Bennie Thompson, of Mississippi, and Carolyn Maloney, of New York, sent the letter Monday requesting information on how Mississippi plans to spend $10 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act and from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and $429 million “specifically allotted to enhance the state’s water infrastructure.” The letter indicates “the start of a joint investigation” by the House Homeland Security and the Oversight and Reform committees into a crisis that deprived Jackson’s 150,000 residents of running water for several days in late August and early September, Adam Comis, a staffer for the committee, told The Associated Press. Thompson’s district includes most of Jackson, and he chairs the Homeland Security Committee. Maloney chairs the Oversight and Reform Committee. Jackson has had water problems for years, and the latest troubles began in late August after heavy rainfall exacerbated problems in the city’s main treatment plant, leaving many customers without running water. Jackson had already been under a boil-water notice since late July because the state health department found cloudy water that could make people ill. Running water was restored within days, and a boil-water notice was lifted in mid-September, but the letter to Reeves says “water plant infrastructure in the city remains precarious, and risks to Jackson’s residents persist.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Libraries receiving state funds would be required to determine what material is “age-appropriate” and restrict minors from accessing some books under a proposed rule submitted by the secretary of state Monday. The proposed rule, submitted by Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, would also allow parents to challenge a library’s “age-appropriate” designation, and ban state funds from being used to “purchase or acquire materials in any form that appeal to the prurient interest of any minor.” Libraries that receive state funds could see them cut off if they violate the proposed rule. “When state dollars are involved, we want to bring back local control and parental involvement in determining what children are exposed to,” Ashcroft, a Republican, said in a statement. “Foremost, we want to protect our children.” After the rule is formally published in the state register on Nov. 15, residents will be able to submit public comment on it for 30 days. Ashcroft cited state laws that gives his office authority for rulemaking over library funds when he filed the rule. Under the rule, libraries will have to adopt a “written, publicly-accessible” policy determining “how selections are made in considering the appropriateness for the age and maturity level of any minor ... who accesses any material in any form.” That policy will also allow parents and guardians to know what materials are available, and bans library employees from allowing minors to access those materials without a parent or guardian’s permission.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A federal administrative law judge has denied a request to block permits that expand bison grazing in north-central Montana while several parties challenge them. Gov. Greg Gianforte, Attorney General Austin Knudsen and the Montana Stockgrowers Association asked the U.S. Interior Department’s hearing division in August to reverse the the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s granting of the permits. Administrative Law Judge Veronica Larvie ruled on Oct. 13 that while there were several concerns about the permits, the parties failed to show that the expanded bison grazing would cause immediate and irreparable harm and she declined to block them while the case moves forward. The Stockgrowers argue additional bison grazing will harm the cattle industry and the local economy. The conservation group American Prairie sought the 10-year permits to remove some fences so bison could roam more freely in Phillips County south of Malta. The grazing area in dispute covers about 108 square miles. It will allow American Prairie to increase the size of its bison herd from about 800 animals to 1,000 bison by 2025, the group said.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: The body of a Texas woman found in the trunk of a car that crashed in south-central Nebraska during a police chase was the mother of the teenage driver, police have confirmed. The crash happened Friday along Interstate 80 near Grand Island, shortly after authorities were alerted to be on the lookout for a vehicle out of Texas believed to be involved in a possible homicide there, the Nebraska State Patrol said. A trooper spotted the car minutes later and attempted to stop it, but the driver refused to pull over and a chase ensued reaching speeds of more than 110 mph, the patrol said. The car soon crashed, and the 17-year-old driver suffered serious but non-lethal injuries, police said. Police also found the body of a woman in the car’s trunk. The following day, the patrol identified the woman as 49-year-old Michelle Roenz, of Harris County, Texas. The Harris County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Monday she is the mother of the 17-year-old boy who was driving the car. No charges against the teen appeared Monday in Nebraska online court records.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A 47-year-old man will spend up to 15 years in prison for sending death threats to a half-dozen Nevada elected officials in messages citing false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen. Matthew Carter was found guilty in September of three felony counts of aggravated talking and one count of misdemeanor harassment. Washoe County District Judge Egan Walker sentenced him last week to two to five years for each felony, to be served consecutively. Walker also sentenced Carter to six months for the misdemeanor but said it can be served concurrently, meaning at the same time as the other sentences. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said Monday that Carter sent multiple racist and threatening messages to U.S. Attorney Jason Frierson, state Treasurer Zach Conine, three members of the Nevada Assembly and Gov. Steve Sisolak’s chief of staff Yvanna Cancela. Frierson previously served as speaker of the Assembly and Cancela previously served as a state senator. The others targeted were Assembly members Steve Yeager, Lesley Cohen and Brittney Miller. Ford said the threats, which included racial slurs and references toward lynching, cited passage of expanded mail-in voting ahead of the election as a reason for his promised violence toward the officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAtkinson: A laboratory equipment distributor has been fined $140,000 on 14 felony counts of failing to file export information on shipments to Russia and Ukraine between 2015 and 2019. Intertech Trading Corporation, in Atkinson, pleaded guilty to falsely describing the nature and value of the exported items on commercial invoices and shipping forms, the U.S. attorney’s office in New Hampshire said. In its plea agreement filed in July, Intertech said that it used false descriptions such as “lamp for aquarium” or “spares for welding system,” rather than accurately identifying the sophisticated scientific equipment actually contained in the shipments. Intertech, which was sentenced in federal court Monday, admitted that it drastically undervalued the shipments, thereby evading the requirement to file Electronic Export Information, which would have been reported to the departments of Commerce and Homeland Security, the U.S. attorney’s office said. The company’s actions jeopardized national security, said Joseph Bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the FBI Boston Division. Intertech “had an unblemished record in the industry for more than 30 years and has been devastated financially” by the government’s investigation and the resulting plea agreement, its attorney said in a court document.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Supreme Court got two new members Monday. The Democrat-led state Senate confirmed Rachel Wainer Apter and Douglas Fasciale to fill two of three vacancies on the state’s highest court. Wainer Apter is currently the head of the civil rights division within the state attorney general’s office and previously served as counsel to the attorney general. Fasciale has been serving a temporary assignment on the high court since mandatory retirements left openings. He served as a judge on the Appellate Division since 2010 and was a state Superior Court judge from 2004 to 2010. Murphy appointed Wainer Apter, a Democrat, in 2021, but her nomination was held up as state senators vetted her appointment. Murphy appointed Fasciale, a Republican, last month. Their appointments track with a New Jersey tradition of governors appointing no more than four members from their own party. “This prevents the Court from lurching too far in one direction or the other. It forces Governors to select nominees from among the best lawyers and judges in the state, regardless of party,” Murphy said when he appointed Fasciale. The seven-member court still has one more vacancy, which Murphy must fill and the Senate confirm.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The New Mexico Civil Guard has been barred from publicly acting as a military unit without authorization or assuming the role of law enforcement by using organized force at public protests or gathering, according to a newspaper. The Albuquerque Journal reported Tuesday that District Court Judge Elaine Lujan also has banned such activity by the group’s directors, officers, agents, employees, members and any of their successor organizations and members. Lujan granting a motion by Bernalillo County District Attorney Raúl Torrez, who told the Journal that the decision, “fundamentally represents a victory for the rule of law….We’re trying to prevent violent extremism.”A lawsuit alleged members of the New Mexico Civil Guard violated state law by exercising or attempting to exercise the functions of a peace officer without authority and have organized and operated as a military unit without having been called to military service by the governor, according to the Journal. The newspaper said the governor has exclusive authority under the state Constitution to call on the militia to keep the public peace.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Thieves stole 20 cars from a dealership and will likely use the vechicles to commit other crimes, a top police official said. The car thieves hit a Mistubishi dealership over the weekend, broke open a lock box that held keys and drove off with late-model cars, NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said Monday. While some stolen cars are sold overseas, Essig said investigators believe the cars stolen from the Mitsubishi lot will be used to carry out other crimes. “Our feeling is just based on the way crime is going, people taking these cars, they will use these 20 cars in multiple robberies and burglaries throughout the city, switching plates on and off and on and off,” Essig told reporters. Employees did not realize the cars were gone until they came in Monday morning, the chief said. One of the stolen cars was recovered in Brooklyn, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: With abortions in the state and the number of out-of-state clinic patients soaring after Roe v. Wade was struck down, judges should permit more trained health professionals to prescribe pills for medication-induced abortions, plaintiffs in a lawsuit wrote on Monday. Abortion providers, medical workers and an abortion-rights group awaiting trial next year in their 2020 lawsuit challenging many state abortion rules asked a three-judge panel to act now and block a law limiting who can provide such medication from just certain licensed physicians. Allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who work at certified abortion clinics to prescribe these pills would immediately expand access to abortion in North Carolina, the plaintiffs said. These “advanced practice clinicians” already can prescribe the same two medicines used in medication-induced abortions for managing a patient’s miscarriage, according to a memo describing the legal grounds for a preliminary injunction. The court should remove “an unnecessary barrier to care so that more North Carolinians can access a full range of reproductive health services, including time-sensitive abortion care, in their own state,” Anne Logan Bass, a nurse practitioner at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, and a plaintiff, said in a news release. North Carolina abortion clinic operators have said they’ve seen a marked increase in the number of women coming from other states that now have more severe abortion limitations following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nAlmont: A UPS driver came to the rescue of two people who crashed their vehicle in a rural area of Morton County, the Bismarck Tribune reports. According to the shipping company, Ken Oakes was making deliveries Sept. 20 when he came upon a crashed car on a bridge east of Almont. Oakes, an Army veteran with medical training, helped a female passenger and a male passenger out of the vehicle and continued to help when paramedics arrived, according to the news outlet. “He was amazingly helpful,” said Frank Melchior, an emergency medical technician with the Almont Ambulance Service.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Patrol Superintendent Charles Jones announced Friday that the Ohio State Highway Patrol would permit troopers to have tattoos on their arms but they’ll have to wear long-sleeve uniforms − even in the heat of summer − to cover the ink. The patrol’s policy still prohibits tattoos above the neckline or below the wrist. Exceptions may be allowed for “a conservative wedding band/civil union tattoo, brand or body art” on the ring finger, the policy states. Police departments across the state and the nation are relaxing their grooming rules in an effort to recruit employees. Columbus, Akron and Cleveland police departments recently announced new policies. Patrol Academy Commandant Major John Altman, who declined to disclose whether he has tattoos, said the new tattoo policy means the patrol can reach out to several hundred potential recruits who expressed interest but also said they have visible tattoos. Altman noted that there are no current plans to change the patrol’s policy that prohibits facial hair.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPauls Valley: A politically connected attorney who served as Gov. Kevin Stitt’s hospital surge plan adviser during the pandemic was accused Monday in a drug trafficking charge of illegal involvement in marijuana businesses. Matt Stacy, 43, became the latest attorney to be accused of helping out-of-state clients establish marijuana grow operations by finding them “ghost” owners in Oklahoma. Stitt on Monday said he will be donating Stacy’s contribution to his reelection campaign to charity. Stacy, a lieutenant colonel in the Oklahoma Army National Guard, donated $2,900 to Stitt last year. Stacy was charged Monday in Garvin County District Court with 13 felony counts after being indicted last month by the state’s multicounty grand jury. Stacy “has acted as a consigliere to international drug trafficking organizations engaged in industrial-scale black-market marijuana manufacturing and trafficking,” a state narcotics investigator alleged in an affidavit filed with the charge. The illegal conduct included “structuring fraudulent ‘straw’ ownership schemes to circumvent Oklahoma ownership disclosure and structure requirements for medical marijuana businesses,” the agent with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control alleged. State law requires a licensed grow operation to be at least 75% owned by Oklahoma residents. “On multiple occasions, Stacy created and/or facilitated the creation of business entities through the use or recruitment of Oklahoma residents to operate as ‘straw owners’ to facially satisfy the Oklahoma residency requirements.” the agent alleged. One grower reported paying Stacy $60,000, according to the affidavit.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two people have together been awarded $10.4 million at trial after a jury found they suffered hearing loss and emotional trauma when they narrowly escaped a natural gas explosion in Portland. Lawyers for gas leak investigator Eric Rader and stylist Kristen Prentice said both suffered life-altering changes, including post-traumatic stress disorder, after an excavator hit a buried gas pipeline Oct. 19, 2016. Rader had found high levels of gas inside a corner bagel shop and warned firefighters to flee shortly before the blast obliterated the three-story commercial building and gutted a neighboring structure. “The reading on his gas meter indicated extreme risk,” said Greg Kafoury, the attorney for Rader and Prentice. “Rader notified nearby first responders, saving many.” Prentice was about to enter the salon next door when firefighters alerted her to the danger. Both took shelter nearby. Rader and Prentice are now permanently afflicted with hearing loss and painful sensitivity to loud noises, Kafoury said. Their lawsuits were tried jointly in Multnomah County Circuit Court. On Thursday, a jury awarded $6.5 million to Prentice and $3.9 million to Rader – the largest payout to date over the blast. Jurors found contractor Loy Clark Pipeline Co. liable for both of the workers’ medical expenses and lost earnings. Each award included $2.3 million in punitive damages, though about 70% of that money will be directed to a state crime victims fund under Oregon law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNewtown: Political signs in southeastern Pennsylvania have been found booby-trapped with razor blades, which resulted in sliced fingers for one resident, police said. Upper Makefield Township police said Sunday that a campaign sign for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro was placed without permission on someone’s property, and while trying to remove it the resident found that razor blades had been “placed around the perimeter of the sign.” “Obviously, this was designed to inflict punishment on anyone who attempted to remove the sign,” police said in a social media post. Police said they inspected all campaign signs and found razor blades placed around the perimeter of signs for two other Democratic candidates, John Fetterman and Ashley Ehasz. Fetterman is running for U.S. Senate and Ehasz for U.S. House. Police said their investigation continues and warned residents to exercise caution in removing signs placed on their property without permission, and to call them if “any implements” have been installed on the signs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawsuit brought by Rhode Island’s cities and towns against consulting giant McKinsey & Company over its alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis through deceptive marketing practices will be heard in federal court in Northern California. Towns across the state joined their brethren in Pennsylvania, Utah, Wisconsin and elsewhere in accusing McKinsey of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy by advising Purdue Pharma how to downplay the dangers of Oxycontin while maximizing sales of the prescription painkiller. The communities charge that McKinsey’s misconduct has perpetuated a serious public-health crisis that brought about significant economic damages, including spiking costs related to public health, opioid-related crimes, emergencies and public-safety challenges.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAnderson: Eight Starbucks employees, three of whom were fired by the company, have filed a defamation lawsuit against Starbucks and a former manager, Melissa Morris, who accused the employees of kidnapping and assault prior to the start of a shift in early August. A summons for the lawsuit was filed on Oct. 17 after the Anderson County Sheriff’s Office found that Morris’ criminal accusation was false, according to the summons. On Aug. 1, eight employees at a Starbucks in Anderson surrounded a store manager and presented a list of demands that included better pay, equipment upgrades and better staffing, according to Mya Ourada, a store barista at the time. On Aug. 3, Morris, the Starbucks store manager, in coordination with Starbucks management reported to police that the workers had assaulted and kidnapped the manager on Aug. 1, according to the summons. According to the summons, the Sheriff’s Office told a reporter, “None of the allegations were true... The employees did not stop her from leaving and did not put their hands on her, which is what the boss reported had happened.” “Starbucks knew exactly what they were doing when it smeared our reputation, painting us as criminals,” Aneil Tripathi, a former employee who was fired, said in a press release. “They abused the law enforcement process to intimidate us and keep us terrified that a knock on the door would be the Anderson police coming to take us away.” Starbucks and Morris have 30 days to answer the claims in the summons. “We are reviewing the details of this matter and look forward to defending the company against the allegations made,” a Starbucks spokesperson wrote in an email to the Independent Mail. “No Starbucks partner has been or will be disciplined for supporting or engaging in lawful union activity – but interests in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all partners.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council passed a group of ordinances and resolutions Tuesday, approving a TIF district that a local developer hopes will aid in creating an affordable housing development in eastern Sioux Falls. The $2.14 million TIF agreement passed the council 7-1 at their meeting, alongside resolutions that formally set the boundaries of the district, as well as approving the project plan for the development.Developer Kelly Nielson told councilors last month he’d been trying to work on a project like this for years, and that his staff had recently “started designing the least expensive house we could come up with.” Each of the 65 homes in the 9.7-acre development must be priced at or below $340,000, with two-bedroom, one-bathroom houses set at a price goal of $232,000 or below, and two-bedroom, two-bathroom units in a twin home with an unfinished basement set at a price goal of $323,000 or below. All of the homes would all need to be constructed by May 1, 2028, Business Development Coordinator Dustin Powers told councilors at the meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nBrentwood: A small plane crashed Tuesday on a road in a Nashville suburb, killing one person, authorities said. The pilot was the only person on board the single-engine plane that crashed in Brentwood at 7:30 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. Brentwood police confirmed one fatality but didn’t immediately indicate whether the person who died was on the plane. Police said on Twitter that the two-lane road in the community just south of Nashville was closed afterward. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A man was convicted of capital murder on Monday in the 2019 shooting death of a law enforcement officer who was the first Sikh deputy in his agency. A jury took less than 30 minutes before finding Robert Solis, 50, guilty in the killing of Harris County Sheriff’s Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal during a September 2019 traffic stop in a residential cul-de-sac 18 miles northwest of Houston. Authorities say the 42-year-old deputy was shot multiple times from behind after he stopped Solis and was walking back to his patrol car. The same jury in Houston that convicted Solis began hearing evidence late Monday afternoon in the trial’s punishment phase. Prosecutors are seeking a death sentence. Just before his trial began last week, Solis fired his court appointed attorneys and chose to represent himself. Solis testified in his own defense and told jurors he had accidentally shot Dhaliwal. Prosecutors argued Solis deliberately shot Dhaliwal because he didn’t want to go back to jail. At the time of the traffic stop, Solis had a warrant for violating parole. Dhaliwal was described by Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez as “a trailblazer” because he was the first Sikh deputy with the sheriff’s office when he joined the force around 2009. Gonzalez’s predecessor as sheriff, Adrian Garcia, implemented a religious accommodation policy that allowed Dhaliwal to wear the traditional turban and beard of the Sikh religion.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah worked to distinguish himself from former President Donald Trump in a contentious debate Monday evening. “I stood against my party time and time again to oppose reckless spending. I will do it again and again and again. We need people who say no,” the second-term Republican said. Lee repeatedly pointed to his voting record and twice told the audience at Utah Valley University that he voted less in line with Trump than all but two Republican senators – Rand Paul and Susan Collins. “To suggest that I’m beholden to either party, that I’ve been a bootlicker for either party is folly. And it’s contradicted by the plain facts,” Lee said. Lee faces a challenge from Evan McMullin, a former Republican known most for his long-shot bid for president six years ago, when as an independent he won 21.5% of voters in Utah, including Lee. McMullin has remained a pillar of the anti-Trump movement, attacking the former president as an authoritarian who poses a threat to democracy. Lee’s last minute efforts to put space between his voting record and Trump’s stances depart from his past messaging as Election Day nears.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: A plan is being developed to turn part of the Winston Prouty Center for Child Family Development campus into as many as 300 housing units, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. “We’re pushing forward with it,” said Chloe Learey, executive director at the center. “Master planning is really that process of going through what are all the things we would want and what fits and what’s on the landscape and where are the wetlands and how much is it going to cost?” They hope to complete the plan in April, according to the news outlet. The design is intended “to build a neighborhood essentially,” Learey said. The planning process is estimated to cost $200,000. Grants and donations are being sought to assist with the project, the news outlet reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nWoodbridge: A couple, their 19-year-old daughter and a 36-year-old man were found dead in their home after a fellow resident, who is now charged with murder, called 911 to report a shooting, police said Tuesday. Prince William County Police officers responded to a Woodbridge home on Monday afternoon after a 911 caller reported that someone shot into the residence and people might be dead inside, Police Chief Peter Newsham said at a news conference near the home. When officers arrived, they found the door open and two men and two women dead in different parts of the home. “This is horrific,” Newsham said. “Every adjective that you can use to describe a tragedy, you can use to describe what happened here last night.” The evidence found on the scene didn’t match the details from the 911 caller, who turned out to be the suspect in the case, Newsham said. The caller – David Maine, 24, of Woodbridge – was found nearby. On Tuesday morning, Maine was charged with four counts of second-degree murder, Newsham said. Maine is being held without bond. The police chief identified the dead as Miguel Duran Flores, 44; Kelly Victoria Sotelo, 42; their daughter Karrie Ayline Sotelo, 19; and Richard Julio Jesus Revollar Corrales, 36, who lived in the basement of the home. Maine had a relationship with another resident, who was not at the home, Newsham said. That person has cooperated with police, providing valuable information, and is also upset about what happened at his home, he said.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: Bremerton Municipal Court has shut down some public access to the court through the end of the month and cases may be continued, citing employee turnover and the COVID-19 pandemic for the court's inability to keep regular hours. The restrictions for Bremerton’s court make it the only court of limited jurisdiction in Kitsap County to institute new public access restrictions. The city courthouse was closed to the public starting on Monday, with all court hearings being held on Zoom. Court hearings will be limited, and cases will be continued as courtroom staffing allows, according to the emergency administrative order. The new restrictions could be updated or amended. Judge Tracy Flood, who took office in January, issued the emergency administrative order Sunday, citing “constantly changing issues” starting with the onset of pandemic restrictions and accommodations in March 2020.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Appalachian Regional Commission is granting $47 million to 52 projects aimed at economic diversification in communities affected by job losses in the coal industry. The funding, which comes from the commission’s POWER Initiative, will reach 181 counties. The funding is the largest to date since the initiative was launched in 2015, the commission said Monday in a statement. It is aimed at creating jobs, expanding skills training and attracting private investments to support industries such as agriculture, food and tourism. “Our coal-impacted communities are a vital part of Appalachia’s 13 states and 423 counties – when our coal communities thrive, our entire region is uplifted,” said ARC Federal Co-Chair Gayle Manchin. The POWER Initiative is funded by Congress and has invested $367 million in 447 projects throughout Appalachia, according to the commission. Hundreds of coal-fired power plants have shuttered over the last decade.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMaple Grove: Sheriff’s investigators are willing to forgo any possible underage drinking violations in order to get more information about a bonfire explosion that injured more than a dozen people, including some critically, officials said Tuesday. The Shawano County Sheriff’s Office says as many as 40 current and former Pulaski High School students were at the bonfire Friday night in the Town of Maple Grove, which is about 25 miles south of Green Bay. The sheriff’s office believes the explosion was triggered when someone pushed a 55-gallon drum containing diesel fuel into the fire. Investigators say 17 people injured were privately transported to hospitals after the explosion. Seven of those were transferred to Ascension Columbia St. Mary’s Hospital in Milwaukee to have their burns treated, WLUK-TV reported. Authorities say a number of the injured remain hospitalized, some in critical condition. “We understand there may be some apprehension for some to meet with us based on the evidence of underage drinking, and although underage drinking is something law enforcement agencies take seriously, we can assure those who were there, that our detectives do not have intentions on issuing citations for this, as our main focus and concern is gathering the facts of this tragic event,” the sheriff’s office said. A number of people have come forward with information, investigators said, but there are other witnesses to the explosion who have not.\n\nWyoming\n\nShoshone National Forest: A grizzly bear attacked and injured two men who apparently surprised the bruin while they were recreating in northwestern Wyoming, state wildlife officials said Monday. The encounter happened Saturday while the men were off a trail and searching for antlers shed by deer and elk in the forest southeast of Yellowstone National Park, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department said. The antlers can be sold for taxidermy and craft purposes and for dog chews. The men were able to call 911 from near the scene and other recreationists in the area were able to get them to the trailhead, where they met search and rescue teams. One man was flown to the hospital by helicopter while the other was taken by ambulance. Their conditions were not known on Monday, wildlife officials said. Game and Fish personnel were still investigating the attack. Reports from hunters and landowners in the area where the attack occurred indicate there may be six to 10 bears moving between agricultural fields and low elevation slopes, Dan Smith, a regional wildlife supervisor, said in a statement. The agency will continue to monitor bear activity in the area and work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make management decisions in the best interest of public safety, Smith said. Grizzly bears are protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2019/01/14/governor-doug-ducey-state-of-the-state-address/2554223002/", "title": "Full text: Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey's 2019 State of the State speech", "text": "Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday delivered the first State of the State address of his second term.\n\nDucey praised Arizona's strong economy and job market, but said the state needs to save for the next economic downturn.\n\nThe GOP governor is set to release his budget this week, but said it won't include much new spending. He spoke of the state's need to bolster its rainy-day fund.\n\nThese are his full remarks as prepared for delivery:\n\nChief Justice Bales, Members of the Legislature, Judiciary and fellow Arizonans — I am so honored to be back here today, and just like you, I am ready to get to work.\n\n2018 brought a lot our way. Election years tend to do that for people in our business. Elections also bring change and new faces, as we see here today — and in government, that’s a really good thing. Let’s work together in the months ahead to transform our promises into progress for the state we all love.\n\nTo all who were sworn in for the first time today, and to the other public servants who took the oath with me last week, congratulations and welcome. It wasn’t so long ago that I was new here, too. I ran because I cared, believed I could make a difference, and felt we needed some fresh ideas. No doubt, you’re all here for many of the same reasons.\n\nYou’ve also lucked out, because you’ve got some real pros here to show you the ropes. Speaker Bowers and President Fann — you’re well suited and well prepared for these new roles. Leaders Fernandez and Bradley — I’m looking forward to working together. I think we can all agree, there’s plenty of opportunities to find common ground.\n\nBipartisanship is a word that gets tossed around a lot. And today, it seems everyone has their own definition. So let me be clear on the approach I intend to take. I’m not here just to work with Republicans on Republican ideas. And bipartisanship doesn’t simply mean working with Democrats on Democratic ideas. I’m here as governor of all the people to work with all of you on good ideas.\n\nAnd now’s the time to do so. Because the state of our state is strong, and it’s getting stronger. The challenge before us is to lay the groundwork today to make sure the Arizona of tomorrow remains strong. Doing so requires action now to do the things that matter and secure Arizona’s future.\n\nThe issues we need to tackle aren’t partisan ones. In some cases, they aren’t even political. At the top of that list: securing our water future.\n\nNow stay with me — this is not an issue that leads the news. It doesn’t make for a snappy headline, or a provocative soundbite, and it can’t be explained in 280 characters. But as I traveled the state this past year, it’s one of the issues I was asked about most by real people — especially in rural Arizona.\n\nIt’s an issue that deserves your focus and attention. Which is why it’s first on my list.\n\nHere’s the bottom line: We’re in a 19-year drought. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. Arizona and our neighboring states draw more water from the Colorado River than Mother Nature puts back.\n\nIt’s time to protect Lake Mead and Arizona.\n\nDoing so will require compromise. No one stakeholder is going to get everything they want. Everyone is going to have to give. And I’ve been impressed by the willingness of those involved to do just that.\n\nIt’s been said: Whiskey’s for drinking; water’s for fighting.\n\nWe have two leaders here today who’ve got the scars to prove it. They are giants, who deserve the credit for getting Arizona to this point — not to mention our gratitude for their lifetime of public service: Governor Bruce Babbitt and Senator Jon Kyl. Bruce Babbitt served in public office for 20 years, first as Arizona Attorney General and Governor and later as Secretary of the Interior under President Bill Clinton. Jon Kyl served Arizona in Congress for 26 years, including three terms as a U.S. Senator. Then, when Arizona needed him most, he returned to the Senate last September.\n\nGovernor Babbitt and Senator Kyl have shown us the path. Working with others. Setting aside differences. Putting our state, and the greater good first. Now it’s our turn to do the heavy lifting.\n\nThis issue is important and it’s urgent. Our economy. Our environment. Our future.\n\nLet’s prove we can work together in a bipartisan fashion and get this done.\n\nSame goes for a lot of other things, frankly.\n\nWe’ve implemented a hiring freeze and held the line on out of control growth in government. Today, our state government operates more efficiently.\n\nWe’ve gotten government out of the way of job creation, cutting red tape and placing a moratorium on new regulations. In fact, we’ve eliminated over 1,000 regulations.\n\nImagine if we took that same approach this legislative session regarding laws. We’re not short on laws here in our state. Over 107 years we’ve built up a hearty 11,000 plus pages.\n\nCertainly, many of our laws have merit. But many don’t. So why does each legislative session seem to be a competition to pass the most new laws?\n\nWhat if we found a way to get rid of old unneeded laws, rather than just creating new ones? If for every law we passed, we repealed three or if new laws had sunsets. I’m challenging this legislature let’s chop the stacks and stacks of statutes down, so that the laws make sense and are relevant to the Arizona of today.\n\nAnd how about we start with eliminating the most unnecessary law of them all: legislative immunity. We are a nation of laws, not men. No one — not me, nor you — is above the law. Now, Congress likes to exempt themselves from the law — but isn’t that why Americans hold them in such contempt? Let’s show the people of Arizona that their elected leaders will live under the same laws as every man and woman in this state. Send T.J. Shope’s referral to the ballot and let the people speak on special privileges for elected officials.\n\nAnd when there are emerging issues that need to be addressed, let’s not ignore them — let’s solve them.\n\nOne year ago, most of us didn’t know Parkland, Florida, even existed. But now, tragically, it’s another on the list. Ingrained in our memories and American vernacular. Columbine. Virginia Tech. Sandy Hook.\n\nSo last spring, I convened Arizonans in my office. Parents. Teachers. Principals. Law enforcement. Prosecutors. Mental health experts. Democrats and Republicans. People who weren’t Democrats or Republicans. Students themselves. With a goal of being proactive, and taking action to stop a tragedy from happening here. We researched the five deadliest school shootings of the last 20 years, and asked: How could these have been prevented?\n\nWe built a plan that could make a real difference: The Safe Arizona Schools Plan. More cops on campus. More school counselors. Improved background checks. A STOP order that protects Second Amendment rights while keeping guns out of the hands of individuals who are a lethal threat.\n\nThese are solutions that will make schools safer, and it’s time for us to get it done. I’ll be including some elements of this plan in my budget that you’ll see Friday — with an even greater investment than I proposed last year.\n\nWe know when a police officer is around, it makes things safer. Who do we call whenever there’s trouble? Our brave men and women in blue. And that’s why we’re including enough dollars to put a cop on every campus that needs one. And I’ll be working with legislative leaders to pass the rest.\n\nThis plan is a reasoned and balanced approach. Which is why thought leaders like David French at the National Review and Hugh Hewitt have endorsed it; why the Arizona PTA supports it; and why we modeled elements of it from Gabby Giffords’ plan.\n\nThis is simply too important an issue to let partisan politics and special interests get in the way. We’ve got a responsibility to do something for our kids — and we’ve got to do it this session.\n\nWhether it’s water or school safety — these are things that matter. We know that.\n\nWe’ve been here before. We did it on Prop 123 — who thought that lawsuit would ever get settled? We did it with the 20-year extension of 301 — nobody believed that would happen. University bonding -- the obituaries were written on it, but we got it done. Opioids — a unanimous vote of the entire Legislature.\n\nAnd it was just 8 months ago we delivered a 20 percent pay raise for hardworking teachers.\n\nWhen we unveiled that proposal, many said it was not possible. And there’s no doubt, forces were standing in the way. But because of teachers — lots of them — and principals, and superintendents, PTAs, parents, education champions and business leaders — with the leadership of J.D. Mesnard, and former President Yarbrough. With bipartisan support from leaders like David Bradley, Sean Bowie, Andrea Dalessandro and Steve Farley, we got that pay raise passed and into teachers’ paychecks.\n\nHalf of this commitment was added last fall, with some school leaders going even further. Payson. Yuma. Marana. The Washington Elementary School District, right up the street. Many others.\n\nAnd to anyone out there considering using these resources somewhere else, I have one message - don’t even think about it. These are raises teachers earned and they are raises we are going to fulfill and protect.\n\nAnd more is needed on K-12 education. A focus on results, resources and reforms.\n\nArizona has been the leader in school choice. It’s good for parents, and most of all, it’s good for kids.\n\nHealthy choice and competition brings about innovation, and that’s been the case in Arizona public education. But we also know improvements can be made. More transparency, more accountability, and granting more financial review and oversight over taxpayer dollars — all with the purpose of making sure every public school is improving and providing Arizona kids with the best-possible education.\n\nSame goes for addressing the teacher shortage. In my past life, I used to tell my team at Cold Stone Creamery — if you find a good idea, grab it. So as we built Cold Stone, we borrowed ideas from others: McDonald’s. Subway. Starbucks. And I confess — I’ve kept the habit going.\n\nFour years ago, I heard what sounded like a really good idea to address the teacher shortage. If someone graduates from an Arizona university, is willing to stay in Arizona, and teach in a public school, why not allow them to graduate debt-free by providing a scholarship?\n\nSo we turned it into reality and launched the Arizona Teachers Academy. Already, 221 students have started moving through the program. This year we plan to significantly expand it: more dollars, more support. We are going to create a pipeline of talent and the next generation of Arizona teachers.\n\nAnd today, as a guest of Angela and I, we have the person who came up with the idea. He’s had an incredible career of public service, he’s continuing that service as newest member of the Arizona Board of Regents, and his wife, Jennifer, is with him today. Arizona thanks you, Fred Duval.\n\nEducation and our economy go hand in hand.\n\nMany of us remember a class back when we were in high school called shop. It's where a lot of good people discovered a passion, they turned into a purpose, and then a pretty good paycheck.\n\nOur education leaders are creating the \"shop\" classes of the 21st century-- it’s called Career and Technical Education — CTE. Today, students in these programs are training to becoming nurses, pilots, pharmacists, bankers, firefighters and software developers — all before graduation.\n\nIn fact, 99 percent of CTE students graduate high school —99 percent — a rate much higher than the national average. They perform better in mathematics and reading — and their technical skills rival professionals in the same trade.\n\nJust take a look at some of these programs: Aviation at Pima Community College. Advanced manufacturing at Maricopa Community Colleges. Diesel mechanics at the Western Maricopa Education Center. And culinary arts at the East Valley Institute of Technology.\n\nToday, we have more jobs available in the state of Arizona than we have people to fill them. Whatever and wherever the skilled trade is needed, Arizona is prepared to meet the demand.\n\nI want to recognize education leaders who are paving the way: Lee Lambert, Maria Harper-Marinick, Greg Donovan, Doug Pruitt, and Sally Downey. Thank you for your leadership.\n\nThese are programs we plan to build, expand and align with the jobs of tomorrow. And my budget will do just that.\n\nIf people want to work, let’s let them work! 100,000 people will move here this year. There’s a job available for every one of them. Lots of them are trained and certified in other states. Standing in their way of earning a living in Arizona, our own licensing boards, and their cronies who tell them — “You can’t work here. You haven’t paid the piper.”\n\nLet’s stop this foolishness. Pass Warren Petersen’s bill to grant universal recognition for all occupational licenses — and let them work.\n\nAnd before those unelected boards feign outrage – let’s remember: workers don't lose their skills simply because they move to Arizona. And, in the name of good government, let’s have the bullies on these boards answer three questions: what do you exist to do, how do you know if you’re doing it well, and who would miss you if you were gone?\n\nThere’s dignity in all work.\n\nLast fall, I visited our state prison in Buckeye, Arizona. There, joined by Arizona Cardinals defensive back Antoine Bethea and D lineman Corey Peters along with Cardinals President Michael Bidwill, we saw the possibilities of Opportunity for All first hand.\n\nAt a job fair, soon-to-be-released men and women were excited to participate in a program that equips them with the skills to successfully re-enter society. They lined up at employers like Jacksons Car Wash and Hickman’s Family Farms — some left with multiple job offers. This is a program we need to secure well into the 21st century to protect public safety and reduce Arizona’s prison population.\n\nArizona’s economy is booming. There’s no doubt about it. We’ve added nearly 300,000 new jobs in the last four years.\n\nAnd I’m proud to say, our relationship with Mexico is stronger than ever. With an updated North American trade deal, known as the USMCA, this will mean even more trade coming through our ports and more jobs for Arizonans.\n\nI’ve become fond of saying that the last time unemployment was this low, you were renting your movies at Blockbuster. But the benchmark is moving. By the end of this year, unemployment is forecasted to plummet to levels we haven’t seen since before you knew what a hashtag was.\n\nSome said the teacher pay raise was unsustainable and based on rosy projections. Turns out those projections weren’t rosy — they were in response to a growing economy that has led to a record balance in our general fund.\n\nWhen I stood here four years ago, we faced a $1 billion deficit. It’s not by accident that today, we’ve got a $1 billion surplus. Arizona weathered the storm. Made tough decisions. Held the line on raising taxes and will continue to hold the line on raising taxes.\n\nIt’s the Arizona way, it’s a winning game plan, and I have no intention of changing course.\n\nGovernment didn’t rebuild Arizona. People rebuilt their businesses. They hired and invested. Workers and families rolled up their sleeves. So for their sake, let’s make sure we’re on strong footing today and into the future.\n\nWith revenue soaring, some have suggested loosen up, let the good times roll. Ladies and gentleman: We’ve seen that movie before, and we know how it ends. It wasn’t that long ago that this state racked up a massive tab, went on a spending binge, with no long-term plan of how to pay for any of it. And when the economy tanked — every one of those false promises evaporated. It was painful, for real people. Let’s learn from the mistakes of the past.\n\nTo the big spenders: On November 6th, the people spoke. They want their teachers paid and their budgets balanced. So, the balanced budget I will present to you on Friday fully funds the priorities we know are important — public safety, child safety, education — above and beyond inflation. There are some targeted investments in critical areas. But frankly, for a surplus year, this budget is pretty light reading.\n\nBecause I’m proposing that we secure Arizona’s future and prepare responsibly for the unexpected and the inevitable -- by bringing our Rainy Day Fund, to record-breaking balance of one billion dollars. If ever there were a way to protect public education, to protect the pay raises our teachers have earned and deserve, to prevent budget gimmicks, band-aids and massive cuts down the line; to avoid tax increases and budget standoffs and government shutdowns — it’s through this thoughtful, prudent and fiscally-conservative approach.\n\nFour years ago, as a new governor, I inherited 35,000 hardworking state employees, 40 billion in combined spending, over 200 boards and commissions and 43 plus state agencies. We got to work restructuring a government that should operate at the speed of business.\n\nWe’ve made a lot of progress. We’ve got less bureaucracy, more efficiencies. And still, more can be done. Remember when Andy Tobin worked his way out of a job? Well, buckle your seatbelts because there’s going to be a lot more of that as we look to save taxpayer dollars and streamline state government. And our dedicated state employees will continue to play a critical role in shaping our direction. We’ll rely on their expertise, and know-how as we apply technology and customer service techniques to further consolidate our government.\n\nThis is another non-partisan issue. It’s not Republican versus Democrat. In our nation’s capitol, both parties are equally guilty for bloated government, spending sprees and unmanageable debt. If anything it’s an Arizona versus Washington, D.C. issue. The federal government is broke, broken and broken-down, and has been for decades. Washington could learn a lot from us.\n\nWhen the federal government failed to secure our border, we created the Border Strike Force, combating crime without interrupting trade.\n\nWe know the value of time, so we reduced wait-times at the MVD. Our Department of Child Safety has become a national model and the envy of other states.\n\nAnd yes, when congress failed to do their job, we kept the gates of the Grand Canyon open.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time these last four years, making a lot of new friends. I’ve been to every county. In dozens of schools. In our state agencies. Businesses -- large and small. It’s been fun and pretty darn delicious. The chocolate chip cookies at Beyond Bread in Tucson. The Especial at Lute’s Casino in Yuma. And you’ve got to try the pies at The Mogollon Moose out in Payson. Let’s just say you don’t have to guess my new year’s resolution.\n\nWe’ve got great people in this state. Some have been here for generations -- others just got here yesterday. And then there are those we said goodbye to last year for the final time. Their memory, and their legacies will live on:\n\nCongressman Ed Pastor\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Carolyn Warner\n\nTreasurer Carol Springer\n\nChief Justice Bud Jones\n\nSenator John McCain\n\nOthers had names we were not familiar with — their lives cut short in the line of duty. Their service will be honored and remembered all the same:\n\nStaff Sergeant Maximo Flores\n\nChief Warrant Officer Taylor Galvin\n\nStaff Sergeant Alexander Conrad\n\nFirst Sergeant Nicholas Amsberry\n\nArmy Specialist Robert Jones\n\nU.S. Deputy Marshal Chase White\n\nNogales Police Officer Jesus Cordova\n\nSalt River Police Officer Clayton Townsend\n\nTrooper Tyler Edenhofer\n\nTheir ultimate sacrifice reminds us of the sacrifices made every day by our heroes in uniform — law enforcement, first responders, correctional officers, our National Guard, and military personnel. We salute you. We are proud of you. And we thank you. We know that to truly secure Arizona’s future, we can’t do it without you. And we pledge to continue to support and invest in you and your families.\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Legislature -- we’ve got our work cut out for us. But with the leadership here, and the passion and purpose that you and I bring to the issues that face us, I have high hopes and great enthusiasm that this will be our most productive session yet.\n\nLet’s put party labels aside. Let’s put Arizona first. Let’s do the things that matter. Let’s get to work. Thank you and God bless.\n\nREAD MORE:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/21/mow-may-haunted-house-shooting-monk-seal-birth-news-around-states/50119967/", "title": "No Mow May, haunted house shooting: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Civil rights pioneer Jo Ann Robinson, who played an instrumental role in the historic 13-month Montgomery Bus Boycott in the mid-1950s, had a residence hall named after her on Alabama State University’s campus Tuesday. The hall was previously named for Bibb Graves, former Alabama governor and member of the Ku Klux Klan. The Board of Trustees voted to change the name in September. Dr. Sheree Finley, a relative of Robinson, called the renaming exciting. “She’s finally being brought to the forefront,” Finley said. Local artist Kevin King painted a portrait of Robinson during the event. The featured speaker of the event was Fred Gray, famed civil rights attorney, who recalled planning the bus boycott in Robinson’s living room. “Little did many know that (many of the) activities that (had an) impact on the civil rights movement in Alabama occurred at Jo Ann Robinson’s house,” Gray said. “She was the person who was interested in having mass participation. We could have desegregated the buses without a protest, but she was interested in getting something done with the community.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A legal challenge has been filed claiming proposed state Senate districts for the capital city area unconstitutionally favor the Eagle River suburb. The motion to reject the amended redistricting plan and to modify it was filed Monday as Anchorage Superior Court Judge Thomas Matthews considers the legality of the map approved last week by the state’s redistricting board, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The new map was drawn after portions of the board’s first proposal were ruled unconstitutional by the Alaska Supreme Court. Each state Senate district is composed of two House districts. The board’s first proposal sought to link Eagle River to the south Muldoon area of Anchorage, which the Alaska Supreme Court called an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.” The court ruled in a lawsuit brought by east Anchorage residents Felisa Wilson, George Martinez and Yarrow Silvers, who also filed Monday’s challenge. The new proposal seeks to link south Eagle River to south Anchorage and north Eagle River to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The new challenge claims the redistricting board incorrectly interpreted the court’s instructions by keeping Muldoon districts together but again splitting the Eagle River districts. The filing seeks an order requiring the board to keep both House districts in Eagle River together.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: A wildfire nearly tripled in size as relentless winds pushed the flames through neighborhoods on the outskirts of a college and tourist town, keeping hundreds of residents away from their homes and destroying more than two dozen structures. The blaze continued its run Wednesday through dry grass and scattered Ponderosa pines around homes into volcanic cinder fields, where roots underground can combust and send small rocks flying into the air, fire officials said. Persistent spring winds and 50 mph gusts hindered firefighters. “This is a heads-up for everywhere else in the state,” said fire information officer Dick Fleishman. “If you have dry grass up next to your house, it’s time to get that cleaned up.” Fire managers are contending with tight resources as wildfires burn around the Southwest. The U.S. has 16 top-level national fire management teams, and four of those are dedicated to blazes in Arizona and New Mexico – something Fleishman said is rare this early in the wildfire season. Hundreds of people have been evacuated because of the wildfires north of Flagstaff and south of Prescott in Arizona. On the outskirts of Flagstaff – where tourists and locals revel in hiking and horseback riding trails, camping spots, and the vast expanse of cinder fields for off-road vehicle use – flames soared as high as 100 feet. Popular national monuments including Sunset Crater Volcano and Wupatki were closed because of the wildfire.\n\nArkansas\n\nJasper: The Cherokee Nation has signed an agreement with the National Park Service to allow citizens to gather plants within the Buffalo National River to use for purposes including food, crafts and medicine. The river, located in the Ozark Mountains, was established as the country’s first national river in 1972. “This area has a vibrant history of helping sustain our Cherokee people with food, the cane and bushes for our Cherokee crafts, and leaves and roots for traditional medicine,” Deputy Chief Bryan Warner said. The agreement, announced Wednesday, will establish a process for Cherokee citizens to gather plants in parts of the national park including the Lost Valley, Tyler Bend, Buffalo Point and Rush areas. “This i7/ 8 s an important step in the continuing efforts to embrace our tribal partners in the management of public lands at Buffalo National River,” said Mark Foust, National Park Service superintendent at Buffalo National River. “The Cherokee Nation offers invaluable information, ecological knowledge, and a unique perspective that will lead to a better understanding of the benefits of public land.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: City supervisors have approved legislation prohibiting police from storing DNA obtained from rape kits and other crime scene evidence in city-run databases for more than 60 days. Tuesday’s unanimous vote came two months after San Francisco’s district attorney disclosed that police used a sexual assault victim’s DNA against her in 2016 in an unrelated 2021 property crime case. The revelation by DA Chesa Boudin prompted a national outcry among law enforcement, legal experts, lawmakers and advocates of sexual assault victims. Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who introduced the legislation, said there were no local laws regulating the storage or use of DNA profiles in local police databases, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Victim samples cannot be uploaded to state and federal DNA databases, which are more tightly regulated, and the legislation does not apply to those databases. “The fact that the police department’s crime lab has been storing and using victims’ physical evidence against victims came as a shock to most of us in the city,” Ronen said. The department stores DNA information in what it calls a quality control database in order to ensure samples are not contaminated. The department has said it stopped the practice. Police chief Bill Scott told police commissioners in March that he’d discovered 17 crime victim profiles, 11 of them from rape kits, that were matched using a crime victims database during unrelated investigations.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A “game changing” app will soon be in the hands of local first responders, and officials say it will improve their interactions with those in the community who have mental health issues or intellectual or developmental disabilities. Fort Collins Police Services announced Thursday that its officers will begin using the Vitals app in a first-of-its-kind partnership with UCHealth through the co-responder program and Mental Health Response Team. People and caregivers can download the Vitals app and create a profile that includes an individual’s name, photo, other identifying information and medical information along with their behavioral triggers and de-escalation techniques, which can help officers respond better in a crisis situation, UCHealth Co-Responder Supervisor Stephanie Booco said during a news conference. Fort Collins police officers and UCHealth co-responders who have the app will receive notifications when they are near someone with a profile and can use the information in the profile to better assist or resolve a situation. The technology is a “game changer” for the community, Fort Collins Police Services Chief Jeff Swoboda said. Fort Collins is the first community in Colorado to start using the Vitals app and the first community in the country to use it with a co-responder program, Booco said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers advanced legislation Tuesday evening that abortion rights advocates say is needed to protect in-state medical providers from legal action, as well as patients who travel to Connecticut to terminate a pregnancy and those who help them. It comes amid new abortion restrictions being enacted in a growing number of conservative states. The bill cleared the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 87-60. It now awaits action in the Senate. Although Connecticut codified the right to abortion in 1990, proponents said steps need to be taken now to prepare for the U.S. Supreme Court possibly overturning or weakening Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. However, the socially conservative Family Institute of Connecticut has criticized the legislation, arguing it will create a “safe harbor” for “abortion providers who violate abortion laws in other states.” The bill is considered by some advocates to be one of the most consequential abortion-related proposals to come up for a vote in the Connecticut General Assembly since 1990. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he will sign the legislation in the law if clears the full Democratic-controlled General Assembly.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Sen. Darius Brown has regained his high-profile General Assembly committee assignments, following his acquittal of misdemeanor charges earlier this year. A jury in January found the Wilmington Democrat not guilty of misdemeanor offensive touching and disorderly conduct. A woman accused Brown at the time of hitting her in the head and throwing a drink glass that shattered near her while dining at a Talleyville restaurant in May 2021. Following his arrest, Brown was removed from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chaired. In November, months after his arrest, Brown reportedly got into a verbal altercation with Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, D-New Castle, during a bill-signing press event. That led to Senate leadership stripping Brown of his role on the Bond Committee, a high-profile position that helps write the annual infrastructure spending bill. Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola said in a statement Tuesday he has reinstated Brown to these positions due to his “acquittal in court and my belief that the terms of these sanctions have been appropriate.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden plans to attend the White House Correspondents’ Association’s annual dinner – the first time a sitting president will be at the event since Barack Obama in 2016. The organization said in a tweet that it was pleased to host Biden and first lady Jill Biden at the dinner April 30 that will honor the First Amendment. Donald Trump opted to skip the event when he was president, and it was canceled in 2020 and last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” is serving as the event’s entertainer. In 2018, Michelle Wolf’s biting, after-dinner comedy routine grabbed headlines, even in Trump’s absence. After the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington earlier this month, some of those who attended, including Cabinet members, other administration officials and members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 amid a surge of cases around the nation’s capital. Capacity for the upcoming dinner is more than 2,600, and the event is fully booked. Ashish Jha, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, suggested last weekend that the correspondents’ dinner should move forward. He told “Fox News Sunday” that “we are at the point in this pandemic” where “I think we can gather safely.” The association is requiring full vaccination and negative same-day coronavirus tests.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: As critics decried a congressional redistricting map submitted by Republican Ron DeSantis as racially motivated and drawn to benefit the GOP, the staff member who crafted the maps told lawmakers Tuesday that he didn’t take race or party politics into consideration in preparing it. Lawmakers were called back to the Capitol for a special session to approve new congressional districts after DeSantis vetoed the maps they approved last month. The GOP House and Senate leadership opted not to try drawing maps again but rather to take up one submitted by DeSantis. His plan would likely add more Republican seats than the maps the Legislature approved and could mean the four districts where Black voters have the best chance of selecting a candidate would be reduced to two. Five of the current 27 U.S. House members from Florida are Black – one a Republican from an overwhelmingly white district. J. Alex Kelly, DeSantis’ deputy chief of staff, said the map is “race neutral.” Democrats reject that argument. Several Black lawmakers have called DeSantis racist for submitting the map. Rep. Angie Nixon said other lawmakers chastised her for previously using that language, but at a rally before session began, she repeated her opinion and said she won’t be silenced. “That’s what he is,” Nixon said in an interview afterward. “It’s all racially and politically driven. And this is the type of systemic racism that they don’t want us to talk about. It’s because it makes them uncomfortable because it shows people who they truly are.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is appealing a federal judge’s ruling allowing a challenge to her eligibility to run for reelection to proceed. A group of voters last month filed the challenge with the secretary of state’s office alleging that Greene helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election victory. They say that violates a part of the 14th Amendment and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Greene said the law the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is unconstitutional, and she filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to prohibit state officials from enforcing it. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg on Monday ruled that the challenge can proceed. Greene filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. The provision of the 14th Amendment cited in the challenge says no one can serve in Congress “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.” Ratified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress. Greene has denied aiding or engaging in an insurrection. The challenge, filed on behalf of the voters by a group called Free Speech for People, is set for a hearing before an administrative law judge Friday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Images of a Hawaiian monk seal being born on an Oahu beach have been captured on camera. An employee of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources shot video and photos of the pup emerging from the mother onto white sands last week. “As soon as its (amniotic) sac burst, the little one starting wiggling around,” Lesley Macpherson, who works for the department’s Division of State Parks, said in a news release Tuesday. The mother monk seal checked on her pup by barking as the newborn flapped its flippers. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species. There are only about 1,400 seals in the world. About three-quarters of this total live in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a remote string of small atolls northwest of Hawaii’s populated islands. The rest, about 300 seals, live in the Main Hawaiian Islands including Oahu and Maui. The pup, named PO5, was one of two baby seals born on Oahu last week. Officials and volunteers will actively monitor the moms and their pups until weaning in about five to six weeks. After weaning, officials will aim to tag the pups and may apply temporary satellite transmitters to the seals to help keep track of them. Three other pups born on Oahu this year died from complications related to birth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court has allowed lawmakers to intervene in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law they passed earlier this year that would ban abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. The court on Monday approved a request by Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke, Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder and the Legislature to take part in the case. The law is modeled after a Texas law that is enforced through civil lawsuits to avoid constitutional court challenges. The Idaho law had been scheduled to take effect Friday but was temporarily blocked by the court following a lawsuit by a regional Planned Parenthood organization. Lawmakers said Planned Parenthood’s arguments challenging the constitutionality of the abortion law “directly implicate the Legislature’s authority.” The law allows the father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles of a “preborn child” to each sue an abortion provider for a minimum of $20,000 in damages within four years after the abortion. Rapists can’t file a lawsuit under the law, but a rapist’s relatives could. The bill passed the House and Senate with veto-proof majorities. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law but said he feared it would “in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed into law a state budget that aims to soften the blow of inflation with $1.8 billion in tax breaks and direct payments to Illinois consumers – an outline Republicans derided as an election-year ploy. The $46 billion budget plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1 also makes substantial investments in debt and savings backed by tax revenues virtually no one predicted a year ago amid a worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker, who faces reelection this fall, said in a news release from Chicago that the fiscal outline “brings real improvements to the lives of working families and sets us up for a stronger fiscal future.” He said the funding for schools, updated highways and transportation systems, and paying down obligations in the state pension programs “are the kind of priorities we can invest in when our state is governed responsibly.” Pritzker rolled out his plan in February, when national inflation was at about 7% – the highest in 45 years. The package includes tactical strikes at rising prices: suspending the 1% grocery sales tax, freezing the motor fuel tax increase and offering a one-time $350 property tax refund, totaling $970 million in money consumers could keep or get back.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: There won’t be a balloon release at this year’s Indianapolis 500 in May. For the past two years, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway held off on the pre-race balloon release largely due to COVID-19 protocols limiting the amount of staff on site. But this year, according to vice president of communications Alex Damron, the decision has taken into account the environmental and wildlife impacts – issues critics have raised for years. Speedway officials said they want the pre-race events to bring about unity as a way to honor military heroes, celebrate sporting excellence and build excitement. “We do recognize the release has become more divisive in recent years,” Damron said. “We’ve received significant feedback from groups and individuals opposed to it as well as an increasing number of our fans.” The balloon release has been a yearly staple at the event for more than 70 years. Environmentalists have been calling for the release – one of the few regular large balloon releases that have still been happening across the country – to end for years. Though the balloons are released in Indianapolis, they can travel quite far. In 2018, one woman even found what she believed to be an Indy 500 balloon in Ohio, 100 miles away. When the balloons land, they make their way into the ecosystem and the food chain.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two years after fourth grade teachers at Andrew Jackson Elementary asked their students to consider whether the school should change its name, five members of the school’s student leadership team presented their arguments for renaming the school to the Des Moines School Board on Tuesday. The renaming project was waylaid when schools closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, teachers began discussing moving forward with the name change. Bettina Bradley, a reading and math interventionist, advocated letting students lead the project. At this week’s Des Moines School Board meeting, the students highlighted Jackson’s ownership of enslaved people and his signing of the Indian Removal Act, the 1830 law that authorized the president to negotiate the removal of Native Americans from their homelands to federal land – a move that led to thousands of deaths on the Trail of Tears. “The name Jackson is important to our school and community, as we are the stars,” student Keren Moran said, referring to the school’s mascot. “So we’re asking the board to rename Andrew Jackson to Mary Jackson Elementary.” Mary Jackson was NASA’s first Black female engineer. Her story was made famous in the 2016 book and film “Hidden Figures.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of two former Sedgwick County sheriff’s employees accused of stealing cash, drugs and weapons from the department’s evidence unit has been sentenced to a suspended jail term and one year of probation. Marc Gordon, 47, was sentenced after pleading guilty earlier this month to one count of official misconduct and three counts of theft, all misdemeanors, the Wichita Eagle reported. He was sentenced to a year in jail, which was immediately suspended, and placed on probation for a year. Gordon would be subject to having the jail term reinstated if he fails to abide by the terms of his probation. Prosecutors say Gordon was a property and evidence technician with the agency when he and a property and evidence supervisor, 55-year-old Robert White, stole more than $7,700 in cash, several pounds of cocaine, meth and other drugs and several samurai-style swords. The missing evidence led the Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office to dismiss or review dozens of drug cases. White pleaded guilty in January to 12 counts, including felony official misconduct, drug distribution and thefts. He is set to be sentenced on April 29.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The last stockpiles of a deadly chemical agent in the U.S. have been safely eliminated, according to Kentucky officials in charge of destroying the Cold War-era weapons. The final M55 rocket containing VX nerve agent was destroyed Tuesday at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent plant. Officials began disassembling about 18,000 of the rockets and draining the VX agent in July, according to a news release from plant officials. Candace Coyle, the plant’s project manager, said Wednesday that the nation’s entire stockpile of VX nerve agent “is now completely destroyed.” VX is considered the deadliest of the chemical agents that were produced by the U.S., much in the 1960s. It has a consistency similar to motor oil, and even a tiny amount causes victims’ bodies to flood with fluids, producing a feeling of drowning before death. Officials in 2017 declared that assassins used VX agent to kill the brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a Malaysian airport. The central Kentucky Army depot still has 277 tons of other chemical agents left to be destroyed, after beginning with more than 520 tons of VX, GB and mustard agent that was in storage for decades. Officials said it all should be gone by next year after it began eliminating its mustard agent stockpiles in 2019.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Legislation to keep transgender athletes from competing on college and K-12 women’s and girls’ sports teams has been approved by the state Senate with little debate. The Advocate reports that the bill by Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, passed Tuesday evening on a 29-6 vote. It goes next to the state House. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoed similar legislation last year, saying it was mean-spirited, unnecessary and could result in loss of NCAA events in the state. He has not said what he would do were the bill to pass this year. The measure would apply to K-12 schools, as well as colleges and universities, if they receive state funding. “Athletic teams or sporting events designated for females, girls, or women shall not be open to students who are not biologically female,” the bill says. Opponents say there are no known transgender athletes currently competing in the state, and the legislation adds to discrimination against an already marginalized group. Mizell said the NCAA hasn’t gone through with threats to pull events from states with similar laws.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday signed into law a bill to create a public-private partnership to help grow the state’s aerospace industry. Supporters envision the corporation as a central hub for innovation and economic development in the state’s air and space industry. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Mattie Daughtry, D-Brunswick, said the effort has been years in the making. “The Maine Space Consortium will bring together business, research and state leaders, to help ensure Maine continues to be at the forefront of this industry,” Daughtry said in a statement. Members of the air and space industry have taken an interest in Maine in recent years, in part because it is home to the former Loring Air Force Base and Brunswick Landing, formerly a naval air station. The state’s geography and existing infrastructure make it a candidate to serve as a site for small launches, industry members have said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The addition of about 80 acres to the Pocomoke State Forest through legislation makes an elevated walkway connecting Snow Hill directly to the park possible. HB882, signed into law by Gov. Larry Hogan this month, was co-sponsored by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester. According to a statement by Carozza, the project would create a trail network from Snow Hill to Pocomoke City “and has significant social, recreational and economic benefits.” This Maryland Department of Natural Resources project would add the acreage to Pocomoke State Forest as new type of wildlands and would exempt approximately 2 acres for the trail’s construction. She also confirmed in a statement that “the trail will be developed through a collaborative planning process between the Maryland Forest Service, Maryland Park Service and the Town of Snow Hill.” The public hearing on this project was held Oct. 28, 2020, and 98% of the 122 comments were in strong support of the project, including multiple organizations and local government agencies.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A gate separating affordable housing from the new playground at Coes Park was unlocked Friday. Community activists celebrated, having seen the locked gate as a symbol of environmental injustice and racism. “It felt like modern-day segregation,” said Nelly Medina, an organizer with the Tenant and Housing Alliance of Worcester and a Lakeside Apartments resident who spearheaded the fight to unlock the gate. “They got $1.2 million from saying it was in an environmental justice community, and they locked the gate. It put white people on one side and (Black, Indigenous and people of color) people on the other.” But Alex Corrales, director of the WHA, said unlocking the gate was simply a seasonal task. “It’s springtime – that’s all it is,” Corrales said in an interview. “We had been opening it for years, during the summer program for children, and they would do swimming classes, have canoes, but we would not leave it open permanently because we were concerned with safety.” Corrales bristled at the idea of any injustice and said the plan was to open the gate “indefinitely.” “We will obviously monitor the situation in terms of communicating with residents and the community,” he said. “If there are incidents that really put the safety risk of residents involved, we do want to review that very closely.”\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: A judge denied a motion Tuesday to reduce bonds for the jailed parents of a teenager who is charged in a shooting at his high school that left four students dead. Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews said that James and Jennifer Crumbley’s actions before their Dec. 4 arrests in a commercial building in Detroit were meant to conceal their whereabouts. “The defendants indicate they were devastated when they heard about the alleged actions of their son, felt unsafe in their home, felt hounded by the press and found it necessary to leave,” Matthews said. “The chronology of events that occurred subsequent to the defendants leaving their home is not consistent with cooperation with law enforcement.” The Crumbleys had disappeared the day before after they were charged with involuntary manslaughter. The parents are accused of failing to keep a gun secure at home and failing to reasonably care for their son when he showed signs of mental distress. They have pleaded not guilty. “Upon a warrant being issued, law enforcement is not required to make an appointment with a defendant,” Matthews said. “It is the job of the police to ensure a swift, safe and secure arrest. The defendants’ actions were premeditated to conceal their whereabouts.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear a challenge by environmentalists over portions of a lower court ruling involving a key permit for the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals in January reversed a 2018 decision by state regulators to issue PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It sent the case back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for further proceedings. That was a win for environmentalists, but they’re challenging other parts of the ruling. One prong involves the agency’s decision to issue the permit without setting specific effluent limits on mercury and other pollutants. They also faulted the appeals court for not imposing consequences for the agency’s alleged effort to dissuade the federal Environmental Protection Agency from submitting critical written comments during the water permit review process. “It is so important that Minnesota agencies be held accountable when they circumvent laws that were meant to protect the integrity of the regulatory process,” said Paula Maccabee, counsel for WaterLegacy, one of the three parties that asked the Supreme Court to step in. The other petitioners are the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy and the Fond du Lac band of Lake Superior Chippewa.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A state prison violated inmates’ constitutional rights by failing to protect them from violence, failing to meet their mental health needs, failing to take adequate steps for suicide prevention and relying too much on prolonged solitary confinement, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday. The department released findings of its two-year investigation of the state’s oldest prison, Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. The probe started after an outburst of violence in late 2019 and early 2020. “The problems at Parchman are severe, systemic, and exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision,” the department said in its report. It said the Mississippi Department of Corrections “has been on notice of these deficiencies for years and failed to take reasonable measures to address the violations, due in part to non-functional accountability or quality assurance measures.” “Years of MDOC’s deliberate indifference has resulted in serious harm and a substantial risk of serious harm to persons confined at Parchman,” the Justice Department said. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, head of Justice’s civil rights division, said 10 homicides and 12 suicides have occurred among inmates at Parchman since 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A bill passed by the state House on Tuesday would put restrictions on how race is talked about in public K-12 schools. The GOP-led House on Tuesday voted 85-59 in favor of the bill, with some Republicans opposing the measure. It now goes to the GOP-led Senate. The legislation would ban schools from teaching “that individuals, by virtue of their race, ethnicity, color, or national origin, bear collective guilt and are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, ethnicity, color, or national origin.” The measure also bans schools from compelling students and teachers to affirm that “individuals of any race, ethnicity, color, or national origin are inherently superior or inferior.” Students, parents or teachers could file complaints alleging violations of those bans with the state education department or Missouri attorney general. Supporters argued that the bill is needed to prevent classrooms from being used to indoctrinate children. But critics said the measure could have a chilling effect and might scare educators away from having difficult discussions about race and American history. “America’s history is not squeaky clean,” Democratic Rep. LaKeySha Bosley said. “We need to be open-minded about that and have the hard conversations and not be scared to talk it through.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The city commission has voted 4-1 to deny an appeal from local marijuana dispensary owners over a Safety Inspection Certificate and to bring forward a proposed referendum package regarding adult-use marijuana sales on the ballot this November. City staff will work with city commissioners to get a referendum on the ballot. Janelle and Dale Yatsko, owners of Green Creek Dispensary in Cascade County, applied for a Safety Inspection Certificate, handled by Great Falls Fire Rescue as an annual inspection for businesses within city limits, for the operation of an adult-use marijuana dispensary within city limits in February. GFFR and the City Attorney’s Office advised that their application likely not be processed, according to the agenda background. Legal counsel for the Yatksos, Attorney Raph Graybill, reached out to the City Attorney Jeff Hindoien to argue that “state law entitles the Yatskos to operate their adult-use marijuana business within City limits; any contrary policy is preempted by state law.” The city responded denying the SIC on the basis of a local ordinance that has been in place for medical marijuana and federal law regarding marijuana but said the Yatskos could appeal the decision, which they did.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts touted the tax cuts lawmakers approved this year as they wrapped up their session Wednesday. Ricketts said the $900 million package of income and property tax cuts that the Legislature approved this year delivered “the most significant tax relief bill we have ever had in the state of Nebraska.” He signed the bill last week. Lawmakers took care of their business quickly Wednesday because Ricketts didn’t veto any of the bills they sent to him this week. Ricketts also praised bills the Legislature passed that will lay the groundwork for a canal project to divert water out of Colorado and study the creation of a major new lake along the Platte River between Lincoln and Omaha. Lawmakers also made plans to spend more than $1 billion in federal pandemic relief money, including a package of $335 million to help economic recovery in parts of Omaha and other high-poverty areas in the state. And Ricketts said the Legislature made important investments in public safety including improvements at the state law enforcement training center and setting aside money for a potential new state prison.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The Generator, lauded as a headquarters for Burning Man artists, has a new space and a new mission. The arts and maker space reopened this month after signing a 10-year lease with Foothill Partners, developer of the much anticipated Oddie District – a 187,000-square-foot mixed-use space just east of U.S. 395 in Sparks, next to Goodwill. The Generator currently takes up about 70,000 square feet, about twice the size of its former home on Icehouse Avenue in industrial Sparks. Eventually, about half the space will be given to another tenant. “Any time there’s a lot of people in a space making art, it makes us all feel better, right?” said Jessi “Sprocket” Janusee, communications director for the Generator, also lovingly known as The Genny. Since 2013, local and international artists alike have used the space to assemble colossal sculptures, from temples to whales to ships, before sending the installations into the desert to burn. While it continues to be a magnet for Burning Man creations, staff at the Generator say the goals of the space are now more community-driven. Still run by a cast of established Burners, the team is placing a much heavier emphasis on community outreach year-round.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Theo Martey, a teacher of West African drumming and dance and a songwriter, is the state’s next artist laureate. Martey, nominated by Gov. Chris Sununu, was confirmed by the Executive Council on Wednesday for the two-year, honorary position. He had received the Governor’s Arts Award for Arts Education in 2019. Born in Accra, Ghana, he has more than 33 years’ experience as a performer and arts educator across three continents. He has lived and worked in New Hampshire for 20 years. Martey has taught more than 5,000 workshops to students from first grade through high school, college and university students, and in communities. “For over two decades, I have been invited into dozens of schools across New Hampshire as an artist in residence, working with students so that they may experience West African drumming and dance hands-on,” Martey said in a statement. “To be named artist laureate is an honor, and I look forward to continuing to use music to empower others to discover their best selves and promote the importance of arts across the state and the region.” Martey is the state’s ninth artist laureate since 1997.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A Catholic diocese has agreed to pay $87.5 million to settle claims involving clergy sex abuse with some 300 alleged victims in one of the largest cash settlements involving the Catholic Church in the United States. The agreement between the Diocese of Camden, which encompasses six counties in southern New Jersey on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and plaintiffs was filed with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden on Tuesday. The settlement must still go before a U.S. bankruptcy judge. If approved, the settlement would exceed the nearly $85 million settlement in 2003 in the clergy abuse scandal in Boston, although it’s less than other settlements in California and Oregon. “I want to express my sincere apology to all those who have been affected by sexual abuse in our Diocese,” Bishop Dennis Sullivan said in a statement. “My prayers go out to all survivors of abuse and I pledge my continuing commitment to ensure that this terrible chapter in the history of the Diocese of Camden, New Jersey never happens again.” Details about what allegedly happened to the roughly 300 victims were not included in the proposed settlement, according to Jeff Anderson, an attorney for some 70 of the victims, who called it “a powerful advance in accountability.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Officials with a U.S. agency undergoing a multibillion-dollar modernization effort that includes the production of plutonium cores for the nation’s nuclear arsenal celebrated the opening of a massive office complex Tuesday. Jill Hruby, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, joined other officials and members of the state’s congressional delegation for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Years in the making, the new complex on the edge of Albuquerque will replace a collection of two dozen military barracks and other buildings, some of which date back to the government’s top-secret Manhattan Project during World War II. Officials said some of the old buildings were compromised by asbestos and lead paint and were well past their lifespans. The new building boasts enough space to cover more than five football fields and will end up saving the agency an estimated $40 million in deferred maintenance, officials said. It includes a data center for rows of servers, conference rooms and secure spaces. Construction was supposed to wrap up last year, but officials said pandemic-related labor and material shortages resulted in delays.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: A widely seen video of an 8-year-old Black child sobbing as he’s being led into a police car over a bag of chips was called “heart-wrenching” Wednesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said more needs to be done to build trust with communities of color. The video taken Sunday shows a white officer holding the clearly distraught youth from behind by his elbows, leading him from a sidewalk to the back seat of a police vehicle. Another officer says the situation is about “stealing stuff.” The man recording the video argues with police to let the child go. The video has been widely shared on social media, with many people condemning the officers for treating the child roughly. Hochul, at a COVID-19 briefing in Syracuse, said the video was difficult to watch. “We have more work to do, and I know that the mayor is working closely with the police department to get to the bottom of everything,” said Hochul, a Democrat. “But also make sure that we do protect our children – that they’re handled in a different way when it comes to encounters with law enforcement.” Syracuse police said Tuesday the officers’ actions were being reviewed, along with body-worn camera footage. Police said the incident involved an accusation of youths stealing from a store.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to give a judge another week to work through the latest step in a long-running legal fight over public education spending. The court’s justices granted Special Superior Court Judge Michael Robinson a seven-day extension, which he had requested Tuesday while citing differences between the legal parties over details and numerous documents to review. Robinson was tasked last month with scrutinizing the November order of another judge who had directed that $1.75 billion be moved from state coffers to carry out two years of a remedial plan to address education inequities. In particular, the Supreme Court told Robinson to review Judge David Lee’s order in light of the General Assembly’s passage of a state budget that funds some of the plan’s provisions. Robinson originally had until Wednesday to report his findings to the justices, who afterward will hear appeals that likely would rule on whether the judicial branch has constitutional powers to order taxpayer-funded spending for education on its own. Republican legislative leaders say only the General Assembly can appropriate state money.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican state Sen. Ray Holmberg resigned Wednesday as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature’s business between sessions, just days after a published report that he had exchanged scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Holmberg, 79, the state’s longest-serving senator, stepped down from the legislative management committee, saying in a statement “recent events and discussions have made it clear to me that the interim governing body of the legislature, Legislative Management, does not need to be any part of that discussion.” Holmberg will remain on the panel, but not as its chairman. “No further comments on this announcement will be forthcoming,” his statement said. He had announced in March he would not seek reelection. The Forum of Fargo reports Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier as Morgan-Derosier was held in the Grand Forks County Jail. The newspaper cited a jail log it obtained through a records request showing the time and date of the text messages. Morgan-Derosier was held at the time on state child pornography charges. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges but in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reports. He also said he no longer has the texts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A doctor accused of ordering excessive amounts of painkillers that led to multiple patient deaths at a Columbus-area hospital was acquitted of 14 counts of murder Wednesday following a weeks­long trial. Dr. William Husel, 46, was accused of ordering the drugs for patients in the Mount Carmel Health System. He was indicted in cases that involved at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for a nonsurgical situation indicated an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued he was providing comfort care for dying patients, not trying to kill them. Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook told jurors before the start of deliberations that they could also consider lesser charges of attempted murder. They deliberated for six days. Husel would have faced a sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility in 15 years had he been found guilty of just one count of murder. Prosecutors presented their case beginning Feb. 22 and put on 53 prosecution witnesses before resting on March 29. Those witnesses included medical experts who testified that Husel ordered up to 20 times as much fentanyl as was necessary to control pain.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Emergency responders, National Guardsmen, children, parents, grandparents, members of Congress, City Council members, students and college professors united Tuesday in their desire to remember the 168 lives lost in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building 27 years ago. In spite of the somber reason for the gathering, laughter and joyful conversation were heard among the crowd of nearly 1,000 people filling the pews of Oklahoma City’s First Church ahead of the annual Day of Remembrance Ceremony. The ceremony was moved inside the church east of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum out of concern for chilly temperatures and wind gusts Tuesday morning, but by the time the crowd followed the bagpipers to the Field of Empty Chairs to place flowers on them, the sun was shining brightly. Speakers partaking in the program included Gov. Kevin Stitt, U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice and Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. “When you see your fellow human beings as Republicans or Democrats – not as fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters – then you have begun the process of dehumanization. You are paving the path to horror,” Holt said. “That memorial is a symbol of that path’s inevitable conclusion.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon State Treasury has at least $5.3 billion invested in fossil fuel companies, a coalition of environmental groups said in a report Wednesday that blamed the state for adding to global warming and urged divestment. Oregon is considered a “green” state, through its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by state agencies and being the first state to commit to stop using coal-fired power. Yet the state treasury is working at cross-purposes with over $1 billion invested in the coal industry alone, Divest Oregon said in its report. “The state exposes Oregonians to climate and health risks, economic costs, and financial losses” through the investments, the group said. The amount that Oregon has invested in oil, gas and coal companies – whose products are a leading cause of global warming – is probably far higher than $5.3 billion because the numbers that Divest Oregon obtained from the state treasury through a public records request do not include private equity investments, which are not subject to public disclosure. The state treasury did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The agency’s spokesperson was tied up in a meeting Wednesday of the Oregon Investment Council, which makes investment decisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The federal fraud trial of a City Council member and his wife in what prosecutors alleged was a “widespread corruption conspiracy” has ended in a mistrial following a jury deadlock. Jurors deliberated for about 25 hours over four days but were unable to reach a verdict in the case of Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and his wife, Dawn Chavous, who were charged with honest services wire fraud in a 22-count indictment. Outside the courtroom, Johnson thanked family, friends and supporters “for just praying for us and showing your support during this very stressful time.” The jury told the judge Monday afternoon that they were at an impasse but deliberated all day Tuesday after being instructed by the judge to do so. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office later said “the government is committed to retrying the case.” Johnson, 46, a Democrat who has served on the council since 2012, was accused of engaging in official actions in exchange for payments. Chavous, 40, was accused of having entered into a “sham” consulting agreement with a nonprofit that was used to funnel payments to her husband. Defense attorneys said prosecutors lacked evidence to support their case, defending the work of Chavous as legitimate and saying it had nothing to do with Johnson’s actions on the council.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The downtown arena known as “The Dunk” will keep its name at least through June. Dunkin’ Donuts’ two-decade-old naming rights deal for the building expired Wednesday, but the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority has agreed to a short-term extension through June 30 while it vets new proposals, Executive Director Daniel McConaghy said Tuesday. At the start of this month, the Convention Center Authority went out to bid for new naming rights proposals from companies looking to display their brand to hockey and basketball fans or drivers speeding past on Route 95. Unlike the previous naming rights deal, which included only the arena, this time the authority plans to include the rights for the next door Rhode Island Convention Center, according to the Request For Proposals. While Dunkin’ Donuts – now known as Dunkin’ – may put in a bid to keep the name, it is likely to face competition. And the fact that the doughnut chain didn’t come to an agreement to extend the deal before it went to a formal bidding process may be a sign it has moved on. The arena was built by the City of Providence in 1972 and was originally known as the Providence Civic Center. Dunkin’ first bought the naming rights to the center in a 2001 deal valued at $8.65 million over 10 years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: A performer who scared a group at a haunted house was shot by a man who said he thought he was grabbing a prop gun as part of the experience, police said. The employee at the Zombie Experience at the Hollywood Wax Museum Haunted House in Myrtle Beach was hit in the shoulder and survived, authorities said. The man told investigators the group fell to the ground after the performer scared them Saturday, and he felt a gun hit his foot, Myrtle Beach Police said in a statement on Facebook. The man thought the gun was not real and was part of the experience and fired twice, police said. The performer spoke at the suspect’s bond hearing and said the man looked at him before firing. He said since the shooting, he is struggling to work and can’t sleep. So far, the man has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor because he gave the gun to a 15-year-old after firing it even through he was told it was real, authorities said. Police said they are still trying to determine where the gun came from, and additional charges are likely.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Avera Health has plans to build the state’s largest pickleball facility. The health care provider will construct 12 outdoor courts at its Avera on Louise Health Campus in Sioux Falls at a cost of about $1.5 million. Pickleball is a sport that’s recently grown in popularity, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Combining elements of tennis, badminton and pingpong, it’s played indoors or outdoors on a badminton-sized court with a slightly modified tennis net. Two or four players can play with simple equipment that involves paddles and a plastic ball with holes. Jason Askew is executive director of Sports Medicine for Avera and said the organization wants to appeal to people of all ages. “Being able to offer something for adults that is growing by leaps and bounds in popularity, both here in Sioux Falls and around the country, is a lot of fun to be able to announce,” Askew said, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Askew said construction will take a few months, and Avera anticipates the free courts will open to the public by early August.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican officials have removed three congressional hopefuls from the GOP primary ballot, including one candidate backed by ex-President Donald Trump. The late Tuesday night decision by the Tennessee Republican Party was a long-awaited result of months of debate over Morgan Ortagus, Trump’s former State Department spokesperson, entering Nashville’s open 5th Congressional District race. Even with Trump’s endorsement, some Republicans criticized the selection after pointing out that she had just recently moved to the state and did not know the region or its voters. Tennessee’s GOP-controlled Legislature had sought to nudge Ortagus and others off the ballot by imposing residency requirements on most U.S. House and Senate candidates. However, that attempt fizzled after the state’s election office told the Associated Press the legislation – which Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee allowed to go into effect without his signature earlier this month – would not apply retroactively to candidates who had already met the qualifications. That left the decision up to the state Republican Party, who had received challenges over the voting records of Ortagus, as well as video producer Robby Starbuck and small-business owner Baxter Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Former state lawmaker Wendy Davis sued Tuesday over the most restrictive abortion law in effect in the U.S., nearly a decade after her 13-hour filibuster of another anti-abortion measure made her an overnight Democratic star. The lawsuit is the latest attempt to halt the Texas law known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Courts have repeatedly turned back multiple other challenges and kept the law in place since September. That includes both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Texas Supreme Court, defeats that left attorneys for Texas abortion clinics acknowledging that their path to stopping the law had effectively shut. Like past challenges, Davis calls the law unconstitutional but a takes a different legal approach, suing a Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain, who earlier this year accused Citigroup of circumventing the law by offering to pay travel expenses for employees who go out of state to seek an abortion. Cain did not immediately respond to an email sent Tuesday evening. The suit also names three private citizens who Davis accuses of using or threatening to use the law’s unique mechanism that enforces the law only through private lawsuits. Davis’ filibuster propelled a failed run for governor. She also lost a bid for Congress in 2020 and now works with abortion funds.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As warmer weather draws more people to get out and enjoy the sunshine, officials are urging anyone heading out into the state’s great outdoors with their pets to keep their dogs on leashes. Dogs can have a serious impact on wildlife and on landscapes, and any left off-leash while in nature could act on their instincts to chase deer and other animals, wildlife officials said Tuesday as they issued a statewide request for dog owners to take the issue more seriously. Utah wildlife often struggles to find food during the winter and can be vulnerable and weak come springtime, according to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “If they get chased, it uses up energy they may need to survive,” said Covy Jones, the Big Game coordinator at UDWR. “These animals are already depleted, and they often can’t afford to waste energy. If you or a pet force them to move away from where they are trying to feed, it could be harmful.” Deer and other big game animals typically move to lower elevations in search of feed during the snowy winter months, which typically brings them closer to roads and to people and pets. Dogs that are off leash can also disturb nesting ground birds and can chase, injure or kill small mammals, deer, elk or moose, according to the DWR. Utah law states that a person may kill or injure a dog that is “attacking, chasing or worrying any species of hoofed protected wildlife.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The second of four men accused in a failed plan to build a biotechnology plant in Vermont using tens of millions of dollars in foreign investors’ money raised through a special visa program was sentenced Wednesday in federal court to 18 months in prison. William Kelly, 73, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, also was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $8.3 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty last June to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of concealment of material information. As part of the plea deal, eight other charges were dropped and he agreed to cooperative with the government. Kelly was indicted in 2019 on multiple fraud charges along with Miami businessman Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak and Burke Mountain ski resorts in northern Vermont, and former Jay Peak president William Stenger. Kelly was an adviser to Quiros. The indictment accused the men of conspiring to devise a scheme between 2011 and 2016 to defraud foreign investors in the AnC-Bio project in Newport. The EB-5 visa program encourages foreigners to invest in U.S. projects that create jobs in exchange for a chance to earn permanent U.S. residency.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After two years of pandemic-enforced absence, Tom’s Cove Park campground will again welcome hungry seafood lovers as the Chincoteague Seafood Festival – appropriately themed “Long Time ... No Sea!” – returns for its 52nd year May7. The Chincoteague Chamber-sponsored event is held the first Saturday in May to promote the seafood industry on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. The festival offers fresh, local seafood and signature dishes from local restaurants as well as old and new Eastern Shore favorites prepared by festival cooks, volunteers and professionals, according to the chamber. Non-alcoholic beverages are included in the ticket price, with beer available for purchase. Front Page News will provide live entertainment, and festivalgoers can shop an arts and crafts tent featuring handmade creations from area artisans. Ticket sales have been brisk due to the two-year hiatus, according to the chamber.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A citywide “day of service” in May will offer thousands of volunteer opportunities in an event Mayor Bruce Harrell hopes will be a symbol of how his administration plans to beautify the city. Rather than a budget boost or a new devotion of city resources, Harrell is appealing to civic goodwill to help clear litter, weeds, debris and graffiti, The Seattle Times reports. More than 80 city-organized cleanup and volunteer events will take place May 21. Some of the options include picking up litter in Ballard, clearing trails in Jackson Park, working on community gardens in the Chinatown International District, sorting donations at downtown shelters and building tiny homes near the Duwamish River. “This is going to be symbolic of how we’re going to get things done in our city,” Harrell said Monday. “People want to help. Employers want to help; employees want to help.” Everyone who volunteers for the day of service, Harrell said, will a sense of self-fulfillment that they did something about a problem rather than just complaining, along with a T-shirt. The city annually spends about $3.7 million on graffiti removal and has the equivalent of about 15 full-time employees devoted to the problem. Harrell said he’s not yet sure if the city needs to devote more money to it. Volunteers can register at seattle.gov/dayofservice.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A former director at a hospital has filed a lawsuit alleging he was fired after he raised concerns about the safety of patients who were on ventilators and receiving other respiratory care services during a surge of COVID-19 cases. Mark Mustard was fired as director of cardiopulmonary and therapy services at Princeton Community Hospital in September 2021. His departure from the West Virginia University Medicine affiliate came amid the surging delta variant of the coronavirus “at a time when respiratory care was crucial to the community,” according to a lawsuit filed last week in Mercer County Circuit Court. Mustard, then 63, alleges he was terminated after he reported concerns about the quality of medical care being provided as the number of patients requiring respiratory care increased during the pandemic. Mustard was “highly outspoken” about the need for more staff in the respiratory services department “in order to provide an adequate level of care to its patients and the community,” the lawsuit said. He was not warned that his job was in jeopardy or given a reason for the termination, which came less than one month after he received an “exceptional” performance review that included an incentive bonus of more than $6,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Communities are encouraging residents to keep their lawnmowers in the garage next month to boost the population of bees and other pollinators. Appleton became the first city to adopt the “No Mow May” initiative a couple of years ago, and others have followed, including Wausau, Oshkosh, Fort Atkinson and Stevens Point. The idea is to give homeowners the option of letting their lawns become a bit overgrown for a few weeks to ensure that bees coming out of hibernation have plenty of options for the nectar and pollen they need, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Cities temporarily waive enforcement of ordinances that require homeowners to maintain their lawns. This year, the initiative has spread even farther, to La Crosse, Wisconsin Rapids, De Pere and other communities. “Bees, and insects in general, are in a bit of a slump right now,” said Israel Del Toro, a biology professor at Appleton’s Lawrence University. Studies have shown steep declines in wild bee populations in the 21st century. The United Nations characterizes it as a threat to the global food supply. Del Toro said many factors are hurting bee populations, including climate change and irresponsible uses of pesticides and herbicides. But in his view, the biggest stressor is habitat loss. Del Toro said there is plenty of room for compromise. People can plant native flowers or allow growth only in parts of their yards.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A utility company estimates a new law requiring carbon-capture systems be added to coal-fired plants could cost the average customer an extra $500 a month, WyoFile reports. Black Hills Corp. said in a filing with the Wyoming Public Service Commission that the measure passed by the Legislature in 2020 could cost it as much as $1 billion per coal unit, according to the news outlet.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/01/lifeguard-death-traffic-ticket-scam-amherst-pushback-news-around-states/118519764/", "title": "Lifeguard death, traffic ticket scam: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Rural school districts are leading the state in reported COVID-19 case rates. When the Alabama Department of Public Health updated its COVID-19 school dashboard for the first time this school year Friday, three districts stood out with the highest percentage of confirmed cases: Covington, Greene and Marion county schools. All three are rural districts, and about 5% of students in each district have tested positive for the coronavirus. These schools were among only 52 of Alabama’s 137 school districts with available data on the state dashboard. In Marion, most of the 160 reported cases were concentrated in three schools, resulting in temporary closures, said Marion County Superintendent Ann West. “We’re just trying to operate with what’s best for each school,” West said. “I don’t like to send children home because for some of our students, what they get to eat is at school.” Masks are not required in Marion County Schools, but West said the district strongly encourages them. “Certainly, if I were not vaccinated, I would be wearing a mask,” she said. Meanwhile, masks are required in Greene County Schools, which reported 47 COVID-19 cases Friday. Covington County Schools reported 140 cases. According to district protocols, masks are “recommended for all individuals while indoors” and required on school buses.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The Sitka Assembly has authorized a 20-year lease of land to an Alaska Native corporation for development for cruise ship passengers. The Assembly, voting 5-2, approved leasing 17 acres to Shee Atika Inc., which plans to work with another company, Adventure Sitka, to develop the land with attractions such as zip lines, a salmon bake and a canoe launch, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The land is between the ferry terminal and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Chris McGraw, who owns the terminal and manages Adventure Sitka, said development of the property will be an important part of handling an expected large number of tourists. “The key to over-tourism is good distribution of guests,” McGraw said at an Assembly meeting. Karl Potts, CEO of Shee Atika Inc., said the lease would generate $300,000 to $400,000 a year for the city. Assembly member Kevin Knox raised questions about staffing at the site, citing difficulties businesses are having this year with hiring staff. But he said he would vote “yes” because of an expected influx of passengers next year. “We don’t have a lot of options here,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The FBI’s Public Corruption unit is investigating efforts by Gov. Doug Ducey’s past and current staffers – including one who is now a federal judge – to push for a closed-door deal to issue tax refunds worth as much as $100million to aid one of Ducey’s campaign supporters. Grant Nulle, former deputy director at the Department of Revenue, said an FBI agent contacted him in mid-July, shortly after an Arizona Republic investigation uncovered how the Ducey administration had pushed the department to agree to refund sales taxes on fuel for mining companies, even though that tax had been in place for decades. The companies that stood to benefit were represented by Texas tax firm Ryan LLC, founded by Ducey supporter G. Brint Ryan. The top three deputies in Ducey’s administration left their government jobs and went to work for Ryan to push for the tax refund. The men and others working for Ducey met with Revenue officials at least 16 times to insist that the department – which was under their oversight in the governor’s office – agree to stop opposing Ryan and issue a tax refund to one fuel company. That, officials said, would have triggered refunds in all other similar cases, costing the state’s general fund more than $100 million.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients on a ventilator climbed to a new high Monday as the state reported 33 new coronavirus deaths amid the summer surge driven by the highly contagious delta variant. The Department of Health reported the state’s COVID-19 patients on ventilators rose by 17 to 361, surpassing the high the state had set last week. The state’s virus hospitalizations remained unchanged from a day earlier at 1,257. There are 533 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state. The department reported there are 21 available ICU beds in Arkansas, though it’s not clear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients. Last week the state ran out of ICU beds for virus patients, though availability has slightly eased since then. The state’s COVID-19 death toll rose Monday to 6,912 since the pandemic began. It also added 882 new virus cases. Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The Department of Health reported that the number of active cases among students and staff in the state’s public schools has grown to 3,684. Cabot, Fort Smith, Springdale, Rogers and Bentonville schools each reported more than 100 active cases.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Legislature on Monday voted to guarantee people can call out their bosses publicly in most harassment and discrimination cases. When companies settle complaints filed by their employees, the agreements often include a provision barring the employee from disparaging the company or talking publicly about what happened. These agreements came under fire during the #MeToo movement, criticized as shielding public figures and companies from responsibility in sexual harassment cases. California passed a law in 2018 that bans these nondisclosure agreements in cases involving sexual harassment, discrimination or assault. The Democratic-dominated Legislature voted Monday to expand that law to include other types of harassment and discrimination, including claims based on race, religion, gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who must decide whether to sign it into law. “No worker should ever be silenced from speaking out about their own experience of harassment or discrimination in the workplace,” said Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, author of the bill. “For far too long, these secret settlements and agreements have reinforced a culture of secrecy that prevents accountability, respect and justice.”\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A former police officer involved in the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia should stand trial for assault, a judge ruled Monday. District Judge Michelle Brinegar said there is probable cause for the charge against former Loveland police Officer Austin Hopp, who will be arraigned in late September, the Loveland Reporter-Herald reports. Hopp arrested Karen Garner in June 2020 after she left a store without paying for about $14 worth of items. His body camera footage shows him catching up to the woman as she walks through a field along a road. Gardner, now 74, shrugs and turns away from him, and he quickly grabs her arm and pushes her 80-pound body to the ground. A federal lawsuit filed on Garner’s behalf, which included images from the body camera footage, claims that Hopp dislocated her shoulder by shoving her handcuffed left arm forward onto the hood of his patrol car and that she was denied medical treatment for about six hours. Former Loveland police Officer Daria Jalali is facing several charges stemming from the arrest, including failing to intervene in the use of excessive force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 1,500 long-term unemployed residents who recently found jobs are being awarded $1,000 bonuses under the first round of the Back to Work CT program, an initiative funded with federal COVID-19 relief funds. Approximately $10 million has been allocated for the program, which will provide bonus payments for up to 10,000 eligible applicants through Dec. 31. “Many workers who were displaced during the early months in the pandemic and faced long-term unemployment are now transitioning back into the workforce and starting to rebuild,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday in a statement. “This one-time bonus payment will help some of those workers pay for the critical things they need to get back to work, including childcare.” To be eligible for the program, applicants must obtain and maintain a full-time job for eight consecutive weeks between May 30 and Dec. 31. Applicants must complete and submit an application electronically to the Department of Revenue Services.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A state trooper who received several traffic commendations has been indicted for a fraudulent traffic warning scheme in which at least two of his victims were fellow law enforcement officers, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Tuesday. Cpl. Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9, was charged with misdemeanor and felony tampering with public records; issuing a false certificate, a felony; and official misconduct, a misdemeanor. If convicted, he faces up to nine years in prison. Delaware State Police contacted prosecutors in May, according to the justice department, after an internal review found “a serious pattern of fraudulent E-Warnings” by Ramirez. The review began April 30 after one of his supervisors found discrepancies in an accident report, prosecutors said. Ramirez was immediately suspended. According to the indictment, after finding the discrepancy, the supervisor began looking at Ramirez’s activity and compared instances in which E-Warnings and E-Tickets were issued to dashcam footage to determine whether the stop had occurred and if so, what had been issued. In April alone, Ramirez issued more than 30 fraudulent warnings, according to the justice department. In some cases, motorists were not informed of the warnings. In other instances, a traffic stop never happened.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Landon Collins, safety for the Washington Football Team, took some time away from the field Monday to bring joy to young football players, WUSA-TV reports. Collins surprised players at the D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation’s Woodbridge Warriors Youth Football Team at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store in Northeast D.C. Each member of the team got a $150 Dick’s Sporting Goods gift card to use however they wanted. Collins served as their personal shopping consultant. The kids, surprised and excited to spend time with the star player, grabbed new shoes and other football gear. “It just feels great for him to come down here and spend his time with us, just so we can have a surprise and get us ready,” one player said Collins said the opportunity to spend time with the kids was a blessing. “Being around these kids to give them a smile on their face and to put something on their shoulders that they can use on and off the football field is amazing,” Collins said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State education officials on Monday began to make good on threats to withhold funding from school districts that defied Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ban on mask mandates, despite a circuit judge last week ruling the ban unconstitutional. Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran announced that the Florida Department of Education has withheld an amount equal to monthly school board member salaries in Alachua and Broward counties, as directed by the State Board of Education. Funds will continue to be withheld until the districts comply, Corcoran said. Broward County Interim Superintendent Vickie Cartwright said in a statement that Broward County School Board believes it is in compliance with the law. “The health and safety of our students, teachers and staff continue to be our main priorities,” Cartwright said. “As such, BCPS (Broward County Public Schools) will continue to mandate masks, knowing the data shows they help minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our schools.” DeSantis, a Republican who is eyeing a possible presidential run in 2024, had been threatening to impose financial penalties on school boards for weeks. Democratic President Joe Biden has said if that happened, federal money would be used to cover any costs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers will use the same guidelines as in 2010 to redraw congressional, legislative and other electoral districts, meaning lawmakers are not required to give members of the public an advance look at the plans, nor consider whether districts give candidates from different political parties a meaningful chance to win. Identical guidelines were presented to both House and Senate redistricting committees Monday. The House voted to adopt the guidelines, while senators gave preliminary agreement, with a final vote likely on the first day of a special session expected in October or November. Asked about whether maps would be released in advance, Senate Majority Leader John Kennedy emphasized the shortened time period because of delays in U.S. census data stemming from COVID-19. In 2010, state legislative maps were unveiled the Friday before the redistricting special session began. “We’re obviously operating under a very short period of time compared to what they had to this previously,” said Kennedy, R-Macon. Advance notice of maps is one of the key objectives for which outside groups have been lobbying. “Georgians need to have access to the maps and know how and when the maps will be presented,” said Jerry Gonzalez, CEO of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health care officials are concerned about a shortage of oxygen as the state’s coronavirus surge continues to grow. Hospital officials are canceling nonemergency procedures that require oxygen in an attempt to conserve supplies, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. There is a global shortage of oxygen containers that are needed for transport to the islands, said Hilton Raethel, president and CEO of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, a trade group for the state’s hospitals and nursing homes. “The combined demand has increased to the point where we are concerned about whether we can generate enough oxygen in Hawaii to meet all the needs of our health care facilities,” Raethel said. Hawaii’s two oxygen plants have switched to producing medical gas only. Raethel said mainland tank orders are backlogged for months. Hawaii Pacific Health, which oversees several hospitals in the state, directed staff to cancel elective procedures where oxygen is needed. “We do not plan to defer any emergency surgery, and we will need to have careful consideration of cases that are urgent but not emergent,” Hawaii Pacific Health President and CEO Ray Vara said in a staff memo. “Any cases that can be deferred safely should be deferred until the oxygen supply solutions are clearer.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An environmental group that wants to end public-land grazing has outbid a rancher for a grazing lease on state land that includes habitat for bull trout and steelhead. Western Watersheds Project’s bid of $8,200 won the 20-year grazing lease on 620 acres in central Idaho’s Sawtooth Valley in Custer County. The group and the Idaho Cattle Association say it’s possible other state grazing leases could be sought by other environmental groups. Western Watersheds will also have to pay an annual $800 fee based on the number of sheep or cattle authorized for the allotment. “That’s still a screaming deal,” said Erik Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, noting that private-land grazing fees are about three times that much. “Certainly, at those prices, the parcel is a lot more valuable for conservation than it is for grazing livestock.” Molvar said the group will not graze livestock but instead convert the grazing lease into a conservation lease and allow the area to be used by wildlife, notably a herd of 50 pronghorn that frequent the area. Elk and bighorn sheep are also in the region. He also said sections of two streams running through the parcel, Fourth of July Creek and Champion Creek, will be protected. The new lease takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A white police officer has been placed on administrative duty as the city’s police oversight agency investigates his struggle with a Black woman who was walking her dog in a lakefront park. Police Superintendent David Brown on Monday directed that the officer be placed on paid desk duty while what happened over the weekend is investigated, the department said. Attorneys for the woman allege the encounter became violent and was an “obvious case of racial profiling.” The Civilian Office of Police Accountability said Monday that it reviewed the officer’s body camera video and recommended he either be placed on administrative duty or be relieved of his police power while it investigates. “If violations did occur, COPA will hold the officer accountable,” interim chief Andrea Kersten said. A law office representing Nikkita Brown said she was near the lakefront with her dog about 12:10 a.m. Saturday when a police officer approached her for being in the area after the park was closed. In a video recorded by a bystander, the woman and her dog appear to be walking away from the officer as he follows closely, and at one point she turns around with her phone in her hand and stops. Moments later, the officer appears to reach for her phone and then grabs Brown.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s health commissioner defended herself Monday against criticism arising from a photograph circulating on social media showing her not wearing a face mask during a wedding reception. Dr. Kristina Box said in a statement that she “made an informed decision” to take off her mask while dancing or talking at a recent family wedding with guests fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Box said all but five people at the wedding were fully vaccinated. Several social media comments called Box’s actions hypocritical, as she said Friday that Indiana had reached “the darkest time in the pandemic” amid a surge in infections and hospitalizations and urged more people to get COVID-19 shots and wear masks. The photo shows Box standing amid several people, none of whom are wearing masks. Box said in her statement that federal guidelines call for people to wear masks at indoor public places when in areas of “high or sustained transmission.” “I continue to wear my mask in these settings and encourage Hoosiers to do the same,” Box said. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb apologized in May 2020 after posing for a photo with two people in which none of the three wore masks inside a Brown County restaurant, a day after recommending mask-wearing.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A man was sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday in the abduction and killing of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, three years after she disappeared while out for an evening run. Judge Joel Yates’ sentence for Cristhian Bahena Rivera was mandatory for a first-degree murder conviction in Iowa, which does not have the death penalty. The 27-year-old former farmhand, who testified that he came to the U.S. illegally from Mexico as a teenager, has been jailed since his arrest in August 2018. Yates pointedly rejected defense claims that others were responsible for the crime. “Mr. Bahena Rivera, you and you alone forever changed the lives of those who loved Mollie Tibbetts,” he said. The sentence caps a case that inflamed anger over illegal immigration, fueled fears about violence against solo female runners, and took several noteworthy twists during and after Bahena Rivera’s trial in May. Tibbetts’ mother, Laura Calderwood, addressed Bahena Rivera in a victim impact statement read to the court. “Mollie was a young woman who simply wanted to go for a quiet run on the evening of July 18 and you chose to violently and sadistically end that life,” she wrote.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Former Gov. Jeff Colyer announced Monday that he is dropping out of the 2022 race for governor after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. “While I have always focused on helping others, for the next few weeks I am going to focus on my health,” said Colyer, a physician who served as governor for a little less than a year in 2018. In his announcement, Colyer said he was endorsing Attorney General Derek Schmidt in the governor’s race. Colyer had been Schmidt’s main rival for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s reelection. Schmidt wished Colyer “all the best in overcoming his current health challenges” in a statement and said that “now is the time to come together to elect a Republican governor for Kansas next year.” In a tweet, Kelly wished Colyer “a quick recovery.” “Colyer and I may have our disagreements. But one thing we can all agree on: the need to defeat cancer,” she wrote on Twitter. Colyer was elevated from lieutenant governor in January 2018, when GOP Gov. Sam Brownback resigned to become U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. Colyer narrowly lost the 2018 Republican primary to polarizing conservative Kris Kobach, who alienated moderate GOP and independent voters and lost to Kelly that November.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The governor signaled Monday that he wants to convene a special legislative session to deal with COVID-19 issues once a “general consensus” is reached on what can be achieved. Gov. Andy Beshear said the special session needs to happen soon in part to maintain the state of emergency he declared at the outset of the pandemic in Kentucky. And there are pressing coronavirus-related issues stemming from school closures due to surging outbreaks, he said. The governor has the authority to call lawmakers into special session and to set the agenda. Beshear, a Democrat, has had discussions with leaders of the Republican-led Legislature over what actions could be taken if lawmakers are brought back to the statehouse. Those negotiations come as Kentucky suffers its worst surge of virus cases and hospitalizations since the pandemic began. Various emergency measures previously issued by Beshear are set to expire as a result of a recent landmark court decision. It’s up to lawmakers to decide whether to keep them in place. Kentucky had more new cases of COVID-19 last week than any other week in the pandemi, and on Monday reported another record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients. The highly contagious delta variant is spreading fastest among school-age Kentuckians, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A storied jazz site where a young Louis Armstrong once worked toppled when Ida blew through the state as one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the U.S. The Karnofsky Tailor Shop, where a Jewish family employed Armstrong, collapsed Sunday during the storm. Armstrong would play a small tin horn as he worked on the coal and junk wagons, according to the National Park Service. The business opened downtown in 1913 and had a residence above it where the late jazz legend would often eat meals. The family, who provided Armstrong a “second home,” lent him money to buy his first cornet. “Louis said it was the Karnofskys that instilled the love of singing in his heart,” jazz historian and retired photojournalist John McCusker said, according to WWL-TV. Morris Karnofsky, the family’s son and Armstrong’s childhood friend, opened the city’s first jazz record shop on that same street, according to the park service. Armstrong would visit Morris Music when he returned to New Orleans after moving away. When daylight came Monday morning, all that was left was a pile of bricks and other remnants of the historic site.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lobster fishing industry will face a host of new harvesting restrictions amid a new push from the federal government to try to save a vanishing species of whale. The new rules, which have loomed over the profitable lobster industry for years and were announced Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are designed to protect the North Atlantic right whale. The whales number only about 360 and are vulnerable to lethal entanglement in fishing gear. NOAA said it expects the new rules will result in a nearly 70% reduction of the risk of death and serious injuries the whales can suffer from entanglement. The rules had long been expected to focus on reducing the number of vertical ropes in the water, and they will. The rules reduce the number of rope lines that link buoys to lobster and crab traps, NOAA said. The rules will also require the use of weaker ropes so whales can more easily break free if they do become entangled, the agency said. NOAA said the rules also expand the areas of ocean where fishing with trap rope is prohibited or limited. Members of the lobster fishing industry have said strict new rules could make it difficult to get lobsters to consumers.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Organizers of the 80th National Folk Festival say they’re adding a fourth stage at this year’s festival, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Stage. The festival is slated to return to downtown Salisbury on Sept. 10-12 for the third year of its residency in the Eastern Shore city. Supported by Maryland Traditions, the traditional arts program of the Maryland State Arts Council, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Area & Stage at the 80th National Folk Festival celebrates and showcases the rich, living traditions of Maryland. The area shines a spotlight on the distinctive music, rituals, crafts, occupations, foodways and other traditions at the heart of Maryland heritage, expressing both the state’s deep history and its evolving character. Performances, demonstrations, displays, exhibits, and narrative presentations by Maryland master artisans and performers explore a wide range of cultural traditions, including those of its First Peoples, the cultural legacies of European settlers, and the expressions of the newest Maryland residents whose cultural roots come from around the globe.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Hundreds of students at Amherst College are pushing back against what they call the school’s overly restrictive coronavirus protocols that include double-masking indoors, restrictions on off-campus activities, and no in-person campus dining. In a letter sent to President Carolyn “Biddy” Martin a week ago, the students said that “the guidelines are not based on any given data, have been developed without student input, are significantly stricter than our peer institutions, and are in conflict with (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines.” The restrictions originally announced Aug. 24 and designed in response to the spread of the delta variant apply to the first two weeks of the fall semester, which began Monday. The prestigious private liberal arts college celebrating its 200th anniversary this year had already mandated COVID-19 vaccinations. In response to the pushback, Martin wrote another campuswide email Aug. 27. “We are in the midst of a surge, and you are arriving on campus from all over the country and the world, including from delta hotspots,” she said, adding later: “Now is not yet the time to relax key restrictions.” She did, however, amend a near-universal outdoor mask mandate, calling it “unworkable.”\n\nMichigan\n\nRoyal Oak: Some animals are rolling up their fur for COVID-19 shots at the Detroit Zoo. The zoo in suburban Detroit said its gorillas, chimpanzees, tigers and lions are getting a vaccine developed by Zoetis, a veterinary drug company, and authorized by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Other animals will follow. “We’re both thankful and relieved a special vaccine is now available to protect against COVID-19,” said Scott Carter, the zoo’s chief life sciences officer. “The animals routinely get other vaccinations.” The zoo said no COVID-19 infections have been found in its animals. Anti-vaccine advocates have aggressively criticized other zoos nationwide that have administered the shots to their animals. But the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has said it supports the animal vaccines, which “have been clinically tested and administered to animals only after deep consideration by veterinary professionals.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state has reached 300 traffic accident deaths before Labor Day for the first time in more than a decade, prompting state public safety officials on Monday to issue a plea for people to slow down. The state reported its 300th fatality Saturday – the earliest the state has eclipsed that threshold since 2007, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety’s Office of Traffic Safety. There were 240 traffic deaths in the state at this time last year, and the state did not reach 300 until October. Officials attributed 103 of the deaths, or about 40%, to speeding, compared to 78 at this time last year. “This many preventable deaths on Minnesota roads before Labor Day is completely unacceptable,” said Office of Traffic Safety Director Mike Hanson. “It’s not a homework assignment; you don’t get a do-over. We all need to drive smart to keep our family, friends and neighbors alive.” Nearly three-fourths of all victims were male, with the majority between 21 and 30 years old. Alcohol-related deaths stand at 74, which is down from 88 at this time last year and 136 in 2011. Drunken driving-related deaths comprised 20% of all traffic fatalities in 2020 compared to more than half in the 1960s. State officials say the lower numbers are due in large part to extra impaired driving enforcement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said Tuesday that he is feeling well, less than two weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. “To everyone who has asked, I have recovered fully from my bout with COVID-19, and I have a clean bill of health,” Wicker posted on Twitter. “I am looking forward to resuming my travel in the state this week.” Wicker, 70, is one of three senators who announced Aug. 19 that they had tested positive for the coronavirus. Wicker, independent Sen. Angus King, 77, of Maine, and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper, 69, of Colorado, had all been fully vaccinated. All three have recommended that people get their shots. Wicker wrote Tuesday: “Being fully vaccinated greatly reduced my risk of developing severe complications from the virus. Getting the shot is safe, easy, and free, and it could save your life.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge on Tuesday refused to reinstate federal unemployment benefits that were cut in June when Gov. Mike Parson pulled out of several programs, saying the court “would not substitute its judgment” for that of the governor. The ruling by Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem came a day after lawyers representing Missouri residents who lost the jobless benefits asked for reinstatement with back pay that, for some people, could have amounted to $1,500. The enhanced benefits from several federal programs added money to the unemployment checks for out-of-work Americans to help ease the crunch caused by shutdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic. But some Republican governors, including Parson, ended the benefits, saying they wanted to prod people to rejoin the workforce. In his four-page ruling denying a preliminary injunction, Beteem wrote that “the balancing of harms and the public interest strongly favor the Governor’s decision to promote economic recovery and encourage workers’ re-entry into Missouri’s critically understaffed labor force.” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement that the ruling “affirmed the legality of Governor Parson’s decision to terminate these temporary benefits and will hopefully lead to the hiring of workers for businesses that desperately need the help.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has announced a rule encouraging schools to give parents final say on whether children should wear masks in schools, after several large school districts implemented mask requirements for all students. Gianforte, a Republican, made the announcement Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Education on Monday opened civil rights investigations into five Republican-led states that have banned or limited mask requirements in schools, saying the policies could amount to discrimination against students with disabilities or health conditions. Gianforte said in a statement that masking in schools, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, is “based on inconclusive research.” He also said masking could have adverse impacts on children’s “health, wellbeing and development.” The CDC issued its guidance in light of the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The rule says schools should consider “parental concerns” when adopting mask mandates and provide parents the ability to opt out of health-related mandates for a wide array of reasons including physical and mental health, developmental needs, religious beliefs and moral convictions.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of COVID-19 cases in the state has increased in each of the past ten weeks, and the total nearly doubled over the past two weeks as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread. Nebraska reported 5,006 new cases for the week ending Friday, according to an Omaha World-Herald analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s up from 3,755 the previous week and nearly double the 2,668 cases recorded the week before. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has also risen over the past two weeks from 190 new cases per day Aug. 15 to 715.14 new cases per day Sunday. “Those numbers speak for themselves,” said Dr. James Lawler, a co-executive director of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Security. “We’re going up, and we’re following in the footsteps of the Southern states that saw increasing cases before us. And we’ll continue that way unless something dramatic happens.” The state said 323 people were hospitalized with the virus in the state as of Thursday. Last week, Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered all the state’s hospitals to delay elective surgeries, if possible, to help free up capacity, but he resisted taking other measures to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: City officials say they’ll use a $50,000 grant from the National Park Service to fund research about five decades of segregation, civil rights activism and advocacy in the historic West Las Vegas neighborhood. An announcement Monday said the project aims to focus on the years 1930 through 1979 in what amounted to the city’s segregated Black community. The goal is to determine what buildings and properties could be included on the National Register of Historic Places and listed on the city’s Historic Property Register. The funds to Las Vegas are part of nearly $750,000 nationwide allocated under the park service’s Underrepresented Community Grant Program, the city statement said. The city Historic Preservation Office submitted the grant request, and the city will issue a request for proposals for contracts with experienced cultural resources consultants to prepare the survey and inventory.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A milestone anniversary for the New Hampshire Film Festival is again being pushed back a year due to COVID-19. Announced Monday, the 20th annual NHFF will have to wait another year because of the pandemic. The celebration was originally scheduled for October 2020, then delayed to October 2021. Now it’s planned for 2022. An autumn tradition in Portsmouth, which has hosted the festival since 2004 after its debut in Derry three years before, the festival said it would be unable to keep up with new health and safety protocols seen in art venues and community events across the country “due to the scale and scope” of an event spread across several days and multiple venues. “We are upset to find ourselves in this extremely difficult position, but our deeper concern lies with the filmmakers, attendees, supporters, partners and sponsors who continue to struggle with the ongoing pandemic,” NHFF executive director Nicole Gregg said in a statement. Celebrating newer filmmakers and directors, as well as more experienced screenwriters and actors, the NHFF is a four-day fall event that typically draws crowds for film showings, question-and-answer sessions with film producers and actors, and receptions and parties at downtown restaurants.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: A young lifeguard was killed, and seven other people, including three other lifeguards, were injured when lightning struck a Jersey Shore beach Monday afternoon, authorities said. It marked the second death of a young lifeguard at the Jersey Shore in a little over a week. Ocean County Sheriff Michael Mastronardy said the others were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. “Our hearts are with the family and friends of the young lifeguard killed by today’s horrific lightning strike on the beach in Berkeley Township, and we pray for a full recovery for those injured,” Gov. Phil Murphy wrote on Twitter. “I’ve spoken to Mayor Carmen Amato and offered the full support and assistance of our administration during this difficult time.” Amato said his township’s beaches will be closed Tuesday through Thursday as crisis counselors are made available to beach staff and lifeguards. Four of those struck were lifeguards, and four others were beachgoers. “This is a tragic and heartbreaking day for our town and the entire Jersey Shore,” Amato said in a statement. “This young person was out there every day protecting the lives of others. Our lifeguard teams, like so many along the shore, develop special connections with our community throughout the summer, which makes this loss even greater.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest electric provider wants to transfer its share of a coal-fired power plant to an energy company backed by the Navajo Nation, but environmentalists argue that approving the deal would prolong the life of the plant and run counter to New Mexico’s renewable energy goals. The state Public Regulation Commission will determine whether Public Service Co. of New Mexico’s plan for Four Corners Power Plant is in the public interest during a two-week hearing that began Tuesday. It heard from the public Monday. Some of those who spoke at the virtual meeting Monday choked back tears when talking about pollution emitted by the plant over the decades, while others spoke about how their jobs at the power plant and coal mine helped to put their children through college. Some tribal members told regulators that all levels of Navajo leadership are behind the proposal. They said allowing the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. to take over the utility’s stake in Four Corners would provide more time for the tribe to find ways to deal with significant economic consequences that will come when the plant closes in 2031. If regulators don’t approve PNM’s plan, the Navajo Nation could lose up to $60 million annually, said LoRenzo Bates, former speaker of the Navajo Nation Council.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Resigning from office probably didn’t end former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s legal problems, and no matter what happens next, taxpayers are likely to wind up with a hefty bill. The state has already agreed to pay up to $9.5 million to lawyers representing and investigating Cuomo and his administration over sexual harassment allegations and other matters, according to a review of available contracts. That figure represents the maximum amount that could be spent, not actual bills submitted so far. It doesn’t include the legal fees of Cuomo’s private attorney, whose bills are being paid by his campaign committee. His successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, can decide whether the state will continue to pay lawyers to defend Cuomo and his administration going forward. Cuomo and the administration face the possibility of civil lawsuits from women who have accused the Democrat of sexual harassment. The state attorney general is looking into Cuomo’s use of state employees to help with a book he wrote. Federal prosecutors are investigating his administration’s handling of nursing home death data. He’s also facing a state ethics commission inquiry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a bill Monday that would do away with the permit someone must obtain from a county sheriff before buying a pistol, turning back a key agenda item of conservative gun rights supporters. Cooper’s veto was expected, and an override will be difficult for Republicans who control the General Assembly, since they lack veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. Only two Democrats – both in the House – voted for doing away with the pistol purchase permitting system, which goes back more than 100 years. Cooper supports more gun-sale restrictions, not less, and his office expressed his opposition to the bill the day after the final legislative vote this month. “Gun permit laws reduce gun homicides and suicides and reduce the availability of guns for criminal activity,” Cooper said in a news release Monday. “At a time of rising gun violence, we cannot afford to repeal a system that works to save lives. The legislature should focus on combating gun violence instead of making it easier for guns to end up in the wrong hands.” Bill supporters said the current process has become duplicative with the comprehensive national checks that licensed gun dealers must conduct. The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association backed the repeal this year after opposing it previously.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit by the state of Missouri seeking to stop a project that would supply Missouri River water to central North Dakota. The Bismarck Tribune reports the ruling will enable the federal Bureau of Reclamation to move ahead with a water service contract for the Central North Dakota Water Supply Project. The project will receive water from the McClusky Canal for systems in Burleigh, Sheridan, Wells, Foster, Kidder, McLean and Stutsman counties. The Missouri suit alleged violations of federal policy, including failure by project developers to properly study the project’s environmental impacts and its alternatives. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey ruled against Missouri on all counts. The state of Missouri “doesn’t like any depletion from the Missouri River,” said Merri Mooridian, deputy manager of the Red River Valley Water Supply Program, which will move Missouri River water by underground pipeline from Washburn east to supply systems in the east and central parts of the state. The Central North Dakota Water Supply Project will use the same pipeline, taking nearly 13 million gallons a day. “The state of North Dakota has the right to flows of the Missouri River in the state of North Dakota,” Mooridian said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Common Pleas judge has rescinded his order that a man sentenced for a felony drug charge get vaccinated against COVID-19 within two months as a condition of his probation. Speaking at a hearing Tuesday, Judge Christopher Wagner told Brandon Rutherford that it’s not a judge’s role to make decisions for him or “teach you to be a better person.” The reversal came nearly a month after Wagner had sentenced Rutherford. At the time, Wagner told Rutherford he presumed he hadn’t been vaccinated because he was wearing a mask in court, which Rutherford confirmed, telling the judge he wasn’t worried about the vaccine. Neither Rutherford nor his attorney, Carl Lewis, objected to the vaccination order during the sentencing, but soon afterward Rutherford expressed concerns about the directive. Lewis said Tuesday that his 21-year-old client has concerns about the vaccine and will not get it within two months. Lewis had argued that a judge doesn’t have the power or authority to order someone to be inoculated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A bill approved by the Republican-led Legislature this year that seeks to crack down on protesters is unconstitutional and would chill the ability of groups to mobilize people to advocate for racial justice, a civil rights group argues in a federal lawsuit filed Monday. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP filed the lawsuit in federal court in Oklahoma City, along with the national NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center. The lawsuit argues the law, which takes effect Nov. 1, was written to discourage peaceful demonstrations and violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantee the right of the public to peacefully assemble and give citizens equal protection under the law. The new law increases the penalties for blocking roadways, grants motorists civil and criminal immunity if they kill or injure someone while fleeing from a riot, and authorizes hefty fines for national organizations that coordinate with those found guilty of committing crimes under the state’s rioting statutes.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: City employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 – or obtain a medical or religious exemption – by the middle of October, or they will be fired. “With COVID-19 filling hospitals and claiming lives, we must do everything within our power to end this pandemic and restore our community’s health,” Mayor Ted Wheeler and all four City Commissioners wrote Monday in a letter to municipal workers. The city will require its approximately 6,800 employees to submit proof of vaccination, show they are in the process of being vaccinated, or apply for an exemption by Sept. 10 and be fully vaccinated or granted an exemption by Oct. 18. Those who fail to meet the deadline “will be put on a list for separation from employment,” according to the letter. The city plans to provide a comprehensive outline of the new policy later this week and to answer whatever questions municipal workers might have. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that earlier this month, Multnomah County imposed a vaccine mandate on its employees, and Gov. Kate Brown has announced similar requirements for all teachers, health care workers and state employees across Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Masks will be required in all public and private schools, as well as child care facilities, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday, reversing course amid a statewide COVID-19 resurgence that is filling hospital beds just as students return to class. The Department of Health order will take effect Tuesday, Sept. 7 – a week or more after the start of school in many districts – and will require students, teachers and staff to wear masks when inside, regardless of vaccination status, the Wolf administration said. The order will not apply to student-athletes while they’re playing, nor to outdoor activities. “Wearing a mask in school is necessary to keep our children in the classroom and to keep COVID out of that classroom,” Wolf said at a news conference Tuesday. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association said the decision on masking should have been left to local school officials, but it would nevertheless remind school districts “of their legal obligation related to the directive.” Less than a month ago, Wolf had ruled out a statewide mask mandate for schools after requiring them last year. But the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has changed the administration’s calculus about what is needed to keep students in class.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The union that represents nurses at the state’s only Level 1 trauma hospital is calling on its parent company to increase the pay of nurses who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The United Nurses and Allied Professionals union on Tuesday delivered a petition with more than 2,000 signatures to Lifespan Corp., which operates Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Lifespan, the state’s largest health care organization, has already increased compensation for nurses at some of its other hospitals. “We provide a critical component of patient care in Rhode Island, yet during this unprecedented health crisis, Lifespan seems to have forgotten about us,” Frank Sims, a Rhode Island Hospital nurse and union president, said in a statement. “While the nurses at Miriam Hospital and Newport Hospital are being recognized for their front line service with appropriate compensation increases during this crisis, Lifespan has refused to do the same for Rhode Island Hospital nurses.” A Lifespan spokesperson said the system provides nurses with “highly competitive wage and benefits packages.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A private college is allowing men to live on campus for the first time since it was founded 167 years ago. About 45 men moved into a dorm set aside for them at Columbia College this month, media outlets report. College officials said last year that they decided to bring men to what had been an all-women college because enrollment had fallen 25% in the past decade. “Most women now are looking for a co-educational experience. Also, we really believe the opportunity that we provide and the environment we have is a good one for men to grow. And so it’s expanding our outreach to men of course but also to a broader group of women,” said Columbia College President Tom Bogart, who took over as leader of the school in October. Jordan Wright was one of the first men to move into the Columbia College dorms. “I feel like it’s a good experience,” Wright said. “It’s a new beginning and new blessings. I know it’s a little different now, but I feel like everything is still going to go good with the boys and girls, even though it’s a new thing.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday that she has activated nine soldiers from the state National Guard to help with coronavirus testing in the western part of the state amid a surge of infections. “This past week, I had conversations with all three South Dakota hospital systems and asked them what they needed as cases start to rise again,” she said in a statement. “Monument asked for the National Guard to assist them in their testing efforts, and we are happy to help.” Over the past two weeks, the average number of infections has tripled statewide. The western part of the state has been the hardest-hit, with Meade County, which hosted the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally earlier this month, leading the state in new cases per capita. The Department of Health reported last week that it had traced 63 cases among rallygoers. Meanwhile, COVID-19 hospitalizations statewide reached 216 – the largest number since January. Two deaths were also reported Tuesday, bringing the total death toll of people with COVID-19 in the state to 2,069. The health department said Pennington County had more than twice as many new COVID-19 cases in the prior day than any other county in the state. Noem activated the National Guard last year to prepare field hospitals for a surge in patients, but the hospitals were not utilized.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that notoriously blocked a federal dam project in the state decades ago, should no longer be on the endangered species list, federal officials announced Tuesday. Arguing that the fish is no longer in danger of extinction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has begun the process to delist the species, a move backed by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that has favored lifting protections for the fish since 2019. “Thanks to the persistence of many people, the extinction of the snail darter was ultimately avoided, and today we can celebrate its recovery,” said Zygmunt Plater, the attorney who wrote the citizens’ petition to save the snail darter in 1975. Snail darters, a member of the perch family, grow up to 3.5 inches long and mostly eat freshwater snails. Shortly after the passage of the landmark 1973 Endangered Species Act, construction of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Tellico Dam in eastern Tennessee threatened the habitat of the newly discovered fish, located just above the site of the project. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, marking the first time the nation’s highest court took up an ESA case. In 1978, the court ruled in favor of protections for the fish and halted work on the nearly completed dam. Congress later exempted the dam from the law to allow the project to be completed. But the TVA worked to transplant the snail darter to other rivers and streams.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The GOP-controlled Legislature passed a broad overhaul of the state’s election laws Tuesday, tightening already strict voting rules and dealing a bruising defeat to Democrats who waged a months­long fight over what they argued was a brazen attempt to disenfranchise minorities and other Democratic-leaning voters. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he will sign the bill, the latest in a national GOP campaign to add new hurdles to voting in the name of security, spurred in part by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election. Texas Democrats fought the legislation for months, arguing the bill was tailored to make it harder for young people, racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities – all Democratic-leaning voters – to cast ballots, just as they see the demographics shifting to favor their party. The bill specifically targets Democratic strongholds, including Houston’s Harris County, further tightening rules in a state already considered among the hardest places to cast a ballot. The legislation set off a heated summer in Texas of walkouts by Democrats, Republicans threatening them with arrest, Abbott vetoing the paychecks of thousands of rank-and-file staffers when the bill failed to reach him sooner, and accusations of racism and voter suppression. Even the final vote did not escape a parting round of confrontation after Senate Republicans, at the last minute, scuttled one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement: efforts to shield voters with felony convictions from prosecution if they did not realize they were ineligible to cast a ballot. It had been included following backlash over the arrests of two Texas voters, both of whom are Black.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox cast doubt on the efficacy of mask-wearing Tuesday as health leaders made some of their most impassioned pleas yet for Utahns to mask up and get vaccinated. Cox, a Republican, said his administration is encouraging people to wear masks but said it is unclear whether they are effective against the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. “Masks are not as effective as most of the pro-mask crowd are arguing,” Cox told reporters at a news conference. “We know that they’re just not.” Cox offered no specific evidence to support his assertion, and his comments contradicted public health experts, as well as statements Utah’s state epidemiologist Dr. Michelle Hofmann made a few minutes earlier at the same news conference. State hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to prevent the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. “There will be enduring harm to our children and generations to come if we do not stop the divisiveness around the things we know work like masks and vaccines,” Hofmann said. “We know the path to healing is the end of this pandemic, and it hasn’t ended yet even if we want to pretend it has.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Nearly all arriving students at the University of Vermont have been vaccinated against COVID-19. UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials are still working with fewer than 100 students to bring them into compliance with the school’s inoculation requirement. Earlier this month UVM reinstituted an indoor mask mandate for all faculty, staff, students and visitors on the Burlington campus. The exact size of this year’s school enrollment won’t be known for several weeks, but it’s expected to be more than 13,000. The incoming freshman class is expected to have about 3,000 students. “In wonderful news for the years ahead, an extraordinary new class of Catamounts have joined us this fall – with more than 25,000 applications for admission, the incoming class is on track to being the best academically prepared and the largest we’ve ever welcomed!” President Suresh Garimella said in a message to the student body. Students at colleges and universities across Vermont are returning for the fall semester amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, this time driven by the more transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam granted posthumous pardons Tuesday to seven Black men who were executed in 1951 for the rape of a white woman, in a case that attracted pleas for mercy from around the world and in recent years has been denounced as an example of racial disparity in the use of the death penalty. Northam announced the pardons after meeting with about a dozen descendants of the men and their advocates. Cries and sobs could be heard from some of the descendants after Northam’s announcement. The “Martinsville Seven,” as the men became known, were all convicted of raping 32-year-old Ruby Stroud Floyd, a white woman who had gone to a predominantly black neighborhood in Martinsville, Virginia, on Jan. 8, 1949, to collect money for clothes she had sold. Four of the men were executed in Virginia’s electric chair Feb. 2, 1951. Three days later, the remaining three were also electrocuted. All of them were tried by all-white juries. It was the largest group of people executed for a single-victim crime in Virginia’s history. At the time, rape was a capital offense. But Northam said Tuesday that the death penalty for rape was applied almost exclusively to Black people. Northam said the pardons are an acknowledgement that the men did not receive due process and faced racial bias.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The coronavirus pandemic is filling hospitals at an “alarming” rate and continuing to strain health care workers, state health officials said Monday. And for the first time during the pandemic, hospitals are also seeing large numbers of sick pregnant patients, said Dr. Tanya Sorensen, the executive medical director of women’s health at Swedish Health Services. She noted pregnant patients are generally less likely to be inoculated against COVID-19. “We’re seeing ICU admissions, maternal deaths, babies born prematurely either to help the mother breathe or rescue the baby,” she said. “It’s really heartbreaking. … Pregnant women need to be vaccinated.” As of Monday morning, the state’s hospitals and health care centers were treating 1,570 COVID-19 patients, Washington State Hospital Association CEO Cassie Sauer said. Of those, 188 were on ventilators. Eleven days ago, the hospital association had counted 1,240 patients with 152 on ventilators. “It’s an enormous stress on a health care system to have this many patients with a single diagnosis,” she said. “This doesn’t happen. … It’s very, very alarming.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A historic suspension bridge will be undergoing major repairs, but it’s not clear whether the span will reopen to traffic. The West Virginia Division of Highways and Gov. Jim Justice announced Monday that a $17.9 million contract had been awarded to repair and rehabilitate the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, The Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register reports. The project will make repairs on the span’s superstructure and substructure as well as clean, paint, replace damaged suspension cables and renovate lighting, officials said. “It is absolutely fantastic news for the city of Wheeling to know that its most iconic structure, the suspension bridge, is going to be fully repaired and rehabilitated,” Mayor Glenn Elliott said Monday. The future of the historic 1849 bridge was in question after officials closed the span to vehicle traffic in 2019 since motorists repeatedly ignored Division of Highways weight restrictions and warnings on the structure. Multiple overweight vehicles tried to cross it, leading to damage, and it’s unclear whether the repairs will allow the bridge to reopen to traffic. After the contractor begins work on the bridge, crews will determine the extent of the damage, and officials will then determine how the bridge will be used going forward.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: A school district has reversed a decision to leave a federal free meals program following widespread criticism and loud protests from parents and others. Waukesha school board members said they received threats in the wake of national attention after voting to opt out of the program that was providing free breakfast and lunch to all students in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The board voted 5-4 on Monday to reverse course, with parents and others packing the meeting room and two overflow rooms. Board member Karin Rajnicek said after the board’s previous vote to end the free program that it made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Even without the program, Waukesha students from low-income families still would have been able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to extend the Seamless Summer Option during the pandemic to offer free meals year-round has allowed for more coronavirus-safe practices by eliminating the need to collect payments and allowing meals to be served more easily in classrooms or outside.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: More staff than inmates at the state’s men’s prisons have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past month, the Department of Corrections said late last week. Since July 23, the state has reported 43 cases of COVID-19 among staff at the Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlins and the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution in Torrington. A total of 20 inmates in those two facilities tested positive for the virus over the same period of time. “Historically, we’ve had far more positives in our inmate population, as a percentage of the population, than we’ve had for staff,” Wyoming Department of Corrections spokesperson Paul Martin said Wednesday. “I think that trend is changing now.” About 35% of prison employees report being fully vaccinated, compared to 64% of inmates, the agency said. Vaccinations are not required for anyone, Martin told the Casper Star-Tribune, but are offered to employees and inmates. Inmates are still wearing face coverings and social distancing, Martin said. The only facility that did not experience an outbreak during the peak of the pandemic was the Wyoming Women’s Center in Lusk. This month, the women’s prison has reported five cases among staff and 11 among inmates.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/01"}]}

Bush, also discouraged accepting the gift.\n\n“Nothing about getting Air Force One from a foreign government feels right,” Fleischer wrote May 12 on social media. “It shouldn’t pass through foreign hands and it shouldn’t be a gift from a King.

It's less impressive.\"\n\nYet as Trump plans to accept a Boeing 747-8, often dubbed a \"palace in the sky,\" from Qatar's royal family ‒ a $400 million foreign gift that would be the largest ever to a U.S. president ‒ the exterior differences might not jump off the page for the casual flyer.\n\nThe Qatari plane stretches 18 feet 4 inches longer than Air Force One, can carry more weight and fly slightly faster and farther. It's also 22 years newer than Air Force One, built in 1990. Both planes hold about the same number of passengers and have the same height.\n\nBut the Qatari plane separates itself most visibly with its lavish inside amenities ‒ creamy white and tan leather furnishings, rugs and artwork designed by the famed French interior design firm Cabinet Alberto Pinto, according to Bloomberg.\n\nUnable to view our graphics?

(The Air Force operates a second Air Force One jet, also a Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, deployed in 1991.)\n\nTrump's idea is for the Qatari plane to serve as the temporary Air Force One until Boeing finishes building the new versions. The plane would then go to his future presidential library.\n\nDemocrats and other critics of the move argue accepting the plane could violate the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars any U.S. official from accepting “any present” of “any kind whatsoever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state.”\n\nThe White House has countered that the plane is a gift to the U.S. Air Force, not Trump personally.\n\nThe White House has not released information about the Qatari plane that Trump covets. But the news publication Semafor tracked the tail number of the plane when it was parked at Palm Beach International Airport in South Florida this summer. The number matches a Boeing serial number of a plane detailed in a 16-page \"aircraft specification summary\" by the Swiss firm AMAC Aerospace\n\nIt's unclear whether the Qatari plane has undertaken accommodations since the summary was posted in 2023.\n\nHere is a comparison of the Qatari plane versus Air Force One based on publicly available information:\n\nBoeing 747-200B v. Boeing 747-8\n\nAir Force One is a Boeing 747-200B, which has increased fuel capacity and more powerful engines than the standard 747-200. Boeing first started serving the model in 1972.\n\nAir Force One has upgrades from a standard 747-200B that include special electronic and communications equipment, a self-contained baggage loader, front and aft air-stairs and the capability for in-flight refueling.\n\nThe Qatari plane is a Boeing 747-8, a widebody aircraft with lengthened fuselage and redesigned wings, according to Boeing. The model went onto the market in 2011.\n\nAges of planes\n\nThe current Air Force One plane was completed in 1990 and has served six presidents: George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Trump, both in his first and second nonconsecutive terms.\n\nThe Qatari royal family purchased the Boeing 747-B in 2012, the same year it was built. The plane's interior was refurbished and it began service in 2015.\n\nQatari plane can fly farther\n\nIn addition to being longer and a bit taller, the 747-B owned by Qatar also has a wider wing span: 224 feet, 5 inches, compared with Air Force One's 195 feet, 8 inches.\n\nThe Qatari 747-8 can also fly farther without refueling. Air Force One can fly about 7,751 miles without needing to refuel. That's equivalent to a flight west from Washington to Tokyo.\n\nThe 747-B has a maximum take-off weight of 987,000 pounds, compared to 833,000 pounds for Air Force One.\n\nInside the rooms on Air Force One\n\nAir Force One has about 4,000 square feet of interior floor space, according to information from Boeing and the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThat includes an executive suite with quarters for both the president and first lady (equipped with a dressing room, lavatory and shower), a conference and dining room, an office area for senior staff members, an area that can convert into a medical facility, as well as sitting areas for the presidential staff and Secret Service, Air Force crews and traveling members of the media.\n\nAir Force One also contains two galleys that can provide 100 meals at one sitting, advanced multifrequency radios for air-to-air, ground and satellite communications and state-of-the-art navigation, electronic and communications equipment.\n\nThe plane has six passenger lavatories.\n\nInside the Qatari plane\n\nThe interior of the Qatari plane has a more modern design with chic cream white couches, seats and rugs, photos of the plane show.\n\nArtwork from the late American sculptor Alexander Calder is featured throughout, according to Bloomberg, along with custom-made Tai Ping rugs, sycamore and wacapou wood fixtures.\n\nThe layout includes a master bedroom, guest bedroom, a private hallway for the executive residence, an upper deck lounge area with a long leather sofa facing a large flat screen television, additional lounge areas with oversize leather seats, a private office and several galleries.\n\nAmenities include electric window shades, water systems that allow hot and cold water for each sink and shower, a digital entertainment and game system, along with sophisticated sound, television and broadband internet systems.\n\nThe plane has nine lavatories for passengers in addition to one lavatory in the bedroom suite and another in the guest bedroom.\n\nThis story was updated to add new information.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/15/trump-faces-maga-backlash-over-qatari-airplane/83631791007/", "title": "Trump faces MAGA backlash over plan to accept Qatari plane as gift", "text": "WASHINGTON ― Criticism of President Donald Trump's plan to accept a \"palace in the sky\" Boeing 747-8 plane from the Qatar royal family isn't just coming from Democrats and the president's other usual critics.\n\nMAGA loyalist Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has a close relationship with Trump, and conservative commentator Ben Shaprio have publicly opposed the move, in addition to several Republican members of Congress who typically have Trump's back.\n\n\"I trust Qatar like I trust a rest-stop bathroom,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, said in a May 14 interview on Fox News. \"With those guys, trust in God, but tie up your camel.\"\n\nTrump has welcomed a foreign gift he says he would be \"stupid\" not to accept: a $400 million jet from the Qatari government, decked out in chic interior lounge furnishings, that he wants to make the temporary Air Force One while Boeing completes two new Air Force One jets, with an expected 2027 completion time. It would be the largest ever foreign gift to a U.S. president.\n\nBut it could become more difficult for Trump to keep digging in with a MAGA base not thrilled about his idea.\n\n\"I love President Trump. I would take a bullet for him,\" Loomer said in a May 11 post on X. \"But, I have to call a spade a spade. We cannot accept a $400 million 'gift' from jihadists in suits.\"\n\nLoomer has increasingly become a more influential force in Trump's orbit, having helped push Trump's firing of multiple national security officials in April after showing Trump research demonstrating their past disloyalty to the president.\n\nLoomer pointed to Qatar's ties with the militant groups Hamas and Hezbelloh.\n\n\"This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true,\" she said. \"I’m so disappointed.\"\n\nShapiro, host of \"The Ben Shapiro\" radio show co-founder of The Daily Wire, said accepting the plane from Qatar does not represent \"America first,\" which Trump has made his foreign policy catchphrase.\n\n\"Taking sacks of goodies from people who support Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, Al Jazeera, all the rest ‒ that's not America first,\" Shapiro said on his podcast this week. \"It just isn't America first in any conceivable way.\"\n\nShapiro added: \"I think if we switch the names to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, we'd all be freaking out on the right.\"\n\nTrump visited Qatar on May 14 and met with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani as part of a four-day swing to the Middle East, the president's first overseas trip of his second term.\n\nDemocrats, other Trump critics and many ethics experts argue accepting the plane could violate the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars any U.S. official from accepting “any present” of “any kind whatsoever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state.” The White House has countered that the plane is a gift to the U.S. Air Force, not Trump personally − even though it would ultimately go to Trump's future presidential library and he would retain use of it after leaving office.\n\n\"Functionally, this is a gift to him, notwithstanding the rationalizations offered by administration lawyers,\" Norman Eisen, Virginia Canter and Richard W. Painter, who served as ethics counsels in the Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama White Houses, wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\nRepublican friends of Trump aren't making the same constitutional argument, instead focusing their disagreements with security concerns.\n\n\"My concern is his safety,\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, a close Trump ally, told Fox News. \"Qatar supports Hamas. The Hamas leaders live in Qatar, so my concern is the safety of the president. How are we going to know that the plane is safe?\"\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, said the U.S. government should be buying planes from the United States.\n\n\"I think we ought to have a big, beautiful jet, but I'd like it to be made in the United States of America,\" Hawley said in an interview on CNN. \"The U.S. government ought to be buying all of our stuff in the United States of America. That's the route I would go.\"\n\nTrump has complained that Boeing has been too slow to complete a new Air Force One after his first administration in 2018 awarded the company a $3.9 billion contract to build two new Air Force One jets. His idea is to transfer the Qatari plane to his future presidential library after Boeing completes the new planes.\n\nBut if converted to Air Force One, the Qatari plane's inside would have to be entirely stripped, scrubbed for surveillance technology for security reasons and effectively rebuilt, Republicans lawmakers on committees that oversee the nation’s armed services and intelligence agencies told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nPushback from Republicans over Trump's jet plans hasn't been universal.\n\n\"I think the media is making a much bigger deal out of this than it needs to be,\" Rep. Mark Alford, R-Missouri, told CNN. \"This will go through the ethical checks and the legal checks to make sure everything's in order before it happens.\n\n\"Look,\" he added, \"President Trump is frustrated that he's flying around in the 40-year-old plane. He's wanted a new Air Force One.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said it isn't his \"lane\" to weigh in on the matter.\n\n\"My understanding is that it's not a personal gift to the president, it's a gift to the United States,\" Johnson said to reporters May 14. \"Other nations give us gifts all the time.

The committee, which has investigated Trump’s businesses and his lease of the DC property from the government, was provided the records following a years-long court battle that ended in a settlement in September.\n\nWhile it’s been known that foreign delegations stayed at the hotel during Trump’s time in office, the documents – which include spending by China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Malaysia and the UAE – offer the first detailed accounting records of those stays.\n\nTrump’s hotel, which he opened in 2016, became a magnet for Trump loyalists, Republicans and lobbyists hoping to gain access to Trump administration officials. The hotel has long been a source of criticism by Democrats, who accused Trump of violating the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a president from receiving an “emolument,” or profit, from any “King, Prince, or foreign State” unless Congress consents.\n\nThe spending in the records included more than $250,000 by Malaysia, more than $280,000 by Qatar, more than $90,000 by the Saudis and more than $74,000 by the UAE. In addition, lobbyists and other businesses with connections to foreign governments spent tens of thousands more at Trump’s Washington property.\n\nThere’s no evidence that the foreign spending at Trump’s hotel, which the Trump Organization sold earlier this year, directly affected US policy. But many of the hotel stays coincided with significant foreign policy events, including meetings between Trump and other foreign leaders and US efforts to resolve the 2017 Middle Eastern blockade of Qatar.\n\nThe committee sent a letter Monday to the National Archives detailing portions of what was in the partially redacted accounting records and asking for additional presidential records related to Trump’s hotel and the foreign governments “to determine whether former President Trump distorted U.S. foreign policy to serve his own financial interests.”\n\n“These documents sharply call into question the extent to which President Trump was guided by his personal financial interest while in office rather than the best interests of the American people,” House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said in a statement to CNN. “These documents, which the committee continues to obtain from Mazars, will inform our legislative efforts to ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain.”\n\nA spokesperson for the National Archives told CNN that they “are in receipt of the letter and will respond in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.”\n\nThe committee’s disclosure of Trump’s financial documents comes one day before Trump is set to hold a “special announcement” at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where the former president is expected to launch another campaign for the White House in 2024. The former president’s foreign business dealings, as well as those of his immediate family members, have been under scrutiny for years, and that has persisted in the months since he left office.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee began receiving financial documents from Mazars in September after a deal was reached to end litigation over the documents. The committee first subpoenaed Mazars for Trump’s financial records related to his hotel in April 2019.\n\nIt’s not clear what other spending at Trump’s former Washington, DC, hotel from other governments is included in the documents provided to the committee, or how much of foreign spending contributed to the hotel’s overall revenues.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to the embassies of the six countries included in the House Oversight documents.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a Qatari government official disputed the committee’s findings, arguing that the charges listed in the newly released documents were private citizens and not part of the Qatari government.\n\nA committee spokesperson, however, told CNN that “under the Trump Organization’s own internal policies, the stay at the Trump Hotel by members of Qatar’s ruling family would be identified as spending from a foreign government.”\n\nIn response to questions about the foreign spending, Eric Trump said in a statement to CNN: “As a company, we went to tremendous lengths to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, not due to any legal requirement, but because of the respect we have towards the office of the Presidency. We walked away from billions of dollars in new deals, ceased all international expansion, engaged with an outside ethics adviser to review any material transactions and furthermore, have voluntarily donated all profits from foreign government patronage at our properties back to the United States Treasury on an annual basis.”\n\nTrump Hotel spending during Qatar blockade crisis\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates imposed a blockade on their regional competitor Qatar in 2017, all three countries not only publicly lobbied Trump for his support in helping resolve the crisis, but also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the former president’s hotel, the documents provided to CNN show.\n\nThe documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee detail spending at Trump’s hotel by the governments of all three Gulf countries from late 2017 through mid-2018, including large payments to book rooms for senior foreign officials at a time when they were actively seeking the Trump administration’s support in the blockade crisis.\n\nDuring that time, the crisis fueled tensions between then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had been briefed by Saudi and UAE leaders about their governments’ plan to impose a blockade on Qatar one month before they did so.\n\nMaloney specifically noted in her letter to the Archives that both Saudi Arabia and the UAE spent tens of thousands of dollars at the Trump hotel during a critical nine-day span in March 2018.\n\nThe timing of the hotel spending overlaps with Tillerson’s firing on March 13, whom “Saudi and Emirati officials had been reportedly lobbying President Trump to remove for his role in intervening to stop a Saudi invasion of Qatar the previous summer,” Maloney wrote.\n\nEarlier this year, Tillerson testified during the trial of Trump ally Tom Barrack, who prosecutors accused of acting as an unregistered agent of the UAE, that the former president came up with the idea for a Camp David summit between the three countries to resolve the blockade crisis after initially supporting the move.\n\nBarrack was found not guilty. But Tillerson’s testimony provided unique insight into the former president’s personal role in trying to broker a resolution between the three counties after initially supporting the UAE and Saudi governments.\n\nIn this March 20, 2018, file photo, President Donald Trump meets with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office Evan Vucci/AP/File\n\nBetween March 7-14, 2018, the Saudi Defense Ministry spent $85,961, including renting several $10,500-a-night suites that were the most expensive rooms at the Trump hotel, according to Maloney’s letter and the documents obtained by the committee. While the names of the Saudi officials are not included in the documents, two of them are referred to as “His Excellency,” indicating they were members of the royal family or senior government ministers, Maloney added.\n\nSeparately, the Embassy of the UAE Military Delegation spent $34,037, largely on rooms, at the Trump hotel from March 8-16, 2018, the documents show.\n\nDays after Saudi and Emirati officials stayed at the Trump hotel, Trump met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House, where they discussed the situation in Qatar and ramping up US arms sales to the Saudis. During the meeting, Trump praised bin Salman and called Saudi Arabia “a great friend.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, stayed at the hotel.\n\nThe Qatari government also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump hotel starting in late 2017.\n\n“Between January and early March 2018, the Sheikh Al Thani Family, the ruling family of Qatar, booked an extended stay at the Trump Hotel, spending at least $282,037,” Maloney notes in her letter.\n\nTurkish-linked spending during DOJ investigation\n\nThe committee highlighted at least $86,000 in spending by advocacy groups and lobbyists with ties to the Turkish government at the Trump hotel at the time the Justice Department was investigating Halkbank, one of Turkey’s state-owned banks, for evading US sanctions by funneling cash and gold to Iran. Prosecutors had already charged several individuals, including one close to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nCNN reported that Erdogan had urged Trump in a phone call to drop a potential DOJ indictment into Halkbank. Trump told Erdogan he would have his people look into it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Tuesday, May 16, 2017. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nThe investigation into Halkbank was led by the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York. Then-US Attorney General Bill Barr personally spearheaded an effort to negotiate a settlement with the bank that would have allowed it to sidestep an indictment, CNN previously reported.\n\nGeoffrey Berman, the US attorney, insisted on criminal prosecution and later wrote in his memoir about his time as US attorney that he believed Barr was doing Trump’s bidding in pressuring his office to drop charges. Berman was fired eight months later.\n\nOver a period of seven months beginning September 2017, lobbyist and Trump donor Brian Ballard spent $21,209 at the Trump hotel, according to the Maloney letter and committee records. Turkey paid Ballard’s lobbying shop $4.6 million over two years. He also worked for Halkbank as a lobbyist.\n\nBallard, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, told CNN, “Prior to purchasing a residence in Washington in 2018, I stayed at a number of hotels in Washington, including the Trump Hotel, and paid fair market rates for those nights. There is nothing unusual, newsworthy or noteworthy about that fact.”\n\nThe committee said the records show that one day after Ballard checked out, a notation indicates “American-Turkish Council Call In” made an advance deposit for $65,139. The American-Turkish Council, an advocacy group, held two conferences at the Trump property, the committee said.\n\nThe Turkish embassy sponsored two hotel stays around the time of Erdogan’s May 2017 visit to Washington, Maloney wrote in her letter, though it’s unclear from the records how much the embassy spent for those stays.\n\nA prime minister in the presidential suite\n\nThe biggest windfall the hotel received, according to the committee, came during a September 2017 visit by then-Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak, his delegation and lobbyists who stayed at the hotel.\n\nDuring the eight-day visit, Razak and his entourage spent $259,724 in room charges, restaurant bills and other expenses at Trump’s hotel while he was in town to meet with Trump at the White House several blocks away. Razak, who was under Justice Department investigation for allegedly looting Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund of billions of dollars, stayed in the hotel’s presidential suite for $10,000 per night.\n\nLobbyist Elliott Broidy, who was also the deputy vice chair of the Republican National Committee, and an associate stayed at the hotel for four nights during that same period of time, incurring charges of more than $6,000. They previously were involved in – ultimately unsuccessful –efforts to lobby Trump and administration officials to drop the investigation into the sovereign wealth fund.\n\nThe Justice Department brought criminal charges against other individuals in connection with the scheme. Razak was not charged by US authorities, but he was prosecuted by Malaysian authorities for his role in the embezzlement scheme. Broidy and the associate both pleaded guilty to charges related to the secret lobbying effort. Broidy was pardoned by Trump at the end of his presidency.\n\nThe delegation’s expenses far exceeded the average revenue for other nights in September, the committee said, by nearly 2 to 1.\n\nThe accounting records obtained by the committee show that a Chinese Embassy Delegation was charged $19,391 at the Trump Hotel in August 2017, a little more than two months before Trump traveled to Beijing for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump and Xi first met in April 2017 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, and Trump’s relationship with the Chinese leader was among the most crucial for US foreign policy during his presidency.\n\nThis story has been updated with comment from a Qatari government official.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Jeremy Herb Kara Scannell", "Zachary Cohen", "Jeremy Herb", "Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/05/14/trump-middle-east-trip-saudi-arabia-qatar/83595087007/", "title": "Trump tours Mideast.

He named his youngest son \"Barron,\" a rank of nobility, often hereditary − though he added an extra \"r\" for good measure.\n\nHe's added a touch of gold to every White House portrait, fireplace mantel, doorway, carving and coaster in sight.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged a love affair with royal families, particularly the British one, that traces back to his mother, a poor immigrant from Scotland. In his book \"The Art of the Deal,\" Trump recalls her sitting rapt for hours to watch Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.\n\nNow, Trump is in the Middle East, where wealthy Arab monarchies are laying on extravagant, pageantry-filled receptions fit for an admirer of kings.\n\nTrump's Gulf tour: a trip where personal diplomacy and family business intersect\n\nLavender carpet, golden swords\n\nAs Trump flew into Riyadh on May 13, he was afforded a rare escort of Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de factor ruler, greeted him at the airport, where a lavender carpet − a color that celebrates Saudi identity and is reserved for high-profile dignitaries − was rolled out.\n\nAn honor guard lined up with golden swords.\n\nTrump was treated to tours of gilded palaces, cannon salutes and a state dinner. A fleet of Arabian horses with riders carrying flags escorted the Beast, his presidential limousine.\n\nQatar rolled out its own carpet − red this time − for Trump when he landed in Doha a day later, becoming the first American president to visit the energy-rich country since President George W. Bush in 2003. After stepping off Air Force One, Trump was greeted by another monarch, the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Scores of U.S. and Qatari flags lined the streets. They were also placed on boats and attached to horses and camels.\n\n\"We appreciate those camels,\" Trump said.\n\nDeals, a jetliner and lifted Syria sanctions\n\nIn Qatar, Trump will take part in a second glittering state dinner and seek to strike commercial deals. Ahead of his arrival, the Qataris said they were exploring ways to gift him a luxury jetliner worth an estimated $400 million.\n\nAs Trump visits some of the world's richest countries, he appears to be having a good time.\n\n\"I really believe we like each other a lot,\" he said of the crown prince as they luxuriated on golden chairs under intricate chandeliers in the Saudi royal palace.\n\nA Qatari gift: Trump in talks to accept luxury jet\n\nTrump is chasing major trade deals in the Gulf. During a speech later in the day at a Riyadh investment conference, he described Crown Prince Mohammed as an \"incredible man\" and \"great guy.\"\n\nThe feeling appeared to be mutual. When Trump pledged to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, the crown prince placed his hands over his heart and led a standing ovation.\n\n\"Oh, what I do for the crown prince,\" Trump said.\n\n'Give them a chance at greatness': Trump will end US sanctions on Syria\n\nTrump and the royals, a fascination\n\nDouglas Brinkley, an author and professor of history at Rice University, has noted that Trump is \"always very impressed by monarchy.\" And Michael D’Antonio, who wrote \"The Truth About Trump,\" a 2016 biography, has noted that throughout his life, Trump has expressed a desire to be close to, and possibly on an equal footing with, royal families − especially the British one, and especially its late monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\"This is more important than any piece of legislation he could get through Congress, greater than resolving problems at the border with Mexico,\" D’Antonio said in a 2019 interview. \"I would think one of his dying thoughts will be of this. When he is about to leave this Earth, he will think, 'I was that person, standing with the queen.'\"\n\n(Trump met Queen Elizabeth II twice during his first presidency. In 2018, they watched a military parade and had tea at Windsor Castle. In 2019, during a state visit, she held a banquet for him at Buckingham Palace. A biography by the British author Craig Brown, published after her death, alleged the queen found Trump \"very rude.\" Trump disputed that. \"Totally false,\" he told a British newspaper. \"She liked me and I liked her.\")\n\nStill, Christopher Henzel, who served as charge d'affaires for the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia from 2017-2019 said he didn't \"really see\" in Trump a preoccupation with Middle Eastern monarchies.\n\n\"All U.S. presidents recognize Saudi Arabia is a very important partner if you're going to get anything done in the Middle East,\" he said. \"It's not about whether you like them, are fascinated by them, or don't like them. You have to deal with them. Saudi Arabia's got a huge GDP. It's a diplomatic power. It's got religious credentials.\"\n\nHenzel added that state visits are \"meant to be impressive\" and that the Saudis are \"famous for completely over-the-top lavish events.\" He said this is something other Gulf states − Trump is also visiting the United Arab Emirates on his regional jaunt − have sometimes tried to \"copy and even outdo.\"\n\nTrump's coveted 'palace in the sky': How Air Force One stacks up to the Qatari 747\n\nAmong the pomp, Trump briefly joined a traditional male-only sword dance during his 2017 visit. \"I was there for that. I could tell he was genuinely enjoying it,\" Henzel said.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Qatar bring the glitz\n\nBrett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement at the Obama White House, said the royal treatment Trump is receiving in the Gulf helps \"paper over some of the more delicate areas in our relationship, from human rights to their deals with China.\"\n\nOne problem, Bruen said, is that Trump \"seems so mesmerized by the glitz and glamor, he forgets to stay focused on our agenda and falls into fawning over the show they put on for him.\"\n\nHenzel, the former diplomat, disagreed.\n\nHe said Trump understood the Saudi relationship, contrasting Trump with former President Joe Biden, who vowed while campaigning in 2019 to make a \"pariah\" out of the kingdom for its human rights record, in particular, for the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded the crown prince authorized Khashoggi's killing. Within a year of winning the White House, Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia to push the kingdom to increase oil production amid soaring prices.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nWhere Trump and Arab monarchies align\n\nAli al-Ahmed, a Saudi-born founder of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said the leaders of Arab monarchies have a \"mindset that favors showing off.\"\n\nHe said he believes Trump shares this habit.\n\n\"If you look at his homes, they are gilded,\" Al-Ahmed said, referring to the White House and Trump's opulent, 128-room Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, which features Florentine frescoes and Venetian arches.\n\nTrump met with the Emir of Qatar in an incense-scented ceremonial room at Doha's Lusail Palace.

Come on out on Friday, Saturday or Sunday to watch the great play by the best players!”\n\nTrump is benefitting from his professional relationship with LIV Golf, especially after officials at PGA of America pulled the 2022 PGA Championship from Bedminster following the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. In October, LIV Golf will hold its final competition of the year at another Trump property, Trump National Doral in South Florida.\n\nBut while activists, media outlets and others have expressed concerns that LIV Golf provides international legitimacy to the ruling regime in Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of human rights violations for years, Trump has brushed aside such criticisms.\n\nDuring an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, he spoke approvingly about how the golf tour, which is financed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, has already improved the kingdom’s reputation.\n\n“I think LIV has been a great thing for Saudi Arabia, for the image of Saudi Arabia,” Trump told the Journal.\n\nA spokesman for Trump did not respond to questions from CNN.\n\nHuman rights groups and media organizations have questioned both LIV Golf’s organizers and players over the tour’s connection to Saudi Arabia. Several of those questions have centered around the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nA US intelligence report released last year determined that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation to capture or kill the Saudi journalist, confirming reports soon after the murder that the CIA had made the same conclusion. During his presidency, however, Trump publicly downplayed allegations that bin Salman was involved as his administration strengthened US ties with the Saudis.\n\nBut LIV Golf’s event at Bedminster has also raised the ire of some survivors and families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Speaking on Tuesday at a press conference near Bedminster, Terry Strada, chair of 9/11 Families United, said the group was “appalled” by the “offensive, disrespectful and hurtful” tournament at Trump’s club, which is just 50 miles from the site of the 2001 New York attack. Strada said she was “very disappointed” in Trump, but noted that he was not the main target of the group’s criticism.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN at his club Thursday, Trump reiterated that he has been “friends” with people in Saudi Arabia for a “long time.”\n\n“Frankly, what they’re doing for golf is so great. What they’re doing for the players is so great,” the former President said.\n\nAsked what he would say to the families of 9/11 victims who are protesting the LIV Golf event, Trump appeared to question whether there was knowledge of the Saudi involvement in the terrorist attacks.\n\n“Nobody’s gotten to the bottom of 9/11, unfortunately, and they should have, as to the maniacs that did that horrible thing to our city, to our country, to the world,” he said. “So nobody’s really been there. But I can tell you that there are a lot of really great people that are out here today.”\n\nFollowing Trump’s remarks, Strada told CNN that the former President “knows full well it was the Kingdom. He did everything in his power to protect the kingdom while in office by reneging on a promise he made to 9/11 families he would declassify FBI reports re: Saudis involvement in 9/11.”\n\nThe new circuit has drawn criticism from the PGA Tour, which has suspended players who have signed on with LIV Golf, as well as from some of golf’s biggest stars, including Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. The allure of LIV Golf for the sport’s top athletes – including larger purses and guaranteed payouts – threatens the PGA Tour’s dominance and seems to have caught the legacy organization off guard.\n\nTrump himself seems to be relishing the damage to the PGA Tour, with which he’s had a rocky relationship. While his clubs have hosted events for the PGA and other professional golf events in the past, the PGA Tour has not held an event at a Trump property since a March 2016 tournament at Doral. And after stripping Bedminster of the 2022 PGA Championship, the organization has been squarely in Trump’s sights.\n\n“All of those golfers that remain ‘loyal’ to the very disloyal PGA, in all of its different forms, will pay a big price when the inevitable MERGER with LIV comes, and you get nothing but a big ‘thank you’ from PGA officials who are making Millions of Dollars a year,” Trump wrote last week in a post on Truth Social. “If you don’t take the money now, you will get nothing after the merger takes place, and only say how smart the original signees were.”\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has spoken out about professional sports since entering politics. During his presidency, he frequently criticized the National Football League for allowing players to protest during the national anthem. And last year, Trump joined other Republicans in calling on Americans to boycott Major League Baseball after the league moved its All-Star Game from Atlanta following a new Georgia election law.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Michael Warren"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/05/12/trump-middle-east-trip-business-diplomacy/83529240007/", "title": "Trump tours Middle East with eye on business and diplomacy", "text": "Trump is traveling to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\n\nThe Trump administration wants investment for the United States from the Middle East.\n\nThe president left Washington shortly after American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander was freed by Hamas after 19 months in captivity.\n\nLONDON − It won't be his first ceremonial sword dance.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who arrived in Saudi Arabia for the start of three days of summits among wealthy Persian Gulf rulers, first traveled to the region in 2017 where, in an ornate, Mar-a-Lago-style ballroom in the Saudi capital, he promised \"partnership, based on shared interests and values.\" Ahead of a state dinner, he swayed to the \"ardah,\" a traditional performance combining dance, poetry and swordplay.\n\nNow Trump is back in the Middle East, blending business and diplomacy from May 13 to 16. In addition to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, he will visit Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and Doha, Qatar.\n\n\"What Trump really wants to get out of this trip is success,\" said Frank Lowenstein, a former Middle East envoy in the Obama administration.\n\n\"He wants to make big announcements, especially those that he can say are benefiting the American public, but also to the extent possible that are consistent with his agenda and his narrative, which is, 'I end foreign wars and I get hostages home,'\" Lowenstein said.\n\nDeals and diplomacy\n\nTrump is again diverging from U.S. presidential habit by choosing the Middle East, not Canada or Mexico, for the first foreign trip of his second term. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is returning eight years after his first-term trip for \"commerce and cultural exchanges.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar are three of the world's richest nations and they invest deeply in military and security technologies. Saudi Arabia has already pledged to invest $600 billion in American companies. In March, Trump said he wanted the petro-kingdom to commit to $1 trillion. All three countries serve as intermediaries in conflicts from Gaza to Ukraine.\n\nOn the day of Trump's departure, Hamas released U.S.-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, believed to be the last living American captive in Gaza. Hamas said his release was part of efforts to reach a fresh ceasefire in the war that began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas forces rampaged across southern Israel. Israel has yet to commit to a new ceasefire.\n\nAbraham Accords expanded?\n\nIn his first term, Trump brokered a series of landmark deals, known as the Abraham Accords, under which Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco for the first time recognized Israel. The goal was to provide economic incentives for peace. But the accords barely mentioned Palestinians and their desire for a future state, one of several factors that prevented Saudi Arabia from signing on.\n\nSaudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has insisted there can be no Saudi normalization until Tel Aviv halts its military campaign in Gaza.\n\nHowever, Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told an audience at the Israeli Embassy in Washington on May 5 that he expected progress in expanding the Abraham Accords. \"We think we will have some or a lot of announcements very, very shortly, which we hope will yield progress by next year,\" Witkoff said in a video of his speech.\n\nKeeping business and global affairs separate\n\nStill, some experts say Trump's visit is in danger of blurring business and politics.\n\n\"It's hard to know what the main mission will be,\" said Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. \"Part of the problem is that with Trump the personal and geopolitical are all intertwined. He's doing business, partly on behalf of the U.S., partly on what looks like his own behalf.\"\n\nTrump Organization: Dubai tower signals growth in the Gulf region\n\nIn fact, all three stops on Trump's Middle East tour are places where he and his family have major business interests.\n\nIn recent weeks, the president's sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., who now run The Trump Organization, the holding company for Trump's personal business ventures and investments, visited the UAE and Qatar to preside over deals involving family real estate and cryptocurrency ventures.\n\nIn late April, Dar Global, a London-based Saudi Arabian real-estate developer with close ties to the kingdom's royal family, and The Trump Organization, announced a new luxury hotel in Dubai. Dar Global and The Trump Organization are also pairing up to build a second high-end residential tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Trump family firm recently struck a deal to a build an 18-hole golf course and resort in Qatar that will feature Trump-branded beachside villas.\n\nFor this, it's partnering with Qatari Diar, a firm owned by Qatar's government. In the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, a government-backed investment firm recently made a $2 billion investment in a crypto business deal that could serve as a major boost for the Trump family crypto venture World Liberty Financial, according to Zach Witkoff, its cofounder and the son of Trump's Middle East envoy.\n\nIn recent days Trump has defended the idea of possibly accepting the gift of a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar for use as Air Force One.\n\nTrita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington think tank, said it was no surprise Trump chose to visit wealthy Gulf allies.\n\n\"These are the three countries you would choose to visit in the region whether your name is Trump or not, whether you have businesses there or not,\" said Parsi, who noted Trump recently built a golf course in nearby Oman, a country he is not visiting and that's hosting nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nThe Trump Organization didn't return a request for comment.\n\n\"It’s frankly ridiculous anyone in this room would suggest President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit. He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service,\" said Leavitt, the White House press secretary.\n\nGreg Swenson, an investment banker who chairs the United Kingdom-based chapter of Republicans Overseas, said Trump should avoid blurring personal business and diplomacy.\n\n\"The Saudis and Emiratis are our friends. They also have boatloads of money,\" he said.\n\n\"But you don't want to bridge that fine line of influence-peddling,\" Swenson added, noting that former President Joe Biden's son Hunter was involved in overseas business deals.\n\nA detained American in Saudi Arabia\n\nOne person hoping to profit − not economically − from Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia is Saad Ibrahim Almadi, a 75-year-old dual U.S.-Saudi citizen. He was arrested in Riyadh in November 2021 when he arrived for a family visit.\n\nAlmadi was found guilty of seeking to \"destabilize\" the kingdom, based on a series of now-deleted social media posts he sent that raised concerns about poverty and the demolition of old parts of the cities of Mecca and Jeddah.\n\nThe posts also referenced the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was ambushed, strangled and dismembered by a 15-member squad of Saudi government operatives inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018.\n\nTrump brushed aside the grisly killing of Khashoggi in his first term. Almadi's son, Ibrahim, is hoping his father, who spent a year in a Saudi jail and has since been banned from leaving the country, won't face a similar fate. He has appealed to Trump via Speaker Mike Johnson to help get his father home.\n\n\"He fears that every knock on the door is someone coming to take him back to prison,\" Ibrahim, who lives in Florida, said of his father.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/13/us/police-officers-line-of-duty-deaths", "title": "Intentional killings of law enforcement officers reaches 20-year high ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLast year saw the highest number of law enforcement officers who were intentionally killed in the line of duty since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, an increase that comes as a rise in gun violence and homicides continues across the country.\n\nAccording to preliminary year-end data provided to CNN by the FBI, 73 officers died in felonious killings in the line of duty in 2021. The year marks the highest total recorded by the agency since 1995, excluding the 9/11 attacks.\n\nGunfire has consistently been the leading cause of felonious officer deaths each year – and 2021 was no different. The FBI has not released its full end-of-year breakdown but reported that 55 officers were killed by gunfire in 2021 through the end of November, up from 39 in the same time frame in both 2020 and 2019.\n\nHomicides rose in 2020, a year marked by a global pandemic and the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and subsequent unrest. In its 2020 UCR report, the FBI noted that an increasing number of homicides were committed with a gun. For many cities, the elevated rates of homicide continued into 2021.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the country’s 40 most populous cities saw more homicides last year than in 2020, according to a CNN analysis of police department data, and 10 of those cities recorded more homicides in 2021 than any other year on record.\n\n“When homicides go up, more shootings go up, and it contributes to an overall increase in violence and police officers find themselves in the middle of that environment,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF).\n\nCovid-19 still the leading cause of officer deaths\n\nMaria Haberfeld, chair of the Department of Law, Police Sciences, and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College, who has analyzed data on police deaths in the line of duty, says that a rise in violence against police officers is a phenomenon that happens “every few years” because of an event that serves as a catalyst.\n\nTypically, she said, the uptick is tied to a high-profile case in which an officer or department is accused of misconduct and then that “spills over to all the other police officers around the country.”\n\nThe 73 felonious deaths reported by the FBI are a 59% increase from 2020’s total of 46, breaking the previous high of 72 felonious killings in 2011. According to the FBI, at least eight police officers also lost their lives in premeditated, ambush-style attacks last year.\n\nThe FBI classifies a death as a “felonious killing” when an officer is “fatally injured as a direct result of a willful and intentional act by an offender.” Separately, 56 officers were killed accidentally while in the line of duty last year, up from 46 in 2020.\n\nFelonious killings were not the No. 1 cause of death for law enforcement officers in 2021: For the second year in a row, that was Covid-19. According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a non-profit dedicated to memorializing fallen officers, the total number of officers who died in the line of duty in 2021 was the highest on record, driven by Covid-19. The group reported 336 Covid-19 deaths among line-of-duty officers in 2021, a 32% increase from the 254 officers who died from Covid-19 in 2020.\n\n“As tragic as this is to see this increase in felonious assaults against police officers, more officers will die of Covid than will be stabbed, shot, or die in traffic accidents and many of those deaths are preventable,” said Wexler of PERF, a national police research and policy organization that advises police leaders on best practices.\n\nA placard displayed during a protest march on April 12, 2021, in Philadelphia states \"ABOLISH POLICE.\" Mark Makela/Getty Images\n\nThere was an increase in ‘unprovoked’ attacks\n\nIn late 2021, two Bradley, Illinois, police officers were shot while responding to a call about dogs barking in a hotel parking lot – Sgt. Marlene R. Rittmanic died from her injuries and Officer Tyler J. Bailey was hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nIn Baltimore, Officer Keona Holley died last month after being shot while sitting in her patrol car. Two suspects were charged with attempted murder in the shooting of Holley after they confessed to the crime, but their motive remains unclear, said Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison.\n\nAmong felonious deaths of officers last year, 25 were killed in “unprovoked” attacks through December 27 of last year, according to the FBI. It’s a marked increase from previous years, which usually see the number of officers killed in unprovoked attacks in the low single-digits. In 2020, just two officers were killed in this manner.\n\nThe FBI told CNN that they are currently conducting an analysis on this sharp rise in reports of unprovoked attacks, which they say are not concentrated in any one region of the country.\n\nThe FBI’s Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) data collection program refers to an ambush as an “entrapment and premeditated” attack, while unprovoked is classified as an attack “not prompted by official contact at the time of the incident,” according to the agency.\n\nAccording to Christopher Herrmann, an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, while the significant increase in unprovoked and ambush attacks last year may indicate that police officers are at a higher risk than previous years, there is also disagreement among law enforcement about when such terms should be used. A lack of a universally accepted definition can lead to difficulties in studying ambushes and developing training and operational practices based on “lessons learned from past ambush responses,” he added.\n\nIt’s not yet clear if the Bradley, Illinois, shooting, or Holley’s death would be classified as an unprovoked attack or an ambush by the FBI.\n\nHerrmann said the lack of a clear definition for both terms has significant consequences, as law enforcement “may have difficulty articulating the nature of the threat, making it hard for agencies to train officers to recognize and respond appropriately to ambush situations.”\n\nBaltimore police Officer Keona Holley and Bradley, Illinois, police Sgt. Marlene R. Rittmanic were two of the dozens of officers intentionally killed in the line of duty in 2021. ODMP\n\nLow confidence and a climate of animosity\n\nIn the wake of protest movements following the killings of Black Americans by police, confidence in US police dropped to record lows, according to a report released by Gallup in August 2020. The polling group reported in 2021 that some of these perceptions have slightly rebounded, but stark racial and partisan divides remain in how Americans view the police. Confidence among both Black and White adults in police remains lower than they were before the killing of Floyd.\n\nWhether there’s a connection between low police confidence and heightened animosity to officer killings is not clear, but Haberfeld says that coverage of anti-police sentiment has been more sustained than in previous years.\n\n“There is an overall climate now that is very anti-police, which adds a different angle to what used to happen periodically to police in the past years,” she told CNN. “The anti-police climate would surge after a high-profile case, and usually after a month or so it would subside. But right now, we’re talking about over a year of high-profile, anti-police coverage.”\n\nHerrmann of John Jay said there isn’t an easy fix to the animosity toward police officers.\n\n“Police officers are tasked with rebuilding these relationships with their communities that have been fractured as a result of the Floyd protests and as a result of the over-policing, racial profiling, and high-profile killings of Black people,” Herrmann said.\n\nOfficer ambushes have ‘ripple effect’ in departments\n\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison, left, stands with the family of Keona Holley, a Baltimore police officer who died last month after an ambush attack. Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nOfficer Holley was removed from life support late last month after she was shot while sitting in her patrol car. Commissioner Harrison said in a statement announcing her death that Holley’s “strength, courage and resilience are an inspiration to us all.” In an interview with CNN, Harrison said the officer’s death had an “extremely negative ripple effect” throughout the police department and the community she served.\n\nHarrison said the assailant “apparently walked up somewhere from the rear of the (police) vehicle or alongside the vehicle and began firing into the vehicle, striking our officer.” Holley then accelerated the patrol vehicle and crashed, officials said.\n\n“It’s one negative ripple effect for having been killed in the line of duty, but to have been ambushed while sitting in your car is something totally different,” Harrison said.\n\nHolley’s funeral took place on Tuesday in Baltimore. The Baltimore Sun reported that hundreds of people showed up to pay their respects, including many law enforcement members from out of state.\n\nHarrison said many of his officers had to take time off after Holley’s killing, which added an additional challenge to a department that was grieving but also short staffed. According to the commissioner, his leadership role is to ensure the department can be resilient while in the grieving and mourning process.\n\n“We have to provide resources for our officer wellness program, through our chaplaincy program, to make sure our members are mentally and emotionally and spiritually sound to go back to work and to continue working,” he said.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Priya Krishnakumar", "Emma Tucker", "Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/13"}]}

I can’t say it without smiling, actually. And that feels pretty great.\"\n\n\"I have real joy. It took me 41 years to get here.

Smile a little, at least? Then step aboard. You’re going to enjoy this.\n\nIf not, you may at least enjoy the really good acting from Julianne Moore, Ethan Hawke (they have the above exchange) and the ever-welcome Greta Gerwig, though the self-aware hipster vibe that permeates the film might overwhelm you.\n\nNeed a break?

She’s single but wants to become a mother, something she evidently discusses at length and often with her married friends (Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph, both also quite good). She’s decided to go with a sperm donor — a college classmate who was a math genius but, this being a hipster New York kind of movie, now makes artisanal pickles.\n\nBut then she meets John (Hawke). He teaches at the New School and excels at ficto-critical anthropology (they explain what it is but I’m still fuzzy). He’s smart and sweet-seeming and living in the shadow of his wife, Georgette (Moore), a world-renowned Danish academic as known for her icy demeanor as her brilliance. He’s trying his hand at fiction, and Maggie agrees to read the first chapters of his book. Intellectual-romantic-drama warning bells go off all over the place.\n\nAgain, at some point you have to decide whether these are the kind of characters you want to spend time with, or the kind of characters that are the reason you never wanted to live in New York in the first place.\n\nOnward. John and Georgette have two kids, but he and Maggie fall in love. Soon she doesn’t need a sperm donor; she and John get married and have a daughter of their own. Miller skips ahead a couple of years. The burden of being a parent — to both their daughter and John’s former children — falls heavily on Maggie. John has become a bore, and a boor.\n\nSo Maggie hatches, guess what? A plan. (She always does; it’s fun to see Gerwig play a control freak.) She schemes, with her friends’ help, to get John and Georgette back together again.\n\nReview: ‘Love & Friendship’ a comedy of manners to relish\n\nMiller, who also wrote the story, hasn’t reinvented the wheel, but she’s put a slightly different spin on it. It’s sort of a brainiac version of a screwball comedy. But it wouldn’t work without the performances. Hawke again plays a character chugging along at a slow boil who, every now and then, boils over. Gerwig pretty much defines this genre of movie, so at home is she in them. There is a sweetness to Maggie, as there always is to Gerwig’s characters, but she is also more ambitious in her plans, more adamant about their coming to fruition, than we sometimes see.\n\nBut it’s Moore who really steals the show. Her accent alone is a marvel — I don’t think it’s really Danish, but I like it better than what I imagine that might be. She somehow allows us to see beneath the icy façade without ever quite breaking its surface.\n\nUltimately no one could actually live with any of these characters. They’d drive you nuts. But in short doses, as in “Maggie’s Plan,” it’s nice to have them drop by for a visit.\n\nReview: ‘Me Before You’ cliched, predictable romance\n\n‘Maggie’s Plan’ 3 out of 4 stars\n\nStars: Greta Gerwig, Ethan Hawke, Julianne Moore\n\nDirector: Rebecca Miller\n\nLength: 98 minutes\n\nRated: R for language and some sexuality\n\nWhere:Fandango.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/columns/2024/08/11/worcesters-lois-lane-patiently-awaits-the-return-of-clark-kent/74686329007/", "title": "Worcester's Lois Lane patiently awaits the return of Clark Kent", "text": "WORCESTER — Over the last few weeks, Worcester residents have been beaming with pride, all eyes focused on Stephen Nedoroscik at the Olympics in Paris. The Worcester native on the men's gymnastics team has earned multiple medals for Team USA, but it's his energy and glasses that seem to have stolen the spotlight.\n\nNedoroscik, now nicknamed \"Clark Kent,\" for his thick-framed glasses and superhuman abilities on the pommel horse, has been embracing his new-found fame and super(hero) stardom.\n\nWhile the Superman memes keep coming, it has many fans wondering, Who is his Lois Lane? Nedoroscik is dating Tess McCracken, who has also embraced the Superman/Clark Kent memes and newly found viral fame. In a recent interview with NBC's \"Today\" show, McCracken said people have been calling her Lois Lane, a nickname she said she doesn't mind.\n\nBut did you know there is another Lois Lane \"waiting\" for \"her\" Clark Kent back in Worcester?\n\nThe short private road runs along That's Entertainment at 244 Park Ave. and was renamed in 2012, after the owner of the \"pop culture emporium\" petitioned to change the name of then-Marmon Place.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"It was just like, 'Wouldn't it be cool if we changed the name?' So we started asking customers and they supported the whole idea, which led to a petition and then finally, we had a big ceremony to unveil the sign,\" said Pete Beaudoin, manager at That's Entertainment. \"We really weren't sure how the city was going to respond, but they were all super into it.\"\n\nWorcester Mayor Joe Petty, who has been mayor since 2012, remembers the decision fondly and said while comic books were never his personal passion, Superman holds a special place in his heart as he grew up watching the Kryptonian on television.\n\n\"Worcester has a lot of quirky spots,\" he said. \"This is one of so many. It was great to have been a part of the process to get Lois Lane renamed. I am always amazed by the influence that comic books have on the youth today.\"\n\nThe street sign itself is nearly identical to that of every street sign in Worcester, even showcasing the iconic heart. There is one difference — the sign is the only in the city to have \"Lane\" spelled out, rather than marked by the traditional abbreviation of \"Ln.\"\n\n\"When creating the sign, they spelled out the word 'Lane' and it truly gives spectators the full effect,\" Beaudoin said. \"It's just this little bit of whimsy in Worcester, it's wonderful.\"\n\nLane first appeared in \"Action Comics\" No. 1, in June 1938. She works alongside Clark Kent as a reporter for the Metropolis Daily Planet and has been Superman's primary love interest for more than 80 years.\n\nAccording to DC Comics, she is one of the world's most famous and celebrated reporters and is \"every bit a hero in her own right.\" Throughout her career in between the pages of comic books, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has also been a wife, mother, a costumed vigilante herself and a political activist.\n\nOn the corner of Park Avenue and Lois Lane, the street sign has gone missing several times but has always been \"rescued\" and returned to its rightful place.\n\n\"We were having some construction and one of the workers placed the sign down for a moment and someone scooped it up,\" Beaudoin said. \"It was actually a customer who made it their mission to find the sign, which they did, and it was put back in place.\"\n\nThe shop sells everything from comic books to records, tabletop games and sports memorabilia, and even has a small bumper sticker displaying the now-iconic street sign that reads \"Follow me to Lois Lane.\" Apart from the bumper sticker, Beaudoin said the shop's best seller is a T-shirt that reads \"Worcester: Paris of the Eighties,\" a phrase coined sometime in the 1980s to draw people to Worcester.\n\nNow Nedoroscik is back from Paris, landing in Sarasota, Florida, earlier this week. He is expected to make his way to Worcester at some point, where everyone, including Lois Lane, will welcome him with open arms.\n\nT&G engagement editor Sarah Barnacle is getting to know Central Mass. by exploring some of the best places to go and things to do in Worcester County.

'Deep Blue Sea 3' (2020)\n\nThe proudly B-movie \"Deep Blue Sea\" franchise has a penchant for seriously bonkers shark attacks. This third installment is no different: Tania Raymonde plays the head of a group of video-blogging environmentalists on an artificial island in the Mozambique Channel, and her marine biologist ex (Nathaniel Buzolic) shows up with a goon squad hunting a trio of genetically engineered, crazy-smart bull sharks. (Fun fact: You'll root for the fish.)\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n9. 'Meg 2: The Trench' (2023)\n\nThe first half of this sequel is a dull underwater sci-fi action flick all about folks turning on each other for natural resources and Jason Statham's diver dude saving his trouble-magnetic daughter. Then director Ben Wheatley lets loose with the creature feature we came for, where our hero has to deal with a trio of hungry megalodons, a kaiju-sized octopus and other freaky monsters attacking \"Fun Island,\" a beachy locale that maniacally lives up to its name.\n\n8. 'Jaws 2' (1978)\n\nImagine the pressure of following \"Jaws\" without Steven Spielberg and two of your top actors. But unlike the two sequels that came later, this follow-up wasn't absolute chum. The shark is still crazy destructive – even taking on a helicopter – but what's neat here is the return of Roy Scheider as the police chief who's voted out when the powers-that-be don't believe another beast is in the water, but who saves the day anyway.\n\n7. 'The Meg' (2018)\n\nIt does give you the hand-to-fin combat you want from Jason Statham battling a 75-foot-long prehistoric shark, but getting there is a bit arduous: A bunch of researchers plumb new depths off the coast of Shanghai and accidentally unleash the Meg. It's all pretty corny and earnest until the ginormous shark starts wreaking havoc on ships and people in inner tubes.\n\n6. 'The Reef' (2010)\n\nA bunch of Australian friends (including a pair of lovers) sailing a yacht to Indonesia crash their boat on a coral reef and are stranded in the middle of the ocean. Their only hope is to get to a nearby island, a situation made harder – and much more tense – by a clever great white, noteworthy for being a real shark rather than a CGI one like most films use. Extra points for a headless giant turtle corpse.\n\n5. 'Open Water' (2023)\n\nThis Sundance Film Festival breakout used real sea life to add all-too-realism to its worst-case vacation scenario. A married couple go on a scuba expedition to help their relationship and wind up getting stranded, with jellyfish stinging and sharks circling. It's an unnerving narrative that aims for authentic emotions and some very hard decisions when it comes to survival.\n\n4. 'Under Paris' (2024)\n\nNot only did it nab a Stephen King Tweet of Approval, there's a lot to enjoy in this high-end B-movie. A scientist (Bérénice Bejo) partners with a cop (Nassim Lyes) for help when a man-eating menace begins a killing spree, sets up shop in the catacombs and threatens a major triathlon that's come to town. In addition to some \"Jaws\" nods (including a clueless mayor), the final act is full of fishy mayhem, all leading to one heck of a last-scene cliffhanger.\n\n3. 'The Shallows' (2016)\n\nThe prettiest shark movie you’ll ever see, it's essentially \"Let's go surfing with Blake Lively in paradise\" until her character becomes the target of a hungry shark. A scene-stealing seagull is her only confidante as she tends to a really nasty leg bite – luckily, she's pre-med! – and uses her smarts (and a flare gun) to foil the shark's meal plans.\n\n2. 'Deep Blue Sea' (1999)\n\nSure, the ridiculous factor is high when you consider that the sci-fi thriller centers on super-duper-smart sharks born from the studies of scientists working on an Alzheimer's cure. But it totally owns that silliness in an enjoyable way, like a shark using a dude strapped to a gurney as a battering ram. Bonus: The film offers up an all-time great movie death, a joyously gnarly munch you don't see coming until it’s too late.\n\n1. 'Jaws' (1975)\n\nThe seafaring masterpiece sinks every other shark movie in its utter perfection. Hollywood's first summer blockbuster is aces across the board, from sheer terror to the unforgettable John Williams score (which keeps the dread going even without the toothy predator). But what really elevates the film from creature feature to complex shark-ridden drama is the trio of main characters, including top cop Brody (Roy Scheider), nerdy oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Ahab-esque hunter Quint (Robert Shaw).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/02/14/nba-all-star-celebrity-rising-stars-updates/78551043007/", "title": "NBA All-Star weekend: Stephon Castle named Rising Stars MVP", "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. — NBA All-Star weekend tipped off Friday with a cavalcade of events that included Hollywood stars and the greatest talents in basketball.\n\nEmmy Award-winning actor Rome Flynn led Team Barry Bonds to a 66-55 win over Team Jerry Rice in the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game on Friday at Oakland Arena. Flynn finished with a game-high 22 points, shooting 10-of-16 from the field, and eight rebounds, five assists and one steal. He was named MVP with his bold and beautiful performance. (Flynn won a Daytime Emmy Award for his role on the soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful” in 2018.)\n\n“Shout-out (to) my teammates. They were looking for me before the game,” Flynn said. “They said, ‘We want you to get the MVP.’ I’m a selfless guy. I just want to win. They just put the ball in my hands.”\n\nAnd in the nightcap, some of the NBA's Rising Stars competed in a three-game series with Team C, coached by Chris Mullin, winning a spot in the main event Sunday against Shaquille O'Neal's team.\n\nThis year marks a departure as the All-Star Game will be two semifinals pitting the best in the league against each other. The winning teams will play in a third and final game. The format now includes the winning Rising Stars squad from Friday, which will be helmed by WNBA icon Candace Parker.\n\nCatch up on all the action from Friday's Celebrity Game and now-crucial Rising Stars showcase event:\n\nRising Stars: Spurs guard Stephon Castle wins MVP\n\nSan Antonio Spurs guard Stephon Castle scored 12 points, while adding three rebounds and two assists, in leading Team C over Team G League and into Sunday's All-Star Game.\n\nRising Stars: Chris Mullin's Team C advances to All-Star Game\n\nRising Stars, Game 3: Team C 25, Team G League 14\n\nTeam G League was competitive early, but Team C ripped off a massive run to win the Rising Stars mini-tournament, clinching a berth in the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday.\n\nFacing a four-point deficit in the middle of the game, Team C (led by coach Chris Mullin) ripped off a 17-2 run to close the game and top Team G League, 25-14. Team C did it on defense, clamping down on the perimeter and never letting Team G League find rhythm.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs guard Stephon Castle willed Team C, leading all scorers with 12 points, while adding three rebounds and two assists. In fact, Castle scored seven more points than the next closest players — Dalton Knecht of Team C, and Dink Pate and Leonard Miller of Team G League — each of whom scored five points. Castle was named MVP.\n\nAs they did in their victory over Team T (led by coach Tim Hardaway Sr.), Team C allowed Castle to run point and push in transition; in the final against Team G League, Team C scored 10 fast-break points, compared to just two from Team G League.\n\nBut, more than anything, it was the Team C defense that limited Team G League to just 31.6% shooting - that won the game.\n\nRising Stars, Game 2: Team G League 40, Team M 39\n\nThe offense wasn’t as crisp in the second game of the Rising Stars mini-tournament as it was in the first, but the action was far closer. There were six ties and 10 lead changes in the game and the largest lead either team held was four points.\n\nIn the end, it was Team G League (led by coach Jeremy Lin) who topped Team M (led by coach Mitch Richmond) by the score of 40-39.\n\nWith the score at 37-35, Team G League had multiple attempts to tie the game late, and finally did, thanks in part to five consecutive missed free throws by Team M. Rockets forward Amen Thompson of Team M, however, soared through the lane for a dunk, giving Team M a 39-37 lead.\n\nLin called a timeout and dialed up a play to get a 3-point shot. And while the design faltered, Team G League forward Bryce McGowens eventually heaved a shot from beyond the arc as the shot clock was winding down. He swished it home, winning the game for Team G League, who won despite shooting 45% from the floor.\n\nTeam G League posted 10 second-chance points to Team M’s two, and the game’s two leading scorers, center Leonard Miller (14) and McGowens (12) were both on Team G League.\n\nThey will face Team C (led by coach Chris Mullins) in the final.\n\nRising Stars, Game 1: Team C defeats Team T, 40-34\n\nTeam C (led by coach Chris Mullin) pulled away from Team T (led by coach Tim Hardaway Sr.) to take the first game of the Rising Stars mini-tournament with a score of 40-34. Team C outhustled Team T, scoring five second-chance points and pushed the pace, topping Team T in fastbreak points, 13-5.\n\nSpurs guard Stephon Castle orchestrated the Team C offense, pushing the ball and finding shooters for open looks. Castle dropped six points — including the game-winning jumper — four assists and four rebounds. Jazz guard Keyonte George led Team C with 10 points, shooting 3-of-5 from the field, while Raptors guard Gradey Dick led Team T with 12 points, shooting 5-of-7 from the field.\n\nSo now, Team C advances to the finals to face the winner of the game between Team G League (led by coach Jeremy Lin) and Team M (led by coach Mitch Richmond). The winner in the final will then compete in the revised All-Star Game on Sunday.\n\nRising Stars, Game 1: Team C 25, Team T 21\n\nIn the first game of the Rising Stars mini-tournament, a battle between Team C (led by coach Chris Mullin) and Team T (led by coach Tim Hardaway Sr.), it was Team C that raced out to an early 10-point lead.\n\nTeam C pushed the pace up the floor, earning seven fast break points out of the team’s first 15 points, as Utah Jazz guard Keyonte George dropped eight early points on three-of-four shooting, including a pair of 3s, as Team C sped out to a 15-5 lead.\n\nBut Team T battled back by working the paint, and it was Raptors second-year guard Gradey Dick leading all scorers midway through the game with nine points on four-of-five shooting.\n\nTeam C leads Team T, 25-21.\n\nRome Flynn named celebrity All-Star MVP: Check out highlights\n\nActor Rome Flynn played high school basketball and hoops three, four times a week at 5:30 a.m. with a group known as the Breakfast Club. His basketball skills were on display in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, scoring a game-high 22 points and adding eight rebounds and five assists as he led Team Bonds to a 66-55 victory against Team Rice in Oakland.\n\nFor his effort, Flynn who won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2018, was named MVP of the celebrity game.\n\n“When I’m not filming, I hoop,” Flynn said on the court while holding the MVP trophy. “You want to have fun, but ultimately you want to win the game. It’s really competitive and we actually wanted to win. We had a real game plan.”\n\nFlynn revealed the game plan Barry Bonds, the coach of the winning team, had for the contest. “He said, ‘Get Rome Flynn the ball.’ ”\n\nFlynn is from Springfield, Illinois, and attended the same high school as former NBA All-Star Andre Iguodala.\n\nWas Druski snubbed for MVP?\n\nDespite Druski appearing to be shocked at the MVP trophy presentation — where he went to accept the trophy before Rome Flynn was called — the comedian was nowhere near a top performer. Druski, of Team Jerry Rice, finished with four points in the losing effort. He shot 1-of-6 from the field and 1-of-4 from three. He added one rebound and one turnover to his stat line.\n\nCelebrity All-Star Game Stats\n\nHow did your favorite star fare in the All-Star Celebrity game? Here's a look at the box score:\n\nFinal: Team Bonds 66, Team Rice 55\n\nActor Rome Flynn scored a game-high 22 points, leading Team Bonds to a 66-55 victory against Team Rice in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game Friday in Oakland. The Daytime Emmy Award-winning actor delivered a show with his scoring – he has a pick-up game quality step-back fadeaway jump shot – passing and dribbling. Shelby McEwen, the high jumper who won a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics and played two seasons of community college basketball, had 14 points for Team Rice and had the only two dunks of the game – a two-handed slam in the third quarter and a windmill dunk in the fourth. WNBA forward Rickea Jackson had 16 points and musician Tucker Halpern scored eight points for Team Bonds. Pro Football Hall of Famer Terrell Owens scored 18 points for Team Rice.\n\nQ3: Team Bonds 47, Team Rice 35\n\nTeam Bonds has a double-digit lead over Team Rice heading into the fourth quarter. Actor Rome Flynn of Team Rice continued his MVP campaign on Friday with a deep three from behind the Ruffles Four-point Ridge Line to extend Team Bonds lead to 47-35. Flynn is nearing a double-double — maybe even a triple-double — with 15 points (7-of-12 FG), six rebounds and five assists. Team Rice’s Shelby McEwen is keeping his squad in the game with nine points, while his teammate Terrell Owens has eight points.\n\nTeam Bond’s Kai Cenat finally got on the board with a layup on an assists from none other than Flynn. Team Rice’s Druski is still scoreless. (He missed two free throw attempts in the third quarter.)\n\nWatch: Olympian Shelby McEwen dunks in All-Star Celebrity Game\n\nLeave it to the Olympic high jumper to get the first dunk in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game. Shelby McEwen, who won a silver medal for the U.S. in the high jump at the 2024 Paris Olympics, threw down a two-handed dunk for Team Rice in the third quarter. McEwen played college basketball at Northwest Mississippi Community College and averaged 5.7 points in 2016-17 and had a season-high 16 points against Arkansas State Mid-South.\n\nHalftime: Team Bonds 31, Team Rice 25\n\nActor Rome Flynn was the star of the second quarter, finishing the first half with 11 points, five rebounds and three assists and giving Team Bonds a 31-25 lead at halftime. Flynn whipped a quick no-look pass to Tucker Halpern for an assist and was the best non-athlete on the court. He also displayed a nifty fadeaway jump shot. Pro Football Hall of Famer Terrell Owens leads Team Rice with six points. Fan favorite Dylan Wang, the Chinese actor and singer who has 5.7 million followers on Instagram, received the biggest cheers when he scored on a layup late in the second quarter. Druski continues to shoot but remains scoreless for Team Rice.\n\n“I feel great. I’m just trying to let the game come to me a little bit,\" Flynn said at halftime. \"I had an Olympic high jumper (Shelby McEwen) guarding me in the first quarter… I couldn’t really do too much with that guy guarding me. I got some good match-ups and knocked down a couple mid-range (shots).”\n\nQ1: Team Bonds 10, Team Rice 10\n\nWe are all even after one quarter. Team Bonds jumped to an early lead with a quick bucket from Shelby McEwen, who just so happens to be an Olympic high jump silver medalist. Team Bonds quickly had an 8-2 advantage, but actor Pablo Schreiber and Pro Football Hall of Famer Terrell Owens started to heat up for Team Rice. They each scored four points to tie it at 10.\n\nComedians are off to a rough start. Team Rice’s Druski is 0-for-2 from the field and had a turnover along the sideline while bringing the ball up the court. Meanwhile, Team Bond's Cenat got rejected at the rim by Golden State Valkyries forward Kayla Thornton.\n\nJerry Rice spars with Barry Bonds\n\nThe trash talking has begun. Coaches Jerry Rice and Barry Bonds, two Bay Area legends, engaged in verbal sparring before their star-studded lineups faced off against each other in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday.\n\n“How many rings do you have?” Rice asked Bonds, who jokingly responded, “I have two divorce rings.”\n\nBonds, who played 15 seasons with the San Francisco Giants from 1993 to 2007, never won a World Series during his 22-year career. Rice, on the other hand, won three Super Bowl titles with the San Francisco 49ers, where he played for 16 seasons from 1985-2000. Rice also played four seasons with the Oakland Raiders (2000-2004).\n\nWhen is the NBA All-Star Celebrity game?\n\nThe Ruffles NBA All-Star Celebrity Game takes place on Friday, Feb. 14, with the TV broadcast airing on ESPN.\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nGame starts: 7 p.m. ET\n\nNBA All-Star Celebrity game TV channel: How to watch showcase\n\nTV channel: ESPN\n\nESPN will have TV coverage from Oakland Arena.

But it soon put the brakes on implementing the feature amid a wave of criticism, noting it would “take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”\n\nIn a public statement Wednesday, Apple said it had “decided to not move forward with our previously proposed CSAM detection tool for iCloud Photos.”\n\n“Children can be protected without companies combing through personal data, and we will continue working with governments, child advocates, and other companies to help protect young people, preserve their right to privacy, and make the internet a safer place for children and for us all,” the company said in a statement provided to Wired. (Apple did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.)\n\nInstead, the company is refocusing its efforts on growing its Communication Safety feature, which it first made available in December 2021, after consulting experts for feedback on its child protection initiatives. The Communication Safety tool is an opt-in parental control feature that warns minors and their parents when incoming or sent image attachments in iMessage are sexually explicit and, if so, blurs them.\n\nApple was criticized in 2021 for its plan to offer a different tool that would start checking iOS devices and iCloud photos for child abuse imagery. At the time, the company said the tool would turn photos on iPhones and iPads into unreadable hashes — or complex numbers — stored on user devices. Those numbers would be matched against a database of hashes provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) once the pictures were uploaded to Apple’s iCloud storage service.\n\nMany child safety and security experts praised the attempt, recognizing the ethical responsibilities and obligations a company has over the products and services it creates. But they also called the efforts “deeply concerning,” stemming largely from how part of Apple’s checking process for child abuse images is done directly on user devices.\n\nIn a PDF published to its website outlining the technology, which it called NeuralHash, Apple attempted to address fears that governments could also force Apple to add non-child abuse images to the hash list. “Apple will refuse any such demands,” it stated. “We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future.”\n\nApple’s announcement about killing its plans for the tool came around the same time the company announced a handful of new security features.\n\nApple plans to bring expanded end-to-end encryption of iCloud data to include backups, photos, notes, chat histories and other services, in a move that could further protect user data but also add to tensions with law enforcement officials around the world. The tool, called Advanced Data Protection, will allow users to keep certain data more secure from hackers, governments and spies, even in the case of an Apple data breach, the company said.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/tech/apple-hey-siri-change-trnd", "title": "Why Apple may be working on a 'hey Siri' change | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nApple reportedly wants to put an end to “Hey.”\n\nThe company is said to be training its voice assistant Siri to pick up on commands without needing the first half of the prompt phrase “Hey Siri.” The trigger phrase is used to launch Siri on various products, including the iPhone, iPad, HomePod and Apple Watch.\n\nBloomberg, which first reported the news, said the change could come next year or in 2024. Apple did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nAlthough the update would be seemingly minor, experts say it may signal broader changes are coming and could require extensive artificial intelligence training. Lian Jye Su, a research director at ABI Research, said having two trigger words allows the system to more accurately recognize requests, so the move to one word would lean on a more advanced AI system.\n\n“During the recognition phase, the system compares the voice command to the user-trained model,” Su said. “‘Siri’ is much shorter than ‘Hey Siri,’ giving the system potentially less comparison points and higher error rate in an echo-y, large room and noisy environments,” such as in the car or when wind is present.\n\nThe move would allow Apple to catch up to Amazon’s “Alexa” prompt that doesn’t require a first wake word for its voice assistant. Microsoft shifted away from “Hey Cortana” in 2018, now allowing users to only say “Cortana” on smart speakers. However, “OK Google” is still required for most Google product requests.\n\nThe move away from “Hey Siri” would also come at a time when Apple, Amazon and Google are collaborating on the Matter automation standard, which will allow automation and Internet of Things devices from different vendors to interoperate.\n\nWith this in mind, James Sanders, a principal analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, said “redoubling efforts on improving Siri functionality is likely a priority at Apple.”\n\nSiri launched in February 2010 as a standalone iOS app in the Apple App Store before it was acquired by the tech giant two months later. The company then integrated Siri into the iPhone 4S, which was released the following year, and introduced the ability to say “Hey Siri” without physically touching a button in 2014.\n\nSiri has gotten smarter over the years, thanks to integration with third-party developers, such as ride hailing and payment apps, and supporting follow-up questions, more languages and different accents. However, it still has issues with not understanding users and responding incorrectly.\n\n“While the ‘Hey Siri’ change requires a considerable amount of work, it would be surprising if Apple announced only this change to Siri,” Sanders said. “Considering the rumored timing, I would anticipate this change to be bundled with other new or improved functionality for Siri, perhaps alongside a new model of HomePod and integrations with other smart home products via Matter, as a reintroduction to Apple’s voice assistant.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/17/tiktok-ban-legal-risk-supreme-court/77778658007/", "title": "Why not complying with TikTok ban is risky, even if Trump wants to ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − Even if President-elect Donald Trump offers assurances, companies like Apple, Google, and Oracle would be risking major financial penalties by not complying with the TikTok ban that goes into effect Sunday.\n\nThe law, which the Supreme Court upheld Friday, requires TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok's American assets if the app wants to keep operating in the U.S. Congress passed the law out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure could allow the Chinese government to get sensitive personal information on Americans and manipulate the information Americans receive.\n\nTrump, who takes office Monday, has expressed interest in finding a solution that would keep the popular social media app available in the U.S. while addressing national security concerns.\n\n\"My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\" Trump posted on Truth Social Friday.\n\nLegal experts told USA TODAY that keeping the app afloat on Sunday is a risky move, no matter what promises Trump gives.\n\n\"The companies, Apple, Google, etc., have to essentially decide – likely, in conjunction with their CEOs, in conjunction with their boards – whether they want to take this risk in violating the law, despite President Trump's assurances,\" Wayne Unger, a Quinnipiac University law professor, told USA TODAY. \"Because his assurances only go so far.\"\n\nApple, Google, and Oracle didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on whether they plan to stop offering services related to TikTok once the ban goes into effect. Before publication, a spokesperson for TikTok referred USA TODAY to a video statement from TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who suggested the company is hoping Trump will come to its rescue.\n\n\"I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\" Chew said. \"Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives.\"\n\nAfter publication, TikTok said in a statement that it \"will be forced to go dark on January 19\" unless the Biden administration immediately assures the company's service providers that the administration won't enforce the law.\n\nHow the TikTok ban works\n\nThe TikTok ban works by pressuring companies to stop helping TikTok operate in the U.S. That includes companies like Apple and Google that provide access and updates to the app, as well as companies like Oracle that offer internet hosting services.\n\nThose companies could be hit with $5,000 fines for each user they help access TikTok. For Google and Apple, that could mean a $5,000 fine for each user that downloads or updates the app through the companies' services, and for a company like Oracle, it could mean $5,000 for each user that simply accesses the app using its services.\n\nCompanies like Oracle \"would very quickly owe a lot of money, whereas with Apple and Google, the fines would accrue more slowly,\" Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Tiktok would shut down by everyone else having to turn them off, essentially,\" Unger told USA TODAY.\n\nThe law authorizes the U.S. attorney general to sue companies to exact the fines for each user over the previous five years – meaning an attorney general could even sue after Trump's upcoming presidency to get fines imposed for user access during his presidency.\n\nThe law allows a president to extend the deadline by 90 days, but only if TikTok is moving towards selling off its U.S. assets and there are legally-binding agreements in place for that.\n\n\"This 90-day extension is meant to not ban Tiktok if we're in the middle of that process, but we're not in the middle of that process,\" Rozenshtein said.\n\nWhat Trump could try – and why it may not be enough\n\nCNN and the Washington Post reported Wednesday that Trump was considering issuing an executive order to halt the ban to give him time to try to negotiate a solution. The media outlets cited anonymous sources.\n\nHowever, an executive order – as opposed to a new law – wouldn't actually have the power to halt the law, according to Rozenshtein. The sell-or-ban law was passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden in April.\n\n\"A presidential declaration, executive order, Truth Social, Tweet – doesn't matter what form it takes. It would not have any legal effect,\" Rozenshtein told USA TODAY. Executive orders \"are just press releases with nicer stationary.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean a promise from Trump would necessarily be meaningless, from a legal perspective. If Trump promised companies he wouldn't enforce the law and then an attorney general sued the company to impose fines for the time period covered by Trump's promise, the company could argue in court that it relied on the promise and so shouldn't have to pay.\n\nHowever, whether that argument would work in court is uncertain, according to Rozenshtein.\n\n\"The question is, if you're Apple, 'Does that give you enough comfort?' And I just have no idea what the answer is,\" he said.\n\nThe Justice Department could also simply decide not to enforce the law.\n\nBiden's deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, said in a statement following the Supreme Court's Friday decision upholding the law that implementing it and ensuring compliance after Sunday \"will be a process that plays out over time.\"\n\nTrump's attorney general nominee, Pam Bondi, declined to say whether she would enforce the ban at her confirmation hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut given the law's five-year window for enforcement, the Justice Department's failure to enforce the law today could be cold comfort.\n\nJustin Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's law school, told USA TODAY in an email that it's \"very unlikely\" Apple and Google would take the risk of not complying given the hefty penalties that could follow.\n\n\"In reality, there is very little that President Trump can do on his own to prevent the law from going into effect,\" Hurwitz said.\n\nWould a TikTok ban be permanent?\n\nEven if TikTok goes dark after Sunday, it could come back to life very quickly. The sell-or-ban law allows the restrictions to be lifted as soon as there is a qualified sale, and U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar predicted earlier this month that something like that may well happen.\n\n\"I think Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken – ByteDance saying we can't do it, China will never let us do it,\" Prelogar said as she defended the law in arguments at the high court Jan. 10.\n\n\"But, when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider, and it might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process,\" she said.\n\n(This story was updated to add additional information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2023/05/28/how-to-claim-your-unclaimed-money-and-accounts/70249184007/", "title": "You may have money coming to you.

When fraudsters call to say we’re about to be arrested for tax debt, our Social Security number has been “suspended,” or a loved one is in trouble, we play along.\n\nThis gives us valuable insight into how the scams operate, while wasting the time these jerks could spend victimizing more vulnerable people.\n\nWe have our work cut out for us. Government-imposter frauds have scammed people out of at least $450 million since 2014, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Interestingly, people ages 20 to 59 are more likely to report being defrauded this way than those 60 and over, but older people tend to lose more money. The median individual reported loss was $960, but it was $2,700 for people 80 and older, the FTC said in a July report.\n\nYou don’t have to engage with the bad guys to help thwart them. Answering the phone when scam artists call can put you on a “sucker list” that will prompt more calls.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nBut you can sign up for free “watchdog alerts” from AARP’s Fraud Watch Network, report scam attempts to the FTC and warn loved ones about the latest schemes, such as these three.\n\nGovernment imposters\n\nFraudsters are nothing if not flexible. As media coverage of IRS-imposter calls increased last year, scammers switched to impersonating Social Security investigators. The crooks often use software to spoof caller ID services into showing phone numbers for the Social Security Administration or its fraud hotline.\n\nDoug Shadel, AARP’s lead researcher on consumer fraud, recently pretended to take the bait. He returned a robocall from a group of these impersonators and was told the FBI was about to arrest him for opening 25 fraudulent bank accounts. To help the “investigators,” Shadel was advised to move all the money in his legitimate bank accounts to prepaid cards issued by “government-certified” stores such as Apple, Target, CVS or Walgreens. Then, Shadel was supposed to give the caller the cards’ serial numbers so the information could be added to his “file” – allowing the bilkers to steal the money.\n\nDetails of these scams may seem absurd, but con artists are exceptionally good at creating an atmosphere of fear and urgency so you’ll react emotionally, Shadel says.\n\n“Once you’re in that state of fear, it swamps all reason,” he says.\n\nVariations on this scheme include warnings that your Social Security number has been suspended because of suspicious activity or that your help is needed to investigate a crime, such as immigration fraud. Know this: Social Security numbers can’t be suspended, investigators typically don’t enlist civilians, and government agencies don’t call out of the blue, says Kathy Stokes, director of AARP’s fraud prevention programs.\n\n“Anyone calling from the government saying there’s a problem and you owe money is a scam,” she says.\n\nPassword-enabled blackmail\n\n“Sextortion” blackmail tries to convince you that your computer has been hacked and that the blackmailer is about to expose an extramarital affair, porn-watching habits or other embarrassing behavior. The email is really just a boilerplate form, but the subject line may include your actual password (which was probably exposed in some previous, unrelated database breach). The blackmailer typically demands payment via bitcoin or other digital currency. The solution is not to pony up, but to hit delete – and change your passwords regularly.\n\nKidnapping scams\n\nThis is a twist on family emergency scams, where someone pretends to be a loved one who urgently needs money – to get out of jail, leave a foreign country or pay a hospital bill, for example. With kidnapping scams, crooks pretend to hold your loved one hostage, often including the sounds of someone screaming or pleading. The call may appear to come from the supposed victim’s phone number.\n\nResist the urge to panic, and instead verify your loved one’s whereabouts, Stokes says. That could mean hanging up without speaking – often the best approach – then calling or texting them. Alternatively, reach out to someone likely to know where they are, such as a spouse, friend or parent, Stokes says. If you stay on the line, expect that the swindlers will try to keep you from checking out the story by threatening dire consequences.\n\n“If they say, ‘Don’t tell anybody or drastic things will happen,’ just know that that’s part of their ruse,” Stokes says.\n\nThis article was written by NerdWallet and was originally published by The Associated Press.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NerdWallet.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/23/costco-dei-shareholder-proposal-rejected/77907655007/", "title": "Costco shareholders reject anti-DEI proposal. Here's why they did.", "text": "Costco shareholders voted down an investor proposal from a conservative think tank that urged management to investigate the business risks of its diversity initiatives.\n\nMore than 98% of shares voted against the proposal, according to preliminary results announced by Costco chairman Hamilton “Tony” James. He and other board members had asked shareholders to reject the proposal involving the company's diversity, equity and inclusion policies ahead of Thursday's annual meeting.\n\n\"We owe our success to the more than 300,000 employees who serve our members every day. It is important that they all feel included and appreciated and that they transmit these values to our customers,\" James said.\n\nEthan Peck from the National Center for Public Policy Research – the right-leaning shareholder advocacy group that submitted the proposal – argued in a prerecorded message that DEI is \"illegal, immoral and detrimental to shareholder value\" and poses litigation risks for the company.\n\n\"By not hiring and promoting completely irrespective of race and sex ‒ in other words, by merit alone ‒ the company is not always hiring or promoting the best person for the job, and anything short of that is selling the success in the future of the company short, and therefore selling shareholders short,\" the message said.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe vote came just days after President Donald Trump used executive power to crack down on DEI.\n\nIncreasingly, companies are facing a DEI showdown at the shareholder ballot box.\n\nApple recently recommended investors vote against a shareholder proposal to eliminate the company’s DEI programs.\n\nRight-leaning groups like the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center say they bring shareholder proposals to counter liberal politics invading corporate boardrooms and advancing a “woke” ideological agenda that puts businesses at risk.\n\nSeizing on the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision striking down affirmative action in college admissions to challenge corporate diversity policies, these groups are bringing more DEI-related proposals before investors.\n\nWhile small, the number of anti-DEI shareholder proposals has more than tripled since 2020, according to the Conference Board. This proxy season, Walmart and Starbucks face similar proposals.\n\nPeck, deputy director of the National Center for Public Policy Research’s Free Enterprise Project, said his group plans 40 shareholder proposals this year, 12 focused on DEI.\n\n“Our shareholder proposal efforts are very much in tandem with the general pushback against DEI, in that both the general pushback and our proposals are about exposing how DEI is discriminatory and value-destroying,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nRight-leaning investors advance shareholder proposals – even those likely to get low-single-digit support – to make a point and get attention. Like Costco, corporate boards usually recommend shareholders vote against them. The measures typically get less than 2% of shareholder support.\n\nTrump's DEI executive orders increase business risks\n\nSpeaking to business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday, Trump called DEI programs \"absolute nonsense.\"\n\nHis latest executive order to end DEI in the federal government and affirmative action in federal contracting sent shockwaves through corporate America. Trump said his administration would investigate corporations that don’t fall in line. That warning could fuel more shareholder activism over the potential legal and financial fallout from diversity initiatives.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is one of the companies that may become a target.\n\nWhen asked about a potential challenge to its DEI practices, CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC’s Squawk Box: “Bring them on,” though he said he would listen to arguments about where JPMorgan Chase is getting it wrong “and make modifications.”\n\nFacing a rapidly shifting political environment and under fire from conservative foundations, think tanks and political operatives, a growing list of major corporations have dialed back diversity efforts.\n\nSome companies retreated from DEI commitments shortly before Trump took office. Among them was Facebook and Instagram owner Meta as CEO Mark Zuckerberg looked to align his social media company with the Trump administration.\n\nCostco, Apple and others reject anti-DEI shareholder proposals\n\nThose rollbacks have critics who say companies are making shortsighted decisions that could undermine their businesses.\n\nAmong them is the progressive shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, which issued a 2023 report showing a “statistically significant correlation” between diverse management and eight key financial metrics.\n\n“These are businesses that have existed longer than four years. We expect them to exist beyond this four-year window in front of us,” said Meredith Benton, principal founder of Whistle Stop Capital, which consults with As You Sow on DEI. “What we want to see is them making decisions that are in their business interests over the long term.”\n\nSome companies are standing by their DEI programs. None have defended those programs quite as vigorously as Costco.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research submitted the shareholder proposal, arguing that Costco’s DEI initiatives hold “litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.”\n\nCostco’s board of directors voted unanimously to recommend shareholders reject the measure, arguing that diverse employees and suppliers fuel innovation in the merchandise it stocks and the services it offers.\n\n“Our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,” the directors said. “The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.”\n\nCostco CEO Ron Vachris also defended those practices to a concerned shareholder, saying his company does not use hiring quotas but focuses on giving all workers the same opportunities.\n\n“If these are the policies you see as offensive, I must tell you I am not prepared to change,” Vachris wrote in the exchange viewed by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nStefan Padfield, director of the National Center for Public Policy Research’s Free Enterprise Project, said Costco’s “defiant” response to a “perfectly reasonable shareholder request” was out of line.\n\n“Simply asking shareholders to trust the status quo at Costco is insufficient,” Padfield told USA TODAY. “This is a rapidly changing landscape in terms of law, regulation, and market sentiment, and shareholders accordingly have good reason to ask for a review of practices, legal advice, and managerial information gathering and processing.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/12/toll-road-scam-smishing-texts/82318084007/", "title": "Toll road scammers continue to send 'smishing' texts: Don't click on ...", "text": "A text message scam claiming that consumers owe money for fake, unpaid road tolls is continuing to proliferate across the U.S., and experts are warning recipients to exercise caution.\n\nThe scam texts try to impersonate the toll service in your state – for example, if you live in California, the text will likely say it's from FastTrak.

Here's ...", "text": "Have you received a letter from the Social Security Administration (SSA)? If you're the recipient of an overpayment, you may owe the office some money.\n\nStarting on Thursday, March 27, the SSA reversed its more lenient policy for returning overpayments. The SSA, which pays benefits to nearly 69 million people monthly in 2025, occasionally pays a beneficiary more money than they should have gotten.\n\nAn overpayment can happen when a beneficiary fails to update a change in income, for instance. Or the SSA can incorrectly calculate benefits.\n\nPrior to last month's change, people who received an overpayment had 10% of their benefits withheld from each check to put toward repayment. That rate has now been ratcheted up to 100%, meaning those overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery and will receive no checks until the balance is resolved.\n\nLetters notifying recipients of the new overpayment policy may be arriving in mailboxes this week, as the agency said it would begin sending out the notifications on March 27.\n\nIn an August 2024 report, the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General estimated the agency made nearly $72 billion in improper payments – mainly overpayments – during fiscal years 2015-2022, as previously reported by USA TODAY. That accounted for less than 1% of all benefits paid during that period, but as of September 2023, the agency had $23 billion in uncollected overpayments, according to the report.\n\nWhat does the Social Security repayment change mean?\n\nFor any Social Security overpayments that occur after March 27, 2025, the recipient's future benefits will be withheld until the overpayment is reimbursed.\n\nWhat if I'm already reimbursing an overpay?\n\nFor those who are reimbursing an overpayment from before March 27, the withholding rate does not change, the agency said.\n\nWhat about SSI overpayments?\n\nThe withholding rate for overpayments of Supplemental Security Income benefits will remain at 10%.\n\nIf Social Security overpaid you, how do you pay it back?\n\nMoving forward, any beneficiary found to have been overpaid will \"automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the SSA says. That means benefits will be docked until the overpayment amount is met.\n\n\"If someone cannot afford full recovery of their overpayment, they can contact Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 or their local office to request a lower rate of recovery,\" the agency said in the notice.\n\nThe SSA says it will wait at least 30 days (plus five mail days) from the date it has sent an overpayment notice before starting to collect the overpayment.\n\nYou can repay the overpayment by credit card, online bill pay or check. For more information on repayment of overpaid benefits, visit the SSA website.\n\nCan you appeal a Social Security overpayment?\n\nIf you are sent an overpayment notice, you can appeal the decision or the amount, the agency says. Beneficiaries can also ask Social Security to waive collection of the overpayment if they believe it was not their fault and can’t afford to pay it back.\n\nSocial Security discontinues its more lenient overpayment withholding plan\n\nLast year, the SSA had opted to begin withholding only 10% of a recipient's benefits to recoup overpayments as a way of \"significantly reducing financial hardship on people with overpayments,\" the agency said at the time.\n\nThe move came after Social Security faced negative media coverage in 2023 from KFF Health News and Cox Media Group Television Stations, as well as \"60 Minutes\" about how the agency went about collecting overpayments, some of which happened more than a decade ago.\n\nSome beneficiaries lost their homes as benefits were cut off to make up an overpayment. \"Innocent people can be badly hurt,\" then-Social Security chief Martin O'Malley said, according to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nHow to avoid an overpayment of Social Security benefits\n\nThere are some steps you can take to avoid an overpayment, according to finance site NerdWallet:\n\nBe alert: If your benefit increases and you do not know why, contact the agency. You can also call to ask how your benefits are calculated.Stay up to date: Report your monthly income, marital status and any available resources that may affect the amount of your benefits. You can call the agency to update your information or access your my Social Security account online.\n\n\"Overpayments happen for several reasons, such as a beneficiary neglecting to update their income, marital status or work situation, or the SSA miscalculating how much it should pay,\" NerdWallet advises. \"Regardless of who is at fault, beneficiaries who receive overpayments from the Social Security Administration usually have to give back the money. Because taxpayer money funds Social Security benefits, the SSA is legally required to recover overpayments.\"\n\nWhy is Social Security changing its overpayment recovery process?\n\nConsider it part of the overall plan President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, have to reduce federal spending. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has said it plans to cut its workforce by more than 12%, slashing 7,000 employees.\n\nThese “significant workforce reductions,” as the SSA described them, along with the closing of some offices, could result in people facing a slowdown in the processing of benefits applications and longer waits for help from Social Security personnel.\n\nThe SSA's switch to withholding up to 100% of a recipient's benefits until it has recovered any overpayments will result in about $7 billion in overpayment recoveries over the next decade, the agency says.\n\n“We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people,” acting Social Security commissioner Lee Dudek said in a statement. “It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds\n\nContributing: Kinsey Crowley, Joey Garrison and Medora Lee, USA TODAY and Susan Tompor, Detroit Free Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2023/09/29/banned-books-read-these-books-now-and-why-in-defense-of-books/71008499007/", "title": "Banned books: Why you should read these 51 books right now", "text": "USA TODAY staff\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAs journalists, it's our job to seek out the truth even when it's uncomfortable. We value diverse perspectives, are open to new ideas and respect intellectual freedom. So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculums or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials that a book can go from challenged to banned in a school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is true only for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society.\n\n'All Boys Aren’t Blue' by George M. Johnson\n\nWe’re failing young queer readers, specifically Black and young people of color, if a book like activist George M. Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” stays on banned-book lists. Published in 2020, this memoir-manifesto follows the author’s journey of growing up a queer Black person and is an indispensable piece of literature for high school readers. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence and college years while revisiting traumatic and transformative experiences and weaves in important statistics about the LGBTQ community. Johnson candidly – and some might think, explicitly – explores their sexuality and unpacks their experiences with sexual assault in a way that’s necessary for readers to heal. The American Library Association listed the book No. 3 on its list of the 10 most-challenged books of 2021. Both a primer for teens looking to be allies to the LGBTQ community and a YA book meant to make young queer readers feel seen, Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a force to be reckoned with. – Pamela Avila\n\n'Gender Queer' by Maia Kobabe\n\nWhy do we tell teens to shave their legs if we resent having been told to ourselves? This question, among so many others, has been haunting me since I read “Gender Queer,” Maia Kobabe’s autobiographical graphic novel that explores the author's experience coming out as nonbinary and asexual. Through the novel, Kobabe vividly unravels small personal moments common to so many young people, exploring the discomfort inherent in everyday experiences like routine Pap smears. Kobabe raises a lot of excellent questions about the social mores of gender and the avidity with which society feels compelled to assign gender even though it is unique to individuals. Reading “Gender Queer” for the first time was like experiencing a jolt of adrenaline. It’s a book about Kobabe’s journey, but it allowed me to reframe mine, offering me the space to excavate my past and challenge my own self-concept. “Gender Queer” encourages growth and self-acceptance, and its removal from libraries is a huge disservice to teens. – Madison Durham\n\n'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas\n\nOne of the most challenged books in the country is this award-winning, bestselling middle-grade novel. Since the book’s release in 2017, it has been no stranger to controversy. The book’s critics say there’s too much sex and profanity. Some said it breeds contempt for police. The crux of the story, however, is systemic racism. Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter loses her best friend, Khalil, after he is shot and killed by a police officer. It’s a familiar story: Khalil, a Black kid, was unarmed when the white officer shot him. Khalil’s death becomes national news. Protests ensue. And a narrative forms, painting Khalil as a troublemaker and drug lord. Starr is caught between two worlds: her poor neighborhood and the rich prep school she attends. It’s the same story many Black children have lived. After Khalil’s death, Starr finds her voice of activism and pride in her Black identity. The banning of Thomas’ book is another reminder many people are uncomfortable with the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. – Tracee Herbaugh\n\n‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli\n\nSixteen-year-old Simon Spier has a crush on an anonymous gay classmate who goes by the name Blue online, and with whom he has been exchanging increasingly flirtatious emails. One problem: Neither knows the other’s real identity. Another problem: Simon is still closeted. But when a nosey classmate finds Simon’s emails and threatens to out him, cautious Simon needs to step outside his comfort zone before he’s pushed out. What’s so welcome about Albertalli’s tale of high school high jinks, secret crushes and fraught friend-group dynamics is how ordinary and familiar it is. This sweet and funny high school story is light on trauma and big on laughs, and a balm to queer readers who want to see themselves reflected in happy coming-out stories. (It also has a rather good film adaptation, “Love, Simon,” starring Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner.) – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami\n\nThis is one of the most hauntingly, mind-bendingly beautiful books I've ever read. The surreal novel weaves two parallel plots that meld music and metaphysics, time and fate, and loss and alienation as it follows the young Kafka Tamura, who is fleeing an Oedipal curse, and Satoru Nakata, an old man with a knack for talking to cats. \"Kafka on the Shore\" is an imaginative literary puzzle sure to challenge students and their conceptions of what a novel could, or should, be. Chock-full of surreal happenings, nothing is clearly defined in this book. Murakami leaves the story open-ended for readers, giving them space to decide what to draw from it – a level of freedom they may not often be afforded when dissecting more “classic” novels typically included in curriculums. In a setting where students are often instructed to find \"the right answer,\" \"Kafka on the Shore\" is a breath of fresh air that can stretch their imaginations. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I snuck into my sister’s room and grabbed a copy of \"Twilight.\" It was just before the \"Breaking Dawn – Part 1\" movie release, and \"Twilight\" fever had hit my school. The story of Bella, Edward, vampires and forbidden love features all the hallmarks of coming-of-age literature and introduced me to themes I hadn’t seen in media yet. \"Twilight\" brought me together with my peers to talk about reading, giving me new worlds to explore and new friends to talk about them with. Banning \"Twilight\" severely limits the opportunity for students to take reading into their own hands and enjoy a coming-of-age story full of fantasy and imagination. – Chris Panella\n\n'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' by Erika L. Sanchez\n\nFor young women struggling with mental health struggles, the loss of a loved one, the loss of innocence and outdated expectations that often come with growing up in a Latino household, Sanchez’s 2017 YA novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” can be a lifeline. In August, Madison County Schools in Mississippi removed 10 books from general library circulation, including Sanchez’s. High school is a tough time, and young people in particular pick up a book to escape reality or to make sense of the changing world around them – reading makes them feel safe enough to express how they’re feeling. And making a book like Sanchez’s inaccessible hinders the representation young Latino readers need. – Avila\n\n'The Odyssey' by Homer\n\nOdysseus’ 10-year journey after the Trojan War back home to Ithaca to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, has a lot going on – a lot dark going on. Witches, slavery, tricks, betrayal, Cyclopses, grim and gory deaths, cannibal giants, varied monsters, murderous guests and mass slaughter all feature in the epic (in the original sense) tale from the eighth century BCE. It’s a wild ride with bad role models, and there couldn’t be a more classic example of the Books by Dead White Men vein of literature. That being said: “The Odyssey,” both the book itself and the themes it explores, are so deeply woven into the fabric of our modern culture that the name itself is a genre. Knowing \"The Odyssey\" is like getting a peek into the source code of innumerable (truly) works of literature spanning 28 centuries, giving any reader a deeper, more nuanced understanding of not just countless works of art but of culture itself. (And as it happens, it’s a fantastic, gripping story that’s a joy to read in its own right.) – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nIt's funny that \"Speak\" is so challenged, considering I was in high school when I read it. Apparently, it \"exposes children to immorality\" – reasoning you don't know whether to laugh or cry at. Adults who think teenagers aren't already exposed to everything probably don't remember what it was like being a teenager. Sexual assault, unhappy families and the nuances of high school life are real-world issues that teens are already aware of. Kids need books that start difficult conversations, that demonstrate the importance of using your voice and having someone who listens, that show you can rise above adversity. \"Speak\" is beautiful in its spare prose and simplicity. Many can relate to, and laugh with, Melinda's dry humor and cynical voice. It's a necessary story that gives permission to students whose voices are silenced to take up space – and speak. – Nusrat Sultana\n\n'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Picoult\n\nI was in eighth grade when the Columbine shooting happened, back when the concept of a school shooting was new. Children and teens today live in a very different reality, with active shooter drills and school shootings as part of their everyday life and consciousness. Parents have challenged this book because of its depictions of a school shooting; the bullying and romantic partner violence that led up to it; and the trauma and suicides that came after. Children are bullied. Teenagers are in abusive relationships. They get pregnant and grapple with decisions about abortion. Adolescents struggle to define their sexuality. Young people contemplate suicide and kill themselves. Banning books about these topics doesn’t make them cease to exist. The story, so beautifully told, touches on all of these topics because these are the traumas teens battle, some of which have directly contributed to violence in schools. If we’re unwilling to let young people read about, think about, process and dissect the very traumas they experience all around them, how can ever hope to solve these problems? – Katie Wedell\n\n'Blubber' by Judy Blume\n\nI read “Blubber” in fifth grade, and it's the most pivotal book of my youth. The book’s main character is a young fifth grader, Jill, who joins the more popular kids in the class to ostracize Linda, a girl nicknamed Blubber because of her size. The main reason the book has been banned is because nothing happens to Jill and her fellow bullies. That is precisely why I needed this book. In the fifth grade, I was Linda. “Blubber” was inspired by an incident in the author’s daughter’s own fifth grade class, and what Blume saw was not the exception but often the rule. In real life, bullies often get away with their behavior. While the similarity between myself and Blubber stung, it also provided solace. I was not alone. This was not something that happened only to me. Others knew how I felt. And that meant everything. It is always satisfying to read stories with happy endings, but it is just as important to read ones that don’t. Because in life, there are bullies and unresolved endings, and that is something that every fifth grader should know. – Mary Cadden\n\n'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding\n\nGolding uses preteen boys to show readers how a group of people will mistreat those they simply don’t like and even beat a child to death out of fear arising from a conspiracy theory. The use of boys as main characters may make it easier for some to understand the forces that can erode a society, or may make readers feel alarmed about the “end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.” Either way, this book can prompt young readers think deeply about governance and societal leadership in a way that will inform them throughout their lives. – Erin Mansfield\n\n'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" revolves around the friendship between two migrant workers during the Great Depression. I remember reading the book for my high school English class and thinking about loneliness as well as companionship. The two protagonists are brought together by a shared dream of purchasing land that's eventually shattered by the predatory social environment for migrant workers at that time. With this book, school-age readers have the opportunity to examine the conflict between reality and the American dream, in addition to human friendships. – Rayna Song\n\n'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein\n\nSilverstein’s collections of poetic nonsense was a classic on our living room bookshelf. His fantastical black-and-white sketches begged a wild imagination and a healthy sense of humor. They posed impossible scenarios, built as much for wordplay as they were for plot. \"A Light in the Attic\" has been banned in some schools over claims it promotes disrespect and violence. To argue this is to argue that children are unable to understand hyperbole. I am a deep believer that adolescent minds should be taken seriously, that they always understand more than we think and that they grow best when we overestimate them. The greatest children’s authors know this. I want the next generation to learn just as I did from Silverstein the joy of twisting words in different ways, of laughing at themselves, and of finding poetry and humor in everyday life. – Anna Kaufman\n\n'Eleanor & Park' by Rainbow Rowell\n\nRowell’s novel captures what it means to be a misfit teenage girl in a world that wants to cast you aside. As a teenager, this book made me feel seen as it keys into the nuances of being an outcast while coming into your own. This book has been banned for coarse language and sexuality, but it covers difficult topics such as racism, domestic abuse and body image that are enlightening for teen and adult readers alike. With high school years being a turbulent time for many, \"Eleanor & Park\" provides a much-needed perspective on surviving your teenage years in the face of adversity. – Samantha Mangino\n\n'Two Boys Kissing' by David Levithan\n\nI revisited “Two Boys Kissing” almost 10 years after first reading it, and – in the best possible way – it was more of a gut-punch than I'd recalled. The narration by a Greek chorus of men who died of AIDS is an emotional reminder of the strong bonds of chosen family. This book feels especially timely as progress on LGBTQ rights faces renewed political backlash and as monkeypox spreads mainly through our community. Reading “Two Boys Kissing” today shows how much has changed in the past decade while highlighting what work there still is to be done – and what we may be in danger of losing if we become complacent about our progress. The young characters remind us what is at stake and who most needs to hear these stories and feel a community’s love today. – Zach Wichter\n\n'Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice' by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, Ann Hazzard\n\nAs this book follows a Black family and a white family discussing the police shooting of a Black man, its first page reads, “the grown-ups didn’t think the kids knew about it.” Amid nationwide conversations about race, many parents assume children are in the dark or unable to have meaningful discussions about racism. But children hear the murmurings and have questions. Shutting those down means lost opportunities for learning. A growing body of research shows children begin to notice race years before adults want to talk about it with them. Delaying these conversations and ignoring the realities of racism could make children more susceptible to racist beliefs. After all, it’s the adult’s responsibility to help children make sense of their social world. “Something Happened” approaches these conversations with care and includes child-friendly discussion guides curated by child psychologists to help encourage vital parent-child conversations about race. – Fernando\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky\n\nEvery person I’ve spoken to who read “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” when they were in high school remembers it as a teenagehood-defining book. Chbosky writes beautifully and timelessly from the mind of high school freshman Charlie, an introvert who gets taken under the wing of a group of upperclassmen and learns the value of letting others into his life. Some of the content throughout can be intense or inappropriate for younger readers – topics include alcohol, drugs, sex, abortion, mental health struggles, suicide and sexual abuse. But these are all things high schoolers can and often do experience, and blocking them from a story that explores them in a thoughtful, empathetic way doesn’t do anyone any good. More, it holds teenage readers back from discovering a story that may guide them through a tumultuous period. Years later, I count myself one of the lucky many to have found this story when I did. – Hannah Yasharoff\n\n'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' by Maya Angelou\n\nAngelou’s beautifully written autobiographical novel touches on two important and painful subjects that often get it banned from schools: rape and racism. While they may not be the most comfortable topics, they’re still as prevalent in 2022 as they were in 1969, when the book was published. It features some graphic depictions, but the sad truth is these topics are not new to many young adults, and reading about Angelou’s healing journey is instrumental in letting them know they’re not alone. Simply banning a book that depicts rape and racism doesn’t shield readers from facing them in their lives; it just removes another resource that may help them move forward. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The House on Mango Street' by Sandra Cisneros\n\nThere are some novels that read like poetry, and \"The House on Mango Street\" is on that list. Cisneros uses short vignettes to show key moments in the life of Esperanza, a 12-year-old Latina girl growing up in Chicago, poised in the awkward time between childhood and adolescence. The writing is truly lovely, and the use of vignettes creates a feeling of being inside someone’s memories. Through Esperanza, Cisneros creates a portrait of a community, both the love and support as well as the restrictive and painful aspects. The latter includes moments of domestic and sexual abuse, and as Esperanza ages within the novel, her understanding and descriptions of those situations become more explicit, although never graphic. It is easy to understand why the book has won multiple awards, as Cisneros plays with narrative form and storytelling, and questions what it means to belong in a fascinating and wonderful way. – Rebecca Viser\n\n'Maus' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. Though \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. –VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was assigned only one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for one another helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that about 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming-out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and it provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten: disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired bythe magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then – about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixth graders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local newspaper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He already had tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it had been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones The Man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran, but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted people, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyonce once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they fear for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming of age, Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That shortsightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affects those who fight. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions. Through a more contemporary lens, readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body, much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later tries to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries), the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is good only behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ people, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of World War II, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid\\'s Tale' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in The New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s, and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Wedell\n\n'1984' by George Orwell\n\nI read \"1984,\" one of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. The book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games' (series), by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have beenoutrageously dystopian when Collins published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime,\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger – themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent comments. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over, as they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}]}

The suspension is to be served May 29-30.\n\nAlvarado has 10 days to appeal the HISA ruling.\n\nAlvarado addressed the possibility of a fine on this week’s C.L. Brown Show, hosted by columnist C.L. Brown of the Louisville Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"I forgot it was a rule,”\" Alvarado said. \"I was seeing my dream coming true right in front of me.

Orseno said Hades was “really stud-ish,” as a 2-year-old, which led to the decision to geld the horse. “He’s a son of Awesome Slew,” Orseno said. “Nobody was thinking ‘stallion’ at that point. Nobody was thinking anything.

Asmussen addressed the speedy time for Hall of Fame — 1:44.27 for 1 1/16 miles. “He was ridden much more aggressively because he’s playing a little catch-up on a horse like Track Phantom, but the ability is there,” said Asmussen, who also trains Track Phantom.\n\nHonor Marie\n\nTrainer: Whit Beckman\n\nOwners: Ribble Farms (Alan Ribble), Michael Eiserman, Earl Silver, Kenneth Fishbein, Daniel Fishbein\n\nJockey: Rafael Bejarano\n\nSire: Honor Code\n\nDam: Dame Marie, by Smart Strike\n\nPrice tag: $40,000 at 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 2-1-0 in three starts\n\nCareer earnings: $318,175\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 10 (No. 14)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 25-1 (co-No. 9 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Grade 2 Kentucky Jockey Club on Nov. 25 at Churchill Downs\n\nPossible next start: Grade 2 Risen Star on Saturday at Fair Grounds\n\nNotable: Beckman is a Louisville native who worked as an assistant for Todd Pletcher, Eoin Harty and Chad Brown before going out on his own in 2021. All three of Honor Marie’s career starts have come at Churchill Downs. “To me, he’s a very talented, quality horse, and we’ll see if he made the jump from 2 to 3,” Beckman said. “Early on he was always just kind of aloof, lights weren’t really on, but now we’re really starting to see him wake up, and I know he knows what he’s doing out there. He’s put on a lot of weight, a lot of muscle. He’s been doing what he needs to do.”\n\nLiberal Arts\n\nTrainer: Robert Medina\n\nOwners: Evan Ferraro, Stephen Ferraro\n\nJockey: Cristian Torres\n\nSire: Arrogate\n\nDam: Ismene, by Tribal Rule\n\nPrice tag: Homebred\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 2-1-3 in six starts\n\nCareer earnings: $294,825\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 19 (No. 8)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 60-1 (co-No. 22 choice)\n\nLast start: Third in Grade 3 Southwest on Feb. 3 at Oaklawn\n\nPossible next start: Grade 1 Arkansas Derby on March 30 at Oaklawn\n\nNotable: Broke his maiden at Ellis Park on Aug. 13 and won the Grade 3 Street Sense on Oct. 29 at Churchill Downs.

Cox told the Daily Racing Form he hasn’t given up on Nash reaching the Kentucky Derby. “He always trains well, and he has Derby points,” Cox said. “(Saturday’s allowance race) is an opportunity to get some confidence back, get back in a Derby prep next time.”\n\nNo More Time\n\nTrainer: Jose D’Angelo\n\nOwner: Morplay Racing\n\nJockey: Paco Lopez\n\nSire: Not This Time\n\nDam: Baroness Juliette, by Speightstown\n\nPrice tag: $40,000 at 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Iowa\n\nCareer record: 2-1-0 in four starts\n\nCareer earnings: $156,780\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 20 (No. 6)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 40-1 (co-No. 17 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Grade 3 Sam.

Velveeta. Capri Sun. Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio admits: Some of the company’s iconic products had become “a little bit dusty.”\n\n“For a while, we were apologetic about the brands that we had,” Patricio told CNN Business. “We got distracted believing that the future was launching new small brands, niche brands.”\n\nRecently, “we stopped and said, let’s go back” to basics, Patricio said. “Let’s be proud of the brands we have. Because they’re incredible.”\n\nMore than half of Kraft Heinz’s business comes from just eight brands — the aforementioned three, plus Kraft Mac and Cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Heinz, Lunchables and Ore-Ida. They may not seem glamorous, but they’re the very brands the company is banking on in its years-long effort to turn around the world’s fifth-largest food and beverage conglomerate.\n\nPhiladelphia Cream Cheese and Velveeta are some of Kraft Heinz's most prized brands. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nProcessed foods are “where the industry makes its money,” said Alexia Howard, senior analyst covering US Food at Bernstein. “That’s traditionally been what works in packaged food.”\n\nSo Kraft Heinz reworked its portfolio to cut its healthier nuts and cheese business and focus on the processed icons, putting them front and center in flashy, even goofy, marketing campaigns that have captured the attention of social media. (Consider the eight-foot-long Velveeta box that appeared in New York City’s Central Park.) But that strategy is not without risk, especially as consumers trend toward healthier options.\n\nFor Kraft Heinz, which is relying on Patricio to execute a comeback, there’s a lot on the line.\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nKraft and Heinz joined forces in 2015, a deal orchestrated by Heinz’s owners at the time, Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway and the investment firm 3G Capital. At first, investors were optimistic, buoyed by 3G’s successful track record of using mergers to create powerhouse conglomerates, like Restaurant Brands International (QSR), owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons. But in this case, the winning formula fell flat. After a few years, the company started to lose value, fast.\n\nCritics said that an extreme cost-cutting strategy choked innovation. And in 2019, the company revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its accounting practices. It wrote down the value of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands by $15 billion, posted a $12.6 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2018, and had to revise past financial statements and later pay millions of dollars in a settlement.\n\nEven the venerable Harvard Business Review weighed in with harsh criticism. “While investors were hungry for growth, 3G could not change the Kraft Heinz legacy brands quickly enough to meet consumer demand for healthier, fresher and, in some cases, cheaper private-label products,” a 2019 piece in the magazine proclaimed. “While Jell-O, Kool-Aid, and Velveeta were being stacked onto shelves, the tectonic plates of big-box food were shifting beneath Kraft Heinz’s feet, and they could not adapt fast enough.”\n\nEnter new management.\n\nKraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio has had to make some tough decisions in his quest to turn the company around. CNN\n\nIn 2019, with the company in crisis, Patricio joined Kraft Heinz from Anheuser Busch InBev (BUDFF). Since 3G Capital had also managed AB InBev’s huge 2008 merger, that connection set off alarm bells for some. “Everybody was like, ‘Oh, gosh, is this really going to work?’” said Howard.\n\n“He had a monumental task when he first came in,” she noted. Shares of the company had fallen sharply, sales were faltering and investor confidence was low.\n\nToday, Kraft Heinz shares are worth about $37 apiece, an improvement from its 2020 lows of about $22 but far from its high of almost $100 a share in 2017. In the third quarter of this year, net sales grew to $6.5 billion, a 2.9% increase from the year before.\n\n“Three years ago, our company was in the bottom,” Patricio said during a Bernstein conference in June. “Today, we feel that we are a good company.”\n\nBut that’s not enough. “We think we can be great. And to be great, it’s a very different game,” he said.\n\nPatricio has streamlined operations, invested in supply chain improvements and ramped up advertising. He’s also made some potentially risky changes to the company’s portfolio.\n\nGoodbye, Mr. Peanut\n\nTo focus on core categories, Patricio started shedding divisions.\n\nIn 2020, Kraft Heinz announced that it was divesting its natural cheese business. The following year, it said the same of Planters, bidding adieu to the iconic Mr. Peanut.\n\nThat move may seem like a headscratcher, since natural nuts and cheese are more easily positioned as healthy foods than processed meats and cheese. But they’re also hard to differentiate from competitors.\n\nNatural cheese and nuts didn’t fit “​​our strategy for the future,” Patricio told CNN. “It’s not … where the growth would come from.”\n\nKraft Heinz decided to sell off its Planters nuts business. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThose two categories are particularly exposed to private label, or store brands, he said, and experts agree. Shoppers are “very price driven,” when it comes to these items, said Daniel Hooker, a senior lecturer in applied economics at Cornell University with an expertise in food industry management.\n\nAnd competition is especially fierce right now, because consumers have become increasingly interested in private label as grocery prices skyrocket. Swings in ingredient prices can cut into costs, especially in these categories.\n\nSelling off those brands “helped us immensely,” Patricio said.\n\nKraft Heinz’s current portfolio is less likely to face competition from generic brands, noted Hooker. Heinz Tomato Ketchup is far and away the leading brand in that category, and “there’s no private brand equivalent, really, of Capri Sun,” he noted.\n\n“The best way to compete with store brands is having very strong brands,” said Patricio. “They really play a role in the hearts of consumers. So we have more loyalty.”\n\nFor that reason, Kraft Heinz has leaned in to promoting its legacy brands — and with sometimes outrageous marketing. In Patricio’s words, “we need to be creative and make the consumers talk about these brands.”\n\nHello, Velveeta martinis\n\nIn Velveeta’s case, Kraft Heinz partnered with a steakhouse chain to sell Velveeta martinis and created a Velveeta-themed nail polish, in addition to tweaking the processed cheese brand’s logo.\n\nVelveeta teamed up with a steakhouse chain to sell the cheesy Veltini. Kraft Heinz\n\nOther Kraft Heinz brands have also used attention-grabbing marketing campaigns. Over the summer, Oscar Mayer introduced the “cold dog,” a popsicle that tastes like a hot dog. The item was sold for a limited time at Popbar locations in a handful of cities. Kraft Real Mayo has partnered with Juicy Couture to create sweatsuits. The pants say “Smooth” on the rear.\n\nEfforts like these raise brand awareness, help create buzz online and gain media attention. Kraft Heinz’s brands now have a presence on gaming platforms like Roblox, in addition to social media channels and other platforms. In his discussion of the company’s third-quarter results, Patricio noted that six of the company’s campaigns this year have garnered over a billion earned impressions each, referring to views received by media coverage of the promotions.\n\nIn a quickly evolving media landscape, it takes “far more work and people to reach consumers,” he told CNN.\n\nBut clever promotions might not be enough to convince consumers to go for Kraft Heinz’s highly processed products.\n\nHow healthy can processed food really be?\n\nOne way to reach health-conscious consumers without overhauling core brands is by building partnerships with outside companies. Recently, Kraft Heinz started working with NotCo, which makes plant-based dairy and protein. Acquiring a company would be expensive, Patricio noted, so a partnership was the way to go.\n\nPatricio seems to be leaning into partnerships, said Howard. For him, they “may be the way to tap into some of these bigger, more disruptive changes that are going to hit the industry,” in the years ahead.\n\nKraft Heinz said in October the first product from the joint venture, plant-based American cheese slices, had launched in a test market.\n\nGrilled cheese sandwiches are prepared with Kraft Heinz NotCo American Style plant-based cheese slices. Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe company has also been making more substantial changes to some products in an attempt to make them healthier: A recent commercial, which bemoans the woes of “adulting,” promotes Heinz’s No Sugar Added Ketchup. Over the summer, the company rolled out a reduced-sugar formula for Capri Sun. Kraft Mac and Cheese is made without artificial flavors, dyes or preservatives and comes in gluten-free and whole grain varieties.\n\n“It is definitely a trend in the world to have healthier foods, and we need to be part of it,” said Patricio. “We need to adapt .. and we’ve been doing that.”\n\nEven with ingredient changes and marketing pushes, however, there’s a limit to how many adjustments the company can make without fundamentally altering the products.\n\n“Some of these brands, they can only make them so much healthier, before they cease to be the products that they are,” said Cornell’s Hooker. “You get to a point where you can’t do much more.”\n\nFor now, things seem to be working, noted Howard, the food analyst. “Three years in … he is actually moving things in the right direction.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/01/29/papa-johns-tries-new-tack-challenge-pizza-hut-dominos-pizza-supremacy/79488352/", "title": "Papa John's tries new tack to challenge Pizza Hut, Domino's for ...", "text": "Aamer Madhani\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLOUISVILLE — The battle among America's pizza chain juggernauts for a bigger slice of the $40 billion industry is about to get more heated.\n\nIn an era when industry leaders are offering two pizzas for as little as $10, Papa John's — the country's fourth biggest pizza chain in terms of market share — says it will launch an aggressive campaign to win more customers by making the case that spending a a few more bucks on your pie is worth it.\n\nCompany officials say their push will start during festivities in San Francisco ahead of the Super Bowl – historically the biggest day of the year for pizza sales – when the Kentucky-headquartered chain will have three of their NFL pitchmen J.J. Watt (a former delivery driver for rival Pizza Hut), Joe Montana and Archie Manning announce that Papa John's will pledge that any customer dissatisfied with their pizza will get their next pizza free. (The company’s most celebrated endorser and franchisee Peyton Manning will be too busy preparing to play in the Super Bowl to take part in the pitch.)\n\nThe company plans to follow its celebrity push with a national television advertisement campaign the day after the Super Bowl to market their free pizza guarantee.\n\nThe brash move comes from a company that has touted a “Better Ingredient, Better Pizza” motto for about 20 years, while its competitors increasingly offer cut-rate deals, which have added a new dynamic to the war among America's big four pizza chains. Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Caesars, and Papa John's account for about 39% of the industry's revenue.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nLittle Caesars, the third biggest chain in terms of sales, sells its large 'hot-n-ready' pizza for $5 in many markets. Industry leaders Pizza Hut and Domino’s have launched value menus where customers can buy two items—including pizzas, pasta, and desserts—for $10 to $11.98.\n\nPapa John’s is hardly averse to offering specials. They currently offer one large, one-topping pizza for regular price with a second one for 50 cents. But with prices that skew higher than their bigger rivals—a large pepperoni pizza goes for $15.50 at Papa John's in the Chicago market— their specials are significantly more expensive their big chain rivals.\n\n“You can’t make a silk purse with a sow’s ear,” Papa John's founder and CEO John Schnatter told USA TODAY. \"You can’t make good wine from bad grapes. If you’re serving a $5 pizza, you are either serving ingredients that are not high quality or you’re putting less on.”\n\nPizza Hut, which recently launched what it's calling its $5 flavor menu, declined to address Schnatter's comments directly. But company spokesman Doug Terfehr noted the company has been \"serving the same great-tasting pizza, at a great value\" for more than 50 years.\n\nPapa John's first introduced the free pizza guarantee in the United Kingdom last year as it was trying to differentiate their brand from Domino’s Pizza, which dominates the UK pizza scene with nearly four times as many outlets as Papa John’s.\n\nPapa John’s president and chief operating officer Steve Ritchie credited the campaign with helping boost same-store sales by “double-digit” percentage points in the United Kingdom last year. Fewer than 2% of their customers in Britain called up to complain and ask for a free pizza, Ritchie said.\n\nUnder the soon-to-be offered guarantee in the U.S., customers dissatisfied for any reason can call Papa John's within 30 minutes of receiving their pizza and they will be offered a choice of having a new pie made for them on the spot or be credited with a free pizza for another day, Ritchie said.\n\nRitchie noted that Papa John’s has scored highest or tied for the highest marks among the top four pizza chains in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for 14 of the last 16 years. But Ritchie suggested Papa John’s must do a better a job differentiating itself from rivals.\n\n“It’s really time to voice that loud and clear out to the consumer,” Ritchie said. “It’s something we’re very passionate about and prideful about. But have we conveyed what we do in the stores every day to the consumers?”\n\nThe company has seen solid sales growth in recent years. Same-store sales at stores open more than a year were up 5% for franchises and corporate stores in North America for 2015 through the end of the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Same store sales were up 7.5% in its international markets through the end of the third quarter.\n\nStill, Papa John’s growth pales in comparison to the 12,000-store chain Domino’s, which has boasted same-store sales growth in the U.S. for six straight years. In the third quarter of 2015, Domino’s reported domestic sales grew 10.5% compared to the same period the previous year. The international division also posted same store sales growth of 7.7%, marking the 87th consecutive quarter of international same store sales growth.\n\nPizza Hut is the largest pizza chain with 15,000 restaurants worldwide, but is going through a turbulent period in which it has been the weak link for its parent company, Yum Brands, the fast food behemoth that also operates Taco Bell and KFC. Pizza Hut saw same-store sales grow just 1% in the third quarter. Yum, which won't release its full fourth quarter earnings until next week, recently reported that sales at its Pizza Huts in China declined 8% in the last quarter.\n\nPapa John's Schnatter, 54, agrees the company needs to improve on telling its story. The CEO, who launched his pizza business out of a broom closet at his father's bar, stars in company's ads and has become the most ubiquitous face in the pizza industry.\n\nSchnatter, who backed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 election, also drew attention after he told shareholders that President Obama's Affordable Care Act would drive up the cost of pizza by 11 to 14 cents per order. The company's Facebook page was littered with messages from critics who said they'd be happy to pay the extra cost if it resulted in workers being covered by health care.\n\nSchnatter said he is confident the company can grow its customer base, particularly with millennials and busy mothers, by underscoring the company’s efforts to improve its quality.\n\n“The consumer is more informed about what’s good and what’s not good—millennials especially,” Schnatter said \"I think we’re skating to where the public is going.”\n\nPapa John’s latest pitch follows the company’s announcement earlier this month that it has removed all artificial flavors and synthetic coloring from its food items. In December, the company said by this summer it will transition to using only chicken that is raised without human and animal antibiotics and that is fed an entirely vegetarian diet.\n\nAt Papa John’s quality control lab and dough factory at the company’s Louisville headquarter, the company has stepped up its effort to ensure a flood of dissatisfied customers won't demand free pizzas once the company starts its quality guarantee promotion.\n\nProduction of 300 million dough balls a year for pizza crusts at Papa John’s hums along at 10 commissaries spread throughout the country, supplying more than 4,600 outlets. Even at that scale, the process of making pizza remains as much art as science, Schnatter said.\n\nOn the floor of the Louisville dough factory, one 13-person shift had well over a century of collective experience with the company. Schnatter said the the longevity of his workforce in key positions has helped make improving key facets of the business easier. It also hasn't hurt retention that the company distributed $60 million in bonuses last year, he said.\n\n“If you don’t get it right from here, you’ll see that the final product (isn’t) right,” Schnatter said over the ear-splitting din of dough being made.\n\nUpstairs from the dough factory, a team of product quality technologists in lab coats randomly test thousands of food items from throughout the Papa John’s distribution system each month Checks include the acidity of the pizza sauce, the depth of the Papa John's cookie-brownie dessert, and even the thickness of their pizza boxes.\n\nDown the hall from the quality control techs, a half dozen young analysts huddle in cubicles where they review and grade 60,000 pizzas bought at Papa John’s outlets worldwide by secret shoppers.\n\nJordan Marr carefully studied an uploaded photo of a hot and spicy pizza from a restaurant in South Korea. Among the things Marr looked for was whether the pizza captured “cheese lock”— the all-important state of cheese hitting the crust—and proper topping spread so a diner would taste the jalapeño and meat in each bite of pizza.\n\nMarr, 26, who got his start with the company working at a Papa John’s restaurant in college, gave the pizza an 8.5 on a scale of 10. The company says they want nothing graded below an 8 to be served to customers.\n\n“You think pizza making is simple, but it is not here,” Marr said.\n\nPapa John's missing Camaro found in Detroit driveway\n\nBurger King heats up the fast food cheap deal war with McDonald's, Wendy's\n\nFollow USA TODAY correspondent Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/business/grocery-store-prices-inflation-september", "title": "Food prices are still surging — here's what's getting more expensive ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPrices at the grocery store continued to soar last month, adding even more pressure to shoppers’ wallets.\n\nThe food at home index, a proxy for grocery store prices, increased 0.7% in September from the month prior and a stunning 13% over the last year, according to new government data released Thursday.\n\nJust about everything got more expensive in September.\n\nFruits and vegetables surged 1.6% for the month, while cereals and bakery products rose 0.9%.

Meanwhile, rescue crews are searching for at least 13 people, including a group that disappeared after a vacation home in Wimberley, between Austin and San Antonio, was swept down a river and slammed into a bridge. Aerial views of the incredible flooding show Houston and its freeways under water — a traffic nightmare with miles of stuck cars. Houston Mayor Annise Parker says there may be as many as 4,000 properties with \"significant damage.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared disasters in 37 counties.\n\nNew deal could create another giant cable company\n\nWe keep hearing about cable companies trying to shake things up as more and more consumers ditch paid-TV for streaming services such as Netflix. The latest two companies to dance are Charter and Time Warner Cable. Charter Communications said today it's buying Time Warner Cable for $55.3 billion The move comes after Comcast and Time Warner Cable's planned marriage fell through last month. What this means for the industry: Charter is also buying Bright House Networks, a smaller cable company, and with the three companies integrated, Charter would become the second-largest TV-and-Internet provider in the U.S., trailing only Comcast. Why Charter and Time Warner Cable are merging: A bigger company would theoretically be in a stronger position to negotiate for better pricing from content providers and have a customer base large enough to offer streaming services and other tech. What it means for you: It's not known if any potential \"better pricing\" would be passed along as cost-savings for subscribers. The combined company probably wouldn't have any immediate effect on the way you watch TV. But it will have a lot more resources to innovate and push the boundaries of new products and services that could spread in the industry. Cutting the cord: If you're tired of waiting for pay-TV to figure its industry out, here are five alternatives to cable that might be right for you.\n\nSupreme Court agrees to hear important case on how we vote\n\nThis one is a little complicated, but it's a big deal. The Supreme Court said today that it will hear a case about whether state legislative districts must have an equal number of people or an equal number of voters. What that means: Voting districts have to be the same size, but it hasn't been clear if that means all the residents in a district or just the eligible voters. Why this matters: In states that have a large number of illegal immigrants, such as Texas, Arizona and California, drawing districts based on total population means voters in one district could have less clout than those in the next district that has few illegal immigrants. One more time: Say there is a rural, white district with no Hispanics and an urban district with 50% Hispanics, including 25% who can't vote (non-citizens). They each have 500,000 residents. In the latter district, fewer voters are choosing their elected officials, and each of those votes carries more weight than in the first district. Who filed the case: The case originated in Texas. The Project on Fair Representation, which is funding the lawsuit, opposes racial and ethnic classifications and has been behind Supreme Court challenges to affirmative action and the federal Voting Rights Act. What a ruling for the challengers would mean: Allowing districts based on the number of legal voters could shift power away from urban districts to more rural areas. \"And because urban areas are more Democratic, the ruling could help Republicans,\" said Richard Hasen, an expert on election law at the University of California-Irvine law school.\n\nTaco Bell and Pizza Hut are ditching fake ingredients\n\n\n\nMore and more people care about what they eat. They care about how their food is made and where it comes from. Fast-food chains are getting that. Taco Bell and Pizza Hut are the latest brands to commit to a menu redo as they phase out artificial ingredients this year. Example: Instead of \"black pepper flavor,\" Taco Bell will start using actual black pepper (yea, we didn't know that was happening either). Fast-food and fast-casual chains have been moving away from artificial ingredients. They want to attract consumers who want to eat natural, and they don't want to lose business to smaller rivals with more wholesome alternatives. More food companies are likely to follow, says Michelle Greenwald, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School. \"These other places don't want to be losing out to the Paneras and the Chipotles,\" she says. Mmmm. Chipotle.\n\nSmall conference schools face huge money pressure\n\n\n\nThe rich are different from you and me, F. Scott Fitzgerald once observed, to which Ernest Hemingway famously added: Yes, they have more money. The so-called Power Five conferences are different from the American Athletic and Mountain West conferences. They have lots more money. The annual USA TODAY Sports series on athletics department finances for Division I public schools illustrates the growing gap between major conferences and smaller conferences. Schools not considered part of the Power Five leagues are facing increased pressure to compete with those that spend more, while also facing a limit on subsides they receive from university sources. In addition, new NCAA legislation will allow schools to pay the full cost of attendance for scholarship athletes which creates another burden for the have-nots. How big was the gap during the 2013-14 school year? Oregon was No. 1 in generating more than $196 million in revenue, while Coppin State was last with just more than $3 million.

Is yours safe? How ...", "text": "Good news: There's a solar eclipse coming! Bad news: Looking at it can fry your eyes and immediately cause serious, lasting damage. Good news: You can safely look at it with a pair of eclipse glasses.\n\nReally bad news: You may not be able to trust the pair you bought online.\n\nThe American Astronomical Society previously warned people to make sure their glasses were ISO-certified but said they hadn't seen any evidence that scammers were selling unsafe copies. Last week, they announced that's no longer the case and the pair you got with a great deal online might let the sun burn out your retinas.\n\n\"In recent days it has become clear that one or more unidentified factories in China are now producing counterfeit eclipse glasses printed with the name and address of a different Chinese factory,\" the AAS said in a release.\n\nSome counterfeit glasses look nearly indistinguishable from the originals, with identical artwork and logos, and appear to be safe, the AAS said, but others that look legitimate are fakes, \"no darker than ordinary sunglasses,\" and extremely dangerous.\n\nDo you need special glasses to view a solar eclipse?\n\nDO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN DURING A SOLAR ECLIPSE.\n\nDon't look directly at the sun anytime, but during a total or partial eclipse it's easy to let your guard down. The only time it's safe is a very brief time during a totality when the sun is completely blocked by the moon, and there is nowhere in Florida that will be in the path of totality during the April 2024 eclipse.\n\nGazing at the sun without protective eyewear can cause serious damage such as blurred or altered vision and can destroy parts of the retina.\n\nSolar eclipse is Monday, April 8, 2024: Is there school that day in Florida, excused absence?\n\nHow to spot fake eclipse glasses\n\nThe first thing to check for is the ISO certification.\n\nSafe eclipse glasses (and filters, for cameras and telescopes) are at least 1,000 times darker than regular sunglasses and have been given an ISO 12312-2 certification. ISO stands for \"International Organization for Standardization.\" But scammers may put that on their counterfeit product whether it's true or not.\n\nAvoid any eclipse glasses that say they are NASA-approved. \"NASA does not approve any particular brand of solar viewers,\" the agency says on its website.\n\nLook for misspellings, incomplete addresses and other sloppy printing mistakes. ISO-certified glasses must have both the company's name and address.\n\nThe safest way is to buy your glasses directly from a vetted vendor. The AAS has a list at eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/viewers-filters. But don't assume that glasses from the names on the list are legit if you buy them from an online marketplace such as Amazon.\n\n\"We recommend not buying eclipse glasses from random sellers in online marketplaces,\" the AAS said in the release, \"even if they claim to get their products from a supplier on our list or to be approved by the AAS or NASA.\"\n\nHow to test eclipse glasses for safety\n\n“There’s no way to tell just by looking at them whether eclipse glasses are genuinely safe,” said Rick Fienberg, Project Manager of the AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force, “but it’s easy to tell if they are not safe.”\n\nPut your glasses on indoors and look around. You shouldn't be able to see anything at all through them \"except perhaps very bright lights, which should appear very faint through the glasses,\" the AAS said. If you can see anything else at all, your glasses are not safe.\n\nNext, take them outside on a sunny day, put them on and look around. \"You still shouldn’t see anything through them,\" the AAS said, \"except perhaps the Sun’s reflection off a shiny surface or a puddle, which again should appear very faint.\"\n\nIf you glance at the sun after that, which the AAS advises not to do for more than a second, the sun should appear as a sharp-edged disc that's comfortably bright.\n\nIf your glasses seem safe but you aren't completely certain, get another pair or use these sparingly and only in bursts of two to three seconds every five minutes or so. Do not use glasses, even legit ones, that have scratches on them.\n\n“Staring at a partial solar eclipse for more than a few seconds at a time, even through perfectly safe solar viewers, isn’t much fun anyway,” Fienberg said. “It’s almost impossible to detect the Moon’s motion across the Sun in real time except with magnification, and you must never look through magnifying optics while wearing eclipse glasses.”\n\nWhere can I get aas.org eclipse glasses?\n\nThere are more than 50 authorized dealers listed on the AAS site, including large retail chain stores including Walmart, Lowes and Staples. But if you buy from them do so in person. The chains may use different suppliers for online sales, the AAS said.\n\nFree glasses are available while supplies last at several libraries in Florida but call first to see if they have any left.\n\nPopular prescription glasses retailer Warby Parker will be handing out free eclipse glasses at any of its locations starting April 1, maximum two per household, while supplies last. You can get one from participating Sonic Drive-In locations. with the purchase of a new Blackout Slush Float.\n\nOther ways to watch the eclipse\n\nThe safest way to look at the eclipse is not to look up at all.\n\nIt's easy to make a pinhole projector that will cast the image of the eclipse onto something like a piece of cardboard. The AAS has a guide to set one up.\n\nAny household object with little holes in such as a colander, a slotted spoon or even a Ritz cracker held over a white sheet of paper. The image of the solar eclipse will filter through the tiny holes.\n\nSolar eclipse events in Florida: List of festivals, planetarium celebrations in April 2024\n\nWhen is the solar eclipse?\n\nThe total eclipse will hit the coast of Mexico on April 8, 2024, around 11:07 a.m. PDT and leave the continental North America at 5:16 NDT. The partial eclipse will begin first as the edge of the moon becomes visible, and then about an hour and 20 minutes later the totality will begin and last for three or four minutes before the sun begins to appear again.\n\nFlorida residents should start to see the eclipse beginning around 1:35 p.m. EDT, with the midpoint at 2:55.\n\nDepending on where you are in Florida, anywhere from just over half of the sun to over 3/4 of it will be obscured by the moon from our angle.

But many fear DuPont's celebrated research operations will be on the chopping block.\n\nDelaware is home to two of DuPont's most vital scientific laboratories – The Experimental Station, a 150-acre campus on Route 141 in New Castle County, and the Stine Haskell Research Center along Elkton Road in Newark. Combined, the two facilities employ 3,100, many in high-paying research-driven positions.\n\nSteve Isberg, an associate professor of finance at the University of Baltimore, said cuts to DuPont's research budget would have a devastating impact on the Delaware economy.\n\n\"There is a multiplier effect on the economy when you lose high-paying jobs,\" he said. \"Those people will leave their high-income homes, impacting the housing community, which will then reverberate into the local consumer markets.\"\n\nIn a two-hour interview with The News Journal, Peltz and senior officials for his New York hedge fund Trian Fund Management did not comment about specific plans for the research operations.\n\n\"Research and development is an important element of DuPont's future success, but like the rest of the business it needs to be well-managed and produce acceptable returns,\" he said.\n\nArthur B. Winkleblack, former chief financial officer of H. J. Heinz Co. and one of Trian's four nominees for DuPont's board, said costs could be streamlined by developing products that will generate the most sales – and producing those products in markets they're consumed.\n\n\"We would rather have research and development closer to the consumer,\" Winkleblack said.\n\nDuPont, which has market capitalization of $67 billion, operates in more than 90 countries with more than 150 research and development centers throughout the globe.\n\nIts Experimental Station in Wilmington was built in 1903 and is the birthplace of the company's most important and profitable products – nylon, Kevlar, Tyvek and the world's first synthetic rubber, neoprene. Roughly 2,500 employees work at the 150-acre campus, including hundreds of PhDs.\n\nStine Haskell, with 600 employees, is growing. DuPont is building a $35 million soybean research facility in Newark that will include two state-of-the-art automated greenhouses. The project is expected to be completed in 2016, with room for future expansion.\n\nWorldwide, DuPont employs 63,000 people. Its 7,000 Delaware employees constitute 11 percent of the state's workforce.\n\nGov. Jack Markell said a reduction in research and development would undermine the state's identity as a global science leader. He's worried about Peltz's plans to divide DuPont into separate companies.\n\n\"There is significant cross-pollination among the scientists working there,\" the governor said. \"If you split DuPont in two, what happens to that cross-pollination? My gut tells me that it would not be positive.\"\n\nPeltz also called for turning seven business units into two separate companies. Agriculture, nutrition and health and industrial biosciences would be split into one company. The remaining units, comprised of DuPont's cyclical, high-cash generating businesses, performance materials, safety and protection and electronics and communications, would become another single company.\n\nShould Peltz win, what was once DuPont could be split into three independent units. The company has already decided to spin off its performance chemicals unit, Chemours, this summer.\n\nShareholders vote on nominees in the proxy fight on May 13, and a recent Wells Fargo analyst report predicted a loss for Peltz. The meeting, open only to DuPont stock owners, is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. at the chemical giant's headquarters at Chestnut Run Plaza.\n\nJohn Roberts, an analyst at UBS Securities, said he has not seen any sound data to determine which side will win, but acknowledged that incumbents, or sitting companies, usually have the edge in proxy elections.\n\n\"This is like any other election process,\" he said. \"Some vote for the incumbent and some vote for change.\"\n\nTrian Chief Investment Officer Ed Garden argues it's been years since DuPont scored on a success innovation – a sign the company's research and development reputation is larger than its actions.\n\n\"It's clear something is wrong because there is no next nylon or Kevlar,\" he said. \"We need to go on the inside and work with other board members to figure out why that is.\"\n\nParry Norling, who worked 16 years at the Experimental Station as a research manager, argues that DuPont's research and development efforts are functioning well, and are crucial to the company's long- and short-term success. Separating DuPont's business units could negatively impact the station, he said, because groups across multiple sectors collaborated to create new products such as the ink Hewlett-Packard sells for printers.\n\n\"You can't separate those units,\" Norling said. \"Sometimes it was two units and someone from central research working as a three-way team.\"\n\nThe success of one unit can lead to a critical development for another unit, Norling added. For example, the printer ink innovation lead to the creation of a dye to color carpets.\n\nPeltz has called for DuPont to increase its debt-to-equity ratio, arguing a modest amount of debt could help the company improve its earnings-per-share target. Competitor Monsanto Co. took a similar step last year.\n\nSome analysts said the Trian proposal is flawed because it overlooks DuPont's standing as a global science leader. Products range from Mylar and fungicides to pharmaceuticals and bioscience products, creating an economic wake that includes numerous support businesses inside and outside Delaware.\n\nIsberg, of the University of Baltimore, said \"DuPont lives and dies by its research and development.\"\n\n\"It needs cash flow for its research efforts,\" he said. \"If DuPont loads itself up with debt and another fixed-interest payment, that cannibalizes your ability to do future research and development.\"\n\nTrian began gathering DuPont shares in the summer of 2013 when it disclosed the purchase of a 0.6 percent stake in the company. Since then, the hedge fund has amassed a 2.7 percent share of DuPont stock, estimated to be worth $1.8 billion. In September 2014, Trian sent a sharp letter to DuPont's board that lauded the company's decision to spin off its performance chemicals unit, Chemours, but demanded DuPont further divide the company into two distinct units.\n\nPeltz said he tried for two years to work with the company to reduce spending and improve performance before he initiated the proxy war, but he was rebuffed by Lead Independent Director Alexander M. \"Sandy\" Cutler, who also is CEO of Eaton Corp., a power management company based in suburban Cleveland.\n\nIn February, Peltz met with DuPont Chief Executive Officer Ellen Kullman and Cutler to discuss a potential compromise. Under the agreement, DuPont would support Myers for its board if Trian agreed to back its investor slate. DuPont officials said Peltz walked away from the agreement because the company would not select him as the potential board member.\n\nDuring his interview with The News Journal, Peltz said if DuPont does not want him on the board, he would be willing to step aside and let Garden, a proposed alternate nominee, take his seat.\n\nCutler said that a Trian nominee joining DuPont's board could have negative repercussions.\n\n\"People say, What harm can one director do?\" Cutler said. \"But this is a comprehensive attack on the leadership of DuPont's board with a present agenda to leverage the balance sheet and break up the company. We think it doesn't create value for shareholders.\"\n\nCutler denied that he campaigned to keep Peltz off the board. He said the board talked with the four Trian nominees and concluded they did not possess the skills needed for boardroom seats. Cutler called the proxy vote a \"comprehensive attack on the leadership of DuPont with a present agenda to leverage the balance sheet and break up the company.\"\n\nHe said a new concern is that Peltz wants to have to up to 20 Trian employees act as analysts for the four new board members. Allowing non-board members to play a role in board decisions has the potential to run afoul of Securities & Exchange Commission regulations, Cutler said.\n\n\"Trian, in a sense, becomes shadow management\" if the proxy vote goes its way, Cutler said. \"The corporate governance model that comes with Trian is very inappropriate. Their proposal is littered with corporate governance conflicts of interest that are simply unacceptable.\"\n\nDuPont says Trian's claims about lackluster growth are inaccurate. Kullman noted that their multi-year strategy has created a stronger company that delivered shareholder returns of 266 percent over the past six years she's been CEO, outperforming both the Standard & Poor's 500 and the company's proxy peers. Employees also benefited from stronger returns, she said.\n\n\"We are both a long-term and short-term company,\" Kullman said in an interview with The News Journal.\n\nShe claimed Peltz is focused on generating a short-term stock bump at the expense of DuPont's long-term growth. And she worries what would happen to the company down the road.\n\n\"Our long-term approach has helped us emerge stronger from the financial crisis,\" she said. \"We've seen that strategy generate shareholder returns. The change has been hard in the short-term, but in the long-term it makes sense.\"\n\nIn February, she blasted Peltz's record with Chemtura, a manufacturer of flame-retardant plastics. Trian founding partner Edward Garden got a seat on Chemtura's board. Garden eventually resigned from the board in 2009 and Chemtura declared bankruptcy a few months later.\n\nFormer DuPont Chief Executive Edgar S. Woolard Jr., the former Apple Computer Inc. board chairman credited with helping to bring Steve Jobs back to the company, said he believes Kullman has developed a winning strategy.\n\nPeltz, by contrast, is proposing to take the company in an unknown direction that \"may or may not work,\" solely for the purpose of a short-term boost in the stock price, he said. Woolard finds distasteful the quick-turn approach employed by activist investors, noting that companies also have a responsibility to their communities and employees.\n\n\"To totally disrupt the company to get the stock price up in the short term, including laying off a lot of people, seems reckless and inappropriate,\" Woolard said. \"I can't believe Trian is going to get a majority of shareholders to vote for it.\"\n\nHe praised the leadership of both Kullman and the board.\n\n\"I'm sure if Peltz's logic was compelling,\" he added, \"the board and leadership would listen.\"\n\nPeltz believes his overarching moves could elevate DuPont's stock price above $120 per share. On Friday, the stock traded at $71. As Peltz sees it, DuPont will become a leaner, stronger operation – and the benefits will trickle down to other business in the state.\n\nIf the company does not right its ship, Peltz said, its headquarters city of Wilmington, which has struggled in recent years to overcome its reputation for violent crime, will take another punch in the gut.\n\n\"If DuPont starts to grow, Wilmington will get better,\" Peltz said.\n\nHowever, he criticized the company for assembling a hospitality portfolio created for the benefit of the employees and the community. In the wake of the Peltz proxy fight, the company in January sold The DuPont Theatre in downtown Wilmington to The Grand Opera House, a move that \"represents a strategic and mutually beneficial business decision,\" Kullman said in a statement at the time.\n\nCompany officials later announced plans to move the entire company headquarters out of the DuPont Building at 10th and Market streets at Rodney Square, home to central offices since 1908. About 1,000 workers will be relocating to Chestnut Run Plaza at Lancaster Pike and Centre Road in July. The downtown space will then house offices for Chemours.\n\nDuPont also is taking bids for sale or management of the Hotel du Pont and the DuPont Country Club, a source familiar with the process said. Three hotel parking lots also have been sold recently.\n\nAnother concern among Delawareans is the possibility that Peltz could cut DuPont retiree health benefits. DuPont has an estimated 81,000 retirees, 10,000 who call Delaware home.\n\nThere are no federal or state regulations prohibiting companies from eliminating or reducing retiree health care benefits. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, does not protect retiree health benefits. Retirees only recourse is a breach of contract claim under the 1974 federal statute.\n\nMadan Joshi, a microbiologist who retired from DuPont in 2007, said a cut in retiree health care benefits could be \"a big blow\" for DuPont retirees who did not have high-paying jobs.\n\nHe also is concerned about current employees in their 50s who are nearing retirement. If Trian wins the proxy fight, he asked, would its board members push for cuts to retirement benefits of current employees?\n\n\"My concern is about people who are on the edge financially and in terms of their ability to retire,\" Joshi said. \"These Trian people, their goal is not to make the company more productive and stabilize things. It's to get in and makes cuts, cash in and go somewhere else. That's what their track record is.\"\n\nPeltz has not threatened to cut DuPont retirees health benefits, but his actions at ketchup maker H. J. Heinz Co. have local retirees worried. After two Trian candidates joined the board, Heinz stopped providing retirees with health insurance and created a reimbursement account. The company started with a $7,000 contribution the first year, but eventually lowered it to $3,500.\n\nIn March, a group of former DuPont employees discussed the possibility of filing a class action lawsuit if the company reduces or eliminates retiree health benefits. They have not yet spoken with an attorney about a potential case.\n\nIn a statement, Trian said its plan to improve DuPont's performance is the best way to protect retiree benefits.\n\n\"Trian's interests are fully aligned with those of DuPont's current and former employees, customers, stockholders and the Wilmington community,\" Carissa Felger, a spokeswoman for the hedge fund. \"If elected, Trian's nominees will strive to help DuPont to always be in a position to honor its obligations to current and retired employees.\"\n\nThis proxy battle is unprecedented, the first in DuPont's 213-year history. Throughout the majority of its history, the company was controlled by the du Pont family. While there was a nasty public fight among family members from 1915 to 1918 over the sale of company stock, this is the first time DuPont has fended off an activist investor.\n\nPeltz came to national attention in 1997 when one of his investment vehicles, Triarc Cos., acquired Snapple from Quaker Oats. Snapple was combined with other beverage brands and sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000.\n\nHe founded Trian in 2005, and within a year launched a proxy war for Heinz. He succeeded in placing two new directors, including himself, on the company's board.\n\nPeltz pushed for cost-saving ideas that resulted in Heinz selling or shuttering 15 factories and reducing spending by $355 million. The leaner Heinz attracted a venture between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Capital. The companies paid $28 billion, or $72.28 per share, in an April 2013 sale, generating a 20 percent return on investment for shareholders.\n\nIn 2008, Triarc merged with fast-food giant Wendy's. Peltz pushed the burger chain to sell Tim Horton's, an under-performing doughnut subsidiary. Wendy's also consolidated three marketing units into one and cut 375 corporate jobs in a series a moves that saved $100 million.\n\nGarden said the goal was to eliminate unneeded spending and concentrate on core products.\n\n\"We are focused on driving growth while reducing oppressive bureaucracy,\" Garden said. \"It is not just about cutting costs.\"\n\nWinkleblack, the former Heinz official, disputes Cutler's view that Trian is looking to divide companies. Peltz waged a successful proxy battle with Heinz in 2006, and Winkleblack initially opposed Peltz's admittance to the company board of directors on similar grounds. When the dust settled, Winkleblack said, Peltz worked with the board and had success creating shareholder value.\n\n\"To Nelson's credit, he sat down with me after a bitter proxy war and said, 'Let's make money for shareholders,' \" Winkleblack said.\n\nTrian's Garden said the hedge fund wants to help reposition DuPont, to bring in new ideas and to help it make smart decisions. Trian officials have said DuPont is too tied to its science legacy and isn't creative enough.\n\n\"We are not dogmatic,\" Garden said. \"What we are trying to do is facilitate a debate on why DuPont's business units are not best in class when it comes to sales growth and margins.\"\n\nThat view is fiercely opposed by DuPont officials, who hammer home the fact that shares have increased 266 percent since Kullman became chief executive in 2009.\n\nThe Peltz plan is fundamentally flawed, Kullman argued. Were DuPont to make all of the \"functional and corporate costs\" proposed by Trian, Kullman said, it would only total $2.8 billion – less than the $4 billion in fat Peltz believes to exist in the company.\n\n\"If we do all the cuts Peltz wants, we could not close the books,\" she said, adding later, \"We are not an underperforming company.\"\n\nPeltz's lack of details troubles Markell.\n\n\"How can I take comfort in words that are not backed up without a focused strategy?\" the governor asked.\n\nThe question comes down to whether the company is performing as poorly as Peltz claims, said Roberts of UBS in New York. If that's the case, layoffs are inevitable regardless of the proxy war's outcome, he said.\n\n\"If Peltz is correct, those jobs are a matter of time,\" Roberts said. \"If DuPont is not producing results, sooner or later something has to change and he could bring the change earlier rather than later.\"\n\nMatt Arnold, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis, said it's likely any staffing reductions will be spread across the entire portfolio.\n\n\"Job losses could not just be a Delaware situation, it could be an everywhere situation,\" Arnold said. \"The heightened amount of scrutiny on costs could imply a headcount reduction across every element of the business all around the world.\"\n\nIsberg predicted that no matter the outcome of the proxy vote, DuPont will change.\n\n\"The real question is not will some kind of restructuring happen,\" he said. \"The real question is how is it going to happen. There has been too much attention paid to DuPont for the company not to do some kind of restructuring.\"\n\nA sign that DuPont may consider structural reform came in February with the additions of Edward Breen and James Gallogly to the company's board.\n\nGallogly is former chairman and CEO of LyondellBassell Industries, a tightly integrated chemical company similar to DuPont. While guiding it out of bankruptcy, Gallogly resisted urges to separate LyondellBassell's business sectors.\n\nBreen was chairman and CEO of security systems-maker Tyco International, where he faced his own battles for control of the company's board. Immediately upon being appointed CEO, Breen sought to replace Tyco's entire board of directors.\n\n\"The two new directors have worked in the area of restructuring,\" Isberg said. \"To me, bringing those two directors say DuPont is going to do more house cleaning here.\"\n\nIn that respect, it's likely DuPont will continue feeling pressure to analyze core business operations even if Trian is not successful in gaining seats, Arnold said.\n\nAsked about what DuPont will look like with himself and three other Trian board members, Peltz said he has the best interest of the company in mind – restoring the company to greatness.\n\n\"My career was not built on cutting costs,\" he said. \"I don't believe you can cut your way into prosperity.\"\n\nContact Maureen Milford at 324-2881 or mmilford@delawareonline.com.

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge. The larger rooms also accommodate larger family support networks.\n\nTo learn more about Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center childbirth services or to find a physician, visit tennovanorthknoxville.com/maternity-care-services or call 865-859-8000.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center offers a free e-newsletter with a monthly dose of health and wellness inspiration sent directly to your inbox from a trusted medical source.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth.

Ever notice those historical markers along Volunteer Landing?

Jack Neely, historian of the Knoxville History Project, did the research for those markers back in the 1990s, and will help tell the stories, including that of Vagabondia, the long-vanished riverfront home of author Frances Hodgson Burnett that inspired the title of one of her early novels. It was surprisingly near the ramshackle houseboat home of Cornelius Suttree, the stoic protagonist of a very different novel by Cormac McCarthy.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

We used to dominate the field, and now we import it all from different countries,\" Trump said, adding that a single shipyard in China produces more ships every year than all U.S. shipyards combined.\n\n\"Chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" he added.\n\nThe baseline tariff applies to about 185 countries in all, even the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands, remote external territories of Australia in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean that have more penguins and seals than people and no apparent trade activity.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nReciprocal tariffs target about 60 additional countries\n\nTrump said he is imposing additional tailored tariffs on about 60 countries that contribute the most to the U.S. trade deficit and have placed the most barriers on U.S. exports.\n\nA White House official called the countries \"the worst offenders.\" Rates of the targeted tariffs have been set at about half what these countries charge on U.S. exports.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries are among the nations hit with the highest reciprocal tariffs, led by Cambodia, 49%; Laos, 48%; and Vietnam, 46%.\n\nNew duties for other major U.S. trading partners include an additional 34% tariff on goods from China, a 20% tariff on goods from nations in the European Union; and a 26% tariff on goods from India.\n\nFor China, the 34% tariff is on top of recently imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese goods, meaning Chinese imports are effectively hit with a 54% tariff.\n\n\"For years, hard working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense,\" Trump said. \"But now it's our turn to prosper.\"\n\nRussia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus are exempt from the tariffs. The White House cited previously imposed sanctions on each that \"preclude any meaningful trade with these nations.\" Trump recently threatened sanctions on imports from Russia if President Vladimir Putin does not end the war in Ukraine.\n\nTrump's universal 10% tariffs are set to go into effect at 12:01 am EDT Saturday, and his reciprocal tariffs will begin April 9. Trump's previously announced 25% tariffs on foreign automobiles and auto parts, will also kick in this week.\n\nMexico and Canada exempt from new tariffs\n\nNeighboring Mexico and Canada are exempt also from Trump's latest tariffs, but the 25% tariffs that Trump previously levied on both countries will remain intact.\n\nTrump levied those tariffs last month as retaliation to the flow of fentanyl from both countries and migrants from Mexico. He later agreed to exempt goods that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump signed in his first term.\n\nImports from Canada and Mexico that are compliant with the USMCA will continue to see no tariff, according to the White House, while non-USMCA compliant goods will be hit with a 25% tariff.\n\nNon-compliant energy products from these countries and potash ‒ key ingredient to make fertilizer used by farmers ‒ will face a lower 10% tariff.\n\nEconomists fear economic downturn\n\nSome economists expressed alarm at the scale of Trump's across-the-board tariffs, saying they're even larger than expected and warning that an economic downturn could result.\n\n\"Those are really big tariffs, and if fully implemented, I think they'll drive the economy into a ditch,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, told USA TODAY.\n\nZandi said the tariffs are a tax increase that will result in higher prices for consumers and weakened profits for companies that import goods. How the economy responds will depend whether Trump moves fully ahead on the duties or agrees to various carve-outs, exemptions and relief for farmers, he said.\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has deployed a whiplash approach to tariffs, threatening tariffs on some nations, only to pull back after receiving concessions. Trump's order imposing the tariffs includes \"modification authority\" that allows Trump to increase or decrease the tariffs rates.\n\n\"If you take those numbers at face value, I just don't know how the economy can digest that. I think that would be the prescription for a downturn,\" Zandi said. \"They're on the very high end of what I anticipated.\"\n\nRetaliation expected from U.S. trading partners\n\nTrump's massive round of tariffs is expected to trigger retaliatory tariffs from key U.S. trading partners, further igniting a global trade war.\n\nAhead of Trump's announcement, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signaled plans for a significant response from Europe in a speech to European Parliament members.\n\n“Europe holds a lot of cards, from trade to technology to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm countermeasures if necessary,\" von der Leyen said. \"All instruments are on the table.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned other nations that if they respond by raising tariffs on U.S. exports, the Trump administration will hit back.\n\n\"My advice to every country right now is do not retaliate,\" Bessent said in an interview with Fox News following Trump's announcement. \"Sit back. Take it in. Let's see how it goes. Because if you retaliate, there will be escalation. If you don’t retaliate, this is the high-water mark.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/01/tariffs-trump-markets-economy-live-updates/82741953007/", "title": "Tariffs updates: Republican senators to rebuke Trump on Canada tax", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Trump's tariffs for Tuesday, April 1. For the latest news, view our story for Wednesday, April 2.\n\nIn what would be a rebuke to President Donald Trump, a Senate resolution to end the emergency declaration enabling tariffs against Canada is likely to have enough Republican votes to pass the chamber, according to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky.\n\nPaul is co-sponsoring the resolution with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, who wants to force GOP lawmakers to go on the record on the policy. Trump implemented the emergency declaration in February to put tariffs on Canada for not going far enough to stop fentanyl from crossing into the United States.\n\nCanadian officials have said fentanyl seizures by U.S. agents at the northern border made up less than 0.1% of total U.S. seizures of the drug from 2022 to 2024.\n\nPaul and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, have publicly said they will vote for the resolution. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said she is likely to support it. Paul told reporters Tuesday afternoon that a fourth Republican is likely to vote in favor, though he would not say who.\n\n\"I think government by emergency rule is a mistake,'' Paul said. \"The power to tax they say is the power to destroy. The power to tax is considered one of the most important powers and so it was given to Congress. ... I think it's probably one of the more important votes that we'll have maybe in a generation.\"\n\nThe outcome wouldn't stop Trump from imposing the tax on Canadian goods because the resolution would have to pass the House to be binding. With a slim majority in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson likely wouldn't risk bringing it up for a vote.\n\nKaine said Tuesday morning the Senate vote would probably be delayed until Wednesday − when Trump plans to unveil his controversial global tariffs − because of the marathon floor speech by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Trump administration froze several dozen research grants with Princeton University without a concrete explanation, school president Christopher Eisgruber said in an e-mail to the campus community, the latest instance of the president targeting institutions of higher learning. The federal government has also suspended funding for Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania and put Harvard contracts and grants under review. The administration has accused some schools of not doing enough to combat antisemitism.\n\n∎ Former Costa Rican President and Nobel Prize winner Oscar Arias said the U.S. revoked his visa to enter the country weeks after he said on social media that Trump was acting like \"a Roman emperor.\"\n\n∎ Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said he has begun a process to remove remaining tariffs on U.S. imports, which would need the approval of Economy Minister Nir Barkat.\n\nTrump willing to negotiate on tariffs, White House says\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that Trump could potentially negotiate lower tariffs with companies or countries if they change policies, but he aims to end trade imbalances that have gone on for decades.\n\n“The ultimate change for these companies and these countries will happen when they decide to do business in the United States,” Leavitt said. “Certainly the president is always up to take a phone call, always up for a good negotiation, but he is very much focused on fixing the wrongs of the past.”\n\nBesides Canada negotiating potentially lower tariffs with the Commerce Department, a number of other countries are calling Trump, Leavitt said.\n\n“If they want to be absolved of that tariff, they can come to the United States of America to do business, bring their jobs here,” she said. In the administration's view, Leavitt said, “Too many foreign countries have their markets closed to our exports.”\n\nTariffs rates set, will be announced Wednesday\n\nTrump has finalized the tariff rates he will impose Wednesday on imports from countries across the world, Leavitt said. The press secretary declined to say Tuesday whether Trump has landed at 20% tariffs for most imports to the U.S., as the Washington Post reported White House aides have explored.\n\n“The president said last night he has made a decision and a determination (on the rates). I was with him in the Oval Office earlier, and he is going to announce that decision tomorrow,” Leavitt said.\n\n“He is with his trade and tariff team right now perfecting,'' she said.\n\nLeavitt said the tariffs will go into effect immediately, and collections on the duties begins Thursday.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House: Americans should 'trust' Trump on tariffs\n\nTrump and other administration officials have dismissed the warnings of many economists that tariffs will drive up prices and possibly tumble the nation into recession, arguing the duties will prompt foreign companies to invest in U.S. projects to avoid the import taxes.\n\nLeavitt said the administration is working to reduce the cost of living, pointing to regulation changes at the Environmental Protection Agency and policies to unleash American energy she said would bring down costs.\n\n“You should trust what this president did for you in his first term,” Leavitt said. “He effectively utilized tariffs while driving down inflation.”\n\nRepublicans have largely stood by Trump as he implemented the tariffs, though many have said they're worried the economic ramifications will hurt people in their states.\n\nWhat time is Trump's tariff announcement April 2?\n\nTrump will formally introduce the tariffs at a 4 p.m. event in the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. It will be his first event in the storied space just outside the Oval Office since he returned to power.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking on Fox News on Monday evening, said the tariffs would be followed by tax breaks Trump promised during his run for office − such as no taxes on tips, overtime or Social Security and a tax deduction for purchasing an American car.\n\n\"For the first time in decades ... we are going to make the global trading system fair for American workers,\" Bessent said.\n\nHouse speaker defends tariffs: 'Will make sense for Americans'\n\nJohnson told reporters Tuesday morning that Trump's plans to implement massive tariffs on the United States' former trading allies \"makes a lot of common sense.\"\n\nThe trade disparities that began after World War II are over, Johnson argued, and there is now a much more integrated global economy.\n\n\"The president is absolutely right when he says that we have to think about America's interests first,\" Johnson said. He later added: \"It may be rocky in the beginning, but I think that this will make sense for Americans and it will help all Americans.\"\n\nReport: Most imports could face 20% tariffs\n\nWhite House aides have drafted plans for 20% tariffs on most goods imported to the United States, the Washington Post reported Tuesday. White House advisers cautioned that several options remain in play.\n\nTrump said Sunday that reciprocal tariffs will target all nations that impose duties on U.S. goods, and the White House said Monday that any country that has treated Americans unfairly should expect to receive a tariff.\n\nFinancial markets may not be soothed by Trump announcement\n\nU.S. stocks closed a choppy session mostly higher Tuesday, a day after March closed with the largest monthly declines in more than two years for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and a day before the extent of Trump's large-scale tariffs is revealed.\n\nJason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said Wednesday's announcement may not calm the unsettled markets.\n\n\"As much as investors might hope for it, this is unlikely to put an end to tariff uncertainty,\" Draho said. \"Uncertainty and market volatility are likely to stay high in the near term as investors recalibrate their outlooks after these events.\"\n\nBessent said the tariffs, combined with tax breaks and corporate investment, will push the economy to new heights. “There's been a line through the Oval Office of countries and companies who want to bring capital, jobs and factories to the United States,\" Bessent said.\n\nLayoffs begin at Health and Human Services\n\nThe Trump administration began firing staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday, the beginning of a plan to cut 10,000 jobs at the Department of Health and Human Services, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.\n\nAn FDA employee said staff had to present their badges at the building entrance and those who had been fired were given paperwork and told to return home, according to one source. Combined with HHS employees who previously accepted buyouts and others who were already fired, the agency's workforce will be sliced by one-quarter from 82,000 full-time employees to 62,000 since Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThe cuts are part of a broader plan by Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk to shrink staffing levels in federal departments and agencies.\n\nWhy is Trump calling April 2 'Liberation Day'\n\nTrump has referred to April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" since he assumed the nation's highest office in January. The president has pledged to enact reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners as well as scores of other nations that contribute to the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit.\n\nTrump's motive is to use tariffs as a way to force other countries to lower their own tariffs on U.S. goods and services, so as to create a more balanced economic playing field for U.S. exports and to create a strong incentive for companies to manufacture goods such as cars inside the U.S. to avoid paying the tax. The administration has already announced 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, on imported automobiles and automobile parts and on goods from Mexico and Canada.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that April 2 \"is a liberation day for our country because we’re going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries.\"\n\n− James Powell and Todd Spangler\n\nAre any cars actually 100% American?\n\nTrump said he wants to spur more manufacturing in the United States with his new tariff targeting foreign car imports, but defining an American-made car isn’t easy. Online automotive marketplace Cars.com found just over half of new inventory vehicles saw final assembly in the U.S. About 19% were assembled in Mexico, 4.2% in Canada and 1.4% in China, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\n\n\"No cars are actually 100% made in the United States, with parts sourced from the United States,” Edmunds consumer insights analyst Joseph Yoon said. “It’s going to be a big, big deal for the auto industry, globally, if the tariffs are implemented and enforced at face value.” Read more here.\n\n− Bailey Schulz\n\nTariffs 101: Who pays for them?\n\nTariffs are primarily levied on imports, typically to protect industries in the country levying them. Tariffs make imports more expensive, thus making local goods cheaper by comparison. Tariffs also can provide income that can be used to support local industries, fund public programs or cover government expenditures.\n\nAnd they can serve as bargaining tools to win concessions from trading partners.\n\n\"While tariffs may seem to penalize foreign producers by making their goods or services less competitive, the reality is that U.S. consumers and businesses ultimately bear the cost,\" the Wilson Center scholars Diego Marroquín Bitar and Valeria Moy write in a \"Tariffs 101\" analysis.\n\nE.J. Antoni, a public finance economist and senior fellow at the conservative Committee to Unleash Prosperity, disagrees, saying in his opinion piece for Fox News earlier this month that economic history shows tariffs are always at least partly paid for by exporters, not just customers.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/23/trump-sanctions-russia-end-ukraine-war/77557215007/", "title": "Trump threatens Russia with sanctions in attempt to end Ukraine war", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump issued Russian President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum on Wednesday – make a deal with me to end the Ukraine war or pay a hefty economic price.\n\nTrump said he'd put all manner of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and vaguely threatened secondary punishment against countries who do business with Moscow.\n\n\"We can do it the easy way, or the hard way – and the easy way is always better,\" he said. \"It’s time to MAKE A DEAL. NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!\"\n\nThe missive followed a warning from Trump the previous evening that sanctions against Russia were likely if Putin refused to enter into negotiations to end the war. Trump repeatedly pledged to quickly end the bloodshed when he was a candidate, claiming at various points that he'd do it as president-elect or within 24 hours of arriving at the White House.\n\nBut the conflict has proved harder to solve than Trump previously indicated — an issue he has blamed, in part, on constraints he faced in directly negotiating with Putin.\n\nTrump told reporters during a January press conference that Putin wanted to meet with him but he felt it would be improper while Joe Biden was still in office.\n\nThe Logan Act prevents private citizens from corresponding with foreign governments with the intent of undermining U.S. foreign policy. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden quit speaking to Putin. His administration adopted the stance that the U.S. would provide military assistance to Ukraine for as long it takes to drive out Russian troops, unless Kyiv decided it wanted to change course.\n\nTrump said Tuesday evening that Putin disrespected Biden and wouldn't be permitted to treat him that way. He said he'd spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and would be talking with Putin.\n\n\"President Zelenskyy would like to have peace. He's told me that very strongly. He'd like to have peace, but it takes two to tango,\" Trump told USA TODAY during an impromptu news conference.\n\nAs for when and where he'd meet with Putin, the president replied: \"Anytime they want.\"\n\nAnd if Putin did not agree to enter into negotiations, Trump said he was \"likely\" to put sanctions on Russia.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for the world: Sign up for USA TODAY's Russia-Ukraine Crisis newsletter.\n\nWar in Ukraine: Putin draws a nuclear red line for the West\n\nRobert O’Brien, who served as national security adviser during Trump's first term, said in an interview prior to the exchange that he believed the new administration would try to pressure Russia into cutting a deal by ratcheting up sanctions on the aggressor nation.\n\n“I would expect President Trump to say, look, Vladimir Putin, if you don't come to the table and do so quickly, the sanctions are gonna be pretty significant and devastating,” O’Brien said.\n\nO’Brien said both sides would need to make concessions. But the former Trump national security adviser, who also served as as his special envoy for hostages affairs, did not believe the president was interested in a scenario where Putin would be able to rebuild his army and attack Ukraine in several years.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, the U.S. president said he was not \"not looking to hurt Russia\" and emphasized that he \"always had a very good relationship\" with Putin prior to the start of the conflict. \"We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process.\"\n\nThe Russian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump sidesteps questions about how ceasefire would work\n\nMultiple times as a candidate, Trump declared that he could end the war in one day, going so far at a September debate as to claim he’d get it done during the presidential transition. He backed off that timeline as the inauguration drew closer, vowing instead to have the war wrapped up within the next six months.\n\n“That's a tough one, much tougher than it would have been before it started, I can tell you that,” Trump told reporters at a Jan. 7 news conference at Mar-a-Lago. “A deal could have been made just by an average dealmaker. A deal could have been made on that,” he added.\n\nLast month Trump called for an immediate ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine after a meeting with Zelenskyy. But he has not said how one would work or how he plans to resolve the war. He has also declined to say whether he’d continue to provide weapons to Ukraine and sympathized with Russia over its concerns about Ukraine’s bid to join NATO.\n\nHe told reporters on Tuesday evening that he believes the European Union should be sending more money to Ukraine than the United States does.\n\n\"I mean, what are we stupid? I guess the answer is yes,\" he said, answering his own rhetorical question.\n\nThe European Union says it has spent $145 billion since the start of the war on financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance to Ukraine. It has also committed to providing $20 billion in loans. The U.S. government has appropriated $175 billion to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdvisers to Trump have talked at various points about freezing the war along the current battle lines during talks, delaying NATO membership for Kyiv for a period of 10 to 20 years in exchange for substantial military assistance and the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, and the establishment of a demilitarized zone that would be patrolled by European peacekeepers to enforce an agreement.\n\nNearly three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow occupies just under 20% of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nUkraine has managed to take back some of its occupied territory, but its efforts to mount a counteroffensive have largely stalled as Russia has surged weapons and soldiers to Ukraine's northeast Kharkiv region with support from North Korean troops.\n\nRussia has meanwhile continued to bombard Ukrainian cities with missile and drone attacks, and it is trying to blockade its ports. Ukraine has stepped up drone attacks on Russian ships and infrastructure and also fired at targets inside Russia using long-range missiles supplied by the U.S. and European countries.\n\nNew administration looks for a negotiated end to the war\n\nAt a hearing last week, Trump secretary of state nominee Marco Rubio, who was later confirmed to the role, signaled it would be the official position of the administration that the Ukraine-Russia war be brought to an end.\n\nHe said sending unlimited aid to Ukraine for as long as it wants to keep fighting is not a realistic position and both countries would have to make concessions.\n\n“Now what that master plan looks like is going to be hard work,” he said. “My hope is that it can begin with some ceasefire.”\n\nThe Biden administration rushed to unload aid to Ukraine during the transition amid concerns that Trump would use military assistance as a bargaining chip. A Biden administration official told USA TODAY in January that the U.S. had exhausted all the funding that Congress previously appropriated.\n\nTrump pushes for end to the conflict: Donald Trump calls for 'immediate' ceasefire in Russia-Ukraine war after meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nIn an interview before the inauguration, Rep. Michael McCaul, who was chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee until early January, said he did not know whether Trump would ask Congress for additional money.\n\n“I'm hoping that Trump sees who Putin really is, you know, in this process, and he's not a good faith partner. He's not a good faith negotiator,” said McCaul, a leading proponent of Ukraine aid in Congress.\n\nTrump said at a news conference in early January that Putin sought to meet with him during the transition, but he did not think it would be appropriate to take the Russian leader up on the offer until after he had taken office.\n\n\"He can't be thrilled, he's not doing so well. I mean, he's grinding it out, but most people thought that war would've been over in about one week and now you're into three years,\" Trump told reporters assembled in the Oval Office on Monday evening, hours after he was sworn in to his second term. \"So he can't be thrilled, it's not making him look very good.\"\n\nPreparations for a meeting are underway, Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz told ABC News earlier this month.\n\n“From President Trump's perspective, you can't enter a deal if you don't have some type of relationship and dialogue with the other side,” he said. “And we will absolutely establish that in the coming months.”\n\nIt is not entirely clear how soon the leaders plan to meet or where they would even do so. The leaders met in Helsinki the first time Trump was in office. Finland has since joined NATO and sided with Ukraine in the war.\n\nA source familiar with the discussions that are taking place said Trump’s special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was likely to meet with Putin's government first.\n\nBefore sanctions and other measures are put in place there has to be dialogue, the person said, and so far, Kellogg's conversations have been limited to Ukraine and the Europeans.\n\nKellogg postponed a trip he planned to make to Kyiv until after the inauguration. He did not respond to a request for comment but told Fox News during an interview in early January that he had a personal goal of wrapping the war up in 100 days.\n\nZelenskyy has said he planned to meet with Trump after the inauguration although it was not clear when. The pair have been in regular communication over the last few months, speaking by phone after the election and meeting in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Zelenskyy and Trump held talks in December while they were in Paris.\n\nIn an interview published in January with podcaster Lex Fridman, the Ukrainian president said it is “naive” to think that Putin wants to finish the war and Trump would have to pressure him to stop it. Zelenskyy said that he struck a ceasefire agreement with Putin in 2019 that Russia eventually violated after ignoring his phone calls.\n\nTrump will be in the same situation as he was, Zelenskyy said, unless the U.S. offers serious security guarantees to Ukraine.\n\n“Today (Putin is) afraid of Trump. But once Trump manages, for example, to do a ceasefire deal without serious security guarantees for Ukraine, he will give a pass to Putin,” Zelenskyy said. “He does not want that. I believe in what he says. But he will give Putin an opportunity, because in Putin’s head, he wants me to fight with Trump.”\n\n'Dictators do not go on vacation': Zelenskyy takes an apparent dig at Congress over military aid\n\nAt a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, in what appeared to be Zelenskyy's first public remarks about Trump since the U.S. leader returned to office, the Ukrainian president questioned whether Trump was committed to NATO and European security more generally.\n\n\"Will President Trump even notice Europe? Does he see NATO as necessary? And will he respect EU institutions?\" Zelenskyy asked an audience of leaders and global opinion shapers.\n\nHe didn't attempt to answer his own question.\n\nPutin is demanding that Ukraine be prohibited from ever joining NATO and continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from territory that it has annexed, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said.\n\n“What Trump has put out there, while I think it's not wonderful, it's also not a disaster if European troops are willing to serve in between the two forces to enforce peace. That's pretty close to a security guarantee,” said Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.\n\nHerbst said he believes the Europeans can be persuaded into such an agreement if they are offered their own security guarantees from the United States.\n\n“I think Trump does not want to think about this right now, but if this became essential to get the deal, he may and that is: if the Russians start shooting at the Europeans, and Europeans shoot back, the Americans are also shooting back.”\n\nO'Brien, the former Trump national security adviser, said, “You’d have security guarantees that are more than a scrap of paper and less than full NATO membership.\"\n\nThose could include having British and European forces on the ground. “There are significant security guarantees to get the Ukrainians what they need and protects Ukraine that are short of NATO membership. I don’t think NATO membership is the magic wand here for Ukraine,\" O'Brien said.\n\nA senior European defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue where there appears to be some division among allies about Trump's ideas for Ukraine, said there is no scenario where a Russia-Ukraine peace deal where the latter is forced to give up territory represents \"the best solution to the war.\"\n\nThe official said western allies should \"never approve\" an agreement that sees Ukraine cede its territory to Russia, that Putin needs to be held accountable for war crimes committed in Ukraine and also pay financial reparations for damages and losses to Ukrainian infrastructure sustained during the war.\n\n\"The only good and long-term sustainable solution is a full victory for Ukraine,\" the official said. The official added that if Trump's peace plan means the conflict is \"frozen\" − armed conflict is brought to an end, but there's no peace treaty or other resolving political framework − it would simply allow Russia's military to regroup and relocate, including closer to other parts of Europe where more countries would be threatened.\n\nThe official added that the most important issue for Ukraine now is how to get it in the strongest possible position vis-a-vis Russia and to compel Putin to negotiate.\n\n\"This is the most critical part,\" the official said, \"and it is still unsolved.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/13/trump-syria-sanctions/83599915007/", "title": "Trump says he will end US sanctions on Syria", "text": "Syria's new president has reportedly said he is open to a Trump Tower rising in Damascus.\n\n\"In Syria, which has seen so much misery and death, there is a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace,\" Trump said.\n\nWASHINGTON − President Donald Trump said he will order the end of sanctions against Syria to \"give them a chance of greatness\" in an effort to normalize relations with the new Syrian government after the fall of dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTrump made the pledge during May 13 remarks at a U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh as makes his first presidential visit of his second term, a four-day swing through the Middle East.\n\n\"Oh, what I do for the crown prince,\" Trump said, recounting how he arrived at the decision following discussions with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\n\"The sanctions were brutal and crippling and served as an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their time to shine. We're taking them all off,\" Trump said. \"So I say, good luck, Syria. Show us something very special, like they've done, frankly, in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe president received a standing ovation after making his Syria announcement, and celebrations broke out in Damascus.\n\nTrump later met Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and told reporters on Air Force One that the Islamist former al-Qaeda fighter was \"a real leader.\"\n\n\"He's got a real shot at holding it together,\" Trump said.\n\nBillions in deals\n\nThe White House announced billions of dollars in arms deals and Saudi investments during Trump's stay. The U.S. agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion.\n\nTrump and the Saudi crown prince signed an agreement covering energy, defense and mining.\n\nThe agreement covers deals with U.S. defense companies in areas including air and missile defense, air force and space advancement, and maritime security, a White House fact sheet said. The Saudi prince said the deal included investment opportunities worth $600 billion, including agreements worth $300 billion that were signed during Trump's visit.\n\n\"We will work in the coming months on the second phase to complete deals and raise it to $1 trillion,\" Prince Mohammed said.\n\nTrump Tower in Damascus?\n\nSharaa rose to power after Syrian rebels he led in December forced Syrian President Bashar al-Assad out of Damascus, ending 50 years of tyrannical rule from the al-Assad family.\n\nAl-Sharaa had lobbied for the end of the multilayered U.S. sanctions, which had continued after al-Assad's ouster. The economic sanctions cut off Syria from the global financial system and has made economic recovery extremely challenging after 14 years of grinding war.\n\n\"In Syria, which has seen so much misery and death, there is a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace,\" Trump said.\n\nAmong the suggestions Sharaa has pitched for sanction relief and face-to-face time with Trump is a possible Trump Tower in Damascus, according to a report from Reuters, which quoted Jonathan Bass, a U.S. pro-Trump activist, who on April 30 met with Sharaa for four hours in Damascus.\n\nBass said Sharaa wants a \"business deal for the future of his country\" that could allow U.S. access to Syria's oil and gas, Syrian cooperation against Iran and engagement with Israel.\n\n\"He told me he wants a Trump Tower in Damascus. He wants peace with his neighbors. What he told me is good for the region, good for Israel,\" Bass said.\n\nThe United Nations, which has been pushing countries to lift sanctions on Syria, welcomed the move by Trump.\n\n\"It was important for us to see relief on sanctions on Syria to help the reconstruction of Syria, to help the Syrian people recover from more than a decade of conflict, a decade of under investment,\" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.\n\nIn addition to Trump's visit with al-Sharaa, Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to meet with Syria's new foreign minister this week in Turkey, Trump said.\n\nContributing: Reuters.

Making deals — like an Israel-Palestine peace accord. And breaking deals — like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Iran Deal, both of which he labeled disasters.\n\nSince entering the Oval Office in 2016, Trump — a self-professed negotiator —has delivered on many of his promises to abandon international pacts that previous administrations had authorized.\n\nAs the United States plans for an early exit from a key, Cold War-era nuclear agreement with Russia, here is a look at some of the landmark international deals, partnerships, and organizations the Trump White House has spurned.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\nJust days after assuming office, Trump delivered on a campaign promise and announced that the U.S. would be pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement between 12 Pacific Rim countries that took seven years to negotiate and was signed by then-President Barack Obama in his second term. Its goals were to boost exports, remove tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and open access to more markets.\n\nIt was a turn toward protectionist measures. By abandoning a deal that would give American companies an opportunity to seek cheap labor abroad, Trump signaled that his priority is to reduce the number of jobs leaving the country.\n\nIn a memorandum announcing the move, Trump favored bilateral negations and said they were to be pursued whenever possible to “promote American industry, protect American workers, and raise American wages.”\n\nThe Paris Agreement\n\nOn June 1, 2017, Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, an international climate accord that the U.S. signed under the Obama administration that aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which come from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.\n\nTrump cited \"onerous energy restriction” on the U.S. and the possible job losses it could cost as reasons for dropping out of the deal. Industrial sectors such as cement, coal, and iron and steel, Trump said, could be affected by America’s inclusion in the accord. He said there were plans to begin negotiations to reenter the deal or enter an “entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.\"\n\nTrump said the deal \"punishes the United States,\" which he claimed was the world leader in environmental protection, without imposing any \"meaningful obligations\" on the world's leading polluters. Historically, the U.S. has ranked as one of the worst emitters of carbon dioxide, but it’s been noted as recently as this year that its contribution to CO2 levels globally has been on the decline.\n\nAfter Syria signed on to the accord in 2017, the U.S. became the only country in the world that wasn’t a party to the landmark deal.\n\nThe Iran Deal\n\nThroughout the 2016 presidential election campaign, then-candidate Trump promised that once he was in office he would tear up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran — better known as the Iran nuclear deal. The president called it the “worst deal ever.” Pushed into passage by the Obama Administration, the Iran nuclear deal reduced economic sanctions against Iran as long as the country ended its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn May, the White House announced that because the JCPOA “failed to protect America's national security interests\" it would be pulling out of the historic deal.\n\nThe White House accused the Iranian regime of archiving its past nuclear weapons work and continuing to enrich uranium and develop ballistic missiles. The administration left some room for a new deal to be struck but said that a return to the negotiating table would depend on a number of preconditions such as the Iranian regime completely abandoning their intent to develop nuclear weapons—something Trump alleges they never stopped pursuing.\n\nIn the meantime, the administration has renewed sanctions against Iran. These measures, according to the White House, would target several of the country’s economic sectors such as energy, petrochemical, and finance.\n\nUNESCO\n\nIn Oct. 2017, the State Department announced that the U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO, which serves a number of functions around the globe such as promoting literacy and protecting historic and cultural sites through the World Heritage Centre.\n\nIt was a symbolic gesture on part of the Trump administration, seeing as the Obama White House cut off funding for UNESCO in 2011, after the group voted to include Palestine as a member. The reasons the State Department gave for leaving the organization include what it views as mounting debt within the organization, a need for “fundamental reform,” and continuing bias against Israel.\n\nNAFTA\n\nOn Aug. 27, President Trump ended nearly 25 years of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, the trade pact linking U.S., Canada, and Mexico. He announced a new, bilateral agreement with Mexico known as the U.S.-Mexico Trade Agreement.\n\nCanada was initially left out of the new deal, which was designed to replace the NAFTA, an agreement that Trump says carried bad connotations. Signed in 1993, NAFTA eliminated tariffs on most goods traded among the continent's three largest countries and made it easier for companies in those countries to move goods across borders. The old trade pact is often blamed for the flight of U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico and the deindustrialization of the American economy.\n\nThe new deal includes controversial stipulations such as the “rule of origin,” which requires that cars must be built with at least 75 percent parts made in North America (up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA) and that 40 to 45 percent of an automobile must be manufactured by employees earning at least $16 an hour.\n\nIn September, little more than a month after the U.S. and Mexico struck their deal, Canada announced it was joining the agreement. The text of the new deal is expected to be signed by the end of November.\n\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty\n\nOn Oct. 20, Trump announced to reporters his intention to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a 1987 pact between the United States and Russia that required both countries to destroy ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of between 310 and 3,400 miles, along with any supporting equipment.\n\nTrump claims that Russia has violated the Cold War-era treaty, set to expire in two years, and said that the U.S. will begin weapons development unless Russia and China—who is not a party to the pact—agree to a new deal.\n\nDays after the announcement, White House National Security Advisor John Bolton met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin and said there was no chance the Trump administration would reverse its decision. Bolton suggested the INF treaty was outmoded.\n\n\"There's a new strategic reality out there,\" Bolton said. \"This is a cold war bilateral ballistic-missile-related treaty — in a multipolar ballistic-missile world.\"\n\nUnited Nations Human Rights Council\n\nCalling it a \"cesspool of political bias,\" Nikki Haley, then-Ambassador to the United Nations, announced in June that the United States was pulling out of the United Nations Human Rights Council, leaving the U.S. without a vote and sidelined from the Geneva-based group that aims to promote human rights around the world.\n\nThe Trump administration made the move amid criticism surrounding its practice of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border. The Human Rights Council called on the White House to end the practice because it \"runs counter to human rights standards.\"\n\nUNRWA\n\nIn August, the Trump Administration said that it would halt U.S. contributions to the United Nations’ aid program for Palestinian refugees. The decision is part of the administration’s efforts to rein in foreign aid and restrict assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. The move came one week after the White House revoked more than $200 million in economic aid to the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe U.S. is \"no longer willing to shoulder the very disproportionate share of the burden of UNRWA’s costs,\" said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, referring to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. The U.N. agency provides health care to approximately 3 million Palestinians, education assistance to 500,000 children, micro-loans to another 400,000 beneficiaries, among other aid.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/08/us-uk-trade-deal-trump-announces-agreement/83508333007/", "title": "Recap: Trump announces US-UK trade deal with focus on steel ...", "text": "WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump touted a “breakthrough trade deal” between the U.S. and United Kingdom as he announced the first agreement since he imposed sweeping tariffs in April that ignited a global trade war and rattled financial markets.\n\nJoined in the Oval Office by U.S. and UK officials who helped broker the agreement, Trump said the pact would boost trade between the two allies and remove \"non-tariff barriers\" he said \"unfairly discriminate\" against American products.\n\n“There could be no more perfect morning to reach this historic agreement,\" Trump said, noting that the agreement happened to fall on \"Victory Day\" in celebration of the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nYet it is unclear whether the deal with Britain ‒ the ninth largest trading partner with the U.S. ‒ will provide momentum for future trade agreements as the Trump administration seeks to rapidly hammer out deals with 170 countries. The U.S. has a $12 billion trade surplus with Britain, making it an outlier from other countries like China that export more goods to the U.S. than it imports.\n\nUnder the still-evolving deal, Trump kept a 10% baseline tariff on British products imported to the United States, but he said that's a \"low number\" compared to the tariffs he wants to maintain for other counties.\n\nThe agreement lowers 25% universal tariffs on automobiles from the UK to 10%, while the 25% rate still applies to vehicles from other countries. Trump also agreed to eliminate 25% tariffs on steel from the UK.\n\nOther details are still in the works, Trump said. Still, U.S. stocks traded higher in the immediate hours of the news spreading of a broad deal between the two longstanding global allies. Trump promised that their efforts would provide billions of dollars in access for U.S. agricultural products such as beef and ethanol.\n\n“They’re opening up their country,” Trump said. “Their country is a little closed and we appreciate it.”\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Keri Starmer was put on a speaker phone for the announcement and called it a “really fantastic, historic day” coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the key moment at the end of World War II.\n\n“This is going to boost trade between and across our countries,” Starmer siad.\n\nTrump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on a slew of countries April 2 but later paused most of them for 90 days, saying those nations' leaders were eager to negotiate trade deals. Since then administration officials repeatedly have said they are close to making deals.\n\nThe UK wasn't hit with a reciprocal tariff during Trump's April roll out, but faced a 10% universal tariff and 25% tariffs that Trump imposed on foreign automobiles, steel and aluminum.\n\nBritons will buy U.S. beef and chicken despite additives: Navarro\n\nPeter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, disputed concerns that growth additives would discourage sales of beef and chicken to the United Kingdom.\n\nKansas, Nebraska and Texas are expected to sell more beef, Navarro said of the trade deal President Donald Trump negotiated with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Wisconsin and California are expected to sell more dairy products, he said. Iowa is expected to sell more corn as ethanol, he said.\n\n“There’s joy in farm-ville today,” Navarro told reporters May 8.\n\nAsked if Britons would buy beef raised with hormones or chicken rinsed with chlorine, Navarro said the markets would decide. He argued that “so-called phytosanitary standards” are “simply a tool to suppress” fine agricultural products.\n\n“If more of that comes into the market and the British people don’t want to buy it, that’s one set of facts,” Navarro said. “We believe that once they’ve tasted American beef and chicken that they’d prefer to have it.” - Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: Reduced UK auto tariffs to help Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar cars\n\nPresident Trump said he made a special exception for the United Kingdom by lowering auto tariffs from 25% to 10% to help high-end vehicles such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar vehicles that are manufactured in Britain.\n\n“It's a very special car, and it's very limited number, too,” Trump said. “It’s not one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars. They make a very small number of cars that are super luxury.”\n\n“That’s really handmade stuff, they've been doing it for a long time in the same location,” he said. “So I said, ‘Let’s help the out with that one.’”\n\nTrump said he will “rarely” make the same decision in negotiations with other countries when it comes to other foreign automobiles. - Joey Garrison\n\nSchumer casts doubt on longevity of Trump’s UK trade deal\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cast doubt on the durability of President Donald Trump’s trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the details of which are not fully known.\n\nSchumer, D-New York, said in a morning Senate floor speech, ahead of Trump’s announcement, that the trade deal “is likely to be built on quicksand.”\n\n“And with this president, if past is prologue, who knows if this ‘deal’ will actually stick,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\n\nSchumer added: “It would be hard to take anything the president says about this deal today seriously, because in all likelihood he will likely change his mind again.” – Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump says 10% tariff could still increase for other countries\n\nTrump’s trade deal with the United Kingdom maintained a 10% universal tariff on the country.\n\nAsked if trade deals with other countries also could result in tariffs staying at 10%, rather than the higher reciprocal tariffs the president threatened last month before pausing most of them, Trump said no.\n\n“The template of 10 is probably the lowest,” he said, suggesting other countries could have a higher tariff. - Zac Anderson\n\nJames Bond cars, films at heart of trade discussions\n\nThe United Kingdom could begin sending more Aston Martin cars – the iconic ride for fictional spy James Bond – to the U.S. under the trade deal, but Trump said potential tariffs on foreign films were still open to discussion.\n\n“James Bond has nothing to worry about, that I can tell you,” Trump said to laughter in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump noted that he was friends with Sean Connery, the late Scottish actor who created the Bond character in film. Trump has two golf courses in Scotland, and Connery helped resolve a zoning dispute for the one in Aberdeen.\n\n“Sean Connery was a friend of mine. He was a great guy,” Trump said. “He said, ‘Let the bloody bloke build his golf courses.’” - Bart Jansen\n\nUK says trade deal with the US eliminates steel tariffs\n\nThe United Kingdom said in a press release that the trade deal with the United States will help a steel industry “on the brink of collapse.”\n\nThe U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on foreign steel. The UK won’t face those tariffs now, according to the release.\n\n“The Prime Minister negotiated the 25% tariff down to zero, meaning UK steelmakers can carry on exporting to the US,” the release states. - Zac Anderson\n\nTrump says he’s not overstating deal\n\nResponding to a question about the significance of the trade deal announced with the UK, Trump said it’s incorrect to suggest he’s overstating its importance.\n\n“This is a maxed out deal,” he said, adding: “It’s a very big deal right now but I think it’s going to grow.” - Zac Anderson\n\nU.S. keeps 10% tariffs on UK goods: Lutnick\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said 10% tariffs would remain under the trade deal, but that the United Kingdom was opening its markets for an estimated $5 billion in U.S. beef, ethanol and machinery.\n\nLutnick said a 25% U.S. tariff on automobiles would be reduced to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles. Lutnick also said a British airline would announce later May 8 that it would buy $10 billion of Boeing planes. - Bart Jansen and Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says UK has agreed to eliminate ‘non-tariff barriers’\n\nAlthough the details of the trade deal are still unclear, Trump said the United Kingdom has agreed to reduce or eliminate the number of “non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products.\"\n\n“This is now turning out, I think, really to be a great deal for both countries because it will be really great for the UK also,” Trump said.\n\nUK’s Starmer says deal will boost trade between countries\n\nUnited Kingdom Keir Starmer, talking through a speaker phone, touted the moment as a “fantastic, historic day” as the U.S. and Britain agreed to a trade deal.\n\n“Really important deal,” Starmer said. “This is going to boost trade across our countries. It's going to not only protect jobs, but create jobs, opening market access. And as you say, Donald, the timing couldn't be more apt.” - Joey Garrison\n\nTreasury sanctions 4 Chinese companies for buying, delivering Iranian oil\n\nIn another trade arena, the Treasury Department announced May 8 it sanctioned a Chinese refinery and three port terminal operators for buying or helping deliver hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian oil.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had signed an executive order to block sales of Iranian oil as part of an economic pressure campaign against the Middle East country working to develop its own nuclear weapon.\n\n“The United States remains resolved to intensify pressure on all elements of Iran’s oil supply chain to prevent the regime from generating revenue to further its destabilizing agenda,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. - Bart Jansen\n\nRubio calls trade deal ‘an important step’ toward more\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio praised the trade deal with the United Kingdom as “an important step towards fair and reciprocal trade” with other countries around the world.\n\n“Looking forward to the many great deals your administration will deliver for the American people!” Rubio wrote on social media. -Bart Jansen\n\nStocks up on word of trade deal\n\nU.S. stock markets rose in initial trading after Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 198.6 points or 0.48% at the opening of trading May 8. The S&P 500 rose 32.3 points or 0.57% in initial trading. And the Nasdaq composite rose 182 points or 1.03% at the opening bell. - Reuters\n\nThe United Kingdom is the ninth-largest trading partner with U.S.\n\nFinal details on Trump's trade deal with the United Kingdom remain under wraps.\n\nBut the two nations exchange a much smaller amount of goods and services – largely cars and chemicals heading to the U.S. – than the U.S. does with its largest trading partners.\n\nThe U.S. exported nearly $80 billion in goods and services in 2024, according to the Census Department, while importing about $68 billion. That ranks the United Kingdom ninth in trade with the U.S.Machinery and transport equipment was also the main goods exported from the United Kingdom to the U.S. in 2023. Cars represented nearly half the UK exports to the U.S., ahead of Germany and the Netherlands, according to that country’s trade office.\n\nChemical exports, mostly for pharmaceuticals, account for nearly one-quarter of the exports to the U.S. They were the second largest group of UK commodities exported to the U.S.\n\nThe United Kingdom figures are dwarfed by U.S. trade with Mexico at $839 billion in goods and serves exchanging across the U.S.-Mexico border last year. Canada traded $762 billion in goods and services with the U.S., while China coming in at $582 billion in trade with the U.S.\n\nTrump met with Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney on May 6, and talks are set to begin with China. - Bart Jansen\n\nU-Michigan economist: Not a major trade deal\n\nTrump’s announcement already is being met with skepticism.\n\nUniversity of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers told CNN he wouldn’t consider it a major trade deal, noting the United Kingdom only accounts for about 3% of U.S. trade.\n\n“The president’s a showman, he’s going to tell you there’s all sorts of wonderful things about it,” Wolfers said. - Zac Anderson\n\nTrump: 'We don't have to sign deals'\n\nTrump commented about the intense interest in the trade deals during a May 6 meeting with the prime minister of Canada.\n\n\"Everyone says: 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?\" Trump said. \"We don't have to sign deals. We could sign 25 deals right now . . . if we wanted. We don't have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market.\"\n\nThe president also expressed frustration with the constant questions. \"I wish they'd stop asking how many deals are you signing this week,\" he said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers during a May 6 committee hearing that deals could be signed soon.\n\n\"I would think that perhaps as early as this week we will be announcing trade deals with some of our largest trading partners,\" Bessent said. - Zac Anderson\n\nWhat's the status of U.S.-China trade talks?\n\nThere are 18 countries that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as \"major trading partners.\" He said negotiations have begun with all of them except China, but talks between U.S. and Chinese officials are now scheduled.\n\nBessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are traveling to Switzerland on May 8, where they will meet with China's \"lead representative on economic matters.\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is also meeting on May 8 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Jinping told Putin their two countries should be \"friends of steel\", as they pledged to boost cooperation to a new level at a time of heightened confrontation with the West.\n\nAt talks in the Kremlin, the two leaders cast themselves as defenders of a new world order no longer dominated by the United States. - Reuters/Zac Anderson\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/14/biden-remove-cuba-state-sponsor-of-terror-list/77697932007/", "title": "Reversing Donald Trump, Joe Biden moves to take Cuba off US ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − President Joe Biden notified Congress of his plans to remove Cuba from the United States' list of state sponsors of terror, in a goodwill gesture the outgoing administration says is meant to help facilitate the release of political prisoners.\n\nThe administration said Tuesday that it had completed an assessment and did not find information that supports the designation.\n\nAn administration official who briefed reporters said Biden made the decision with the understanding that the Catholic Church was advancing an agreement with Cuba that would allow for the humanitarian release of a significant number of individuals who were unjustly detained. The agreement that is in the works would include dozens of individuals who were arrested in 2021 protests against the Communist government. The official could not say how many political prisoners would be set free but said the Biden administration believed the release would take place in relatively short order.\n\nCuba's government said later that it would \"gradually\" release 553 political prisoners, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Catholic Church has been engaging directly with the Cuban government, the person said. The Vatican has consistently kept the administration appraised of the potential actions that Cuba will be undertaking.\n\nBiden spoke this week to Pope Francis by phone, giving the administration confidence in the strength of the dialogue, the official conveyed. He also awarded Francis the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction after their conversation.\n\nAn administration official said Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also asked Biden to lift the state sponsor of terror designation. Biden met with Lula during the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro in November. The administration said the Colombian and Canadian governments also asked the U.S. to remove Cuba from the terror list.\n\n\"In taking these steps to bolster the ongoing dialogue between the government of Cuba and the Catholic Church, President Biden is also honoring the wisdom and counsel that has been provided to him by many world leaders, especially in Latin America, who have encouraged him to take these actions, on how best to advance the human rights of the Cuban people,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\n\"We take these steps in appreciation of the Catholic Church’s efforts to facilitate Cuba to take its own, constructive measures to restore liberty to its citizens and enable conditions that improve the livelihood of Cubans,\" she said.\n\nHolding or releasing political prisoners is not a component of the state sponsor of terrorism designation. The U.S. applies the punishment to countries that are found to have repeatedly supported international terrorist organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration added Cuba to the state sponsor of terror list days before the Republican left office in 2021 and it has remained there throughout the Biden administration. Just three other countries, Syria, Iran and North Korea, are currently on the State Department list.\n\nThe designation allows for restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, bans on defense exports and sales and other financial penalties, according to the State Department. It also gives the federal government authority to sanction people and countries that participate in trade with pariah nations.\n\nIn a letter on Tuesday to Congress the president said the administration had not found any instances of support by Cuba for international terrorism in the last six months and the country's government had provided assurances it would not do so in the future.\n\nTrump's nominee for secretary of state, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is known as a skeptic of increasing U.S. engagement with Cuba's communist government. He was influential in crafting Trump's first-term policy toward the island nation. Rubio will appear before the Senate on Wednesday and is expected to easily win confirmation to the position.\n\nThe outgoing administration told reporters that it been in communication with Trump's transition team about its plans and that Congress and the new president would have an opportunity to review Biden's decision. An official emphasized that Trump's team would be working off the same information.\n\nThe president-elect did not immediately comment on the Biden administration action. But the announcement came under scrutiny from other Republicans.\n\nIn a statement, Cuban-American Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, accused the Biden administration of appeasement.\n\n\"They push these policies both because they believe in them and to undermine the incoming Trump administration and Republican Congress,\" Cruz said. \"These moves do incredible damage to American national security and send a message to our adversaries that they can rely on outgoing Democrat administrations – and wait out pressure from Republican administrations – to continue engaging in terrorism and other aggression against Americans.\n\nSome Democrats were also critical of the move.

Hassett also told CNBC a 10% universal baseline tariff rate is likely to stay in place for most countries as part of any negotiated trade agreement.\n\nA day earlier, Trump announced a 90-day pause on U.S. levies for scores of nations that did not retaliate against the tariffs unveiled last week. The European Union responded by putting on hold for 90 days its first countermeasures against U.S. tariffs.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nTrump accuses Mexico of stealing water, threatens sanctions\n\nDespite imposing a 25% tariff on some Mexican goods, Trump has had a cordial relationship so far with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico.\n\nThat didn't stop Trump from accusing Mexico on Thursday evening of harming farmers in southern Texas by violating a decades-old water treaty, and threatening severe penalties if the situation doesn't change.\n\n\"We will keep escalating consequences,'' Trump posted on his social media site, \"including TARIFFS and, maybe even SANCTIONS, until Mexico honors the Treaty, and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!''\n\nUnder a 1944 treaty, Mexico must send 1.75 million acre-feet of water to the U.S. from the Rio Grande every five years. An acre-foot of water is enough to fill about half an Olympic swimming pool.\n\nThe current five-year cycle is up in October, but Mexico has sent less than 30% of the required water, according to data from the International Boundary and Water Commission.\n\nMexico contends that a historic drought fueled by climate change makes it impossible to fulfill its water commitments, a scenario for which the treaty offers leniency, allowing the water debt to be rolled over to the next five year cycle.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nChina, US remain far apart\n\nThe trade clash with China appeared to be ramping up. Trump on Wednesday raised the tariff on Chinese goods to 145%, the White House clarified Thursday after initially saying it was 125%. A 20% levy was applied in February, stemming from Trump accusing Beijing of allowing fentanyl produced in China to be transported to the U.S.\n\nChina struck back with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods that kicked in Thursday.\n\n\"The trade war is now turning into a direct confrontation between the U.S. and China,\" Rabobank analysts said. \"We could again be seeing escalation and de-escalation at the same time, pulling markets in different directions.\"\n\nTrump did not say when asked whether Chinese President Xi Jinping has been in touch with the U.S. to discuss trade policy.\n\n“I don't want to say who's reached out,'' Trump said. \"I’ll just say that I think it's going to work out, hopefully.”\n\nStocks tumble again after one-day recovery\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes fell sharply Thursday, a day after the domestic markets saw a historic surge following Trump's 90-day pause on some of his most aggressive tariffs.\n\nWith the world's two largest economies engaged in an escalating trade war, investors went on another selloff. The Dow fell by 2.50%, or 1,014.79 points, to 39,593.66. The S&P 500 dropped by 3.46%, or 188.85 points, to 5,268.05. And the Nasdaq ended down by 4.31%, or 737.66 points, to 16,387.31.\n\n\"The current situation is not only chaotic, it’s crazy,\" ING Economist Carsten Brzeski said. \"Don’t forget that we have been here before with announcements and then we get some pauses, only for the originally announced tariff to be reintroduced again.''\n\nOn Wednesday, the pause drove the S&P 500 more than 9% higher, its third-largest gain in a single day since World War II. The Dow posted its biggest percentage advance since March 2020, while the Nasdaq scored its biggest one-day gain since January 2001 and second-best day on record. About 30 billion shares changed hands, which was the highest in at least 18 years.\n\n− Medora Lee\n\nTrump warns of 'transition cost' with tariffs\n\nTrump said Thursday that there will be “a transition cost ” with his aggressive tariff policies as the markets plunged again one day after he paused some tariffs while ramping up levies on imports from China.\n\n\"There'll be a transition cost and transition problems, but in the end, it's going to be a beautiful thing,\" Trump said at the beginning of a Cabinet meeting.\n\nDespite the pause, Trump’s 10% baseline tariffs on most imports remain in effect. Trump also hiked China’s so-called \"reciprocal'' tariff to 125%, raising its total rate 145% when combined with previously imposed 20% duties.\n\nAdministration officials have said about 75 countries have contacted the U.S. seeking trade deals. “I'm not sure we could ever have enough time in the day to talk to all these countries,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.\n\nTrump said he will revive the higher country-specific tariffs he paused Wednesday if the U.S. is unable to reach trade deals with those nations.\n\n\"If we can't make the deal that we want to make, or we have to make, or that's good for both parties − it's got to be good for both parties − and then we go back to where we were,” Trump told reporters.\n\nWhite House downplays latest market plunge\n\nThe Trump administration downplayed Thursday’s massive drop in the stock market, one day after stocks soared when Trump announced he’s pausing tit-for-tat tariffs on most countries.\n\n“Up two, down one is not a bad ratio, or up 10, down five,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters during a Cabinet meeting, ignoring the four-day slump that preceded Wednesday's rally.\n\nTrump, known for being acutely aware of how the market performs, said he had not seen it Thursday.\n\nBessent said the administration will gain certainty on the tariffs as it negotiates trade deals with other countries over the next three months.\n\n“But we had very good inflation numbers today,'' he said. \"Oil’s down. We had a successful bond market, so I don't think you’re seeing anything unusual today.”\n\nDemocrats question timing of Trump's tariffs pause\n\nThe timing of Trump's pause of some country-specific tariffs on dozens of nations Wednesday struck some Democrats as more than a little curious. Less than four hours before the announcement, Trump had written, \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT\" on his social media site.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Adam Schiff of California and Ruben Gallego of Arizona said in a letter the sequence of events raised \"grave legal and ethics concerns,\" noting the posting propelled financial markets to huge gains and boosted the stock of carmaker Tesla, partly owned by Trump ally Elon Musk, by 18%.\n\n\"The president, his family, and his advisors are uniquely positioned to be privy and take advantage of non-public information to inform their investment decisions,\" Schiff and Gallego wrote in the letter.\n\nAt Thursday's Cabinet meeting, Trump brushed off a reporter's question about the Democrats' concerns. The White House denied any impropriety.\n\n− Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat does the tariff pause mean for you?\n\nAmerican consumers should brace for “more bad days in the stock market” and a “massive” increase in prices, not to mention the possibility of a recession, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for financial services company Moody's Analytics. The pause in tariffs won't pause big price increases for \"everything from clothing to cars to cellphones,\" he told USA TODAY. China is a key reason why.\n\nChina accounted for 16.5% of the $3.2 trillion worth of imports brought into the U.S. in 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\n“The tariff mix is actually worse,” Bloomberg LP’s chief economist Anna Wong said on the X social media platform. “China exports more consumer goods to (the) US than other countries, so boosting that relative to others will boost the hit to consumption goods.” Read more here.\n\n− Bailey Schulz, Jessica Guynn\n\nWhat the tariff pause means: How it impacts your wallet\n\nAgriculture Secretary Rollins: Aid package to farmers will be considered\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Thursday that the White House is weighing potential aid packages for American farmers and egg producers to help mitigate damage done by tariffs − but she hopes they will not be necessary.\n\nWhile farmers welcomed Trump's pause on tariffs for many countries, the continued escalation of the duties with China is concerning to soybean farmers because China is a critical export market for U.S. soy, according to the American Soybean Association.\n\n“We run the risk of immediate impacts this growing season, along with the impacts a prolonged trade war with China will inflict on our industry,” said Caleb Ragland, the association's president and a Kentucky soybean farmer.\n\nRollins said it would take time to determine the tariffs' implications for U.S. crops, “especially for our wheat, corn, soybean, etc., that they're just in planting season right now.” She said a firm decision on the aid will be made toward late summer and early fall.\n\nTrump trying to fix issue that's not broken, expert says\n\nTrump “blinked” when he admitted the financial markets’ turmoil was a factor in putting a 90-day pause on tariffs, one economics expert believes.\n\n“He’s trying to reframe this as part of ‘The Art of the Deal,’” said Peter Ricchiuti, a senior finance professor at Tulane University and founder of the Burkenroad Reports student stocks research program, referring to Trump's 1987 book. “I don’t believe a pause was part of the president’s strategy. This was all his silly way of looking at tariffs as a balance of trade.”\n\nWith the major markets closing a fifth negative session in the last six Thursdays, there’s “a 90% chance” the U.S. will enter a recession because of Trump’s overuse of tariffs, Ricchiuti said, predicting the 90-day pause on some tariffs won't result in a correction.\n\nRicchiuti said there’s always going to be some inequity when rich nations like the U.S. trade with others that are not as wealthy. “You don't have to hurt another country to make yours stronger,” Ricchiuti said. “The president made it sound like this is a great issue we needed to fix, but there was really no need for it.”\n\n− Terry Collins\n\nUS stock market today: Latest news on the market\n\nSome tariffs remain despite pauses\n\nTrump's reversal on tariffs was encouraging but far from universal. A 10% blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports will remain in effect, the White House said, and it appeared the duties on autos, steel and aluminium would remain in place. The U.S. tariff pause also does not apply to duties paid by Canada and Mexico because their goods are still subject to 25% fentanyl-related tariffs.\n\nThe EU had been due to impose extra tariffs on U.S. imports including maize, wheat, motorcycles, poultry, fruit and clothing. Those are now suspended.\n\nHow did Trump's 3-month tariff pause come about?\n\nThe three-month tariffs suspension announced Wednesday marks a dramatic retreat for Trump, who on Monday said he wasn’t interested in a pause and just hours before Wednesday’s announcement urged Americans to “BE COOL!” in a post on social media.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, explaining the sudden shift, told reporters the Trump administration has been “overwhelmed” by the more than 75 countries that have approached the U.S. seeking trade deals after the president first announced the sweeping tariffs last week. Trump, speaking to reporters late Wednesday, acknowledged the volatile stock markets and turmoil in the bond market played a role in his decision.\n\n\"I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid,\" Trump said. \"You have to have flexibility.\"\n\nWhat top traded items between US, China could be impacted?\n\nOf the $3.2 trillion the U.S. imported in 2022, 16.5% of that came from China, making it America's top supplier, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. China is also one of the USA's top export destinations, falling behind Canada and Mexico with $150.4 billion of U.S. goods being bought by China in the same year.\n\nMechanical appliances, sound recorders and TV sets were the most commonly traded commodity sectors between China and the U.S. in 2022, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Industry and Security report. For the average consumer, some everyday goods are likely to get more expensive. Read more about what those items are.\n\n− Kinsey Crowley\n\nMichigan governor calls for exemptions on autos, energy\n\nTrump loves to skewer his political opponents, but he had nothing but praise for Michigan's Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during a White House visit Wednesday. Whitmer, a potential presidential contender in 2028, was advocating for issues important to her state, including keeping an Air National Guard base open and an invasive species out of Lake Michigan. Trump said he supported the causes.\n\n\"She's really been doing an excellent job,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Whitmer, however, then stood by awkwardly as Trump signed two presidential memoranda revoking security clearances for former Homeland Security officials, one who angered him for saying the 2020 election was secure and another who wrote a critical book about him.\n\nWhitmer's officer said she wasn't aware she would be pulled into the signing event and that \"her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\n'A very good person': Trump lauds Michigan's Democratic governor during White House visit\n\nWhat is a stock market correction?\n\nCorrection territory is generally understood to mean a stock market indicator has dropped at least 10% from its recent market high. This is different from bear market territory, which refers to a stock market drop of 20% or more from a recent peak, or a closing high.\n\nEvery investment is susceptible to corrections. They can apply to individual stocks, bonds, or stock indexes such as the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq.\n\nSeveral things can prompt a correction including a change in economic policy, newly released jobs or inflation data and company earnings reports.\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nWhat is a recession?\n\nA recession is informally considered at least two straight quarters of declining economic output. But the technical definition is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” according to the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe measure is based on employment, income, consumer spending and industrial production, among other criteria. An economic tailspin is typically accompanied by hundreds of thousands or millions of net job losses.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/energy/oil-prices-opec-russia", "title": "OPEC agrees to pump more oil as Russian output drops | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nOPEC has agreed to pump more crude oil over the next two months as Russian production begins to drop because of Western sanctions.\n\nThe oil exporters’ cartel said it would increase supply by 648,000 barrels per day in July and August, 200,000 barrels per day more than scheduled under a supply agreement with other producers, including Russia, known as OPEC+.\n\nThe Biden administration welcomed the “important decision from OPEC+,” and highlighted Saudi Arabia’s role as the group’s largest producer in achieving consensus.\n\n“This announcement accelerates the end of the current quota arrangement that has been in place since July of last year and brings forward the monthly production increase that was previously planned to take place in September,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that some members of OPEC were exploring the idea of suspending the OPEC+ supply agreement to allow countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to step in and ease a supply crunch that pushed global oil prices above $120 a barrel this week. The Financial Times and Reuters carried similar reports.\n\nSaudi Arabia had previously dismissed US requests to increase production beyond the long standing quota agreed with Russia and other non-OPEC producers. But concerns that sky-high prices could tip the world into recession appear to have prompted a rethink.\n\nReuters, citing two OPEC+ sources, reported earlier that Russia’s output had fallen by around 1 million barrels per day in recent months because of the sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOPEC’s statement did not refer to that decline, noting instead the recent easing of lockdowns in major global economic centers — presumably a reference to China — and an anticipated increase in demand from refineries following seasonal maintenance.\n\n“The meeting highlighted the importance of stable and balanced markets for both crude oil and refined products,” it added.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark for oil, hit $125 a barrel on Tuesday, its highest level since early March. US oil almost reached $120 per barrel. Both have since dropped back by about 6% in response to the media reports and fell again early Thursday before trading narrowly higher at $117 and $116 respectively at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nRobert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush, said prices rallied Thursday because the OPEC move was “more symbolic than fundamentally significant.”\n\n“I wouldn’t call it a drop in the bucket. It’s basically a gesture… an important one symbolically,” he told CNN Business.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted Western powers to ban imports of Russian crude and refined products. The European Union earlier this week agreed to ban 90% of Russian oil by the end of this year.\n\nAt the same time, Russia has started to choke off exports of natural gas to some EU countries — adding to the energy supply crunch that has helped send US and European inflation to its highest level in decades and prices for gasoline and diesel to all-time highs.\n\n— CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report", "authors": ["Mark Thompson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/energy/eu-emergency-gas-plan", "title": "Europe plans to force countries to ration gas as Russia weaponizes ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe European Union has unveiled its emergency gas rationing plan — a day before it fears Russia could drastically cut the flow of natural gas to the continent.\n\nThe “Save Gas for a Safe Winter” plan announced Wednesday sets a target for the 27 member states to reduce their gas demand by 15% between August and March next year. That reduction is based on countries’ average gas consumption during the same months over the previous five years.\n\nThe plan is focused on curtailing demand by businesses and in public buildings, rather than private homes. Among the proposed measures, the EU Commission is encouraging industry to switch to alternate energy sources — including coal where necessary — and to introduce auction systems that compensate companies for reducing their gas consumption.\n\nThe Commission is also hoping to pass a new law that would give it the power to force states to reduce their demand for gas “when there is a substantial risk of a severe gas shortage or an exceptionally high gas demand,” it said in a press release.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This country is preparing for Russia to cut off its gas supply soon 02:50 - Source: CNN This country is preparing for Russia to cut off its gas supply soon 02:50\n\nBy September, countries would have to update their national gas reduction plans to show how they will meet the new target.\n\n\n\nThe measures come just one day before officials worry Gazprom, Russia’s state gas company, may refuse to re-start deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Nord Stream 1 has been shut over the past 10 days for routine maintenance.\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday that a total shut off of Russian gas was a “likely scenario.”\n\n“Russia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon,” she said in a press conference announcing the new plan.\n\nThe pipeline is a vital artery linking Russia’s vast gas reserves to the continent via Germany. It delivers 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year, or nearly 40% of the bloc’s total pipeline imports from Russia.\n\nLast month, Gazprom cut flows through the pipeline by 60%, blaming the West’s decision to withhold vital turbines because of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPipe systems and shut-off devices at the gas receiving station of the Nord Stream 1 Baltic Sea pipeline and the transfer station of the OPAL (Ostsee-Pipeline-Anbindungsleitung) on July 11 2022, in Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania, Lubmin, Germany. Jens B'ttner/picture-alliance/dpa/AP\n\nThose turbines have since been allowed to travel to Germany from Canada, where they were being repaired, under a sanctions waiver, the Canadian government said last week.\n\nBut Russia could still decide to keep the taps turned off. The country has already stopped delivering gas to several European countries and energy companies, because they have refused Russia’s demands to pay for gas in rubles — a move that would put them in breach of European sanctions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to Iran that Gazprom would “fulfill its obligations in full” in supplying gas to Europe. But he warned deliveries could drop by 20% next week if it does not receive the turbine, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nGazprom confirmed in a Wednesday tweet that it had not yet received the necessary documentation from Siemens, the turbine’s manufacturer, to allow for its delivery to Russia.\n\nSiemens told CNN it would not comment on Gazprom’s claims.\n\nThe ongoing uncertainty over Europe’s gas supplies has pushed benchmark gas prices up by about 85% since the invasion in late February, according to the Intercontinental Exchange.\n\nOn Wednesday, prices rose 5% to €161 ($165) per megawatt hour as the deadline for the pipeline’s reopening inched closer.\n\nGermany at risk\n\nGermany would be particularly vulnerable to reduced gas supplies. The region’s largest economy has long relied on Russia’s gas to power its homes and heavy industry.\n\nIn June, the country activated the second of its three-stage emergency gas rationing program days after Russia reduced flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Though it has managed to slash Russia’s share of its imports from 55% to 35% since the start of the war, a dramatic cut could severely limit its ability to fill its gas reserves ahead of winter, as well as tip the country into a recession.\n\nOn Monday, struggling German gas distributor Uniper drew down a €2 billion ($2.05 billion) credit facility with bank KfW because of the impact of Russian gas supply disruptions.\n\nRobert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, said earlier this month that the country must “prepare for the worst” on Thursday, when the pipeline is due to come back online.\n\nGas storage levels across the European Union are currently close to 65%, according to the Gas Infrastructure Europe.\n\nThat’s a lot more than the same time last year, but remains far off the 80% target the bloc has set for its member states to reach by November, Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group, told CNN Business.\n\n“If [Nord Stream 1] remains off or only partly returns after maintenance, it will be difficult for Germany and the whole of the EU to reach that target, hence the possibility of further political measures to cut gas usage,” said Gloystein.\n\nA ‘perilous’ situation\n\nThe bloc is racing to secure alternate gas supplies to avoid a potentially catastrophic shortage this winter. But a crisis could come sooner than expected depending on Russia’s next move.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that a complete shut off of Russia’s gas could shrink GDP in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic — countries particularly reliant on Moscow’s exports — by as much as 6%.\n\n“The point at which the crisis will bite more deeply is looking closer and closer as we head into the summer and then autumn, this is increasingly a matter of ‘when’ and not ‘if’ the crisis arrives,” Vladimir Petrov, senior power analyst at Rystad Energy, said in a Monday note.\n\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, described the situation in Europe as “perilous” and said it must prepare for a “long, hard winter.”\n\nAccording to the IEA, even if European countries manage to fill their gas stores to 90% of their capacity, it is still likely to face supply disruptions early next year if Russia decides to cut off gas deliveries from October.\n\nThe agency said earlier this week that Europe must find ways to save 12 billion cubic meters of gas — equal to about 3% of its annual consumption — over the next 12 weeks to avert disaster. It laid out a number of steps countries could take, including burning more coal and oil.\n\n“This is a big ask, but it does not exaggerate the scale of what is needed,” Birol said in a Monday press statement.\n\n“It is categorically not enough to just rely on gas from non-Russian sources — these supplies are simply not available in the volumes required to substitute for missing deliveries from Russia,” he added.\n\n— Mark Thompson and Nadine Schmidt contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}]}
