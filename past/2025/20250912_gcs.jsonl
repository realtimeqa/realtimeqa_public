Here's what we know", "text": "A manhunt is underway in Utah for the gunman who fatally shot Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist who was making an appearance on a college campus when he was killed.\n\nThe identity of the shooter and what motivated the gunman to carry out the assassination is still unknown. The FBI on Sept. 11 released surveillance images of a \"person of interest,\" showing a person wearing a black shirt, jeans, a baseball cap and sunglasses. The bureau asked for the public's help in identifying the person captured on camera.\n\nAt a news conference, officials said they recovered a bolt-action rifle used in the shooting and tracked the suspect's movements before and after the incident. The shooter remains at large and appears to be of \"college age,\" said Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason.\n\n\"We are investing everything we have to this and we will catch this individual,\" Mason said.\n\nKirk, 31, was among the country's most prominent youth political activists and was a close ally of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. He made a name for himself as a talented and sometime provocative orator, drawing large crowds at college campuses where he hosted \"Prove Me Wrong\" debates. Kirk played a key role in Trump's growing popularity among young conservative voters.\n\nThe FBI said it's working alongside local and state law enforcement in Utah, and requested that people with information, photos or videos of the incident share them through an online tip page.\n\n\"Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said on X.\n\nShooter jumped off rooftop and fled into neighborhood: Officials\n\nMason told reporters that the shooter arrived near the campus at 11:52 a.m. local time before moving through stairwells and on to a rooftop, where the attacker moved into a \"shooting location.\"\n\nAfter the shooting, the suspect ran to the other side of the building, jumped to the ground and fled off campus and into a nearby neighborhood. Investigators spoke with neighbors and witnesses and obtained high quality footage of the suspect.\n\nMason said if law enforcement's initial attempts to identify the shooter are unsuccessful, officials will release images of the suspect to the public.\n\nWhile authorities have not identified the shooter, Mason said the attacker \"appears to be of college age.\" He added that the \"suspect blended in well with the college institution.\"\n\nAuthorities obtain rifle, footprint after Kirk shooting: FBI\n\nInvestigators hunting the shooter located a \"high-powered bolt action rifle\" in a wooded area where the shooter fled, among other pieces of evidence, said Robert Bohls, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Salt Lake City field office.\n\nBohls said the FBI laboratory will be analyzing the weapon as well as a \"footwear impression,\" a \"palm print\" and a \"forearm imprint\" that investigators also discovered.\n\nThe bureau has received more than 130 tips since the shooting occurred, Bohls said, adding that the agency will thoroughly investigate every lead.\n\nWhat happened to Charlie Kirk?\n\nKirk was sitting under a tent and speaking to a crowd of over 3,000 people, including many college students, when he was shot.\n\nVideos circulating online showed the gruesome scene as Kirk slumped over, and people ducked to the ground before running away and huddling in nearby buildings.\n\nOfficials said the gunman was positioned on a rooftop over 100 yards from where Kirk was seated with a microphone.\n\nThe event in Orem, Utah, was the latest stop on Kirk's fall campus tour, The American Comeback Tour. During such events, Kirk debates students and others about myriad of topics, some of them controversial. Just before the shot was fired, Kirk and another speaker were discussing school shooters who identify as transgender.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/10/who-is-charlie-kirk/86080255007/", "title": "Who is Charlie Kirk?

According to Deseret News, more than 6,000 people signed a petition asking Utah State University to bar Kirk from coming onto its campus on Sept. 30 for another of his events.\n\nKirk has become a national figure as a conservative influencer and as the founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that pushes for conservative politics on high school and college campuses.\n\nIn 2024, he spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he gave a speech focusing on what Kirk says he heard from young people around the U.S.\n\nKirk's ongoing tour\n\nThe shooting happened as Kirk was set to kick off a nationwide tour of debates in colleges across the United States. Named “The American Comeback Tour,” the tour was set to make stops at Colorado State University, the University of Minnesota, among other campuses.\n\nApart from the tour, Kirk was also scheduled to debate progressive influencer Hasan Piker at Dartmouth College on September 25. On his live stream, Piker reacted to the shooting in horror and expressed fear to his followers that he could be similarly targeted.\n\nKirk grew Turning Point into a national heavyweight\n\nKirk has been a rising star within the Republican Party over the last ten years, growing his own online profile and expanding Turning Point USA into a power broker within the GOP.\n\nA speech he delivered at the 2016 Republican convention helped introduce him to a national audience.\n\nThen 22 years old, Kirk energized the Cleveland crowd with an applause line that the GOP was “the party of youth and diversity.\" He volunteered a to-the-point slogan irreverent for its time: “Big government sucks.”\n\nIn the two presidential election cycles since then, Kirk's organization has become a nationwide political player, regularly hosting swing-state events.\n\nThe group is controversial even among Republicans. Its leaders have sought to oust those they disagree with. During the 2024 election cycle, Kirk publicly criticized the leadership of former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and called on his donors to stop giving to the national party. McDaniel stepped down months later.\n\nKirk himself has pursued provocative political positions, such as a social media campaign to discredit the civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. He has encouraged traditional gender roles, praising the values of \"marriage and motherhood\" for young women.Turning Point now boasts allies at the very top of the GOP's chain of command.\"Charlie Kirk and Turning Point have been a major reason why the conservative movement is finally growing a spine,\" Donald Trump Jr. said in a written comment to The Arizona Republic in 2024. \"Turning Point's influence has grown because they pick the right fights, work their butts off, and they don't apologize for it. ... That inspires people.\"\n\nKirk's family\n\nKirk was born in Illinois and raised in the suburbs of Chicago. He became involved in politics as a high school student and dropped out of college to pursue political activism.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, Kirk married his wife, former Miss Arizona Frantzve, in 2021. He has a daughter who was born in 2022 and a son who was born in 2024.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Spencer Cox. He was arrested after a relative contacted a family friend, who told authorities that Robinson had \"confessed to them or implied that he committed the incident.\" Authorities said they tied him to the crime through a review of online messages, interviews with his family and friends, and surveillance video.\n\nRobinson was arrested around 10 p.m. local time Thursday on charges of aggravated murder and two other felonies.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we got him,\" Cox said.\n\nIn the hours after the arrest, the scene outside Robinson's Washington City home was eerily quiet. A crowd of reporters gathered across the street from the family home as police officers directed people to stay away from the property.\n\nPresident Donald Trump first announced the suspect’s capture in an appearance on Fox and Friends earlier Friday.\n\nThe news caps a frantic search after authorities, as recently as Thursday evening, said they had \"no idea\" where the suspect might be.\n\nKirk, 31, was killed by a single gunshot on Wednesday afternoon while speaking in front of some 3,000 people as part of his \"American Comeback Tour\" at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City. Kirk was answering an audience question about mass shootings when the bullet struck his neck, causing students and visitors to flee in panic.\n\nDiscord removes Tyler Robinson account, disputes some accusations\n\nDiscord, the online chat app linked to accused Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson, disputed some details of his use of the app that authorities shared at a Friday news conference.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson's roommate showed investigators Discord messages from Robinson that contained references to a rifle that needed to be retrieved and engravings on bullet casings found with the accused shooter’s gun.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Discord said the messages Cox mentioned do not appear to have been sent on Discord.\n\n“In the course of our investigation, we identified a Discord account associated with the suspect, but have found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord,” the company statment said.\n\nDiscord has “removed the suspect’s account for violating our off-platform behavior policy,\" the company said. “We strongly condemn violence of any kind, including political violence, and we will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nNeighbor: 'I don't know why he would do it'\n\nThree doors down from the house where Tyler Robinson grew up, Kristin Schwiermann was finding it hard to reconcile the young man she thought she knew with the shooting.\n\n“He wasn’t that kind of kid,” said Schwiermann, 66. “He was raised in this neighborhood with good people and good family and I just don’t know why he would do that.”\n\nSchwiermann has lived on the street for 16 years and the Robinson family has been there the whole time. She worked as head custodian at Riverside Elementary School when Tyler Robinson was a student there. She described him as quiet, friendly, smart and hard-working.\n\n“Matt and Amber are very hard-working parents, they love their kids,” she said. “This is a total shock because that’s not who Tyler was … that’s not who Tyler is, and that’s what shocks us all. If he did this … I don’t know why he would do it.”\n\nShe said she was a member of the same congregation as the Robinsons, part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, though the family has not been active recently. She doesn’t know about the family's politics.\n\n“In a Latter-day Saint community, we just don’t talk politics because it makes contention, she said. “I don’t care what you stand for, whether you’re a Republican or Independent or Democrat. We have our opinions, we keep our politics to ourselves.”\n\n– Brandon Loomis\n\nWhen will charges be filed against the suspected shooter?\n\nProsecutors are expected to file charges against Robinson at his first court appearance on Tuesday, Sep. 16, according to Christopher Ballard of the Utah County Attorney’s Office.\n\nRobinson’s hearing is set to begin at 3 p.m. local time, Ballard said.\n\nSuspect attended Dixie Technical College, school confirms\n\nThe Utah Board of Higher Education released information that Tyler James Robinson is documented as a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, based in St. George, in southwestern Utah.\n\nHe briefly attended Utah State University in 2021 and received concurrent enrollment credit through Utah Tech University while in high school.\n\n– Nick Penzenstadler\n\nSocial media photos show suspect on family trips, sometimes handling a gun\n\nThe Facebook page for the mother of Tyler Robinson, as of about 9 a.m. ET on Sept. 12, included photos of him on various family trips over many years, including to Hawaii, Alaska, and Disneyland.\n\nIn 2020, the family went on a multi-day, guided trip down the Colorado River, according to a post from June 30 of that year. Accompanying photos showed Tyler Robinson in the water, along with his family.\n\nThere were some photos that showed Robinson handling a gun, although gun use didn't feature prominently among the many photos of him and his family over several years. Records show that both of his parents have Utah hunting licenses.\n\nFor instance, a post on July 6, 2014, that described a \"camping, hiking, and shooting\" trip included a photo of him as a child holding a gun, as well as other photos of him in the outdoors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi and Dinah Pulver\n\nFormer classmates 'shocked' by Tyler Robinson's arrest\n\nXander Luke, 22, graduated in the same Pine View High School class of 2021 as Tyler Robinson and remembered him from several classes they had together.\n\nLuke said he was scrolling TikTok on Sept. 12 when he saw Robinson’s mugshot and thought he looked familiar, then quickly realized the connection.\n\n“I was floored,” Luke said. “Everyone from our class is shocked, but it started to make a little sense since he was politically active and outspoken about people’s rights.”\n\nLuke said he and Robinson shared sentiments about government and political corruption and a view that the system in general was not solving the nation’s problems.\n\nHe described Robinson as deeply immersed in Internet and meme culture. He also had thoughts on the reported engravings on shell casings that police have described.\n\n“From what I remember, his family was more conservative, but Tyler thought the entire system was out of place,” Luke told USA TODAY. “He thought both political sides were contributing to a country being in a worse place and not improving the world.”\n\nLuke said he views those casual high school conversations through a different lens after the violence at Utah Valley University.\n\nHe said it was shocking to imagine that his former classmate could have “branched off from those beliefs into doing something like this,” Luke said.\n\n– Nick Penzenstadler\n\nNeighbors recall Tyler Robinson as a 'quiet' kid\n\nThose who knew 22-year-old Tyler Robinson said they would have “never expected” him to be accused of murder.\n\nRobert Sylvester, a longtime neighbor, said he knew the suspect from small interactions over the years. Once, Sylvester recalled, Tyler Robinson helped him look for a water shutoff valve after a leak.\n\n“He was quiet − we didn’t really communicate back and forth,” Sylvester said. “A lot of people call that politeness. He was so introverted I didn’t look at it as polite, I looked at is as off, or strange.”\n\nHe remembered seeing the Robinson brothers doing the typical things kids in the neighborhood did, like racing down the street.\n\n“Never expected it,” Sylvester said. “It just tears me apart.”\n\n– David DeMille and Karissa Waddick\n\nSuspect arrested on three felony charges\n\nRobinson was arrested on felony charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm and obstruction of justice in Utah County court, according to court records obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nHe's being held without bail, according to an order from Judge Shawn R. Howell. Court documents confirm Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions on his record.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox previously said more detailed information will come when official charging documents are filed, which is expected to occur early next week in preparation for a preliminary hearing.\n\n– Nick Penzenstadler\n\nWho was Charlie Kirk? From cookie crusade to conservative politics, conservative leader inspired and enraged millions\n\nRobinson's mother celebrated his teen accomplishments\n\nAs of about 9 a.m. EDT on Sept. 12, the Facebook page for suspect Tyler Robinson's mother was filled with celebrations of her son's milestones and accomplishments.\n\nOn May 18, 2017, when Tyler Robinson would have been 14 years old, she said that her son made the \"high honor roll\" at school, was \"beautifully talented on the piano,\" and enjoyed participating in choir.\n\n\"Tyler is my tech genius and the best helper I could ask for!\" his mother added.\n\nIn an April 26, 2018 post, soon after her son turned 15, she said he won an award for maintaining a 4.0 grade point average at school that year.\n\n\"Proud mama moment for sure!\" she added, with a hashtag calling him a \"smartypants.\" The post included a photo of Robinson wearing a medal and holding a certificate.\n\nIn a post dated Aug. 25, 2021, she describes driving her son up to Logan, Utah, where Utah State University is located.\n\n\"Driving away without him was one of the most difficult things I've had to do in a long time,\" she wrote. \" He's so excited to start this journey and it's going to be so amazing for him!\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat do we know about Charlie Kirk's funeral?\n\nDetails on Charlie Kirk's funeral arrangements are still forthcoming as of Friday morning. Kirk's funeral will be in Arizona, where he lived with his wife and two children before his death.\n\n\"Unfortunately, at this time the service time is still pending,\" a spokesperson for Hansen Mortuary Chapel in Phoenix told USA TODAY by phone about 9:30 a.m. local time.\n\nKirk's body was transported by Air Force Two from Salt Lake City, Utah, to a Phoenix mortuary on Thursday.\n\nTrump told reporters he plans to attend the service.\n\n– Natalie Neysa Alund\n\n'A different path': Utah governor pleads for dialogue\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox made a plea to young Americans, asking them to reject violence in the wake of Kirk's killing.\n\nIn a news conference that took on the mood of a sermon or a eulogy for the slain conservative organizer, Cox all but begged fellow Americans to turn away from angry division.\n\n\"To my young friends out there, you are inheriting a country where politics feels like rage, it feels like rage is the only option,\" said Cox, who is a Republican.\n\nThrough Kirk's encouragement of \"reasonable agreement,\" Cox said, \"we have a reminder that we can choose a different path.\"\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nVery quiet, musical, few friends, from a churchgoing family\n\nThe family of Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk's slaying, lives in a two-story gray house in Washington City, Utah, just across the Virgin River from St. George. A pickup truck and a Dodge Challenger sit in the driveway, which matches the description officials gave of a car seen driving away from the university after the shooting.\n\nSeveral neighbors and people from the area said Robinson lived at home with his family and they'd seen him there regularly. The neighbors said they had been members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church, and remembered Tyler from school and church.\n\nKristin Schwiermann, who has lived two doors down for the last 16 years, said she has known the Robinson family for decades. She said she watched the boys grow up and often crossed paths with the family at church and school events.“He was always very quiet, had just a few friends,” she said of the suspect. “I think he was more on the musical side, very smart.”Schwiermann said she believes social media may have played a role in shaping his views.\n\n“There’s just too much hate out there,” she said. “I know he wasn’t taught those things. I have no hate for him. Even though I loved Charlie Kirk, I’d rather try to understand what was going on in his mind.”\n\nInvestigators reviewed messages sent to suspect's roommate\n\nTyler Robinson's roommate shared messages sent on the platform Discord with investigators, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in a news conference.\n\nThe messages contained several references to a rifle, including that a rifle had been left behind wrapped in a towel in a bush and stating a need to retrieve a rifle. The messages also referenced engravings on bullets and a scope.\n\nInvestigators found the rifle wrapped in a dark-colored towel, he said.\n\nRobinson ‘became more political in recent years': Governor\n\nAt the dinner table before Charlie Kirk came to Utah Valley University for the event at which he was killed, members of suspect Tyler Robinson’s family had talked in disparaging terms about the conservative activist, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said at the news briefing.\n\n“Investigators interviewed a family member of Robinson who stated that Robinson had become more political in recent years,” Cox said.\n\nAlso, Cox said, a family member interviewed by authorities referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to Sept. 10, “and in the conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU.”\n\n“They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints that he had,” Cox said. “The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nWhat was written on the bullet casings found in the rifle?\n\nAuthorities said there were messages written on the fired casing and three unfired bullets found in the Mauser rifle allegedly used in the shooting.\n\nThe fired casing, according to Utah governor Spencer Cox, read, “Notices, Bulges, OwO What’s This?” The phrase references an internet meme tied to animated videos and furry culture. OwO references an emoticon, and “what’s this?” denotes cuteness or curiosity. It’s frequently referenced by video game streamers.\n\nOne of the unfired casings said, according to Cox: “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.” The lyrics reference the anthem of the antifascist Italian resistance during World War II.\n\nCox said that another read, “Hey fascist! Catch!”\n\nThe third unfired casing, according to Cox, said, “If you’re reading this, you’re gay LMAO.”\n\n-Davis Winkie\n\nTrump will attend Kirk funeral\n\nTrump will attend Kirk's funeral in Phoenix, Arizona, he said on Fox.\n\nOn top of a visit to the United Kingdom next week, the president said he will \"also go to a funeral for a great gentleman named Charlie Kirk, who should not be having a funeral right now.\"\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nA minister turned in suspect, Trump says\n\nA minister with a friend in law enforcement turned in the suspect in Kirk's killing, the president said.\n\n\"Somebody that was very close to him said that's him,\" Trump said. \"The person that was involved was a person of faith, a minister.\"\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nTrump says he hopes the suspect gets the death penalty\n\nTrump said he hoped the suspect in Kirk’s shooting receives the death penalty.\n\n“I hope he gets the death penalty,” Trump said. “What he did – Charlie Kirk was the finest person.”\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox has called for prosecutors to pursue the death penalty, which is legal in the state. Among the approved methods of execution in Utah is the firing squad.\n\nTrump on lawmakers canceling events: 'It's a dangerous business'\n\nTrump urged lawmakers who have canceled events in the wake of Kirk's assassination to \"go forward\" while monitoring security risks closely.\n\n\"It's a dangerous business,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed to the attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year and suggested he could've had better protection.\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nCharlie Kirk was a symbol for many young people. Now what?\n\nMaybe they got sucked in when they saw him debating Kamala Harris supporters on TikTok. Maybe something he said about marriage sparked a reaction in them. Maybe his loud-and-proud brand of politics, no matter how controversial, gave them confidence.\n\nCharlie Kirk, for many in the under-25 crowd, was a symbol. A hallmark of youth political organizing in the internet age. A person they revered or despised. Now, he's gone, fatally shot on a Utah college campus on Sept. 10.\n\nFor many Republicans, he was a culture warrior who could make inroads with young voters. For many Democrats, he was the epitome of Trump’s brand of combative conservatism. Across the political spectrum, young people are left reckoning with what his death means for their generation and grappling with how they feel about it.\n\n– Rachel Hale\n\nWatch the video of Charlie Kirk shooting suspect fleeing\n\nUS threatens action against foreigners praising Charlie Kirk's death\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau warned that the United States may take action against foreign nationals who glorify Kirk's killing.\n\n\"I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\" Landau said in a post on social media.\n\nLandau's comments come months after the Trump administration introduced its new visa policy. Foreign nationals visiting or living in the country legally could lose their visa status if they violate the law under the new \"catch and revoke\" policy, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in May.\n\nIn an email sent to USA TODAY, a state department spokesperson said that \"this administration does not believe that the United States should grant visas to persons whose presence in our country does not align with US national security interests.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nContributing: Reuters, Amanda Lee Myers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-wheeling-cookies-career-activism/86092837007/", "title": "From cookie crusade to conservative politics, Charlie Kirk inspired ...", "text": "AI-assisted summary Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nKirk founded Turning Point USA, a multimillion-dollar organization focused on mobilizing young conservative voters.\n\nHe was a prominent ally of former President Donald Trump and known for his hardline views and often incendiary language.\n\nThe FBI and Utah police are still searching for the gunman, and a motive has not been determined.\n\nWHEELING, IL − Charlie Kirk wanted cheaper cookies.\n\nThe cafeteria at Wheeling High School in the Chicago suburb of Wheeling, Illinois, had doubled the price of cookies from a quarter to 50 cents, citing the higher cost of ingredients. But Kirk, a senior, wasn’t having it. He created a Facebook page to call attention to cookie inflation and urged other students to join him in a cookie boycott.\n\n“Cookies are the highlight of most school days, only to be DOUBLED in price without our consultation? NO!” he wrote on Aug. 23, 2011. “Enough of the manipulation, we must stand together in this fight. Fight the Power!”\n\nThe pressure campaign worked. The cafeteria caved, and students were once again able to gorge on cookies at the bargain price of 25 cents apiece.\n\nThe teenage Kirk’s cookie crusade foreshadowed the career path that he would follow into adulthood.\n\nOver the next decade and a half, Kirk would become one of the nation’s most influential conservative activists, building a multimillion-dollar empire that he used to rally young voters across the country and help to reelect President Donald Trump, whom he would count among his friends.\n\nKirk inspired millions of people and infuriated millions of others with his hard-line conservative views and often incendiary language on everything from abortion, race and gender to gay marriage and gun rights. It was a career that would make him an influential ally to the White House but would end with gunfire on a college campus, the very place he first found success mobilizing a legion of young conservatives.\n\nKirk, 31, was cut down by a single bullet on Sept. 10 while speaking to students at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, as part of his \"American Comeback Tour.\" Trump announced his death on social media, calling him “Great and even Legendary” and saying no one understood the “Heart of Youth in the United States” better than him.\n\nTrump said Friday, Sept. 12, that a suspect in Kirk's shooting is in custody. \"We have him,\" he said in an interview on Fox and Friends.\n\nIn a sign of Kirk’s influence in Republican circles, Vice President JD Vance accompanied Kirk’s family and coffin aboard Air Force Two on the trip back to their home in Arizona.\n\nKirk's willingness to champion a conservative version of family values and attack what he saw as dangerous liberal ideas that impinged on personal freedom won him widespread support across the country. His death sparked calls for monuments and memorials. Trump announced that he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor bestowed upon those who have exemplary contributions to the nation.\n\nAlthough authorities have not yet offered a motive nor detained a suspect, many of Kirk's supporters saw his assassination through an ideological lens.\n\n“I don’t think they realize it yet, but murdering Charlie is going to be remembered as the day where we finally woke up to what this fight really is,\" Nick Freitas, a conservative influencer and Republican member of the Virginia House of Delegates, posted on social media. \"It's not a civil dispute among fellow countrymen. It's a war between diametrically opposed worldviews which cannot peacefully coexist with one another. One side will win, and one side will lose.\"\n\n\"My Christian faith requires me to love my enemies and pray for those who curse me,\" he added. \"It does not require me to stand idly by in the midst of savagery and barbarism ... quite the opposite.\"\n\n'Energy, confidence and passion'\n\nAt the high school where Kirk waged his cookie crusade, flags hung at half-staff on Sept. 11. The school is in the Village of Wheeling, a leafy suburb here northwest of Chicago, not far from Arlington Heights and Prospect Heights, where Kirk was born and grew up.\n\nKirk, who graduated in 2012, was an Eagle Scout and captain of the basketball team. Tall and slender, he also played varsity football and was in the marching band and wind symphony. His mother was a mental health counselor and his father an architect.\n\nKirk will be remembered \"as a student who brought energy, confidence, and passion to the classroom and beyond,\" school officials said in a statement.\n\n\"Even as a teenager, Charlie was known for his drive, his willingness to speak up, and his ability to inspire spirited conversation among his peers,\" the statement said. \"His time at Wheeling was marked by the qualities of curiosity, conviction, and determination – traits that would continue to shape his path long after graduation.\"\n\nA suburban Chicago newspaper, the Daily Herald, noted his prowess on the basketball court. After a game against the Rolling Meadows Mustangs in 2012, Wheeling coach John Clancy told the paper that Kirk had had “a special night” and “made big plays.” The Wheeling Wildcats lost, but Kirk put up 20 points, leading a late game comeback.\n\nThat same year, Kirk landed on the radar of Breitbart News when he sent the right-wing publication an email complaining about “liberal brainwashing” in classrooms. Kirk said his economics textbook, written by Paul Krugman, a liberal economist and columnist for The New York Times, was “littered with biased and subjective analysis.” Kirk said he had cofounded a group to correct misinformation and offer “an alternative viewpoint.”\n\nHe would later write essays for conservative publications like Breitbart and The Daily Caller.\n\n'Big Government Sucks'\n\nKirk got his big political break in 2012. Just 18, he delivered a speech at a youth government day at Benedictine University in a suburb of Chicago. His address caught the attention of Bill Montgomery, a retired entrepreneur who was wowed by Kirk's raw talent.\n\n“You can’t go to college!” Montgomery recalled telling Kirk, according to the National Journal. \"You need to start an organization to reach out to young people with your message.\"\n\nKirk took courses at Harper College near Chicago after high school but dropped out without earning a college degree.\n\nA month after his meeting with Montgomery, the two teamed up to start Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that would propel his rise from college dropout to head of a new wave of conservative activists.\n\nThe aim of Turning Point was to engage young Republicans and serve as a counterweight to liberal groups. At the time, the right wing of the Republican Party was captured in the tea party movement, with activists arguing for limited government. Kirk echoed that feeling in Turning Point’s original, cheeky slogan: “Big Government Sucks.”\n\nWithin a few years, the Phoenix-based Turning Point became a political force all its own. The organization posted grants and contributions worth roughly $2 million in 2014, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. By 2021, the latest year for which data is available, it boasted more than $79 million in contributions.\n\nTurning Point would gain fire with Trump’s political ascendency. During Trump’s first term, Kirk made regular visits to the White House and forged friendships with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and another Trump enthusiast, the rapper Kanye West.\n\nThrough Turning Point – and particularly his repeated campus tours and visits – Kirk helped mobilize millions of young voters to support Trump and other conservative candidates nationally. Trump repeatedly spoke at Turning Point events, and candidates sought the exposure and endorsement Kirk could bring them through his podcasts and powerful social media platforms.\n\nAt a Turning Point rally in December 2024, a month after winning the presidency for the second time, Trump credited Kirk with his win. Kirk's organization grew alongside Trump's MAGA movement.\n\n\"I want to express my tremendous gratitude to Charlie Kirk,” Trump said. “He's really an amazing guy, amazing guy and his whole staff for their relentless efforts to achieve this very historic victory. It's not my victory; it's your victory. It's a great honor.\"\n\n'Submit to your husband'\n\nKirk expanded his own political messaging, with direct challenges to progressive causes and an embrace of Christian conservatism. He even founded an outreach group − TPUSA Faith − focused on pastors and mobilizing those in the pews. Its motto: \"TPUSA Faith exists to unite the Church around primary doctrine and to eliminate wokeism from the the American pulpit.\"\n\nHis following grew to include millions of people. He hosted a nationally syndicated, three-hour daily radio show and podcast that reportedly drew a combined audience of millions. Podtrac, which runs podcast analytics, ranked his show No. 19 in June by unique monthly audience among podcasts nationwide, up from No. 31 previously.\n\nConservative radio talk show host Joe Walsh, who split with Kirk politically over Trump in 2016, called him \"like a son to me.\"\n\n\"We fought politically, we disagreed publicly, almost always respectfully, but thru it all, he was still like a son to me,\" Walsh said in a social media post.\n\nOn his radio show and podcast, Kirk offered a platform for Trump's surrogates to share their ideas. His conversations with top Trump aides and supporters often went to extremes that mainstream media platforms wouldn't. That included on hot-button topics like immigration, gun rights and the anti-abortion movement.\n\nIn February 2024, amid the hotly contested presidential election, for example, immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller joined Kirk to talk about how Trump would deport entire families, including U.S. citizen children.\n\n“Any advanced, developed nation in the world that has a policy of not deporting adults with minors is a nation that will never be able to be sovereign,” Miller said during the segment. “It will never be able to have a border.”\n\nKirk himself often resorted to tough talk against those who did not share his conservative views.\n\nHe accused Democrats of hating the country, argued against the separation of church and state, claimed that in urban America “prowling Blacks” target white people “for fun” and called transgender people “a throbbing middle finger to God.”\n\nHe argued that former President Barack Obama should be put on trial for treason, labeled then-Vice President Kamala Harris “a DEI pick” and said that when he sees a Black pilot, he thinks, “boy, I hope he’s qualified.”\n\nWhen Taylor Swift announced her engagement to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Kirk urged the pop superstar to “reject feminism” and “submit to your husband.” He also encouraged Swift to have “lots of children.”\n\nJosh Kredit, like Kirk an Arizona father and a Christian, said he admired Kirk's fearless willingness to stake a position and defend it.\n\n\"Somehow he could distill things down and resonate, cut through the noise. He would just so bluntly attack an issue,\" Kredit, 39, and a father of five, told USA TODAY. \"He had such a talent for speaking and resonating with kids. I can't do it – if I try to talk to them about it, their eyes glaze over. But he could.\"\n\nKredit said he particularly appreciated Kirk's stances on marriage, the traditional roles of men and women, and his opposition to transgender althletes in women's sports.\n\nKredit and Kirk moved in similar circles, and had many mutual colleagues, and Kredit said he'd recently attended an event where Kirk spoke. Kredit said he was particularly impressed by Kirk's ability to use the Bible to help explain basic truths – truths that some politicians have shied away from saying out loud.\n\n\"He encouraged people to get married and have kids. ... Those are the types of things that not enough people are saying right now. Men are men, women and women, and we should love that,\" Kredit said. \"He just set a great example, frankly, for my kids.\"\n\n'Criminals love gun control'\n\nKirk was known as an outspoken advocate for gun rights. He frequently showed up on social media as a Second Amendment warrior in the wake of mass shootings.\n\n“There is no First Amendment without the Second Amendment,” he posted in 2021.\n\n“Criminals love gun control because it ensures only criminals control the guns,” he wrote in 2022.\n\nBut Kirk’s comments at a 2023 event in Salt Lake City suggesting that “some gun deaths” were the price for gun-owning freedoms quickly began reverberating across social media in the wake of his fatal shooting.\n\n“Having an armed citizenry comes with a price, and that is part of liberty,” Kirk said at the event at Awaken Church, hosted by his Turning Point USA.\n\n“You will never live in a society when you have an armed citizenry and (where) you won't have a single gun death,” he said.\n\n“That is nonsense,” he said. “It's drivel. But I am – I think it's worth it. I think it's worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”\n\nThough his reach expanded beyond college students, Kirk still made college campuses a focus of Turning Point’s efforts. He would go toe-to-toe with liberal students on campuses, challenging anyone to beat him in a debate. He even debated college students at the University of Oxford and Cambridge University in England.\n\n“I visit college campuses so you don’t have to,” he jokingly told delegates at the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Kirk arrived at Utah Valley on the first of what was to be 15 stops on \"The American Comeback Tour.\" Sitting beneath a white tent, he took questions from the crowd of about 3,000 people as part of his “Prove Me Wrong” segment.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into the event, an audience member asked if Kirk knew how many transgender Americans have been the shooter in mass shootings over the past decade.\n\n“Too many,” Kirk replied.\n\nThe audience member said there had been just five and then asked Kirk how many mass shootings there had been during that period.\n\n\"Counting or not counting gang violence?\" Kirk replied.\n\nA single shot then rang out. Kirk slumped in his chair, blood gushing from his neck. Panicked audience members ran for cover.\n\nTwo hours later, Trump announced Kirk was dead.\n\nContributing: The Arizona Republic", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/09/10/charlie-kirk-shot-conservatives-political-violence/86081819007/", "title": "Kirk's death shows conservatives are being targeted | Opinion", "text": "Charlie Kirk, conservative activist, commentator and cofounder of Turning Point USA, was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem on Sept. 10.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox confirmed a \"person of interest\" was in custody, who FBI officials later released. The search for the suspect continued Wednesday, so we don't yet have a confirmed motive, but at this moment in our political culture, it is not hard to connect the dots. It seems likely, given Kirk's high profile as a conservative influencer, that he was targeted for his outspoken conservative and Christian beliefs.\n\nKirk, 31, was a devoted Christian, husband, father of two young children, and one of President Donald Trump's most ardent supporters and allies. Trump himself already eulogized Kirk's death in a post on social media. Kirk epitomized the MAGA right and was particularly endearing to Gen Z conservatives.\n\nIronically, Kirk's professional career at Turning Point USA, an organization that highlights conservative views on high school and college campuses, was dedicated to robust debate, often on college campuses underneath a tent emblazoned with the words \"Prove me wrong.\"\n\nBut now we have a prominent voice, with his whole life ahead of him, that has been snuffed out in a senseless act of violence. That's the opposite of healthy discourse.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nIt has to be said. Conservatives are being targeted.\n\nTrump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024. A second attempt occurred two months later. After Kirk's death, it feels like conservatives are the current targets of political violence.\n\nI know this happens to Democrats, too. In June, a gunmanshot Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in their homes. They survived. Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were also shot in their home. Tragically, they died.\n\nBut right now, in part because of the graphic video posted all over social media, and on the heels of two Trump assassination attempts in 2024, it is conservatives who feel hunted and targeted. Because of this, we are mourning a leader in the conservative movement. And I am angry.\n\nLike Kirk, I am a conservative and a Christian. The toxic political discourse in my email and messages is full of vitriol. The killing of Kirk in broad daylight and the Trump assassination attempts make my experience seem mild by comparison, but it does feel unsafe to hold the same beliefs right now. Kirk's killing seems indicative of a growing sentiment toward conservatives that feels increasingly vitriolic and violent.\n\nKirk's death is a warning sign, and I worry about what comes next\n\nKirk was a national figure. He was inspirational and kind. His death was not just another act of political violence. His goal was to further robust discourse among the right and the left. Healthy debate is not divisive. It is American. It seems like Kirk was killed for this.\n\nI believe Kirk's death will be a flashpoint for conservatives.\n\nIn this moment, it is important to recognize that this feels like an attack on the more than 77 million Americans who voted for Trump, and on those who hold dear Christian and conservative beliefs. Those who seek to live these daily as Kirk did.\n\nWe do condemn political violence, but we also stand firm against being targeted for our beliefs as conservatives. It is un-American and it is wrong. We will continue to speak our beliefs and support our fellow Christians and conservatives. We will not back down, be quiet or dampen what we believe in the face of violence.\n\nThis is what Charlie Kirk would have wanted.\n\nNicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

Melissa Hortman. Trump called it 'horrific.'\n\nThe shooting death of Charlie Kirk has reignited an intense debate around political violence in America.\n\nKirk, a prominent conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA, was shot in the neck at a Sept. 10 event at Utah Valley University and the president confirmed his death hours after.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike have denounced the act of political violence. President Donald Trump addressed the incident in a video where he blamed the \"radical Left\" for heated rhetoric that he said was \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today.\"\n\n\"It's long past time for all Americas and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year, in the most hateful and despicable way possible,\" Trump said in the video.\n\nBut several others have been quick to compare Kirk's death to that of Minnesota House of Representatives speaker emerita Melissa Hortman of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party earlier this summer. Hortman was shot and killed in her home in what officials called a political assassination.\n\nHere is what the president said about the two incidents:\n\nCharlie Kirk shooting live updates: Rifle found, suspect still sought\n\nDonald Trump on Charlie Kirk's death: 'Great guy from top to bottom'\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social shortly after the incident occurred. \"We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot. A great guy from top to bottom,\" the post read. \"GOD BLESS HIM!\"\n\nTrump confirmed Kirk's death in another post hours after the incident, saying \"no one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.\"\n\nTrump's video from the Oval Office also honored Kirk, calling him a \"patriot, who devoted his life to the cause of open debate and the country he loved so much, the United States of America.\"\n\nThe White House announced a presidential proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half-staff until Sept. 14 in his honor. On Sept. 11, Trump said he will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously to Kirk.\n\nWhat did Trump say about Melissa Hortman?\n\nOn June 14, Rep. Melissa Hortman, her husband and their golden retriever were shot and killed in their home. The suspect was indicted by a federal grand jury in July and is also accused of shooting and injuring another state lawmaker and his wife earlier the same day. Investigators say the attacks were researched and planned, and the suspect had a list of mostly Democratic lawmakers and their addresses.\n\n\"I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers,\" Trump said in a June 14 Truth Social post. \"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"\n\nDays later, Trump said he wouldn't call Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, suggesting it would \"waste time.\"\n\nHortman was not mentioned in Trump's Sept. 10 address touching on several recent instances of political violence, including his own survived assassination attempt and the shooting Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana in 2017. He did not mention other attacks on Democrats including an arson attack at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s house, a kidnapping plot against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and an assault on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband in their home.\n\nWho was Charlie Kirk?\n\nIllinois native Charles James Kirk, 31, cofounded the nonprofit Turning Point USA in 2012 when he was 18. The organization's stated goal is to \"build the most organized, active, and powerful conservative grassroots activist network on high school and college campuses across the country.\"\n\nTPUSA claims to be on over 3,500 campuses and has spawned other activist measures, including, among others, an online academy, Turning Point Faith, and Turning Point Action, a political advocacy group that heavily involved itself, without results, in the 2022 cycle in Arizona and other swing states.\n\nAt his campus stops like the one he was speaking at in Utah, Kirk debates students who challenge him at an open mic in a \"Prove me Wrong Table\" series.\n\nKirk was a highly divisive figure. He spoke out against the validity of the 2020 election, said he didn't think Black History Month deserved a whole month, and believed only married heterosexual couples should be able to adopt children. In 17 Politico fact-checks over Kirk's statements, 87% were found to be at least \"Mostly False\" with 17% coming in as \"Pants on Fire.\"\n\nKirk was host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" on Salem Media's \"The Answer\" radio channel. In 2021, it was ranked as the 21st most popular podcast on Apple podcasts. Apple currently lists it as No. 9 for U.S. news podcasts, eight above NPR. Kirk is married to Erika Kirk, an entrepreneur, and the couple has two children. Their daughter was born in August 2022, and they had a son in 2024.\n\nWhat was Donald Trump and Charlie Kirk's relationship?\n\nKirk has long been a Trump ally.\n\nTurning Point USA had its own turning point in 2016 when it began enthusiastically promoting Trump's 2016 campaign and Kirk served as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe organization hosted several campaign events that Trump and Kirk appeared at in the lead up to the 2024 election. Kirk was also a speaker at the first night of the Republican National Convention.\n\n\"Under Biden, our young people own nothing and they are miserable,\" Kirk said in his speech. \"Donald Trump refuses to accept this fake, pathetic, mutilated version of the American dream.\"\n\nTrump also invited Kirk to speak at a viewing event at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, following the inauguration.\n\nKirk was one of the slate of Republicans who called for more transparency around the Jeffrey Epstein files in a rare moment of discord within the party. But the vast majority of his posts on X are supportive of Trump, including calling Trump's purported signature on the birthday letter to Epstein fake.\n\nContributing: N'dea Yancey-Bragg, Bart Jansen, Josh Meyer, Joey Garrison,Christopher Cann, Sarah D.

Officers from the Washington City Police Department kept media and neighbors on the other side of the street.\n\nNeighbors were largely tight-lipped about the family, but many of those who spoke with USA TODAY focused on the family’s faith – they are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose members are known as Mormons.\n\nAnd that faith helped lead to Robinson’s capture.\n\nA ‘minister’ and family members ‘who did the right thing’\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who first announced the arrest ( without naming Robinson ) during a Fox and Friends interview on Sept. 12, said that a “person of faith” was involved with identifying the suspect.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters later in the morning that Robinson was taken into custody after a family member contacted a family friend, who then informed authorities that Robinson had \"confessed to them or implied that he committed the incident.\"\n\nCox said: \"his family and a friend helped to deliver him into the custody of law enforcement in Washington County.” The governor thanked family members \"who did the right thing in this case.\" FBI Director Kash Patel said the arrest occurred at 10 p.m. local time on Sept. 11.\n\nAuthorities tied Robinson to the crime through a review of online messages, interviews with his family members and friends and surveillance video. The messages included some sent on Discord, a popular online chatting platform. In a statement to USA TODAY, Discord disputed statements that the messages were sent on the chatting platform.\n\nThe announcement came a day after law enforcement released several images as well as a video showing the alleged gunman’s leap from a rooftop after the Sept. 10 attack. The FBI recovered what they believe to be the murder weapon, a high-powered bolt-action rifle, and several imprints on the roof where the gunman fired the one fatal shot.\n\nThe ‘quiet’ kid ‘became more political in recent years’\n\nRobinson, who has no criminal history according to state records, attended high school in the neighboring city of St. George.\n\nHe is registered to vote, though he lacks a party affiliation. His parents are registered Republicans.\n\nAs of about 9 a.m. EDT on Sept. 12, the Facebook page for Tyler Robinson's mother was filled with celebrations of her son's milestones and accomplishments. The page depicted a tight-knit family where Tyler was the oldest of three sons.\n\nLongtime neighbor Robert Sylvester told USA TODAY that the Robinson brothers grew up playing throughout the neighborhood as other kids did, sometimes doing foot races down their residential street. Sylvester described him as “quiet.”\n\nThe family is shown on vacations to the Grand Canyon and on outdoor excursions like fishing trips and shooting days.\n\nTyler wore a Trump-related Halloween costume in 2017, according to Amber’s Robinson’s Facebook page.\n\nIn August 2020, Amber Robinson posted what appears to be an ACT college aptitude test score for Tyler – 34 out of 36 – that would place him in the top 1% of test takers, according to recent averages. He received a $32,000 scholarship to Utah State University, she said.\n\nKristin Schwiermann, who has lived two doors down for the last 16 years, said she has known the suspect’s family for decades. A head custodian with the Washington County School District, she said she watched the boys grow up and often crossed paths with the family at church and school events. “He was always very quiet, had just a few friends,” she said. “I think he was more on the musical side, very smart.”\n\nThe eldest Robinson son graduated from Pine View High School in St. George in 2021, according to Amber Robinson's social media and video of the commencement ceremony on YouTube. He then “briefly attended Utah State University for one semester in 2021,” the university said.\n\nHe later enrolled in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George. The Utah Board of Higher Education confirmed Sept. 12 that Robinson “is a third-year student” in the program.\n\nBut during those recent years, said Governor Cox, Robinson “had become more political.”\n\nAt the dinner table before Kirk came to Utah Valley University for the event at which he was killed, Tyler Robinson talked in disparaging terms about the conservative activist, Cox said at the news briefing.\n\nAlso, Cox said, a family member interviewed by authorities referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to Sept. 10, “and in the conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU.”\n\n“They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints that he had,” Cox said. “The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.”\n\nSchwiermann said she believes social media may have played a role in shaping his views. “There’s just too much hate out there,” she said. “I know he wasn’t taught those things. I have no hate for him. Even though I loved Charlie Kirk, I’d rather try to understand what was going on in his mind.”\n\nHunting rifle’s bullets engraved with meme-influenced messages\n\nThat online influence seemingly appeared in the messages that authorities allege Robinson inscribed on the ammunition used in the killing.\n\nThe Mauser 98 .30-06 bolt action rifle that law enforcement officials said was used to kill Kirk had a spent cartridge in the chamber and three unfired bullets in its magazine.\n\nFBI forensics agents recovered the Mauser in a wooded area behind Utah Valley University’s Losee building, from which the fatal shot was fired.\n\nThe fired casing, according to Cox, read, “Notices bulges OwO What’s This?” The phrase references an internet meme tied to animated videos and furry culture. OwO references an emoticon, and “what’s this?” denotes cuteness or curiosity. It’s frequently referenced by video game streamers.\n\nOne of the unfired casings, according to Cox, said: “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.” The lyrics reference the anthem of the antifascist Italian resistance during World War II.\n\nCox said that another read, “Hey fascist! Catch!” The casing also had a series of arrows that pointed up, right, down, down, and down in apparent reference to a cooperative shooter video game called Helldivers 2. The input is the code for an airstrike. It has morphed into a meme and is used to imply a devastating reaction to something that should be destroyed.\n\nLuke, the high school classmate, described Robinson as deeply ingrained in internet and meme culture and said the reported engravings on shell casings came as no surprise.\n\nThe third unfired casing, according to Cox, said, “If you’re reading this, you’re gay LMAO.”\n\nTom Chittum, a former ATF Associate Deputy Director, told USA TODAY that .30-06 “is a common hunting caliber.”\n\nChittum said the traditional hunting caliber is often used for hunting deer.\n\nWhen shooting a bolt action rifle, the user must manually manipulate a lever to eject the fired round and chamber a new round before firing again. That contrasts with semi-automatic rifles, which allow the shooter to pull the trigger and quickly fire again without interruption.\n\n“This was a longer shot, that suggests a person has prepared and practiced, but you don’t necessarily need to be a police or military sniper to make that shot,” Chittum said. “With modern optics and some practice, it’s not an impossible shot.\"\n\nState may seek death penalty with Trump’s support\n\nThe extent to which the shooter trained or practiced will likely be a major focus for investigators and prosecutors, who accused Robinson Sept. 12 of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe governor said Robinson is in custody at the Utah County Jail. Cox indicated Sept. 11 that state prosecutors may pursue the death penalty for Kirk’s assassin.\n\nTrump, in his morning comments on Fox and Friends, argued that Kirk's killer should receive the death penalty.\n\n\"I hope he gets the death penalty,\" Trump said. \"What he did − Charlie Kirk was the finest person.\"\n\nUtah uses lethal injection as its primary method of execution for inmates condemned today, though the firing squad is authorized in cases where lethal injection drugs are not available, due to a long-running shortage.\n\nDiscord removes suspect’s account but disputes Utah governor’s accusations\n\nDiscord, the online chat app linked to accused shooter Tyler Robinson, disputed some details of his use of the app that were shared at Friday's news conference in connection with the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson's roommate shared messages sent on the chat app with investigators that contained references to a rifle that needed to be retrieved and references to engravings on bullets found with the accused shooter’s alleged gun.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, though, Discord said the company believes the messages Cox mentioned in the news conference do not appear to have been sent on Discord.\n\n\"In the course of our investigation, we identified a Discord account associated with the suspect, but have found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord,\" said the statement.\n\n\"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages,\" the statement said. \"These were communications between the suspect’s roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"\n\nAlso, the statement said, Discord has \"removed the suspect’s account for violating our off-platform behavior policy.\"\n\n– Josh Meyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/10/charlie-kirk-shot-at-utah-valley-university/86080079007/", "title": "Charlie Kirk assassination live updates: Shooter still on the loose", "text": "Editor's note: This page summarizes the news of Charlie Kirk's assassination on Wednesday, Sept. 10.

Spencer Cox said at a news conference. \"I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination.\"\n\nLivestream video of the event showed crowds of people running from the university's courtyard where Kirk, 31, was speaking when the shooting occurred. Police said that about 3,000 people were in attendance at 12:20 local time when a gunshot rang out, sending attendees running for safety.\n\nNo suspect was in custody as of late Wednesday, but two people had been detained earlier in the day, according to the FBI and Utah Department of Public Safety. Investigators determined that neither of the two taken into custody had any ties to the shooting and were both later released.\n\nThe incident was the latest in a series of attacks on U.S. political figures, including two assassination attempts against Trump last year, that have underscored a sharp rise in political violence.\n\nTrump vows vengeance against 'radical Left' for killing Kirk\n\nCalling Kirk \"a martyr for truth and freedom,\" President Donald Trump on Wednesday attacked the \"radical Left\" and said its heated rhetoric was \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today.\"\n\nIn a four-minute live address posted to his Truth Social platform, Trump – sitting in the Oval Office – said he was “filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination\" of Kirk on a college campus in Utah earlier in the day. Kirk was a staunch political ally of Trump and helped fuel his political comeback and return to the White House in January.\n\nTrump portrayed Kirk as an inspiring leader who helped spur millions of young Americans to political activism. Earlier on Wednesday, he ordered all U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff until Saturday night in honor of Kirk, calling it a \"mark of respect.\"\n\nHe then turned his anger toward those he believes are responsible, repeating a familiar refrain of his in blaming liberals for violence against his MAGA supporters because of their public criticisms.\n\n\"It's long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year, in the most hateful and despicable way possible,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president didn’t broach the subject of how conservatives, including Kirk, have often attacked liberals and opponents of Trump in a similar manner, in some cases leading to political violence against those on the Left.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\n'Having an opinion in America is going to get you killed'\n\nAs the sun set, Ashton Kelly stood alone on a busy corner of University Parkway near the UVU campus holding a sign: “RIP Charley.”\n\nFor hours, he'd stood — joined briefly by a couple who’d been passing by — in honor of Kirk, his former employer. Kelly worked for him a few years ago, running a Turning Point USA chapter in the area, he said.\n\nPassing drivers honked and waved when they saw Kelly and his sign. “Lots of support, lots of love,” he said of the reaction. \"Mostly devastation, though.\"\n\nKelly, a local plumber, said he came to campus with his sign because he wanted to make people aware of Kirk’s goodness and mission as well as the danger of the nation’s political rhetoric.\n\nHe questioned how other political groups can lob names such as “Nazi extremists, fascists” at conservatives and then wonder why there are consequences.\n\n\"Having an opinion in America is going to get you killed. We’ve gone so left. … Now the Republican Party looks very comfortable for people (like me),” he said, noting the irony of saying so as a gay man in Utah.\n\nEyewitness describes fatal shooting: 'It was just terrible'\n\nAt a small makeshift memorial outside the Timpanogos Regional Hospital, about a dozen mourners lit candles, held flags, and talked to each other in muffled voices. One of those paying his respects was Ammon Paxton, 19, who said he was about four people away from Kirk when the conservative activist was shot.\n\nPaxton said he heard the shot go off, then saw the bullet hit Kirk. He said he watched him fall over and collapse.\n\n\"I can’t even describe how gruesome it was. It was just terrible,\" he admitted. \"He was one of my biggest heroes and my greatest inspirations. I looked up to him a lot.\"\n\nPaxton condemned the shooting, which he called an \"assassination,\" and said he and other young conservatives will fight back against what he called violence from the Left, but within the traditional definition of \"conservatism.\"\n\n\"I was pushed further right due to this event today, and I will not back down,\" he said.\n\nBut asked if he had a message for angry young conservatives who might be baited into retaliation for the shooting, Paxton said they should \"stay focused on Jesus.\"\n\n\"This is not what Charlie Kirk would have wanted,\" Paxton urged. \"He was a peacemaker.\"\n\n— Will Carless\n\nUtah residents grieve: 'I felt drawn to come here '\n\nNear the hospital sign, about a dozen others gathered, speaking only in hushed voices. A man played an acoustic guitar. Mourners placed candles and flowers near the sign and then stood back in silence.\n\nKim Pyper of Pleasant Grove, Utah, and her adult son said they came to Timpanogos Regional Hospital because they believed Kirk’s body had been taken there after the shooting. She said the \"shock and melancholy\" brought by the day’s events made her want to be with like-minded people — to both feel support and support Kirk.\n\nPyper said she felt his presence there.\n\n\"I felt drawn to come here tonight,\" said Pyper, standing off to the side of the makeshift memorial outside Timpanogos Regional Hospital.\n\n— Melissa Galbraith\n\nLaw enforcement agencies gather at a makeshift command center\n\nAt a makeshift command center on the Utah Valley University campus late Wednesday, dozens of officers from several agencies, including the FBI, Utah Department of Public Safety, and local police departments, milled around, waiting for orders or leads.Inside a glass-walled office, officials set up whiteboards and communications equipment.In the adjacent hallways, officers and sheriffs scanned their cellphones, continuously scanning for news and occasionally swapping tips and rumors.\n\n— Will Carless\n\nOfficials: 2 people taken into custody had no ties to the fatal shooting\n\nTwo people who were taken into custody on Wednesday did not have any connection to the shooting of Kirk, the FBI and Utah Department of Public Safety said in a joint statement.\n\nOne person was initially taken into custody as a suspect but was later released and charged with obstruction by university police, according to the statement. A second person was also taken into custody but was released after interrogation with law enforcement.\n\n\"There are no current ties to the shooting with either of these individuals,\" the statement said. \"There is an ongoing investigation and manhunt for the shooter.\"\n\nThe FBI and Utah Department of Public Safety said the shooting is believed to be a targeted attack.\n\n\"The shooter is believed to have fired from the roof of a building down to the location of the public event in the student courtyard. Any additional clarifications cannot be provided to protect the integrity of our investigation,\" the statement added.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. calls Kirk 'like a little brother'\n\nThe president's son, Donald Trump Jr., said Kirk was more than just a friend. He thought of him as family.\n\n\"He was like a little brother to me — and to millions of people around the world — he was a true inspiration,\" Trump Jr. said in a lengthy, heartfelt X post, hours after the Turning Point co-founder was fatally shot. \"He was one of the most courageous, principled men I’ve ever known, and he lived every day with purpose.\"\n\nIn the social media post, Trump Jr. praised Kirk for the impact he had on young people, \"reaching them in masses.\" Trump Jr. said Kirk gave those young voters the courage to stand up and to think for themselves.\n\nDespite his sometimes controversial rhetoric, Trump Jr. wrote that Kirk was never a threat to anyone. He described Kirk as a loving husband, father, leader, and fighter whose character and conviction were rare.\n\n— Terry Collins\n\nNew York Yankees hold moment of silence for Kirk\n\nThe New York Yankees held a moment of silence in remembrance of Kirk before Wednesday's game against the Detroit Tigers.\n\nTrump is scheduled to make an appearance at Yankee Stadium, where the team is expected to hold a pregame ceremony to recognize the victims and heroes of 9/11.\n\n— James H. Williams\n\nMourners gather outside Turning Point USA's headquarters in Phoenix\n\nSupporters of Kirk gathered outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA in Phoenix on Wednesday. Solemn individuals and young families with children dropped off flowers, shed tears, and embraced one another in the moments and hours after the shooting.\n\nStrangers called each other \"brother\" and \"sister,\" and knelt to pray, asking God to heal and comfort Kirk's wife and their children. They shared how Kirk's unapologetic willingness to speak his mind gave them the confidence to stand proudly in their faith and morals.\n\n\"We live in America. We have the First Amendment right to free speech. He was killed because of that right, but he taught the rest of us that it's OK to be strong,\" said Pawnee Carter, 64.\n\nJacob Kaufman, 24, who brought flowers after clocking out of work, said, \"There's no place for any political violence, no matter whether it's a right-wing activist or left-wing activist.\"\n\n— Taylor Seely, Arizona Republic\n\nMelania Trump calls for 'compassionate awareness' after Kirk's death\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump expressed her concern for Kirk’s children in a social media post.\n\n\"Charlie’s children will be raised with stories instead of memories, photographs instead of laughter, and silence where their father’s voice should have echoed,\" she wrote in a post on X Wednesday. \"Charlie Kirk’s life should serve as a symbolic reminder that compassionate awareness elevates family, love, and country.\"\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCharlie Kirk remembered by Phoenix churchgoers\n\nA north Phoenix church that partnered with Kirk in his effort to elect Trump as president proceeded with its usual Wednesday evening service on Sept. 10, just hours after news of Kirk's assassination in Utah sent shockwaves across the nation’s fraught political landscape.\n\nDream City Church Senior Pastor Luke Barnett called Kirk a patriot in his opening sermon, garnering robust applause. Many congregants took out their phones to record the tribute.\n\nJason and Alexis Van Skike of Gilbert, Arizona, saw Kirk at Dream City Church during two \"Freedom Night in America\" events. \"He spoke truth with grace,\" Alexis Van Skike said.\n\nThe couple made the roughly hourlong drive with their infant to attend the Sept. 10 service. They wanted to lay flowers at the base of the church’s American flag in memory of Kirk.\n\n\"What a legacy he’s leaving behind,\" Jason Van Skike said. \"Something we can all aspire to be.\"\n\n— Shawn Raymundo and Jose R. Gonzalez, Arizona Republic\n\nUtah Valley University issues all-clear for campus hours after shooting\n\nUtah Valley University issued an all-clear for the campus nearly six hours after the shooting. The university noted that “there is NO ongoing threat to campus\" and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe school had closed its campus following the incident. Earlier, the university said the campus would be closed and classes would be canceled until Monday, Sept. 15.\n\n\"On behalf of Utah Valley University, we are shocked and saddened by the tragic passing of Charlie Kirk, a guest to our campus. Our hearts go out to his family,\" the school said in a statement. \"As we grieve with our students, faculty, and staff who bore witness to this unspeakable tragedy, UVU campuses will be closed from September 11-14.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting, the school urged people to leave the campus as police continued their investigation. Confusion and fear quickly spread across the campus.\n\n\"No one should die over something like this. Whether you’re in support or not, it’s a tragedy,\" Tyler Knudsen, a sophomore at the university who attended the gathering, told USA TODAY.\n\nCharlie Kirk shot and killed in Utah: Maps, graphics, video show location of fatal shooting\n\nAG Bondi: 'We will not rest until justice is served'\n\nIn a statement on X, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi called Kirk an \"American hero whose love for God, country, and family guided every step of his life.\"\n\n\"He was a faithful servant who poured himself into the fight for justice and freedom,\" Bondi said. \"He challenged his generation with conviction, intellect, and dialogue. He believed deeply in the power of ideas and in the responsibility each of us has to defend the truth.\"\n\nBondi said she was devastated by Kirk's death, adding that her \"heart aches\" for Kirk's wife and their two children.\n\n\"Charlie’s legacy of faith, love, and service will endure in the lives he shaped and the cause he so selflessly championed,\" she said. \"We will honor him and we will not rest until justice is served.\"\n\nFBI now says the 'subject' in custody 'has been released'\n\nPatel said the FBI has released a person of interest in the shooting death of Kirk, less than two hours after he announced publicly that the bureau had that person in custody.\n\n\"The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement,\" Patel said in a post on X at 7:59 p.m. ET. \"Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency.\"\n\nPatel had earlier posted, at 6:21 p.m. ET, that a subject – FBI speak for a person of interest – had been apprehended.\n\n\"We refer you to the Director's post and have nothing additional to provide,\" the FBI said when reached for comment late Wednesday.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nOfficials provide more information about the suspected shooter\n\nUtah Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety Beau Mason told reporters during a news conference that authorities found potential information about the shooter on area CCTV.\n\n\"We do know he was dressed in all dark clothing, but we don't have much better info than that,\" he told reporters.\n\nAuthorities are trying to see if the person in custody matches the person in the security footage, Mason said. He added that the gunshot might have been fired from a rooftop on campus, but law enforcement officials aren't certain yet.\n\nThe FBI's Salt Lake City field office announced on X that it has set up a digital media tip line for information about the shooting. The Utah Department of Public Safety and the FBI are leading the criminal investigation, according to Mason.\n\nCharlie Kirk shooting: The latest on whether a suspect is in custody\n\n'Nothing like this happens in Utah'\n\nHours after the fatal shooting of Kirk, the locked-down Utah Valley University campus was quiet. Law enforcement agents carrying machine guns and an officer with a police dog were among the few walking around.\n\nMarked and unmarked police vehicles blocked traffic from entering campus off University Parkway as SUVs and trucks from a variety of nearby cities and county police agencies lined the curbs in front of the Browning Administration and Keller buildings and up Campus Drive.\n\nFlowers — purple mums, white and yellow lilies, and pink roses — had been laid near the university sign.\n\nLance Suaste, a junior at the university, was walking past the nearby Mountain Run apartments, having just been dropped off after spending the day at a friend’s house. He said he was near the Lossee Center shortly after noon when he saw people running.\n\nSuaste and friends asked what was happening and were told about the shooting. As the campus was being locked down, he went to his car and spent the day with friends.\n\n“Nothing like this happens in Utah. It doesn’t feel real, so it’s very shocking,” Suaste said. He said the shooting was terrible, but he wasn’t worried about the shooter still being at large. He planned to spend the rest of the day in the dorm – as usual.\n\n— Melissa Galbraith\n\n'In the crosshairs': Left fears 'vengeance' after Kirk killing\n\nA top progressive political commentator is worried that Kirk's killing could open the door to acts of \"vengeance\" from people upset over the shooting.\n\n\"Part of me worries about the vengeance that will go on in the aftermath of this,\" said Hasan Piker, a left-wing commentator who livestreams his reactions to the news to millions of followers. \"This puts a lot of people I know, including myself, in the crosshairs.\"\n\nThe Twitch live streamer's comments came as he watched influential right-wing figures demonize progressives in the wake of the shooting, even as it remained unclear who was behind the attack.\n\n\"They sent a trained sniper to assassinate Charlie Kirk while he was sitting next to a table of hats that said 47,\" posted Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer who is known for having the ear of Trump. \"The Left are terrorists.\"\n\n\"I suspect the administration will use this as an opportunity to go after as many people as possible that they have declared ideological enemies,\" Piker told viewers. \"Sky's the limit here.\"\n\n— Michael Loria\n\n6 police officers were working at the campus event\n\nJeff Long, chief of the Utah Valley University Police Department, said the event on Wednesday was held at an open outdoor venue.\n\nThe event was \"in kind of a bowl area here on the central campus,\" Long said at the news conference. \"We have a waterfall area, and so he (Kirk) was kind of in a lower area surrounded by buildings.\"\n\nSix officers were working the event, where more than 3,000 people were in attendance, according to Long. The police chief noted that police officers in plain clothes were also in the crowd, along with Kirk's private security team.\n\n\"We trained for these things. And you think you have things covered. And these things, unfortunately, they happen,\" Long added. \"You try to get your bases covered. And unfortunately, today we didn’t, and because of that, we had this tragic incident.\"\n\n'No one should die over something like this'\n\nUtah Valley University sophomores Dario Perez and Knudsen had been at the university's Lossee Center for about 20 minutes when they heard pops and what they said sounded like fireworks.\n\n“Everyone ducked for a second,” Perez told USA TODAY. “Then panic set in.”\n\n“Hysteria” swept through the outdoor crowd as the audience realized Kirk had been shot, the two students said.\n\n“It was a big shock moment,” Knudsen said, adding that members of the crowd then started running away.\n\nHe and Perez said they were surprised there was not more security, given the controversial speaker and the size of the crowd. They said they’d bought tickets for the event, but when they arrived, there were no ticket takers or metal detectors.\n\nThe students said they are not Kirk supporters, but they “wanted to hear both sides” of the debate.\n\nTurning Point USA mourns death of founder\n\nTurning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organization in the country, said in a social media post just before 6 p.m. EDT, “It is with a heavy heart that we confirm that Charles James Kirk has been murdered by a gunshot.”\n\n“We ask that everyone keep his family and loved ones in your prayers,” the organization said. “We ask that you please respect their privacy and dignity at this time.”\n\nBiden sends condolences to Charlie Kirk’s family\n\nFormer President Joe Biden offered his condolences to Kirk’s family on social media.\n\n\"There is no place in our country for this kind of violence. It must end now,” Biden wrote on X. “Jill and I are praying for Charlie Kirk’s family and loved ones.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nJD Vance reacts to Charlie Kirk's death\n\nVice President JD Vance shared Trump's statement confirming Kirk's death on X.\n\n\"Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord,\" Vance said.\n\n'I’ve seen things I’ve never seen before'\n\nEva Terry and Emma Pitts, two reporters from the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, Utah, arrived on the Utah Valley University campus early Wednesday to talk to the excited crowd decked out in red, white and blue that had gathered for Turning Point USA event.\n\nHours later, Terry told a USA TODAY reporter: “I’ve seen things I’ve never seen before.”\n\nKirk had called up one student and answered a question, then called on a second student, who asked: \"How many mass shooters have been transgender,\" Terry said. \"Too many,\" responded Kirk, Terry said.\n\nWhen the student asked a follow-up question, “(Kirk) picked up his microphone, and before he was able to speak, a bullet hit the left side of his neck, and it was pretty bloody,” Terry said.\n\n“Then he fell off his chair, and then everyone dropped to the ground,” she said. “I didn’t see anyone catch him. I saw him slump out of his chair, and that’s the last thing I saw.\"\n\nLike many, after hearing the single shot, Terry said she and Pitts first ducked to the ground, holding on to each other and saying a prayer. Then they ran, seeking shelter in a nearby building.\n\nWho is Charlie Kirk?\n\nKirk became a national figure as a conservative influencer and as the founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that pushes for conservative politics on high school and college campuses.\n\nIn 2024, he spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he gave a speech that focused on what Kirk says he heard from young people around the United States.\n\nHe was married to Erika Kirk, an entrepreneur, and the father of two children. Their daughter was born in August 2022, and they had a son in 2024.\n\nKirk had 5.3 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio program, \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\" He had also recently co-hosted \"Fox & Friends\" on Fox News.\n\nHe was part of an ecosystem of pro-Trump conservative influencers – including Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens, and others – who have helped to amplify the president's agenda. Kirk frequently attacked mainstream media and engaged in culture war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.\n\nVideo shows crowd reacting to the shooting\n\nVideos of the shooting posted to social media show Kirk seated beneath a tent and speaking about gang violence into a microphone when he’s hit in the neck. Kirk slumps over as he begins to bleed from the gunshot wound.\n\nSocial media platforms, including YouTube and X, have begun removing videos of the attack.\n\nA video taken from the top of the venue where Kirk was speaking shows members of the crowd reacting to the attack by dropping to the ground and then running from the scene. One shot can be heard in the video.\n\nAdditional videos of the event show the aftermath of the shooting. Attendees duck for cover and return to pick up items they had abandoned.\n\n– Michael Loria\n\nCharlie Kirk killing comes amid recent political violence\n\nThe motive for the attack on Kirk is unknown, but it comes after a string of recent political violence across the United States.\n\nA man was indicted by a federal grand jury in July for allegedly fatally shooting Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark and their dog, and shooting and injuring State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette.\n\nIn April, another man was charged with crimes including attempted murder after setting fire to a portion of Gov. Josh Shapiro's home in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2024, Trump was grazed by a bullet during a campaign event in Pennsylvania and targeted in a second assassination attempt two months later. The suspect accused in the foiled attack at his Florida golf club is currently standing trial.\n\nKamala Harris 'deeply disturbed' by Utah shooting\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement she is \"deeply disturbed by the shooting in Utah.\"\n\n\"Doug and I send our prayers to Charlie Kirk and his family,\" Harris said on social media. \"Let me be clear: Political violence has no place in America. I condemn this act, and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence.\"\n\nGavin Newsom denounces political violence after Charlie Kirk shooting\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who interviewed Kirk on a recent podcast episode, weighed in calling the attack \"disgusting, vile, and reprehensible.\"\n\n\"In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form,\" wrote Newsom.\n\nRFK Jr. responds to Charlie Kirk shooting\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has participated in several of Kirk's podcasts and with whom he held a Make America Healthy Again Town Hall, sent well wishes to the conservative activist. \"We love you Charlie Kirk. Praying for you,\" Kennedy wrote on X.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nKirk shot after controversy over speaking engagement\n\nUtah Valley University was the latest stop on Kirk’s The American Comeback Tour with his organization Turning Point USA. The event was scheduled for 12 p.m. local time on Sept. 10.\n\nAlmost 1,000 people had signed a petition to bar Kirk from speaking at the university. More than 6,800 people had signed a petition requesting that the faculty prevent Kirk from speaking at a similar event at Utah State University.\n\n“Allowing him to speak on our campus would not only misrepresent the values we hold dear but also create an environment where divisive rhetoric could flourish,” the petition read.\n\nThe university affirmed its \"commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue\" and urged faculty and staff to keep institutional communication neutral in a statement days before the shooting.\n\n\"UVU, including its leaders speaking on behalf of the institution, does not take official positions on political, social, or cultural controversies unless they directly impact our mission, operations, or core values,\" the statement said. \"This neutrality ensures that our campus remains a true marketplace of ideas, where faculty, staff, and students are empowered to express viewpoints without institutional bias.\"\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick and Fernando Cervantes Jr., USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/11/trump-shot-in-ear-conspiracy-theory/86089971007/", "title": "What happened to the guy who shot Trump in the ear?

The gruesome footage of Kirk being shot in the neck and slumping backwards spread rapidly on the internet.\n\nAlmost as quickly as the condemnations of political violence came the conspiracy theories on the shooting. A scroll through X shows a smattering of posts theorizing on questions investigators are still trying to answer. Several posts draw comparisons, without evidence they are actually related, to another major act of political violence: the first assassination attempt of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe first assassination attempt of Donald Trump: What happened?\n\nOn July 13, 2024, Trump was speaking at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman positioned on a rooftop near the rally fired multiple shots toward the then-presidential candidate.\n\nTrump was shot in the ear and ducked behind the lectern as Secret Service agents swarmed him and ushered him off stage. However, they did not get him out of public sight before he raised a fist in the air as blood streaked down his face in a photographed moment that would become a defining image of his campaign.\n\nA spectator at the rally was killed, and two were critically injured.\n\nWhat happened to the suspect who shot Trump in the ear?\n\nThe shooter was identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, and he was killed by law enforcement at the scene. Crooks appeared to have acted alone and did appear to hold any to any particularly strong political leanings.\n\nRecords show he was registered as a Republican and made a small donation to a Democrat turnout organization.\n\nHe had worked at a nursing home at the time of the shooting.\n\nConspiracy theories on Butler shooting persist\n\nIn more than a year since the shooting and preliminary investigation took place, the FBI has released little additional information about Crooks, opening another avenue for conspiracies to run amok, the New York Times reported.\n\nHelen Comperatore, wife of the man killed at the Trump rally, told the Times she had not received any official update from investigators in months as of July 2025.\n\n“I am praying the president gets to the bottom of it and keeps working on this case for me — and him,” she said, the Times reported.\n\nAnother popular conspiracy about the shooting is that Trump was not really shot, despite ample evidence he was.\n\nWas Trump really shot in the ear?\n\nYes, multiple pieces of evidence show Trump was struck in the ear by a bullet.\n\nA bipartisan congressional task force was created in the weeks following the first attempt to \"investigate all actions by any agency, department, officer, or employee of the federal government, as well as state and local law enforcement (LLE) or any other state or local government or private entities or individuals, related to the attempted assassination,\" according to a December report from the task force.\n\nA timeline of events included in the report shows Crooks fired three shots at 6:11 p.m., with one round hitting Trump's ear before his detail immediately covered his body. A few seconds later, Crooks fired five more shots, the report stated.\n\nA week after the shooting, Trump's previous White House physician Rep. Ronny Jackson issued a memo on Trump's injury.\n\n\"The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear,\" the memo posted to X read. \"The bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci said on CNN that the doctors' reports indicated it would just be a surface-level wound with no further complications.\n\nTrump has mentioned multiple times that he still experiences a \"throbbing feeling\" in his ear where he was shot.\n\nSome lawmakers are still pushing for answers on the federal agencies' planning, execution and leadership failures that allowed the shooting to take place.\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson, Matthew Rink, Bart Jansen, Josh Meyer, Jeanine Santucci, David Jackson, USA TODAY Network\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

While Apple events often occur on a Tuesday, this one will be on a Monday.\n\nWhat time does the Apple event start?\n\nApple's \"It's Glowtime\" event begins at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT.\n\nHow to watch the Apple 'Glowtime' event\n\nA livestream of the event, held at the Steve Jobs Theater at the company's headquarters, will be available on Apple's YouTube channel.\n\nYou can also watch it on Apple's website and the Apple TV app.\n\nWhen is Apple's next 2024 event?\n\nApple hasn't yet released information on its next event this year, but the tech company has held an event in October the past few years, usually centered on Macs and iPads. Apple had an iPad-focused event back in May, so while there may still be an October event in 2024, more additions to the iPad slate of products aren't expected this year.\n\nWhat's rumored to be unveiled at Apple's 'It's Glowtime' event?\n\niPhone 16 and 16 Plus\n\nThe anticipated headline announcement from Apple Monday is the new iPhone 16 range.\n\nThe major upgrade rumored to be in the iPhone 16 is a new A18 chip with 8GB of ram to enable the support of Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence software.\n\n9to5Mac reported in March that the new chip had been designed to support on device artificial intelligence.\n\nThe new models are said to be gaining an action button, replacing the iPhone 15's mute toggle that had been previously incorporated into the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, according to MacRumors.\n\nThe cameras on the iPhone 16 will likely be rearranged from the diagonal orientation of the iPhone 15 to the vertical layout seen in the last generation's Pro models. The change, according to 9to5Mac, is to support the recording of spatial video.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted on social media site X that the company will release the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 plus in black, green, pink, blue or white.\n\niPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max\n\nThe premium iPhone tier is set to see larger screens and a solution to the previous model's heat management problems.\n\nMacRumors reported that the displays of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max would each be .2 inches larger than the equivalent iPhone 15 model at 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches respectively. The site suggested that the phones would be slightly larger than its predecessors.\n\n9to5Mac reports that the iPhone 16 Pro could see the same 5x zoom tetraprism camera that is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The model could be able to record video at 4K resolution at 120fps for the first time.\n\nThe upper line could see the addition of a \"capture button\" that would open and operate the phone's camera. 9to5Mac reported that the button could appear on all models while MacRumors suggested that it could be a Pro and Pro Max exclusive feature.\n\nA leaked photo from Apple watcher Kotusami Ito posted to X in November showed a prototype of the battery case that could be used in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max to prevent overheating issues that plagued the iPhone 15 Pro. The case would use a metal cover instead of a tin one.\n\nKuo predicted that the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will be available in black, white or silver, gray and rose.\n\nAir Pods 4\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman reported in November that the company was planning an overhaul to the wireless earbud offering and 9to5Mac suggested that the results of the shake up are due Monday.\n\nThe company will sunset the Airpods 2 and Airpods 3, bringing the entry level and midlevel wearables under the Airpods 4 banner.\n\nThe entry level Airpods will likely not have noise cancellation while the midlevel offering will. 9to5Mac reports that the Airpods Pro will not see any changes until 2025.\n\nApple Watch\n\nEach of Apple's horological offerings is set to see upgrades on Monday.\n\nSeries 10\n\nThe company appears set to announce the Apple Watch Series 10. Notable changes include larger case size offerings at 45 mm and 49 mm and larger screens according to 9to5Mac.\n\nSE\n\nGurman reported that the newest Apple Watch SE could swap its aluminum shell for one made of \"rigid plastic\" in his Power on newsletter. The company switched the entry level smartwatch's caseback from ceramic to a nylon composite material in 2022.\n\nUltra 3\n\nRumors are scant for the Ultra 3 though 9to5Mac suggested that the watch could receive a new chip but no hardware updates.\n\niOS 18 update schedule\n\nUSA TODAY previously reported that the event will likely feature the release schedule for iOS 18.\n\nThe operating system was revealed at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June where Apple showed that the system would integrate Apple Intelligence.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/06/09/apple-wwdc-2025-keynote-live-updates/84087256007/", "title": "Apple WWDC 2025 news: iOS 26 and Liquid Glass design revealed", "text": "At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, June 9, Apple introduced new feature-rich operating systems sporting a sexy Liquid Glass makeover.\n\nAnd, as expected, the new super-smart artificial intelligence-powered Siri was a no-show. But the feature, which debuted at last year's WWDC, had a hinted return appearance coming later this year.\n\nStill, Apple Intelligence had a major part to play, with AI shown to power a new live translation feature that automatically translates messages, generates translated captions on Facetime and audio translations on phone calls. Visual intelligence upgrades coming to the new operating system, dubbed iOS 26, were shown using ChatGPT to learn about on-screen objects, whether to buy or gain knowledge.\n\nHere's what was announced at Apple's WWDC keynote, which included an address from CEO Tim Cook.\n\niOS 26 release date\n\niOS 26 will be released for testing June 9 through the Apple Developer Program and a public beta version will be released through the Apple Beta Software Program next month, CEO Tim Cook said at the close of the keynote presentation.\n\nThe operating system will be available as an update for iPhone 11 and later \"this fall,\" he said.\n\nApple stresses AI progress\n\nSoftware boss Craig Federighi cited examples of new features such as Live Translation and Visual Intelligence as advances Apple was making with its Apple Intelligence. “Our platforms are more powerful and more useful than ever. We’re continuing to integrate Apple Intelligence across our ecosystem with so many new features that are right where you need them in the apps you use every day.\n\nCook added, \"We continue to advance each of our platforms with more ways to harness the power of Apple Intelligence, as well as a beautiful new design, our product experiences become even more seamless and enjoyable.\"\n\nApple shares dip during WWDC\n\nApple stock fell more than 1% as the WWDC event played out. Shares opened Monday, June 9, at $204.39, but fell to below $202 during the event.\n\nThe company stock price hit $259 in late December 2024, near the end of a three-month period in which Apple set an all-time record for iPhone upgrades. But shares dipped to $172 in April 2025 a few weeks after the company announced it was delaying some artificial intelligence upgrades to Siri to 2026.\n\nChanges to iPad windowing system\n\nApple showed off its iPad \"windowing\" system in iPadOS 26, which mimics a computer more than an iPhone. Users can open and arrange multiple apps at once using customizable sizing options.\n\nThe next MacOS: Tahoe\n\nThe upcoming MacOS will be called Tahoe, with a new design incorporating Liquid Glass so the dock and widgets look more refined. Your display will look larger and there are more ways to customize and personalize your Mac to match your style, Federighi said. Nice touches include adding emojis to folders, for instance.\n\nNew Apple TV+ looks\n\nOn-screen menu options you'll see while watching Apple TV+ productions are getting a makeover in the style of Liquid Glass, while the titles of TV shows and movie options on the home page are getting a bolder look as well.\n\nVisual Intelligence, with an assist from ChatGPT\n\nVisual Intelligence will be part of iOS 26 and let users explore their surroundings without changing apps. You use your camera “to learn about the objects and places around you,” Federighi said.\n\nIt will also let you use any app to learn more about what you are seeing. For instance, say you have a social media app up and see an instrument, you can screenshot that and ask ChatGPT “which rock songs is this instrument featured in,” and it lists songs for you, as demonstrated by the Apple design team’s Billy Sorrentino.\n\nAlso, if you see a piece of clothing or a lamp that interests you, with a screenshot an option will pop up to search for similar items in other apps such as Etsy. Visual Intelligence will also let you add an event you see in another app directly to your calendar.\n\nSpam detection in Messages\n\nOther iPhone updates include polls in Messages, while Spam Detection will slot unknown message senders into a separate queue until you approve them.\n\nPhone feature to catch when you're on hold\n\nThe upcoming iOS 26 will have a new unified phone layout that combines Favorites, Recents and Voicemails, so you don’t have to switch views. AI will create voicemail summaries. “This new intuitive layout makes it easier to navigate the app,” said Darin Adler, vice president of internet technologies.\n\nA Call Screening feature will answer unknown callers in the background and once they leave a voicemail is left you can pick up or ignore the message.\n\nAnother new feature, Hold Assist will “keep your spot in line while you wait for a live agent,” Adler said. Hold Assist automatically detects hold music and lets you tap hold and you can keep using your iPhone. Hold Assist will ring back to you when to return to the call.\n\niOS 26 it is. And it has Liquid Glass.\n\nThe new iPhone software will be called iOS 26, Federighi says. That comes after Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of human interface design, showed how the new operating systems will have an interface featuring “Liquid Glass,” which is translucent like glass but with a fluidity. Liquid Glass “brings more clarity to navigation and controls,” he said.\n\nUsing the camera, you swipe and tap to make the menu options appear using the new Liquid Glass interface, Federighi said. When using Safari, you get a larger screen with the dynamic controls hidden until you tap.\n\n'F1' promo kicks off Apple WWDC\n\nThe event begins with video showing Apple CEO Tim Cook talking with Federighi who is driving an F1 car around the top of Apple Park, a nod to the new Apple TV+ film, “F1,” starring Brad Pitt, hitting theaters June 27. “So glad they put CarPlay in this beast,” Federighi says, and blasts the song “Round and Round,” by by rock band Ratt.\n\nYou can watch the WWDC keynote beginning at 1 p.m. ET/10 a.m. PT. on Apple TV, on apple.com and on the Apple YouTube page.\n\nWhat is Apple's WWDC? What does WWDC stand for?\n\nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference, held June 9-13, is the tech giant's annual showcase of its upcoming software updates. That means new features coming to iPhones, iPads, Mac computers and other devices.\n\nWho will be speaking?\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook typically delivers the keynote. Software boss Craig Federighi will likely also take the stage.\n\nWhat did Apple unveil at its last event?\n\nDuring Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 10, 2024, the company revealed features in iOS 18 and other operating systems including iPadOS 18, Apple Intelligence and a smarter Siri virtual assistant.\n\nIs an iPhone expected to be revealed at WWDC?\n\nNo. Usually iPhones and devices such as iPads typically are debuted at Apple's September event. Last year, the company unveiled iPhone 16 models, Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4.\n\nApple WWDC preview: What to expect at the event\n\nApple is expected to demonstrate new operating systems for iPhone, iPad and other devices including Mac computers, Apple Watch and Apple TV. What would be iOS 19 is expected to become iOS 26 – with a numerical name change similar to how car models are based on years, several outlets including Bloomberg and MacRumors have reported, citing unnamed persons familiar with Apple's plans.\n\nAlso, there may not be a big artificial intelligence splash. At last year's WWDC, Apple introduced a more \"personal\" and smarter Siri virtual assistant, which used Apple Intelligence, but many of the planned improvements have been delayed until 2026.\n\nHowever, Apple is expected to announce that third-party developers will be able to begin using the same AI foundation models the company uses for its Apple Intelligence platform, a move allowing developers to create new applications for Apple devices, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported.\n\nWhat’s being rumored to be revealed at WWDC?\n\nAmong the features Apple is expected to unfold at the event is an AI-powered iPhone battery management mode, which will monitor how you use your phone to conserve energy, Bloomberg has reported. Also possibly to be shown: a new game center app, Bloomberg reported.\n\nWhat is iOS 26?\n\niOS 26 will be the next operating system for the iPhone, according to multiple reports. Other operating systems for Apple devices include MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, tvOS, visionOS. The MacOs is expected to named \"Tahoe,\" the latest in a long line of names based on California locales, Bloomberg's Gurman reported.\n\nThe operating systems will have a new look in addition to new naming scheme. The new interfaces will use light and transparency, Bloomberg reported, styled similarly to the visionOS used on the Vision Pro headset, unveiled at the WWDC two years ago. App icons, tool bars and tab bars are set to look different in the update.\n\nWith the \"26 update,\" Apple is \"changing the playbook. They're not just going (to) iOS 19,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told USA TODAY. \"I think this is also a much bigger OS update, because it all sets up for iPhone 17 and the true AI strategy coming to Cupertino.\n\nApple Intelligence: What to expect\n\nApple may not reveal a truly Apple-Intelligent Siri – allowing the digital assistant to handle tasks across various apps via voice commands – but the company will show off new Apple Intelligence-driven features through its operating systems, Ives said. He expects more information on the company's AI plans including Gemini and ChatGPT integration with Siri and other apps.\n\n\"It's really going to unleash developers to take Apple into this next generation,\" Ives said. \"They need to build iOS that you could have true AI apps deployed in the ecosystem. Remember 25% of the world is going to access an AI through an Apple device over the coming years. ... They're going to have to make sure they're a key player in AI with the other big tech players in this Game of Thrones battle.\"\n\nObservers will want to see progress. \"Patience might be the word of the day, or even the year for Apple. People are talking about this as an AI gap year for Apple,” Alex Kantrowitz, founder of Big Technology podcast and newsletter, said on CNBC on Monday, June 9. \"They had the big vision announcement last year. Not a lot of progress this year as they tried to build it. It is hard to build.”\n\nApple WWDC keynote\n\nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference keynote is underway.

Ian then cut northeast across the state and into the Atlantic Ocean, where it regained some intensity and made landfall in South Carolina on Friday.\n\nIan caused devastating damage throughout its path, knocking out power for millions of people and causing at least 74 deaths.\n\nTo understand its true toll, here’s a location-by-location trip through the wreckage Ian left behind.\n\nCuba\n\nA vintage car passes by debris caused by the Hurricane Ian as it passed in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, September 27, 2022. Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters\n\nAfter forming in the Southern Caribbean Sea, Ian made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in Cuba just southwest of La Coloma in the western Pinar del Rio province early Tuesday.\n\nThe hurricane’s fierce winds and rain left at least three people dead, state media said, and knocked out power to the entire island.\n\nTwo of the deaths occurred in Pinar del Rio, where a woman died after a wall collapsed on her and a man died after his roof fell on him, state media said.\n\nThe province, known for growing Cuba’s rich tobacco, also suffered downed fences and destruction at the Robaina tobacco farm, according to photos posted by state media. State media photos also showed fields in the province inundated with floodwater and trees uprooted.\n\nCayo Costa, Florida\n\nIan strengthened further at sea and made landfall Wednesday on the barrier island of Cayo Costa in southwest Florida as a strong Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds near 150 mph, making it the strongest storm to make landfall on Florida’s west coast since Hurricane Charley in 2004.\n\nSanibel Island\n\nA section of the Sanibel Causeway was lost due to the effects of Hurricane Ian on Thursday.

The floor of Laura Muller’s house was transformed into muck, windows were broken and her furniture had been toppled and flipped around the home.\n\n“Salvageable? I don’t know. I doubt it,” Muller said upon entering. “I’d say it’s done.”\n\nPort Charlotte\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Go inside ICU unit after Ian tears roof off 03:29 - Source: CNN Go inside ICU unit after Ian tears roof off 03:29\n\nIan blew off part of the roof of a hospital’s intensive care unit in Port Charlotte, allowing torrential rains to pour through the building, which was taking care of 160 patients.\n\nDr. Birgit Bodine said the ICU area was no longer usable and on some floors, staff had to walk through puddles. Video inside the ICU showed several inches of water all along the floors and a waterfall cascading down the stairwell.\n\nSome patients were crowded into dry rooms or were placed in hallways to have a roof over their heads, though everyone was doing well, Bodine said.\n\n“Luckily, everybody’s doing good and actually, surprisingly, in decent spirits because they can see that we’re trying the best we can with what we have,” she said.\n\nFort Myers\n\nWater floods a damaged trailer park in Fort Myers on Saturday. Steve Helber/AP\n\nThere were over 800 rescues and about 42 casualties in Lee County, which includes Fort Myers, Sheriff Carmine Marceno said Sunday.\n\nA Fort Myers man told CNN he knew of at least two people who died trying to escape a home during the hurricane.\n\n“I had a friend – they were in his house, and he was with his wife and another couple,” Kevin Behen told CNN’s John Berman Friday night. The storm surge came all the way to the windows of their home, he said.\n\n“These guys pushed their wives out the windows to where a tree was,” Behen said. “They just looked at their wives and they said ‘We can’t hold on anymore, we love you. Bye,’ and that was it.”\n\nBehen told CNN that the two men did not make it, but their wives did. He reported the deaths to authorities.\n\nKissimmee\n\nOsceloa County Sheriffs use a fanboat to rescue a 93-year-old resident from flooding on September 30 in Kissimmee, Florida. Bryan R.

Rick Scott said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\n“I was up in Kissimmee yesterday and there was some flooding up there and they weren’t in a floodplain, nobody was told to get flood insurance and they had about probably a foot of water in their homes, and they were just completely shocked,” Scott said.\n\nSt. Augustine Beach\n\nIan’s center moved through Florida and off into the Atlantic Ocean, but its winds, rain and storm surge still caused flooding in St. Augustine Beach, in the northeast of the state.\n\nIn northeast Florida, St. Augustine Beach suffered flooding from rains and storm surge. Scott Cushnie\n\nScott Cushnie, who has lived in Florida for 14 years, captured video of a flooded A1A Highway in St. Augustine on Thursday afternoon. He said he chose not to evacuate because he felt safe being on the second floor in a thick coquina rock building.\n\n“I know a lot of business owners here, so I’m checking on their businesses – adjusting sandbags, closing doors that are open, fixing property, etc.,” he told CNN.\n\nFormer FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate noted that the flooding and damage stretched across the state.\n\n“It’s just not the coast of Florida that’s been impacted,” he told CNN on Sunday. “We’ve got impacts all the way through Orlando, up to the East Coast. Places like St. Augustine had devastating flooding.”\n\nGeorgetown, South Carolina\n\nFlood waters are suctioned from inside a restaurant near where Hurricane Ian made landfall in Georgetown, South Carolina on Friday. Jonathan Drake/Reuters\n\nIan strengthened back to a Category 1 hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean and made landfall Friday near Georgetown, a city of just over 8,000 people on South Carolina’s coast, midway between Charleston and Myrtle Beach. It was the first hurricane to make landfall in the state in five years.\n\nThe storm caused parts of Charleston to flood, piers in North Myrtle Beach and Pawley’s Island suffered damage and more than 200,000 electric customers lost power in the state. Yet there were no deaths, Gov. Henry McMaster said.\n\n“There is some damage, there’s some heartbreak, there’s work to be done,” McMaster said. “But all in all, it’s a good story.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nThe remnants of Ian hit North Carolina on Friday and Saturday and caused four deaths there, including three fatal vehicle crashes and one death from carbon monoxide poisoning due to a generator running in a closed garage, according to Gov. Roy Cooper’s office.\n\nAt its peak, about 400,000 customers had no power on Friday, though most of those have since been repaired, Cooper told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday.\n\n“This is a time when we all have to pull together to make sure that people are safe.

The Democratic National Committee’s Rules and Bylaws Committee on Tuesday rejected the state party’s proposed bylaws. The national party in February ordered the Alabama party to hold new elections for party leaders and to revise bylaws and encourage participation by more minorities. The directive came amid challenges over the re-election of Nancy Worley as chair of the state party. Committee member Harold Ickes says the party’s proposal did not comply with the DNC directive, and internal elections last year made the “Keystone Cops look organized.” Worley told the panel that people unhappy with her election are “refighting the civil war” with the challenges.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A group that includes a coal company chairman and a framer of the state’s constitution is launching an effort aimed at recalling Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, weeks after his far-reaching budget vetoes prompted public outrage. In late June, Dunleavy announced vetoes of more than $400 million, affecting health, social-service and other programs and prompting the university system to begin making plans for a transition to a single institution. Lawmakers, unable to muster sufficient votes to override the vetoes amid a dispute over the special session’s proper meeting location, this week passed legislation restoring many of the cuts, including $110 million of the $130 million Dunleavy vetoed for the university. He still can cut any spending with which he doesn’t agree.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge has overturned the U.S. Forest Service’s approval of plans for a new copper mine. The judge ruled late Wednesday that the agency improperly evaluated and considered water use issues associated with the Rosemont Mine project in the Santa Rita Mountains in the Coronado National Forest. Conservation and tribal groups on Thursday praised the ruling, saying it recognized that the Forest Service failed to protect public land and resources in mountains that are home to endangered jaguars and cougars, black bears and deer. The mountain range is also home to the Madera Canyon, one of the premier U.S. bird-watching spots. The $1.9 billion Rosemont Mine was expected to leave a waste pile the height of skyscraper. Plans called for it to be built along a scenic highway near Arizona wine country and the small community of Sonoita.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Little Rock Zoo says a Northwest Bornean orangutan has given birth to her first baby. Zoo spokesman Lamor Williams says mother Berani delivered the baby Sunday. The newborn orangutan, which is not yet named, is the fifth born to father Bandar. Williams says the baby is part of the Orangutan Species Survival Plan, which manages orangutans in Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited zoos. The World Wildlife Fund lists Bornean orangutans as critically endangered, one step below extinct in the wild. According to the WWF, their populations have declined by more than 50% over the past 60 years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Heterosexual couples now have a legal alternative to marriage in the Golden State. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law Tuesday that lets straight couples register as domestic partners. California has recognized domestic partnerships since 2000. But the law only applied to same-sex couples who, at the time, were not allowed to get married. The law’s goal was to give same-sex couples the same legal protections as marriage. In 2015, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling effectively legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The ruling had no effect on the state’s domestic partnership law, giving same-sex couples the choice of getting married or filing as a domestic partnership. Same-sex couples – except for those older than 62 – still had just one option: marriage.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A citizens’ campaign turned in thousands of voter signatures Thursday in hopes of repealing a new law that would pledge the state’s presidential electoral votes to the national popular vote winner. The group Coloradans Vote said it submitted more than 227,000 signatures to the secretary of state’s office – well above the 124,000 valid signatures needed to get the question on the November 2020 ballot. The secretary of state has 30 days to certify there are enough signatures to require a referendum. A vote next year could mark the first time a state has joined the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, only to have the move challenged at the ballot box.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 1,500 nonunion state employees will be receiving raises in line with their union colleagues. The Hartford Courant reports that Gov. Ned Lamont signed off on the 3.5% raises that apply to managers, appointees and others. The raises are consistent with recent pay increases for union members and those working for the legislative and judicial branches. The raises are expected to cost about $4.4 million a year. A 2017 agreement with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition calls for annual 3.5% cost-of-living increases for all union employees. The Democratic governor says his senior staff hired in the last six months won’t be getting a raise.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s environmental authority says it has found a new species of tick for the first time in the state. The Asian longhorned tick, also known as the cattle tick or bush tick, was found in northern New Castle County in late June, according to a Wednesday press release from the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. There have been no reports of Asian longhorned tick-borne illness in the U.S., the release said. But in other countries, these tick bites have made people and animals “seriously ill” with fevers and other viruses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The species is known to swarm livestock and horses in great numbers, leading to substantial loss of blood and possible death of the animals, the release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In unusually forceful language, the leadership of the Washington National Cathedral has condemned what it called the “racialized rhetoric” of President Donald Trump and directly compared him to 1950s anti-Communist demagogue Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The statement, released Tuesday, isn’t so much an appeal for Trump to retract or soften his statements as a call for the nation as a whole to reject them. It asks: “After two years of President Trump’s words and actions, when will Americans have enough?” The statement, issued in the name of three of the cathedral’s top leaders – Revs. Mariann Budde, Randolph Hollerith and Kelly Douglas – makes multiple direct references to the Communist witch-hunts of the 1950s led by McCarthy. It accuses Trump of deliberately fanning racial divisions for political gain the same way McCarthy used fears of Communist infiltration.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Universal Orlando officials say the resort is doubling in size with plans for a fourth theme park, but they are offering almost no information on when it will open, what it will hold or how much they’re spending. Despite the lack of details, officials with the theme park resort promised Thursday that it would be epic. To that end, they’re calling the new park Universal’s Epic Universe. The CEO of Universal’s parent company, Comcast NBCUniversal, said the fourth park will be the biggest investment the company has made in its theme park business. The resort already operates Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure, as well as the Volcano Bay water park, in Orlando. Universal recently had been acquiring hundreds of acres of land near Orlando’s convention center.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city will soon add some lessons about the South’s racist history on markers next to four historic monuments. The first of the panels could be installed as early as Friday, officials say. In Piedmont Park, the 1911 Peace Monument commemorating post-Civil War reconciliation will get context noting that its inscription promotes a narrative centered on white veterans, while ignoring African Americans. Many white Southerners retroactively viewed the Civil War through “the lens of Lost Cause mythology” reframing the history. “That mythology claimed that despite defeat, the Confederate cause was morally just,” states the marker to be placed near the Peace Monument. “This monument should no longer stand as a memorial to white brotherhood; rather, it should be seen as an artifact representing a shared history in which millions of Americans were denied civil and human rights.” Georgia law bars the removal of such monuments.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: “Aquaman” star Jason Momoa on Wednesday visited Native Hawaiian protesters blocking the construction of a giant telescope on Hawaii’s tallest mountain. The Native Hawaiian actor wore a green leaf lei around his neck and the crown of his head as he attended a ceremony at the protest site. Honolulu television stations livestreamed dancers in jeans and windbreakers performing hula in chilly weather. Momoa stooped low to present an offering wrapped in green ti leaves. He said he was honored to be there, drawing cheers after saying, “We are not going anywhere.” Protesters have blocked the road to the summit for 17 days. Some Native Hawaiians believe Mauna Kea’s summit is sacred. The summit also has the best conditions for astronomy in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little says the state’s economy is strong, but additional work is needed to shore up transportation infrastructure, education and health care. Little also told some 400 business community members attending his speech at the Boise Metro Chamber event on Wednesday that Idaho’s prison incarceration rate is far too high. The Republican governor hit familiar themes in touting his efforts to make the state a place where children and grandchildren will want to remain or return to live. Little gave his speech at J.R. Simplot Company’s Jack’s Urban Meeting Place. Little called J.R. Simplot, who died in 2008, a mentor and said Idaho must continue on the path exemplified by Simplot of innovation and hard work to remain competitive.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A sometimes overlooked Chicago River museum has reached the mark of 250,000 visitors. A Monday statement from the McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum says a suburban Chicago woman, Deb Lawrence, was the weekend visitor to put the facility at that mark. Friends of the Chicago River opened the museum in a 99-year-old bridge house on the Michigan Avenue bridge in 2006. The mission was to promote a better understanding of the role the river played in city history. There are exhibits depicting the time when Native Americans and early European settlers both lived along the river. Visitors can also see how Chicago’s movable bridges work. Friends’ executive director, Margaret Frisbie, says the museum also shows how a waterway “once primarily thought of as part of the sewage system” is again a valuable asset.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Federal court officials in the city are warning that scammers are using the court’s main phone number to scam and intimidate people. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana says its clerk’s office recently began receiving calls from people reporting that someone claiming to be with the “court” had called them hoping to scam them. The would-be victims’ caller ID made it appear as if the culprits were calling from the court’s main phone number, 317-229-3700, when they actually were not. The would-be scammers told several stories, including telling the calls’ recipients that their Social Security benefits had been “hacked” and asking for their Social Security number. Many of those being targeted have Latino heritage. Court officials say government employees would never request personal information over the phone.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The State Board of Education has adopted new rules that would require lap-shoulder seat belts on all new buses bought by school districts and state-accredited nonpublic schools. The administrative rules adopted Thursday are still subject to legislative review. Other safety equipment required would include one additional stop arm per bus, hand rails, exterior boarding lights, and fire-resistant crash barriers between the front bus seats and the bus drivers. Districts wouldn’t have to retrofit their current fleets. The rules would apply to new buses manufactured on or after Oct. 2, the date the new rules are scheduled to take effect. Iowa Education Department spokeswoman Staci Hupp says the new rules would apply equally to contracted service providers.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Some teens on probation in Sedgwick County receive high-priced items such as iPads, Xboxes and Amazon gift cards as rewards in an after-school program meant to keep them from reoffending. The Wichita Eagle reports that the incentives are funded with public dollars and are not in line with state recommendations that call for incentives of limited financial value. The incentives are part of a system that encourages youth to make positive choices. County and state officials say their cost is small compared to the cost of locking up young lawbreakers. It’s part of a national trend toward emphasizing rewards for good behavior over punishment for bad. Kansas changed its juvenile justice approach in 2016 to focus on keeping youths out of detention when possible.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund says it has acquired about 2,000 acres of forestland in Bell County for the Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail. The state Energy and Environment Cabinet says the purchase enables recreation options including hiking and birding and will conserve habitat for rare species including the northern long-eared bat. Kentucky State Parks Commissioner Donnie Holland says the land purchase will add about 4 miles to the Pine Mountain trail. Conservation fund Director Zeb Weese says the trail will be the access point closest to Pineville and Pine Mountain State Resort Park. The organization has funded thousands of acres on Pine Mountain and says all the sites have management plans to keep them focused on conservation and compatible recreation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Two Louisiana State University researchers have a four-year, $500,000 grant to figure out whether one natural form of DNA regulation affects cattle embryos’ ability to survive. LSU AgCenter researchers Zongliang “Carl” Jiang and Ken Bondioli are studying DNA methylization, a chemical attachment that acts like an on-off switch for individual genes. This form was known in other organisms but wasn’t found in mammals until 2016. Jiang says he recently found it in cattle embryos. Jiang says their work could eventually help livestock production and even human fertility treatments, but that’s years in the future. Right now, he says, the researchers are just investigating how it works. The grant is from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunk: A Victorian-era train depot that later housed a macrame bead shop, a bike business and the headquarters of Tom’s of Maine is up for sale. The Boston Globe reports the 4,125-square-foot, wood-frame building is listed at $939,000 and is currently the home of Dietz Associates Inc., a creative design and marketing firm. Tim Dietz and his wife, Kathy, bought the depot in 2004 and restored the building, which opened in the 1870s for the Boston and Maine Railroad. It closed in the 1960s. A variety of businesses have occupied the building, including Tom’s of Maine, known for its natural toothpaste and personal care products. Dietz said because he and his wife are in their mid-60s, “it’s time to downsize.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Prosecutors in the case of a man accused of killing five people at the Capital Gazette newspaper can review records relating to his mental health since he has been incarcerated, a judge ruled Wednesday. Judge Laura Ripken’s ruling comes as attorneys in the case have been battling over information they need to share before the November trial of Jarrod Ramos, who is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting at the newsroom. William Davis, Ramos’ lawyer, contended the information is privileged and wouldn’t be relevant until a second phase of the trial, if a jury finds Ramos guilty. But Ripken ruled the privilege doesn’t apply in the case of an insanity plea, which she said “is actively being pursued.” Anne Arundel County State’s Attorney Anne Leitess said Ramos’ mental health is “highly relevant.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGreat Barrington: Whoever dumped trash at the building made famous in Arlo Guthrie’s 1967 Thanksgiving protest anthem “Alice’s Restaurant Massacree” has a sense of humor. The director of what’s now the Guthrie Center in Great Barrington discovered Tuesday that someone had filled the dumpster with garbage and left a grubby sofa nearby. They also left a sign that said: “Officer Obie told me to do it.” The sign was a reference to former Stockbridge Police Chief William Obanhein, the Officer Obie of the song who arrested Guthrie for illegally dumping trash. Guthrie, who was traveling Tuesday, said in a note to The Berkshire Eagle through a family member, “I hope they left an envelope with some money in it.” According to the song, an envelope with a name on it led to Guthrie’s arrest.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A nonprofit community mobilization coalition wants local businesses, groups and individuals to take part in its annual Neighborhoods Day this weekend. ARISE Detroit! says volunteers are needed to help beautify, clean up and remove blight from city neighborhoods. Neighborhoods Day is Saturday, and more than 200 organizations already have registered for community service projects. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan has committed with more than 250 employees to beautify and spruce up 16 public schools buildings and participate in six other community service projects. ARISE Detroit! Executive Director Luther Keith says that “there are many neighborhood groups that are stretched for resources, and a few volunteers can make a big difference for them on Neighborhoods Day.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nWorthington: State agriculture officials are placing Nobles County under emergency quarantine after emerald ash borers were discovered in the city. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that it’s the first time emerald ash borers have been identified in the county. The quarantine is aimed at limiting movement of firewood and ash products out of the area, reducing the risk of spreading the tree-killing insect. A total of 19 Minnesota counties are now under a full or partial quarantine to prevent spreading emerald ash borers. The pest was found along Interstate 90. An open house for Nobles County residents to learn more about emerald ash borer will be held Sept. 4 in Worthington. The state Agriculture Department plans to impose the quarantine Oct. 1.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s new lottery is seeking advertising to help sell tickets. The Lottery Corp. says it’s looking for advertising and marketing companies to help build its brand, make advertisements and buy ad space. The deadline for companies to submit proposals is Aug. 22. The corporation announced in June that it wants to start selling scratch-off tickets by Dec. 1. Sales of tickets for multistate games such as Powerball could begin in 2020, lottery President Tom Shaheen has said. Mississippi had been one of six states without a lottery, and churches were longtime opponents of creating one. But as the state faced increasing problems with crumbling highways and bridges, lawmakers last year voted to start a lottery to generate money for transportation.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: Property owners near a cattle farm are suing to stop a major expansion of the operation. A lawsuit filed Tuesday by 141 property owners contends the Valley Oaks Steak Co.’s farm already has brought noise, odors and pests to the area near Lone Jack, about 25 miles east of Kansas City. The lawsuit contends the problems will only get worse if Valley Oaks’ proposal to expand from fewer than 999 cattle to 6,999 cattle is granted. The landowners and Powell Gardens, a botanical garden about 3 miles from Valley Oaks, have opposed the expansion. In January, a Jackson County judge granted a preliminary injunction that put the expansion plans on hold. Valley Oaks officials have said the operation will be among the most environmentally friendly concentrated animal feeding operations in the country.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Northern Cheyenne Tribe has been awarded $2 million in federal funding to build a solar farm. The Billings Gazette reports the tribe will put in matching funding for the construction of the White River Solar Project near Busby. Officials expect the 26-acre solar farm to generate 2.6 megawatts, enough electricity for about 100 homes. Project director Kyle Atwood says the solar farm has 18 months to be built. He says officials are still working out details for how the power will be delivered. The tribe is discussing selling the power to the Tongue River Electric Cooperative. The project aims to lower electricity prices for residents of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, where Atwood says monthly electric bills range from $250 to $450.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State business and education leaders have unveiled a plan designed to create 25,000 jobs while adding $15,000 to the annual income of every resident by 2030. The plan from the group Blueprint Nebraska also seeks to bring 43,000 new young adults into the state and attract $200 million in annual research and development initiatives. The group also hopes to make Nebraska a top-ranked state for its quality of life. Blueprint Nebraska identified 15 high-priority initiatives to achieve the goal. The list includes public-private partnerships to provide more internships and apprenticeships, increasing broadband access and an initiative to promote entrepreneurship. Blueprint Nebraska includes top business groups including the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry, state officials, and leaders of the University of Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A mobile command vehicle has been assigned to emergency planning personnel in northeast Nevada to better handle crisis situations. The Elko Daily Free Press reports the Nevada Division of Emergency Management are giving Elko County authorities the vehicle free of charge. The 2004 Freightliner Major Incident Response Vehicle was little used due to its cost of operation and other factors. The Elko County Sheriff’s Office says the 10-seat vehicle was financed through grant funds. The vehicle will be used for emergency operations as a command post and a communications center. Officials say the sheriff’s office will house the vehicle and fulfill associated costs. Officials say the vehicle originally cost $340,000 and has more than 10,000 miles on it.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A federal judge says a challenge to the state’s new voter residency law can continue. Judge Joseph Laplante refused this week to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two Dartmouth College students. The new law ends the state’s distinction between “domicile” and “residency” for voting purposes, which means out-of-state college students who vote in New Hampshire would also be subject to residency requirements, such as getting New Hampshire driver’s licenses or registering their cars. Laplante heard about two hours of arguments on the state’s requests to dismiss the case and to remove Secretary of State William Gardner as a defendant. After denying both motions, Laplante said while he agrees the students have standing to sue, he isn’t saying they have a particularly strong case.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state now allows terminally ill patients to seek life-ending drugs after a new law went into effect Thursday. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy had signed the bill in April, making New Jersey the seventh with such a measure. Maine enacted a similar law in June, becoming the eighth. The Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act allows only patients who are terminally ill and have a prognosis of six months or less to live to acquire medication to end their lives. Lawmakers tried for years going back to at least 2012 to advance the legislation. The legislation has several measures that legislators called “safeguards.” They include requiring patients to make two requests and allowing them a chance to rescind the request.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDexter: A park has been closed after a swarm of killer bees attacked two people. Dexter Fire and Rescue Chief Justin Powell told the Roswell Daily Record two internet service provider workers were stung over 100 times Tuesday in Dexter. Powell says the workers were repairing equipment on top of an unused water tower at the park when they were attacked. He says the bees chased the workers, who climbed from the tower and run away screaming. Powell says two police officers, three firefighters and emergency medical personnel who responded also were stung. Firefighters later doused foam onto a bee’s nest in the park. Officials say the town will let the bees calm down and seek a bee expert to remove them.\n\nNew York\n\nMount Vernon: A three-week standoff that left this suburban community with two men claiming to be mayor has been resolved after a judge ruled that the former mayor’s guilty plea to stealing campaign funds meant he had forfeited his office. Former Mayor Richard Thomas was seen cleaning out his City Hall office Wednesday night, and a U-Haul truck delivered several items to Thomas’ house. State Supreme Court Justice Lawrence Ecker ruled earlier Wednesday that Thomas had vacated his office by pleading guilty July 8 to misusing 2015 campaign funds. Mount Vernon’s city council appointed its president, Andre Wallace, as acting mayor July 11, but Thomas initially argued that his plea agreement had given him until Sept. 30 to step down.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s elections board is deadlocked over whether to require that voting machines produce a paper printout that lets voters read and confirm their ballot. The state’s Board of Elections on Thursday decided to debate the issue again in three weeks. By then, it’s likely a fifth member will be appointed to replace the chairman who resigned this week. The board is deciding whether voting machines offered by three companies will be cleared for sale to the state’s 100 counties for years to come. One third of the counties are under pressure because a state law says they can’t use their current touch-screen devices after this year. The elections board’s decision comes amid new warnings of Russia and other foreign rivals trying to sabotage U.S. elections.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Two new abortion laws in the state aren’t being enforced because of legal challenges. The state’s sole abortion clinic in Fargo sued in June over a measure requiring physicians to tell women that they may reverse a so-called medication abortion if they have second thoughts. That law was to go into effect Thursday, but the state has agreed to not enforce it until a federal judge rules. The other makes it a crime for a doctor performing a second-trimester abortion to use instruments such as clamps, scissors and forceps to remove the fetus from the womb. The law becomes effective if a federal court allows its enforcement. Tammi Kromenaker, director of the Red River Valley Women’s Clinic, says that “basically nothing has changed” at the Fargo facility.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As students prepare to head back to class, buyers get a bit of a break on certain school supplies and clothing during the state’s annual sales tax holiday this Friday through Sunday. The tax exemption applies to clothing items priced at $75 or less, certain school supplies priced at $20 or less, and school instructional materials priced at $20 or less. The list of eligible items includes purchases such as textbooks, reference books, markers, calculators, lunch boxes, shoes, uniforms, coats, diapers and even formal wear if the items are under the $75 threshold. Materials bought for use in a business or trade aren’t eligible. The Department of Taxation says as long as the individual items are eligible, there is no limit on the amount of the total tax-exempt transaction.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A court on Thursday upheld the rape and sexual assault convictions and 263-year prison sentence of a former police officer whose case has been watched closely by the Black Lives Matter movement and some conservatives. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously rejected appeals by Daniel Holtzclaw that included a lack of evidence, excessive sentence, prosecutorial misconduct, a “circus atmosphere” during his trial, and a failure by the defense attorney to present an expert to offer an alternative explanation to how DNA of one victim wound up on Holtzclaw’s pants. Holtzclaw’s family said in a statement that it is devastated by the ruling, but not surprised. Prosecutors alleged Holtzclaw, 32, targeted black women and girls while on duty. He was convicted in 2015 on 18 charges involving seven women and one girl that occurred in 2013 and 2014.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A state senator’s threats against the Senate president and the Oregon State Police on the eve of a walkout by Senate Republicans in June sent a shock wave of fear through the Capitol. Some who work in the domed building wept, expressing fear of returning to the job, emails obtained by the Associated Press show. Among protective measures that were considered: escorting employees from their parking spaces to their desks, creating secured work areas and even having state police at the dais in the Senate chamber. Republican Sen. Brian Boquist warned June 19 if the state police were sent to force him to return during the walkout, they should “send bachelors and come heavily armed.” The GOP senators staged a walkout June 20, preventing majority Democrats from voting on the bill that would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nFrackville: A man who spent more than two decades behind bars for a murder he didn’t commit is a free man. John Miller was released from prison Wednesday after 22 years. Surrounded by family outside a state prison 100 miles north of Philadelphia, he said it felt “surreal.” A jury in 1998 found Miller guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a man in a train station parking lot, even though there was no physical evidence of his involvement. The key witness against him confessed multiple times to being the real shooter and even sent a letter to Miller’s mother apologizing for lying. Miller, now 44, contacted the Pennsylvania Innocence Project about eight years ago to help with an appeal. On Wednesday morning, a judge set Miller free.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Portraits of late Mayor Buddy Cianci that were removed from a city hotel in response to a complaint about his criminal past are now for sale. WLNE-TV reports that the portraits that hung throughout The Graduate Providence hotel have been donated to the Cianci Educational Foundation, which is selling them to raise money for scholarships. The Graduate is located in the same building as the former Biltmore Hotel, where Cianci once lived. The hotel removed the portraits that hung in every guestroom in June after Kath Connolly wrote a letter to management to remind them of “the corruption, crime, fear, and dishonesty” during Cianci’s years in office. Cianci was sentenced to 4 1/ 2 years in prison after a corruption conviction in 2002. He died in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: A woman says a porch pirate may have stolen a package containing nine tarantulas from her front porch. News outlets report the woman says she received a notification Friday morning that the FedEx shipment had been delivered. When she went to get the package, she says it wasn’t there. The Spartanburg County sheriff’s office says the spiders are valued at $1,000. The responding deputy listed the case as a “possible larceny of mail.” The report says there’s no surveillance video from the home, and there are no suspects at this time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Rangers in Wind Cave National Park have noticed an increase in the number of bison-vehicle crashes, with six such crashes this year. Half resulted in fatal injuries to the bison. Park officials say there were no bison crashes last year, and in 2017 two were hit but did not die. Park spokesman Tom Farrell says the latest crash happened late Saturday night when a local woman driving a car on Highway 385 struck and killed a bison. Farrell tells the Rapid City Journal says he’s not sure what’s behind the increase this year, but he says drivers need to watch their speeds and look out for the animals, especially at night when they’re hard to see. Bison can often weigh as much as a ton.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Jewelry, clothing, contractual documents and a signed guitar are among more than 400 items available at an auction of Elvis Presley-related memorabilia at Graceland. Elvis Presley Enterprises says online bidding is now open for The Auction at Graceland, part of the Elvis Week celebration this month. The celebration of the late singer and actor’s life and career draws fans each year to Memphis and Graceland, Presley’s former home-turned-museum. Elvis Week coincides with the anniversary of Presley’s death Aug. 16, 1977. The Aug. 13 auction will include a black tuxedo made for Presley’s 1969 Film, “The Trouble with Girls,” a 14-karat diamond ring he gave to musician JD Sumner, and an agreement signed in 1955 by Presley giving Col. Tom Parker part of Presley’s publishing rights.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A new mural of slain Tejano star Selena now graces a neighborhood where she lived. The mural unveiled Tuesday in Corpus Christi’s Molina neighborhood has three watercolor images of the Grammy-winning singer who was shot in 1995. A former president of Selena’s fan club is serving life in prison for killing her. The original mural had Selena’s portrait and the words “Always in our Hearts.” That work was done by some students and art teacher Dicky Valdez shortly after Selena’s death. But the mural showed signs of wear by last year. Selena’s relatives paid for the new mural, by New York artist San Singuenza. It says: “The goal isn’t to live Forever but to create something that will.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Salt Lake County intends to launch a program prioritizing rehabilitation over prison for low-level offenders. The Deseret News reports the county’s criminal justice diversion program is expected to reduce the county prison population. The program intended to prevent individuals from entering the criminal justice system is scheduled to begin Monday and be phased in over the next 12 to 18 months. Officials say the program is expected to divert between 750 and 1,000 individuals per year. Diversion will be offered to those facing new charges and individuals already in the system. The program will intervene at four levels of the process and be based on offender risk assessments. Officials say individuals at all risk levels will qualify for a rehabilitative drug program.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: The University of Vermont has upgraded its super computer, and it’s now 200 times faster. The South Burlington computer dubbed “DeepGreen” can achieve the speed of what’s known as a petaflop – equal to one thousand million million computations per second – or the equivalent of 20,000 laptop computers working in tandem. Using a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the upgrade was completed over the winter and spring. Associate physics professor Adrian Del Maestro says the extra processing speed will enable faculty to take on new research projects they could not explore prior to the upgrade. UVM Vice President for Research Richard Galbraith says the additional processing power is “absolutely essential for our faculty to stay at the cutting edge of their disciplines.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: William & Mary has received a $1 million grant to help fund research into the legacy of slavery and racism at the school as well as at the estate of the nation’s fifth president, James Monroe. The university in Williamsburg said in a statement Wednesday that the grant comes from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. William & Mary said the five-year grant will fund several initiatives, including genealogy work and an oral history project documenting stories of descendants of enslaved men and women. The project will be executed in part by the school’s Lemon Project, which aims to rectify past wrongs by the school against African Americans. Also involved is Highland, Monroe’s former estate in Charlottesville, which is part of William & Mary.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state has announced plans to kill another member of a pack of wolves that is repeatedly preying on cattle in Ferry County. But conservation groups contend it may be time to consider moving the cattle off public lands. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife said Wednesday that it planned to kill another member of the Old Profanity Territory wolf pack. The agency killed one member of the pack last month in an effort to change the pack’s behavior. But since then the pack is blamed for killing two cattle and injuring five. The pack is credited with a total of 27 depredations since last September. The Lands Council sent the agency a letter last week saying it may be time to move the cattle instead.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice’s companies owe almost $2 million in delinquent taxes in Virginia, according to records obtained by WDBJ-TV. The Roanoke-based station reports companies owned by the Republican governor owe $1.9 million in taxes to several counties in the neighboring state. Justice lists more than 100 businesses in his most recent financial disclosure statement, including coal, timber and agriculture companies. He has an estimated net worth of $1.5 billion. A representative for the Justice companies issued a statement to the Associated Press saying the businesses “are completely committed and actively working to resolve all tax disputes and liabilities.” The station says it first obtained documents showing more than $2 million in debts, but some of the delinquencies were paid off after it reached out to the companies for comment.\n\nWisconsin\n\nDodgeville: As worries grow over contamination of rural drinking water, a new study of private wells in southwestern Wisconsin has found the overwhelming majority were contaminated with fecal matter. Results from the independent study released Thursday show 32 of 35 wells – or 91% – contained fecal matter from humans or livestock. Also detected in some of the wells during April testing were illness-causing pathogens such as salmonella, rotavirus and cryptosporidium. The results from Grant, Iowa and Lafayette counties are the latest in a series of tests showing an array of problems with well water in the three counties. About one-quarter of the state’s residents get their water from more than 800,000 private wells, according to state figures.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: People can now apply for permits to snowmobile in Yellowstone National Park without a commercial guide during the next winter season. Under a special lottery program, the park allows one group of up to five snowmobiles to enter Yellowstone from each of its four winter entrances per day. This year’s lottery will be open on the recreation.gov website until Aug. 31. Successful applicants will be notified in mid-September. Trips can be for a maximum of three days in length, and permits cost $40 per day with a $6 application fee.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/02"}]}

Step down, Communist Party!” some protesters yelled among hundreds who gathered in the financial hub Shanghai – one of multiple major cities where protests broke out following a deadly fire Thursday at an apartment block in the far western region of Xinjiang.\n\nThe fire appeared to act as a catalyst for searing public anger over China’s strict zero-Covid measures after videos emerged that seemed to suggest lockdown measures delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05\n\nFrom Shanghai to the capital Beijing, residents gathered to grieve the 10 people killed in the blaze in Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi, speak out against zero-Covid and call for freedom and democracy. On dozens of university campuses, students demonstrated or put up protest posters. In many parts of the country, residents in locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets, following mass anti-lockdown protests that swept Urumqi on Friday night.\n\nSuch widespread scenes of anger and defiance – some of which stretched into the early hours of Monday morning – are exceptionally rare in China, where the ruling Communist Party ruthlessly cracks down on all expressions of dissent. But three years into the pandemic, many people have been pushed to the brink by the government’s incessant use of lockdowns, Covid tests and quarantines – as well as ever-tightening censorship and continued onslaught on personal freedoms.\n\nThe ratcheting-up of restrictions in recent months, coupled with a series of heartbreaking deaths blamed on an over-zealous policing of the controls, has brought matters to a head.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He fully supported China's zero-Covid policy.

When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022.

The protest gradually dispersed before dawn, the witness said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Shanghai residents returned to the site to continue protesting despite a heavy police presence and road blocks.\n\nVideos showed hundreds of people at an intersection shouting “Release the people!” in a demand for the police to free detained demonstrators.\n\nCrowds shouting \"Release the people!\" in Shanghai. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nThis time around, police adopted a more hardline approach, moving faster and more aggressively to make arrests and disperse the crowds.\n\nIn one video, a man holding a bundle of chrysanthemum gave a speech while walking on a pedestrian crossing, as a police officer tried to stop him.\n\n“We need to be braver!

A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom!

Here's what ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nAfter unprecedented protests swept China, several cities have taken steps to ease some Covid-19 restrictions and a top official has signaled a softer approach to virus controls – leading to speculation that an end to zero-Covid may be in sight.\n\nChina’s most senior official in charge of its Covid response told health officials Wednesday that a “new stage and mission” in the pandemic response was due to “the decreasing toxicity” of the Omicron variant, increasing vaccinations and the “accumulating experience” of fighting the virus, according to state news agency Xinhua.\n\nVice Premier Sun Chunlan’s comments – which made no mention of “zero-Covid” – came after anger over Beijing’s increasingly costly strategy of mass-testing, enforced quarantine and lockdowns brought thousands of protesters onto the streets of major cities.\n\nAs their numbers swelled, many also demanded greater political freedoms – and some even called for the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nProtests on such a large scale are highly unusual in China. While demonstrations over local grievances occur periodically, the protests are the most widespread since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989.\n\nThe Chinese government has cracked down swiftly, deploying police at key protest sites, calling protesters to warn them and tightening online censorship.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nWhat’s behind the protests?\n\nThe demonstrations were triggered by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, the capital of the far western region of Xinjiang. The blaze killed at least 10 people and injured nine in an apartment building – leading to public fury after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nThe city had been under lockdown for more than 100 days, with residents unable to leave the region and many forced to stay home.\n\nVideos showed Urumqi residents marching to a government building and chanting for the end of lockdown on Friday. The following morning, the local government said it would lift the lockdown in stages – but did not provide a clear time frame or address the protests.\n\nThat failed to quell public anger and the protests rapidly spread beyond Xinjiang, with residents in cities and universities across China also taking to the streets.\n\nWhere have protests taken place?\n\nSo far, CNN has verified 23 demonstrations since Saturday across 17 Chinese cities – including the capital Beijing and financial center Shanghai.\n\nIn Shanghai on Saturday, hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, named after the Xinjiang city, to mourn the fire victims. Many held up blank sheets of white paper – a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nSome also shouted for Xi to “step down,” and sang “The Internationale,” a socialist anthem used as a call to action in demonstrations worldwide for more than a century. It was also sung during pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing before a brutal crackdown by armed troops in 1989.\n\nBy Sunday evening, mass demonstrations had spread to Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan, where thousands of residents called for not only an end to Covid restrictions, but more remarkably, political freedoms. Residents in some locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets.\n\nProtests also took place on campuses, including the prestigious institutions of Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Communication University of China, Nanjing.\n\nIn Hong Kong, where a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 has been used to stifle dissent, dozens of people gathered on Monday evening in the city’s Central district for a vigil. Some held blank pieces of paper, while others left flowers and held signs commemorating those killed in the Urumqi fire.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05\n\nWhat does this mean for zero-Covid?\n\nVice Premier Sun’s remarks Wednesday about China’s “new stage and mission” in pandemic controls came just one day after the country’s National Health Commission (NHC) said the rectification of current pandemic measures is underway and local governments should “respond to and resolve the reasonable demands of the masses” in a timely manner.\n\nIn a meeting with the NHC on Wednesday, Sun also stated that a “human-centered approach” should be taken, and China should enhance its “diagnosis, testing, treatment and quarantine” measures, continue boosting vaccination rates – especially among elderly people – and strengthen medication and medical resources.\n\nExperts have previously said higher vaccination rates among the elderly was necessary before any potential relaxation of restrictions.\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nAt a State Council press briefing on Tuesday, top health officials appeared to acknowledge the disruptions caused by measures such as lockdowns, saying long-term closures “can cause anxiety and life difficulties.”\n\nNHC spokesperson Mi Feng said Covid policies were being rectified to include lifting lockdown “as quickly as possible” to reduce inconvenience.\n\nIn recent days, at least six cities across China, including Beijing, have made changes to their Covid policies, in some cases lifting lockdowns, easing quarantine requirements and eliminating mass testing, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n\nSince Monday, the number of locally transmitted Covid cases reported daily in China has been declining, based on NHC data.\n\nWhy are these protests significant?\n\nPublic protest is exceedingly rare in China, where the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, wiped out much of civil society and built a high-tech surveillance state.\n\nThe mass surveillance system is even more stringent in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is accused of detaining up to 2 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in camps where former detainees have alleged they were physically and sexually abused.\n\nA damning United Nations report in September described the region’s “invasive” surveillance network, with police databases containing hundreds of thousands of files with biometric data such as facial and eyeball scans.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region.\n\nProtesters march in Beijing on November 27. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nWhile protests do occur in China, they rarely happen on this scale or take such direct aim at the central government and the nation’s leader, said Maria Repnikova, an associate professor at Georgia State University who studies Chinese politics and media.\n\n“This is a different type of protest from the more localized protests we have seen recurring over the past two decades that tend to focus their claims and demands on local officials and on very targeted societal and economic issues,” she said. Instead, this time the protests have expanded to include “the sharper expression of political grievances alongside concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns.”\n\nThere have been growing signs in recent months that the public has run out of patience with zero-Covid, after nearly three years of economic hardship and disruption to daily life.\n\nIsolated pockets of protest broke out in October, with anti-zero-Covid slogans appearing on the walls of public bathrooms and in various Chinese cities, inspired by a banner hung by a lone protester on an overpass in Beijing just days before Xi cemented a third term in power.\n\nEarlier in November, larger protests took place in Guangzhou, with residents defying lockdown orders to topple barriers and cheer as they took to the streets.\n\nHow have authorities reacted?\n\nWhile protests in several parts of China appear to have largely dispersed peacefully over the weekend, authorities responded more forcefully in some cities on Monday and Tuesday, flooding protest sites to discourage people from gathering.\n\nAuthorities in some cities have also adopted surveillance tactics, such as those used in Xinjiang, to intimidate those who demonstrated over the weekend.\n\nIn what appeared to be the first official – albeit veiled – response to the protests, China’s domestic security chief vowed at a meeting Tuesday to “effectively maintain overall social stability.”\n\nWithout mentioning the demonstrations, Chen Wenqing urged law enforcement officials to “resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order,” Xinhua reported.\n\nThe tough language may signal a heavy-handed crackdown ahead.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows British journalist 'beaten' and detained in China 01:17 - Source: CNN Video shows British journalist 'beaten' and detained in China 01:17\n\nHow has the world responded?\n\nIn recent days, vigils and demonstrations expressing solidarity with protesters in China have been held around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the United States and Malaysia.\n\nForeign officials and organizations have also voiced support for the protesters and criticized Beijing’s response.\n\n“We’re watching this closely, as you might expect we would,” said US National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday. “We continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest.”\n\nUK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told reporters the Chinese government should “listen to the voices of its own people … when they are saying that they are not happy with the restrictions imposed upon them.”\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union also said on Monday that it condemned “the intolerable intimidation and aggression” directed toward member journalists in China, in an apparent reference to foreign journalists who were detained during protests.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Tara Subramaniam", "Jessie Yeung", "Tara Subramaniam", "How Have Authorities Reacted"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/china/china-covid-foxconn-tibet-disney-intl-hnk", "title": "China is caught in a zero-Covid trap of its own making | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nIt’s been little more than a week since Chinese leader Xi Jinping began his norm-breaking third term in power with a ringing endorsement of his relentless zero-Covid policy.\n\nBut the commitment to stick with it is already fueling scenes of chaos and misery across the country.\n\nIn the northwestern city of Xining, residents spent last week pleading desperately for food as they suffered through the latest of the country’s stringent lockdowns; to the west, in Lhasa, the regional capital of Tibet, angry crowds have been protesting in the streets after more than 70 days of stay-home orders.\n\nIn the central province of Henan, migrant workers have abandoned a locked-down Foxconn factory en masse, walking for miles to escape an outbreak at China’s largest iPhone assembling site. And, in the eastern financial hub of Shanghai, things are gloomy even at Disneyland – the park abruptly shut its gates on Monday to comply with Covid prevention measures, trapping visitors inside for compulsory testing.\n\nIn many other parts of the country, lockdowns, mandatory quarantines, incessant mass testing edicts and travel restrictions continue to cripple businesses and daily life, even as the rest of the world moves on from the pandemic.\n\nA woman wearing a face mask walks past a mural depicting epidemic control workers in protective suits in Beijing, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nRenewed zeal\n\nRather than relax Covid restrictions – as some had hoped for in the lead-up to the Communist Party’s five-yearly leadership reshuffle, Chinese authorities have ramped them up after Xi’s sweeping endorsement of the strategy.\n\n“The 20th Party Congress didn’t provide a timetable for moving away from zero-Covid. Instead it highlighted the importance of sticking to the existing approach,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nThe congress reinforced Xi as an unrivaled supreme leader, and saw him stack the Communist Party’s top ranks with staunch allies – including those who had loyally carried out his Covid policies.\n\n“The new political ecology also provided more incentive for local governments to impose more draconian Covid control measures,” Huang said.\n\nA renewed zeal for the policy can be seen most clearly in smaller cities. While metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai can draw on their experiences of major flareups to implement more targeted lockdown measures, smaller cities with no such know-how tend to pursue zero-Covid goals in a more aggressive and extensive manner, Huang said.\n\n‘It’s simply not working’\n\nThe repeating cycle of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing is taking a heavy toll on the economy and society. Public patience is wearing thin, and frustrations are building.\n\nOn Monday in Baoding city, Hebei province, a father wielding a knife drove through a Covid checkpoint in a desperate bid to buy milk powder for his son. Video footage of the scene and his subsequent arrest sparked uproar online; the following day local police tried to soothe tempers by saying the man had been fined only 100 yuan ($13.75) and that his child’s “milk powder problem” had been “properly resolved.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the death of a 3-year-old in Lanzhou, Gansu province, sparked another outcry, after the child’s family said lockdown measures had delayed emergency responders. Police said later the child had stopped breathing by the time officers arrived, but did not address the family’s accusations that an ambulance had been delayed. CNN has reached out to Lanzhou authorities for comment.\n\nIn another sign of how sensitive the issue has become, Chinese stocks rallied on Wednesday following unverified social media rumors that China was forming a committee to prepare an exit from the zero-Covid policy.\n\nThose rumors were quashed, however, when the Foreign Ministry said it was “unaware” of any such plan.\n\nMeanwhile, experts say they see no signs of the Chinese government taking steps that would suggest it is rethinking its approach.\n\nChinese health officials maintain that changing tack now would risk a huge surge in infections and deaths that could overwhelm the country’s fragile health care system.\n\nBeijing has so far refused to approve for use the mRNA vaccines developed in Western countries, which have been shown to be more potent than those made and used in China. Experts say China also lacks an emergency response plan to cope with surging infections.\n\nBut Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said such catastrophic scenarios could be avoided with proper preparation.\n\nInstead of spending vast amounts of time and resources on testing, contact tracing, quarantining and imposing lockdowns, authorities should introduce more effective vaccines and antiviral therapies and boost the vaccination rate among the elderly, Jin said.\n\nWith boosted immunity, asymptomatic or mild cases could be allowed to recover at home – freeing up space at hospitals to treat more severe cases, he said.\n\n“Using lockdown and containment measures to deal with an infectious disease with such a low mortality rate and high transmissibility is no longer appropriate. The whole world has abandoned this approach – nobody can stand the cost, it’s simply not working,” he said.\n\nFear of the virus\n\nAnother hurdle to pivoting from zero-Covid is a pervasive fear of the virus among large swaths of the public, instilled by the Chinese government to justify its harsh control measures, experts say.\n\n“Authorities have demonized Covid, exaggerating its severity and mortality rate and talking up long-Covid symptoms. Many ordinary people are still very afraid of the virus, with recovered Covid patients suffering from severe discrimination and stigmatization,” Jin said.\n\nIt was partly such fears that drove thousands of migrant workers to flee in panic from the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, he said.\n\nVideos of people traveling on foot, dragging their luggage on roads and across fields, went viral on Chinese social media over the weekend. Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million, imposed sweeping lockdown measures last month after identifying dozens of Covid-19 cases.\n\nThe Foxconn facility has been racing to control an outbreak since mid-October, though the company has not disclosed the number of infections among its workers. On Wednesday, the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone, where the Foxconn plant is located, announced new lockdown measures.\n\nAs the Foxconn exodus thrust the Zhengzhou outbreak into the spotlight, the city’s health authorities have tried to allay public fears. On Monday, the Zhengzhou municipal health commission published a WeChat article with the headline: “Covid is not that horrible, but preventable and treatable.”\n\nHuang, the expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said misconceptions about the virus would complicate matters if China did at some point decide to move away from zero Covid.\n\n“Even if in the future, China wants to change the narrative and play down the seriousness of the disease, some people might not buy into the new narrative,” he said.\n\nAs the winter approaches, experts warn that China could be hit by a new wave of infections – and a new cycle of draconian lockdowns.\n\nChina reported 2,755 local infections for Tuesday, the highest daily tally since August.\n\n“Judging from the situation in China, there will be a major outbreak sooner or later. China has deployed tremendous efforts and paid a heavy cost to prevent that from happening, but in the end, it won’t be able to stop such a highly infectious disease from spreading,” Jin said.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/09/18/ukraine-russia-war-update-maps/75061478007/", "title": "Ukraine war updates mapped: Explosion at Toropets ammo depot in ...", "text": "(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nUkraine destroyed a Russian arsenal approximately 240 miles from Moscow as Kremlin troops continue to grind toward a rail and transportation hub in Pokrovsk. Ukrainian forces still control Russian territory after a cross-border raid and the Biden administration is considering Kyiv's requests to strike deeper into Russia using Western weapons. These developments come more than a month after Ukraine's historic and ongoing incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast, and a week after at least 58 people were killed by a Russian missile strike in Poltava.\n\nAlong with the U.S., officials from Poland and the U.K. have discussed assisting Ukraine with long-range attacks into Russia including with U.K. Storm Shadow cruise missiles and U.S.-made ATACMS ballistic missiles. Moscow responded by expelling six British diplomats and issuing a new warning: Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the West would be participating directly in a war with Russia if they authorized further long-range strikes.\n\nHere's a closer look at some of the most recent updates from Russia's war on Ukraine:\n\nUkraine destroys Russian arsenal with drone attack\n\nSatellite images from Maxar Technologies show smoke billowing from an ammunition depot approximately 240 miles west of Moscow after a series of large explosions in Toropets, Russia. Reuters reports that a Ukrainian drone attack destroyed a facility storing missiles, guided bombs and artillery ammunition, causing an \"earthquake-sized\" blast which showed up on seismic monitors and NASA satellites which picked up intense heat emanating from a 14 square kilometre (5 square mile) area. This is the latest in a series of Ukrainian drone strikes against Russian sites, including airfields and energy infrastructure.\n\nRiley Bailey, a Russia analyst, told USA TODAY that Ukraine's ability to produce drones domestically as one reason for increased success in these attacks on Russia. \"Ukraine has filled out a very wide, deep stock of long-range, domestically produced drones. The most recent strike was reportedly the largest and it primarily targeted energy infrastructure.\"\n\n\"We've seen strikes against ammunition depots and elements of the Russian defense-industrial base trying to degrade Russian efforts to mobilize defense industry to increase production of military equipment and another place where we've seen the Ukrainian strike campaign focus on is Russian airfields,\" Bailey said, adding that these airfield strikes reduce Russia's security and their ability to conduct consistent glide bomb attacks against Ukraine.\n\nBailey sees strikes on infrastructure as aimed at reducing Russia's oil refining capacity, both to supply the Russian military and to degrade a source of funding to the Kremlin in the long term. And energy infrastructure is not the only target of these Ukrainian drone attacks.\n\nRussian attack on Poltava deadliest this year\n\nOn Sept. 3, a Russian ballistic missile struck a military school in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, killing 58 and injuring 320, according to the Associated Press. Citing Ukrainian officials, The Associated Press reported the attack also struck a nearby hospital, describing it as one of the deadliest strikes since the war began. The Russian Ministry of Defense said on Telegram that the strike targeted the 179th joint training center of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Poltava, which specializes in communications and electronic warfare training. It came days after Kyiv's largest drone attack to date.\n\nRussia has attacked civilian targets since the war began. Notable incidents include the attacks on Kramatorsk railway station in April 2022, which killed 63; a Dnipro apartment building in January 2023, which killed 46; and a Hroza cafe in October 2023, which killed 59. The Russian attack on the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in Mariupol is likely the war's most deadly attack on civilians. An Associated Press investigation found evidence that up to 600 people sheltering there were killed. Initial Ukrainian estimates placed the death toll at 300.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst, now a senior director at the Atlantic Council, told USA TODAY that the Poltava attack was the largest airstrike since the major Russian air campaign began in the Fall of 2022 and interpreted it as Moscow's frustrated response to the Kursk incursion. \"I call it a tantrum strike because it has very little military effect. It causes a great deal of pain, but strategically, it's of limited value,\" Herbst said.\n\nBailey, the Russia analyst for the war institute told told USA TODAY that the Russian military may believe there is an operational aim to such attacks. \"When Russian forces first started their large-scale missile and drone strike campaign in October of 2022 the explicit aim was to destroy Ukrainian morale, to destroy Ukraine's will to continue to fight the war. They aimed to collapse the Ukrainian energy grid and use winter as this intense pressure to get the Ukrainian nation, to get the Ukrainian people to abandon their resistance. That effort failed.\"\n\n\"If you view some of these strikes in that lens, you can start to see that some of the strikes on civilian targets could be intentional, that it could be this effort to try to demoralize Ukraine through strike after strike against civilian targets,\" said Bailey.\n\nSeth Jones, director of the international Security Program and vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told USA TODAY that the Poltava attack is fairly consistent with the Russian military strategy in Ukraine, Syria and Chechnya before that. \"CSIS has documented numerous strikes against hospitals in Syria that were treating elements of the Free Syrian Army and other opposition groups. When they target the electricity grid, when they've targeted other civilian targets, it is in part attempting to influence, undermine the morale of a population.\"\n\n\"Having visited Ukraine numerous times during the war, when your city comes under attack, you feel it. There's an element of fear. I don't think it is undermining morale within the Ukrainian population, but that certainly is an important and desired end,\" Jones said.\n\nAir defense is a critical need for Ukraine\n\nThe Poltava attack drew a strong response from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: \"Air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not in a warehouse somewhere,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address. \"Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not sometime later. Unfortunately, every day of delay means loss of life.\"\n\nJones told USA TODAY that while areas like downtown Kyiv are well defended with Patriot batteries, Ukraine doesn’t have enough material to defend all of their cities.\n\nUkraine was \"promised five Patriots at the NATO summit, and they were complaining that they received only one with the second one likely to arrive soon,” said former Ambassador Herbst. “If they had five more Patriot batteries, there would be a good fewer number of Ukrainian dead civilians and maybe soldiers too.”\n\nJones says that the biggest concern for Ukrainian officials is air defense. \"Ukrainians don't have a sufficient supply, and have to make judgment calls about what to shoot down and what not to, or they get overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"When you look at most of the strikes against cities in Ukraine, including the Poltava attacks, they're generally now a combination of cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, drones and decoys,\" Jones said.\n\nAccording to Bailey, Russian forces are trying to seize on Ukraine's limitations, hoping that the large numbers of cruise missiles and drones overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses and allow ballistic missiles to get through. \"The Russians are fine with high interception rates with the drones,\" Bailey said. \"They often use them for that purpose: to both overwhelm the air defenses find out where the air defenses are, then launch the cruise missiles and the ballistic missiles in a way that will try to evade the air defenses and penetrate them.\"\n\nBailey describes air defense as a layered umbrella: \"You want to make sure that a higher-end system, like the Patriot battery, that has proven effective at intercepting ballistic missiles, is in a place and will have the capability to respond to that, while your lower-end air defense systems can respond to cruise missiles, and you want even lower-end systems responding to the Shahed drones.\" Both Jones and Bailey pointed to the importance of air support as part of a layered air defense strategy. Bailey told USA TODAY that a layered strategy is difficult to execute if you only have limited systems, and if you have continued pervasive shortages of air defense batteries and interceptors.\n\nWhat has happened since Ukraine's incursion into Kursk\n\nLast month, Ukraine launched multiple offensive attacks deeper into Russian territory. In one of the biggest assaults on Russia since the war began, Ukraine utilized drones to target several areas, including the capital of Moscow. Kyiv also launched a historic raid across the border destroying a convoy, capturing enemy soldiers and repurposing enemy equipment. Ukraine still controlled Russian territory in Kursk as of Wednesday. Ukraine has launched several counteroffensive operations against Russia throughout the war, most notably in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions in 2022. Ukraine also liberated many settlements in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia territories in 2023.\n\nHerbst says that Ukrainian attacks on Russian infrastructure have grown more successful. \"I've seen reports of 14% or more of Russia's oil refining stock being destroyed, and that has both industrial implication and a military-industrial implication.” When it comes to attacking infrastructure, Herbst said, “Russia was there first and has done extraordinary damage in Ukraine.”\n\nRussia targeted Ukrainian energy facilities in a series of airstrikes, according to a Sept. 19 report from Reuters, citing Ukrainian officials: A U.N. monitoring organization suggests the attacks violated humanitarian law and the International Energy agency fears electricity shortfall this winter.\n\nRussia targeted Ukrainian energy facilities in a new wave of airstrikes, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday, despite a U.N. monitoring body saying attacks on the power grid probably violated humanitarian law.\n\nRegional officials said civilian infrastructure had also been damaged, and the International Energy Agency warned of an electricity shortfall in Ukraine this winter.\n\nThe Kursk incursion has gotten the attention of the Russian military, evidenced by satellite images captured by Maxar Technologies that show new strategic trenches carved into Russian farmland 20 miles north of the Ukraine border.\n\n\"Right now we are at a critical inflection point,\" Bailey said. \"With the incursion into Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian forces have been able to regain the initiative on a limited sector of the front line, start contesting Russia's theaterwide initiative, and start exerting operational pressures on Russian forces that Russian forces haven't experienced for all of 2024.\"\n\n\"We've seen an effort by the Russian military command to silo their high-priority effort in Donetsk Oblast, specifically the offensive operation to seize Pokrovsk. We have seen indications that they have redeployed limited elements that were likely intended for that offensive operation on Pokrovsk, but nothing to suggest that the incursion into Kursk Oblast has heavily disrupted that offensive operation.\"\n\nA Sept. 14 assessment from the Institute for the Study of War notes claims from Ukrainian officials that the Kursk incursion has prompted Russia to triple the concentration of their forces there, but that individual breakdown of where those units are coming from remains unclear. The assessment indicates that a future Russian counter-offensive would require even more forces and additional redeployments from Ukraine.\n\nWhile Bailey told USA TODAY that the war institute cannot confirm specific numbers, they have seen reports of redeployments from Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk and Kharkiv Oblasts, and that Russia appears to be selectively transferring parts of units as opposed to redirecting entire brigades to Kursk. \"In every sector of the front where there is active fighting, we have seen redeployments.\"\n\n\"They're trying to draw from elsewhere before they draw from their reserves and their forces in Donetsk Oblast, which is where they're conducting their priority offensive efforts,\" said Bailey.\n\nBailey does not see the either Ukrainian incursion or Russian attritional approach as decisive gambles and does not think that either country is currently capable of decisive war-winning operations. Instead, each must conduct multiple campaigns toward operationally significant objectives that are far short of victory. Nonetheless, Bailey thinks that comparing the two is important because it shows two diametrically opposed approaches to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Russian forces have really embraced positional warfare in Ukraine. There's not rapid movement along the front line and they have determined that they are fine with this consistent attritional offensive that results in creeping gains, as long as that prevents Ukraine from being able to conduct significant counterattacks and retake territory,\" Bailey said.\"The fighting in Pokrovsk itself had been a slow grind from village to village, and frontal infantry assault from one position to the next.\" Bailey said that Russian forces have advanced only roughly 29 kilometers (18 miles) west of Avdiivka.\"Kursk shows a different approach to war on the Ukrainian side: Ukraine still believes that it can liberate territory through rapid mechanized maneuver. Ukrainian forces leveraged operational surprise and maneuver warfare to advance roughly 28 kilometers (17.4 miles) into Kursk Oblast within the first week of the incursion.\"\n\n\"Ukrainian gains on Russian territory are deeply embarrassing and unsettling and maybe destabilizing for Putin,\" Herbst said, \"but he's betting that they're not, and if his bet is right, then that he's smart to keep all of his most effective troops in Donbas.\"\n\n\"But if he's wrong about that, then, of course, it's a mistake, and there are signs that he may be wrong about it. The thing about an authoritarian state like Russia is that it seems stable, stable, stable, and suddenly it's falling apart.\"\n\nUkraine has received billions in aid, but it needs more.\n\nThe U.S. along with many other countries, particularly those in the European Union, have been providing Ukraine with military, financial and humanitarian aid throughout the war. Reuters reported that Ukraine has also been receiving Indian munitions transferred by European partners.\n\nFrom January 2022 through June 2024, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with over $80 billion in assistance, most of it in military aid according to The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German-based research institution.\n\nRussia has been receiving ammunition from North Korea and close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. Belarus has also cooperated with Russia during the war, allowing them to stage their assault on Kyiv from its borders.\n\n\"What becomes important is more,\" Jones said, referring to the ongoing need for munitions. \"You just need more. They're used every day. The Russians keep coming. And so the longer this war goes on, it's an insatiable appetite that the Ukrainians and the Russians are going to have in a war of attrition. It's the sad reality.\"\n\n\"We know that both sides have had problems with supply,\" former Ambassador Herbst told USA TODAY. \"We know that Russia is being supplied with artillery and ammunition from North Korea in large quantities, although of questionable quality. And we also know that the West in general, including the United States, has learned, as Moscow has conducted this major war against Ukraine, that we ourselves do not have enough ammunition.\"\n\n\"There's been talk by the administration, there's been talk by Republicans in Congress, about doing something about this, but the action has been little, not just in connection with supplying Ukraine, but for us to be prepared for standoffs with either Russia or China,\" said Herbst.\n\n\"This is a serious issue which transcends Ukraine. We need to start ramping up our arms production for just straightforward American defense needs, as well as those of our allies and our friends.\"\n\nSources: Reuters; Institute for the Study of War; The Associated Press, BBC; Planet Labs PBC; Maxar Technologies; USA TODAY reporting", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/09/09/nepal-pm-k-p-sharma-oli-resigns-social-media-ban-protests/86053309007/", "title": "Nepal PM K.P.

Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday as anti-corruption demonstrators defied an indefinite curfew and clashed with police, a day after 19 people died in violent protests triggered by a social media ban.\n\nOli's government lifted the ban after protests intensified on Monday, with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters trying to storm parliament. Nineteen people were killed and more than 100 injured in the unrest.\n\nBut there was no let up in the protests on Tuesday, forcing Oli to quit and plunging Nepal into fresh political uncertainty.\n\nThe unrest is the worst in decades in the poor Himalayan country that is wedged between India and China and has struggled with political instability and economic uncertainty since protests led to the abolition of its monarchy in 2008.\n\n\"In view of the adverse situation in the country, I have resigned effective today to facilitate the solution to the problem and to help resolve it politically in accordance with the constitution,\" Oli said in his resignation letter to President Ramchandra Paudel.\n\nAn aide to Paudel told Reuters the resignation had been accepted and the President had begun the \"process and discussions for a new leader\".\n\nThe army posted an appeal on X asking people to \"exercise restraint\" since Oli's resignation had been accepted.\n\nOli, 73, was sworn in for his fourth term in July last year as the country’s 14th prime minister since 2008. Two of his cabinet colleagues resigned late on Monday, saying they did not want to continue on moral grounds.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Oli had called a meeting of all political parties, saying violence was not in the interest of the nation and \"we have to resort to peaceful dialogue to find solutions to any problem\".\n\nOli had also said he was saddened by the incidents of violence due to the \"infiltration from different selfish centres\". He did not respond directly to the protesters' complaints about corruption.\n\nBut anger against the government showed no signs of abating, as protesters gathered in front of parliament and other places in the capital Kathmandu, in defiance of an indefinite curfew imposed by authorities.\n\nThe protesters set fire to tyres on some roads, threw stones at police personnel in riot gear and chased them through narrow streets, while some looked on and shot videos of the clashes on their mobile phones as thick black smoke rose to the sky.\n\nWitnesses also said that protesters were setting fire to the homes of some politicians in Kathmandu, and local media reported that some ministers were plucked to safety by military helicopters.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the information.\n\nMAIN AIRPORT SHUT\n\nKathmandu airport, Nepal's main international gateway, was closed with immediate effect as smoke from fires nearby set by protesters could endanger the safety of aircraft, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said.\n\n\"We are still standing here for our future … We want this country corruption-free so that everyone can easily access education, hospitals, medical (facilities) … and for a bright future,\" protester Robin Sreshtha told Reuters TV.\n\nOrganisers of the protests, which spread to other cities in the Himalayan country, have called them \"demonstrations by Gen Z\", driven by young people's widespread frustration with the government's perceived lack of action to tackle corruption and boost economic opportunities.\n\n\"The protest was intended, first and foremost, against the rampant corruption in government,\" a protester said in an email to Reuters, signing off as 'A concerned Nepali citizen'.\n\nYoung Nepalis had been putting out social media posts about the \"luxurious lives of the families and children of corrupt politicians and civil servants\" and the government responded by clamping down on social media platforms, the email said.\n\nNeighbour India, which is home to hundreds of thousands of Nepali migrant workers, said it hoped that all concerned will exercise restraint and resolve issues through talks.\n\nA joint statement by the embassies of Australia, Finland, France, Japan, South Korea, UK, Norway, Germany, and the U.S. in Nepal urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, avoid further escalation and ensure fundamental rights are protected.\n\nLast week, Oli's government imposed a social media ban blocking access to several online platforms after it said the platforms had failed to register themselves with the government.\n\nCritics said it was an attempt to throttle free speech, a charge the government denies, citing misuse of social media to spread disinformation and commit fraud, among other concerns.\n\n(Reporting by Gopal Sharma and Navesh Chitrakar in Kathmandu; Additional reporting by Surbhi Misra in Bengaluru; writing by Shilpa Jamkhandikar and YP Rajesh; Editing by Tom Hogue, Stephen Coates, Sonali Paul, William Maclean)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/china/china-protests-zero-covid-position-intl-hnk-mic", "title": "China signals it could soften its zero-Covid policy, but there are ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nChina has given its most significant signal yet that it may adjust its stringent zero-Covid policy that has transformed daily life, roiled the economy – and sparked a wave of protests.\n\nThe top official in charge of China’s Covid response told health officials Wednesday that the country faced a “new stage and mission” in pandemic control.\n\n“With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China’s pandemic containment faces a new stage and mission,” Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said Wednesday, according to state news agency Xinhua.\n\nThe remarks follow a surge in public frustration with zero-Covid and its high human cost, which erupted into unprecedented demonstrations in at least 19 cities since last Friday.\n\nSun – who has been the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s enforcement of the policy – made no mention of “zero-Covid,” as reported by Xinhua. Her comments came a day after a separate body of top health officials pledged to rectify some approaches to Covid control and said local governments should “respond to and resolve the reasonable demands of the masses” in a timely manner.\n\nOn Thursday, Sun reiterated the new tone, telling a health symposium in Beijing that China’s health care and disease control systems now had “effective diagnosis and treatment techniques” against the epidemic. Overall, China had “created conditions for the country to further optimize its prevention and control measures,” she said, according to state media.\n\nThe high-level statements – alongside minor adjustments of rules and some easing of lockdown measures in major cities in recent days – suggest China is bending under pressure on the policy, which has become increasingly disruptive as it struggles to counter highly transmissible variants and record case numbers.\n\nBut the shifting tone has not come with any road map to an end goal or mention of transitioning away from zero-Covid, and it remains uncertain how it will impact realities on the ground or ease mounting public frustration.\n\nAs of Friday, thousands of buildings and residential communities across China remain under lockdown restrictions due to their classification as “high risk.”\n\nLocal officials may be reticent to let cases rise for fear of retribution from a central government that has long prided itself on its zero-Covid stance. Meanwhile, experts say, the country continues to lag in key areas of preparedness for a widespread outbreak.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Protesters clash with police in China during new wave of demonstrations 02:23 - Source: CNN Protesters clash with police in China during new wave of demonstrations 02:23\n\nTone shift\n\nChinese health officials and experts have long argued that the costs of the zero-Covid policy are scientifically justified, citing uncertainties in how the virus will evolve, unknowns about its long-term effects, and gaps in medical preparedness, including a lagging elderly vaccination rate and inadequate intensive care infrastructure – especially in rural areas.\n\nThese weaknesses, they have warned, could see the health care system overwhelmed if the virus spreads freely in the country of 1.4 billion – a situation that could exacerbate the deaths expected with an opening up.\n\nThis remains a key concern for the government, according to health security expert Nicholas Thomas at the City University of Hong Kong, who said: “There is still a substantial part of the population that is trusting in the government’s actions in dealing with the virus. An unmanaged engagement with the virus could not only erode that trust but it could also expose vulnerable populations (to risk).”\n\nOfficials’ recent comments around the policy are “not a sign that China is ready to transition to living with Covid, but a sign that the virus has slipped out of control and that the government is unable to return to a zero-Covid environment,” he said.\n\nCase numbers in the past week have hovered around record highs, with more than 34,000 new infections reported Thursday – posing a steep challenge to efforts to return them to a low level.\n\nThere have, however, been recent signs of efforts to shift public perception about the virus, following years of focusing on its risks.\n\nA number of media outlets picked up a piece by state-run Global Times citing “recent research” from Chinese scientists showing the comparative “decreased pathogenicity” of the Omicron variant. Others shared an interview with a medical expert who raised doubts about long Covid — a sharp contrast to previous state media coverage playing up the long-term risks of contracting the virus.\n\nThe government’s own narrative about the success of zero-Covid and its backing by leader Xi Jinping partly explain why China has long maintained the policy, according to Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.\n\nAfter bringing its initial outbreak in Wuhan under control in 2020, China’s border restrictions and swift method of detecting and suppressing the virus allowed the country to live relatively virus-free, while hospitals in many parts of the world were overrun with sick and dying patients. By China’s official count, it has seen only 5,233 Covid-19 deaths since early 2020, with fewer than 600 reported in 2022.\n\nXi has touted China’s measures and its relatively low number of Covid deaths as a triumph of Chinese governance. The country stuck to that system even as others transitioned to living with the virus following mass vaccinations and the spread of the milder, but highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nEven as Omicron made China’s controls less effective, Beijing continued to prioritize resources for lockdowns, mass testing and forced quarantines over preparing for wide spread of the virus, observers say.\n\n“The number one (reason) is propaganda – they want to claim that China is doing a much better job than the United States,” said Wu, adding that expanding state control over the population could be another motivation for maintaining the zero-Covid policy – as Xi has stressed state security as a key policy goal.\n\nBut while pursuing this strategy, China “lost so many golden opportunities,” to prepare to live with the virus, and to prepare the public for a larger scale of deaths from Covid-19, he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'River of blood': Foxconn employee describes violent protests in China 03:26 - Source: CNN 'River of blood': Foxconn employee describes violent protests in China 03:26\n\nPrepared?\n\nOne concern among health officials about relaxing controls is the low level of vaccination in the elderly population most vulnerable to Covid-19 – a weakness that Beijing on Tuesday launched a new plan to address.\n\nAs of November 11, 40% of China’s over-80 population had received a booster shot, according to state media, while around two-thirds had received two doses – a result of both vaccine hesitancy and an initial roll-out that did not prioritize the elderly.\n\nA World Health Organization advisory group last year recommended that elderly people taking China’s inactivated-virus vaccines receive three doses in their initial course to ensure sufficient protection. Vaccine protection is known to wane over time and decrease against Omicron.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s immunity rests almost entirely on vaccination as so few people have been exposed to the virus. Around 90% of the population is fully vaccinated. While China’s vaccines have been shown to protect against severe disease and death, studies show they offer lower antibody protection than the mRNA vaccines used widely elsewhere in the world. Beijing has yet to approve any mRNA vaccine.\n\nResidents line up for Covid-19 testing at a residential complex in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1, 2022. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA stark warning of the risks for mainland China played out in Hong Kong, where low vaccination rates among that most at-risk group played a role in pushing the Chinese territory’s Covid-19 death rates to some of the highest in the world last spring.\n\nWhile vaccination will not eliminate an increase in deaths when restrictions ease, shots and boosters, and other preparations to reduce risks, are critical for countries transitioning away from policies aimed at “zero-Covid,” according to infectious disease physician Peter Collignon of the Australian National University Medical School.\n\n“The preparation isn’t just vaccines, it’s surge capacity, it’s making sure you have enough hospital staff, you have enough beds and particularly making sure the elderly (are protected),” he said.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nChina has signaled it may make more concerted efforts to bolster its defenses against the virus. Officials on Tuesday released an action plan to boost elderly vaccination rates. This echoed a target mentioned in a 20-point plan to optimize zero-Covid measures, released last month, which also called for hospitals to increase intensive treatment facilities and to stockpile anti-viral drugs and medical equipment.\n\nThe same notice also relaxed certain measures around testing and quarantine, and cautioned against excesses in policy enforcement at the local level – all messages that have been echoed by top health officials in recent days.\n\nAfter that guidance – and in the wake of the recent protests – state media has highlighted a number of cities making minor changes to their policies, largely around testing and quarantine rules.\n\nBut some social media users remained skeptical, saying the changes to testing requirements were too minor to ease the impact of zero-Covid on daily life.\n\nThe northeastern city of Jinzhou on Friday announced it would gradually restore some normal operations in its main urban area – just one day after saying it would not follow other cities by relaxing measures ahead of schedule.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials in the southern hub of Guangzhou relaxed lockdowns in four districts and eased a quarantine requirement. And in Xinjiang’s Urumqi on Saturday, local officials said they would gradually ease lockdown measures in neighborhoods categorized as “low risk,” and moved to reopen essential businesses and public transport in a notice the following day.\n\nThe protests across the nation were sparked by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, where at least 10 people died, and videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims. They joined a list of deaths that have been widely linked in public conversation to Covid-19 controls.\n\nExperts say the real test of the country’s direction remains to be seen in the coming months.\n\nIf the vaccination push and other proposed measures bolstering medical readiness were “seriously implemented,” then China would have “a way forward for future opening,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “But so far they have not been prioritized in the implementation process.”\n\nAnother problem is the disconnect between Beijing’s policies and how they are implemented by local government officials, who are under pressure to control case numbers for fear of being removed from their posts – a regular punishment in the past for those who have allowed outbreaks to spread.\n\n“If you open up and you mess up, then there will be trouble,” Huang said. “You have to change the incentive structure of the local governments before any meaningful changes can be introduced.”\n\nThis article has been updated with new information.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/01/07/north-korea-says-tested-bomb-widespread-skepticism/78399234/", "title": "North Korea says it tested H-bomb to widespread skepticism", "text": "Foster Klug\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea — Soon after the ground shook around its nuclear testing facility, North Korea trumpeted its first hydrogen bomb test — a self-proclaimed “H-bomb of justice” that would mark a major and unanticipated advance for its still-limited nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday by the defiant, impoverished country was met with widespread skepticism, as well as a strong condemnation by the United Nations Security Council, which said it would begin work on a resolution for new international sanctions.\n\nNorth Korea’s fourth nuclear test likely pushed its scientists and engineers closer to their goal of building a warhead small enough to place on a missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. But South Korea’s spy agency thought the estimated explosive yield from the blast was much smaller than what even a failed hydrogen bomb detonation would produce, and the White House said its early analysis of underground activity “is not consistent” with the North’s claim of a successful H-bomb test.\n\nThere was a burst of jubilation and pride in Pyongyang. A North Korean TV anchor said the test of a “miniaturized” hydrogen bomb had been a “perfect success” that elevated the country’s “nuclear might to the next level.”\n\nA large crowd celebrated in front of the capital’s main train station as the announcement was read on a big video screen, with people applauding, cheering and recording the report on their mobile phones.\n\nNorth Korea’s government media called the test a self-defense measure against a potential U.S. attack. “The (country’s) access to H-bomb of justice, standing against the U.S., the chieftain of aggression …, is the legitimate right of a sovereign state for self-defense and a very just step no one can slander.”\n\nThere was high-level concern in Seoul and elsewhere. South Korean President Park Geun-hye ordered her military to bolster its combined defense posture with U.S. forces. She called the test a “grave provocation” and “an act that threatens our lives and future.” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, “We absolutely cannot allow this.”\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter spoke by phone with his South Korean counterpart Han Min-Koo, and they agreed that a North Korean nuclear test would be an “unacceptable and irresponsible provocation,” according to Carter’s spokesman, Peter Cook.\n\nCook said Carter reaffirmed the U.S. treaty commitment to defend South Korea, which he said includes “all aspects of the United States’ extended deterrence” — an allusion to a longstanding U.S. promise to defend South Korea with nuclear weapons if necessary.\n\nIn saying an early analysis by the U.S. was “not consistent with the claims that the regime has made of a successful hydrogen bomb test,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest added that nothing has happened in the last 24 hours to change Washington’s assessment of Pyongyang’s technical or military capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. is still doing the work needed to learn more about the North’s test, he added.\n\nWashington and nuclear experts have been skeptical of past North Korean claims about hydrogen bombs, which are much more powerful and much more difficult to make than atomic bombs. A confirmed test would further worsen already abysmal relations between Pyongyang and its neighbors and lead to a strong push for tougher sanctions.\n\nFollowing a closed-door, emergency session, the UN Security Council called the test “a clear violation” of the council’s resolutions.\n\n“Therefore a clear threat to international peace and security continues to exist,” the statement said.\n\nThe council said it would begin work immediately on a new sanctions resolution in light of “the gravity of this violation.”\n\nBefore the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the test as “profoundly destabilizing for regional security,” and demanded North Korea cease further nuclear activities and meet its obligations for “for verifiable denuclearization.”\n\nA successful H-bomb test would be a big advance in North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Fusion is the main principle behind the hydrogen bomb, which can be hundreds of times more powerful than atomic bombs that use fission. In a hydrogen bomb, radiation from a nuclear fission explosion sets off a fusion reaction responsible for a powerful blast and radioactivity.\n\nA South Korean lawmaker said the country’s spy agency told him in a briefing that Pyongyang may not have conducted a hydrogen bomb test given the relatively small size of the seismic wave reported.\n\nAn estimated explosive yield of 6.0 kilotons and a quake with a magnitude of 4.8 (the U.S. reported 5.1) were detected, lawmaker Lee Cheol Woo said he was told by the National Intelligence Service. That’s smaller than the estimated explosive yield of 7.9 kilotons and 4.9-magnitude quake reported after a 2013 nuclear test, he said, and only a fraction of the hundreds of kilotons that a successful H-bomb test would usually yield. Even a failed H-bomb detonation typically yields tens of kilotons, the NIS told Lee, who sits on the parliament’s intelligence committee.\n\nA miniaturized H-bomb can trigger a weak quake, but only the U.S. and Russia have such weapons, Lee cited the NIS as saying.\n\n“I’m pretty skeptical,” said Melissa Hanham, senior researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterey, California. “The seismic data indicates it would be very small for a hydrogen test.\n\n“It seems just too soon to have this big technical achievement,” she said. “But North Korea has always defied expectations.”\n\nWhile also noting the quake was likely too small for an H-bomb test, Jaiki Lee, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul’s Hanyang University, said the North could have experimented with a “boosted” hybrid bomb that uses some nuclear fusion fuel along with more conventional uranium or plutonium fuel.\n\nJoel Wit, founder of the North Korea-focused 38 North website, said a boosted bomb “is the most likely option,” while adding that he isn’t surprised that North Korea has shifted focus to hydrogen weaponry.\n\n“Every nuclear power essentially moves down the same track as they develop nuclear weapons,” he said. “And that track is miniaturization, but also increasing the yield of nuclear weapons. That’s what the Americans did; that’s what the Russians did.”\n\nThe announcement was greeted in Pyongyang with an expected rush of nationalistic pride and some bewilderment.\n\nKim Sok Chol, 32, told The Associated Press that he doesn’t know much about H-bombs, but added: “Since we have it, the U.S. will not attack us.”\n\nUniversity student Ri Sol Yong, 22, said, “If we didn’t have powerful nuclear weapons, we would already have been turned into the slaves of the U.S.”\n\nIt could be weeks before the true nature of the test is confirmed by outside experts — if they are able to do so at all.\n\nU.S. Air Force aircraft designed to detect the evidence of a nuclear test, such as radioactive particulate matter and blast-related noble gases, could be deployed from a U.S. base on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Japanese media said Tokyo mobilized its own reconnaissance aircraft for sorties over the Sea of Japan to try to collect atmospheric data.\n\nBut North Korea goes to great lengths to conceal its tests by conducting them underground and tightly sealing off tunnels or other vents through which radioactive residue could escape.\n\nFerenc Dalnoki-Veress, a physicist, scientist-in-residence and professor at the James Martin Center, said it may not be possible for the monitors to determine if the explosion was caused by a hydrogen bomb.\n\n“For that, you might need to have the particulates,” he said. “But maybe we’ll be lucky.”\n\nThe test was unexpected in part because North Korea’s last nuclear test was nearly three years ago and Kim Jong Un did not mention nuclear weapons in his annual New Year’s speech. Some outside analysts had speculated Kim was worried about deteriorating ties with China, the North’s last major ally, which has shown greater frustration at provocations and a possible willingness to allow stronger UN sanctions.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing “firmly opposes” Pyongyang’s purported test and is monitoring the environment on its border with North Korea near the test site.\n\nJust how big a threat North Korea’s nuclear program poses is a mystery. North Korea is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs and has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage, long-range missile to eventually carry smaller versions of those bombs.\n\nSome analysts say the North probably hasn’t achieved the technology needed to make a miniaturized warhead that could fit on a long-range missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. But debate is growing on just how far the North has advanced.\n\nNorth Korea needs fresh nuclear tests for practical military and political reasons. To build a credible nuclear program, the North must explode new and more advanced devices so scientists can improve their designs and technology. Nuclear-tipped missiles could then be used as deterrents and diplomatic bargaining chips against its enemies — and especially against the U.S., which Pyongyang has long pushed to withdraw its troops from the region and to sign a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War.\n\n“This is indeed a wakeup call,” said Lassina Zerbo, head of the Vienna-based UN Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which has a worldwide network of monitoring stations to detect nuclear tests. “I am convinced it will have repercussions on North Korea and international peace and stability.”\n\nAP Pyongyang Bureau Chief Eric Talmadge, Hyung-jin Kim and Kim Tong-hyung, Robert Burns and Josh Lederman, Edith M.

Feminists, meanwhile, point to the country’s widespread sexual violence, entrenched gender expectations, and low female representation in boardrooms and in politics as examples of how discrimination against women is still rife.\n\nFeminist protesters at a demonstration on February 27, 2022, in central Seoul.

He’s promising to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, which he claims is unfair to men, and raise the penalty for falsely reporting sex crimes. CNN approached Yoon’s office for comment on his gender policies but did not receive a response.\n\nMeanwhile, liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung of the incumbent Democratic Party has tried to strike a more balanced tone. He says discrimination against men is wrong – an apparent nod to the views of anti-feminist men – but has also promised to close the gender wage gap.\n\nThe ruling Democratic Party's presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung greets supporters on March 03.

JUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe rise of anti-feminists\n\nSince the brutal 2016 murder in Seoul’s trendy Gangnam neighborhood of a young woman targeted for her gender, South Korea has faced a reckoning over its attitudes toward women.\n\nActivists pushed to address sexual harassment and widespread discrimination and found an ally in outgoing President Moon Jae-In, who vowed to “become a feminist president” before he was elected in 2017.\n\nBut in the years since, some men say the needle has moved too far. Anti-feminists point to statistics showing women are now going to university at a higher rate than men and say that compulsory military service for men gives women an advantage in the jobs market. Some place South Korea’s demographic crisis, caused by slipping birth rates, squarely at the feet of feminists.\n\nWhile in other countries, anti-feminists might be discounted by politicians, in South Korea, these men have made themselves a powerful voter bloc.\n\nLast April, Moon’s Democratic Party lost mayoral elections in both Seoul and its second largest city Busan, with exit polls showing young men in their 20s had overwhelmingly shifted their vote to the conservative People Power Party.\n\nAnd in May the Korean marketing and research firm Hankook Research said a survey of 3,000 adults found that more than 77% of men in their 20s and more than 73% of men in their 30s were “repulsed by feminists or feminism.”\n\n“There is a sense of exclusion among men,” said the 36-year-old writer Park Se-hwan, who identifies as anti-feminist. “It’s now time for us to discuss men in South Korea who in comparison have been largely ignored.” Park says he agrees with gender equality but says this feeling of neglect has garnered “a general objection to feminism” among young men.\n\nPark Se-hwan identifies as anti-feminist. Yoonjung Seo/CNN\n\nAccording to Youngmi Kim, a senior lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Edinburgh, social polarization and a lack of employment opportunities for young people has led to men in their 20s and 30s becoming more conservative.\n\nOr, as Yun Ji-yeong, an associate professor in philosophy at Changwon National University, puts it: “Many people are realizing that the (country’s) scarce resources are being distributed very unequally.”\n\n“When they’re looking for the cause, they point the finger at the women who are in front of them.”\n\nThe struggle facing feminists\n\nTo women, the fraught debate over gender isn’t just leaving them feeling like a political punching bag – they say it’s also plastering over the real issues they’re facing.\n\nJust 15.6% of senior and managerial positions are held by women – significantly less than the US’s 42%. Less than 20% of legislators are women, again well below most OECD countries.

But it's out there and you can't see it, you can't smell it. There's no way [for consumers] to know whether [mercury] is in the creams or not because it's not on the labels.\"\n\nThe woman, whose name has been concealed in the report to protect her identity, was referred to Batdorff's team after she reported an array of symptoms to multiple doctors, ranging from insomnia and leg pain to muscle weakness, fatigue and, eventually, the loss of her peripheral vision. Clinical tests revealed elevated levels of mercury in her blood and urine.\n\nBatdorff explained that the most common symptoms she sees from potential mercury poisoning is tingling or numbness in a patient's hands or feet. She described the woman's loss of vision as \"a more extreme and permanent symptom.\"\n\n\"She will not recover her vision,\" Batdorff told CNN. \"So being a young woman that now has vision loss is really frightening and pretty concerning.\"\n\nThe toxicologist added that there are likely to be many more people out there who are being exposed to toxic levels of mercury and are not showing symptoms, or at least not yet.\n\nFollowing the referral, Batdorff and the MPCA visited the woman's house twice, about a year apart.\n\nOn the first visit she showed the team skin whitening beauty creams from abroad but said she was no longer using them. The agency found the amount of mercury in two of those products to be several thousand times higher than the permitted levels of 1 part per million (ppm) in cosmetics and urine tests revealed high levels of mercury in her body (23mcg/liter) -- but mercury was not noted as an ingredient on the products, according to the team.\n\nAt that time, the agency did not consider the levels of mercury in her home to be a concern, but over the course of a year, the mother had increasingly elevated levels of mercury in her body, the case report states.\n\nA second home visit in 2022 found that two new beauty products the woman had bought at a local market, one of which was not labelled as skin whitening but is known to be used for this, also contained high levels of mercury. The products found in her home were empty from use, but the MPCA team tested new unopened versions of the same product, finding extremely high levels of mercury of 11,000 and 18,000ppm.\n\n\"There are limited outlets for availability, and we have no reason or evidence to believe there would be any difference in the products,\" said John Gilkeson, Toxics Reduction Specialist at the MPCA, who tested the woman's home and has conducted three visits to the homes of people using skin whitening creams in recent years.\n\nNew urine tests confirmed that the mercury level in her body had risen to 46.6 micrograms/liter -- more than nine times the level considered normal (5 micrograms/liter)| -- and certain areas in her home now also contained elevated levels of mercury, putting her family at risk.\n\nBackground mercury levels below 200 nanograms per cubic meter (ng/m3) are not considered a concern, Gilkeson explained. But the children's bedrooms recorded levels of up to 400 ng/m3 and their towels read up to 600 mg/m3, according to the case report.\n\nLevels of up to 300 mg/m3 were found in the washing machine, where mercury likely accumulated as clothes worn by the mother were laundered, in turn contaminating other clothing and materials that go into the machine\n\nUrine tests on one of her children found that they now had elevated levels of mercury in their body, albeit much lower than their mother at 6.88 micrograms/liter.\n\nJUST WATCHED How mercury found in some beauty products can affect your health and expose your household.

Batdorff and other experts are calling for greater awareness, regular testing of products and stricter enforcement of regulations to help combat the problem.\n\nIn 2020, a health advisory was issued in Minnesota after a woman developed kidney damage, a rash and other symptoms including insomnia and depression following the use of skin whitening creams that again failed to disclose they contained mercury.\n\nA widespread issue\n\nScreening studies by the biomonitoring team within the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) in 2015 and 2019 also found elevated levels of mercury in the urine of multiple people who used skin whitening products, including pregnant women. Previously unpublished results from these studies shared exclusively with CNN show that follow-up home visits for some of these women revealed high levels of mercury vapor in the air -- particularly in their washing machines -- with readings as high as 1,800 and 2,000 ng/m3.\n\nLori Copan, Chief of the Exposure Prevention and Education Section at the California Department of Health reviewed the findings for the Minnesota mother and told CNN: \"[The case of this woman] unfortunately is similar to others we have seen in California, with a person experiencing symptoms for years without adequate recognition of potential mercury toxicity from a skin lightening product by health-care providers.\" She added that her team has seen around one hundred cases of toxicity from people using these creams, or their family members.\n\n\"Anyone using a skin lightening product that contains mercury, unfortunately, is going to put the whole household at risk,\" said Batdorff. \"There's no way to make sure that no contamination of the mercury will go to other household members. That's just not how mercury works.\"\n\n'The number one possible source of mercury exposure'\n\nMercury has long been used in skin whitening products due to its ability to block the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to skin. US Federal Drug Agency regulations and the Minamata Convention on Mercury -- an international treaty to protect human health and the environment from mercury -- limit the use of mercury in cosmetics, excluding those used around the eye area, to 1mg/kg of mercury, also known as 1 part per million (ppm).\n\nThe products found in the woman's home ranged from 4590ppm to 18,000ppm.\n\nAt high levels, the inorganic mercury typically found in these products is extremely toxic. Chronic exposure can lead to kidney and liver damage, as well as neurological damage including personality changes, anxiety, depression, early childhood development issues and, as seemingly shown in this case, vision loss.\n\n\"With inorganic mercury it's that chronic long-term exposure that concerns me the most,\" said Batdorff. \"It's more subtle but ends up building up in our system and is hard to eliminate, especially when it gets into the brain ... and once mercury has crossed over into the brain and our nervous system, it can cause a lot of different side effects.\"\n\nFor Batdorff and other experts, finding people early and removing the sources of mercury before they cause permanent damage is crucial.\n\n\"When we're thinking about exposures in pregnant women, women of childbearing age and babies and children, you know, we don't want people in those groups to be having higher mercury exposure,\" said Jessica Nelson, Program Director for the Minnesota Biomonitoring program within MDH, who led the 2015 and 2019 studies.\n\n\"We need to be sure women know that products can have mercury in them. And we need to focus on women who speak languages other than English and different ways of sharing the information, ideally through community partners.\"\n\nSkin whitening: Toxic ingredients Steroids\n\nHydroquinone\n\nMercury Three ingredients dominate the harmful skin whitening products used worldwide. Steroids\n\nHydroquinone\n\nMercury Topical steroids are used to treat a range of skin conditions, including psoriasis and eczema, due to the drugs' anti-inflammatory effects. Skin whitening is a potential side effect, which has led to topical steroid misuse. The long-term use of steroids, or use without monitoring by a doctor, can lead to various side effects, such as rashes, pustules, hair growth on the skin, and infections. The over-the-counter sale of potent corticosteroids is banned in many countries and territories worldwide, including the US, the UK, India and Hong Kong. Hydroquinone is used to treat pigment disorders by reducing levels of melanin in the skin.

The US FDA recognizes that hydroquinone may be a carcinogen. Potential health harms include dermatitis, darkening of the skin, neurological problems, fetal growth retardation and possibly cancer.

Mercury salts block the production of melanin, leading to a lighter skin tone. Mercury is found in both inorganic and organic forms in cosmetics. The Minamata Convention on Mercury established a limit of 1 mg/kg (1 ppm) for cosmetics, including skin whitening products. Products tested in a variety of countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and North America have contained up to 40,000 parts per million (ppm) of mercury.

The aim was to inform people, including shop owners and customers, about the risks of mercury found in many skin whitening and other beauty products as well as to test the wide range of items sold across the malls to help identify the products posing the most risk, and their countries of origin.\n\nThe team spoke with more than 200 vendors and customers and disposed of around 900 products containing high levels of mercury -- many of which were manufactured in Pakistan -- over the three months that the program ran, said Fatou Barry, program assistant on the project, who visited the mall almost daily during this time.\n\nBarry said most vendors had no awareness of the products containing harmful ingredients like mercury and were \"shocked\" when they realized the risk to their community. Many others, however, closed their stores when they learned city officials were visiting, Barry said.\n\nIn a reflection paper describing the strategy and impact of her team's efforts, Barry wrote that the biggest taken away from the whole experience was how important it was to keep showing up and engaging with the community. \"Passively sending or posting flyers wasn't nearly as effective as coming in and going [from] vendor to vendor,\" she wrote.\n\nSkin whitening: The culture US Skin color preferences go back to slavery, when lighter-skinned people who were enslaved were likely to be related to their master and favored to work indoors, while darker-skinned people were sent to the fields.

The community outreach and engagement,\" she outlined. \"They all need different voices at the table about how to do that best and most effectively.\"\n\nIn addition to these approaches, Adawe stressed the need for better enforcement of regulations. \"The products are widely available in ethnic malls like Karmel and the state has not actively regulated these products,\" she said. \"I visited [a few months ago] to check if the products we tested that contained mercury are still available...and saw all the mercury containing skin-lightening products displayed on the shelves.\"\n\nThe MPCA is responsible for enforcing regulations on these products in the state, and issuing penalties. In response to Adawe's concerns, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN that the MPCA \"prioritizes education and outreach efforts to help vendors identify and remove products from shelves and will take enforcement actions when appropriate.\"\n\nThey added that \"skin-lightening creams present a unique challenge because their labeling doesn't often list mercury as an ingredient and each product must be tested to determine if mercury is present above the regulatory limit.\"\n\nTo further increase knowledge among affected communities, MDH has an awareness and education grant of up to $200,000 to fund various community organizations, NGOs and city health departments working in this space, including Adawe's.\n\n\"Through Beautywell we do training for health care providers and public health workers to understand about colorism, skin-lightening practice and ways they can identify the health impact of this practice,\" explained Adawe. \"The use of skin-lightening products in the Somali community is high and so we need to continue do health education in this community and teach women to embrace their skin color.\"\n\n----\n\nWant to know more about which products contain mercury?\n\nIf you would like to find out more about skin whitening and beauty products that may contain mercury, these reports and public health lists identify a wide range available worldwide.\n\nThe Zero Mercury Working Group has also created an online database of products known to contain mercury.\n\n----\n\nCredits:\n\nEditors: Eliza Anyangwe, Lucy Benson\n\nDesign: Tiffany Baker, Tal Yellin, Will Mullery\n\nVideo: Elisa Solinas, Agne Jurkenaite, Ladan Anoushfar", "authors": ["Meera Senthilingam"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy", "title": "AI won an art contest, and artists are furious | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nJason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.\n\nIn August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image, titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.\n\n“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,” Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.\n\nIn August, Jason M. Allen's piece \"Théâtre D'opéra Spatial\" — which he created with AI image generator Midjourney — won first place in the emerging artist division's \"digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography\" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen\n\nAllen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.\n\nThe definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.\n\nMidjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nThe newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.\n\nThis came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.\n\n“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\n“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”\n\nYet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.\n\n“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.\n\nYou can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.\n\nFirst, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.\n\nAllen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.\n\n“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,” Allen said.\n\nCal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a “beautiful piece”.\n\n“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,” he said.\n\nAllen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}]}

Blue moon refers to the second full moon in a single calendar month. January's first full moon occurred Jan. 1.\n\nInstead, the moon will appear deep red from the total lunar eclipse, otherwise known as \"blood moons.\" As the sun, Earth and moon line up, the Earth casts a shadow on the moon causing its red tinge.\n\nThe \"super\" comes into play since the full moon is at the closest point of its orbit to the Earth, or its perigee, Wednesday morning.\n\nThat makes the moon look extra close and bright — up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a full moon at its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA.\n\nHow rare is this?\n\nThe last time a total lunar eclipse coincided with a blue moon in the United States was in March 1866 — less than a year after the Civil War ended and more than 150 years ago.\n\nA blue moon occurs once every two-and-a-half years, and this is the first total lunar eclipse to occur in the United State since 2015. Supermoons usually occur three or four times each year.\n\n\"These three lunar events separately are not uncommon, but it is rare for all three to occur at the same time,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist and astronomy blogger Brian Lada.\n\nWhen is the best time to see it?\n\nThe reddish color of the moon will appear during the total lunar eclipse, which will only be visible across the western U.S. The total eclipse will last from 4:51 a.m. PT to 6:08 a.m. PT. In the Eastern Time Zone, the moon will have set before it the eclipse occurs. So, the farther west you live, the more of the eclipse you'll see.\n\nWhere is the best place to see it?\n\nThe best view of the lunar eclipse 2018 in the United States will be along the West Coast.\n\nThe best chance of seeing the Super Blue Blood Moon is in an area with a clear view of the western horizon, preferably high up.\n\nWill I actually be able to see it?\n\nWhile the moon will be full precisely at 8:37 ET Wednesday morning, it'll still be plenty big through the rest of the night and for the next night or two. Just as it has for billions of years, the full moon will be visible to everyone around the world, barring pesky clouds.\n\nIf you don't feel like going outside to watch the eclipse or if there's too much cloud cover where you live, NASA is hosting a live stream of the celestial event on NASA TV and at www.nasa.gov beginning at 5:30 a.m. ET.\n\nWeather permitting, the broadcast will feature views from telescopes at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, Calif.; Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles; and the University of Arizona’s Mount.

And unlike the rare total solar eclipse that carved a path of totality across only a portion of states in 2024, this month's lunar eclipse will be viewable in all of the lower 48 states.\n\nHere's what to know about the upcoming total lunar eclipse.\n\nWhat is a total lunar eclipse?\n\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth is positioned exactly between the moon and sun. The Earth casts a shadow on the surface of the moon, dimming it.\n\nThe moon doesn't produce its own light. It shines because its surface reflects the sun's rays. So when the Earth blocks the sun, a lunar eclipse occurs.\n\nDuring a total lunar eclipse, some sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere and then hits the moon's surface. Because these longer wavelengths make it through the atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths have scattered away, making the moon appear orange or red, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in the Earth's atmosphere, the redder the moon.\n\nLunar eclipse 2025: What makes the celestial event different from a solar eclipse?\n\nWhat does a total lunar eclipse look like?\n\nDuring a total lunar eclipse, the moon isn't reflecting sunlight, so from Earth, it appears dimmer. The dim moon appear reddish orange for a few hours.\n\nHow long does a total lunar eclipse last?\n\nTotal lunar eclipses last a few hours. The lunar eclipse next week is expected to last more than three and a half hours, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nWhat's the best way to view a total lunar eclipse?\n\nWhile special equipment isn't necessary to take in a total lunar eclipse, telescopes and binoculars can enhance the viewing experience. Regardless, a dark spot, away from light pollution and trees, is best.\n\nAre total lunar eclipses rare?\n\nTotal lunar eclipses aren't considered rare, as they occur about every two-and-a-half years, according to Astronomy, an outer space magazine.\n\nWhat is the next total lunar eclipse?\n\nThe next total lunar eclipse visible in the U.S. is predicted for March 3, 2026, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is the different between a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse?\n\nDuring a lunar eclipse, the Earth is positioned between the sun and moon. During a solar eclipse, the moon comes between the sun and Earth, blocking the sun's light from reaching Earth.\n\n(This story was updated to fix a typo.)\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, USA TODAY\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

It will be the first on Earth since 2022.\n\nHow to watch the total lunar eclipse?\n\nLunar eclipses happen when Earth is between the sun and a full moon. During the event, the moon moves through Earth's umbra, the dark center of its shadow, according to Space.com.\n\nUnlike a solar eclipse, it is safe to look at the entire lunar eclipse which can last for hours.\n\nThe eclipse will last approximately six hours, occurring between 11:57 pm and 6 a.m., with the best view of totality happening between 2:26 a.m. and 3:31 a.m.\n\nFor approximately 65 minutes during this total lunar eclipse, there will appear the blood moon.\n\nWhat is a blood moon?\n\nThe blood moon is a trick of the light, when the typical whitish looking moon becomes red or ruddy brown. It happens when the moon is fully in Earth's shadow and a little bit of light from Earth's sunrises and sunsets falls on the surface of moon, making it appear red.\n\nWhy is it called a worm moon?\n\nThe March moon is also called the worm moon, referencing the time and season when the soil begins to warm and the first signs of life return, such as earthworms, beetle larvae and grubs from their winter slumber. These invertebrates are also among the first food sources for birds and other animals coming out of hibernation in the spring.\n\nWhat is the Ides of March?\n\nThe Ides of March is Saturday, March 15, 2025.\n\nThe Ides are one of three monthly occurrences, according to the Roman calendar, including the Kalends and the Nones. These days also marked specific moon phases. The Kelands always falls on the first day of the month and represented the new moon. The Nones occurs on the 5th or 7th depending on if it has 30 or 31 days and represented the first quarter moon. The Ides falls on the 13th or 15th and represented the full moon.\n\nThe Ides of March represented the beginning of a new year with the appearance of the first full moon of the 'Roman calendar year' before January and February were eventually added, according to the Almanac.\n\nBut the famous stigma of bad luck and doom behind March 15th lays with the assassination of Roman Emperor Julius Caesar in 44 BC. Also made famous in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar tragedy, a soothsayer warned Caesar — \"Beware the ides of March\" — the omen before his misfortune with betrayal and death.\n\nWhen is the first day of Spring 2025?\n\nThe first day of the spring equinox falls on Thursday, March 20, 2025 at 5:01 a.m. Eastern.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/01/24/full-moon-calendar-2024-astronomy-supermoon/72087293007/", "title": "Full moons in 2024: Jan. 25 will start off the year with the first", "text": "The first full moon of 2024 will rise on Jan. 25 at 12:54 p.m. EST. Traditionally known as the Wolf Moon because of a greater chance of hearing wolves howling during that time, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\nEver since the first humans looked up at the sky and saw the gray, cratered surface of the moon, legends have been fueled by it. There are stories about a mysterious \"man in the moon\" since some witnesses claimed to have seen a person's face among the craters. Other observers compared the craters to cheese and imagined a whole sphere composed of mouthwatering dairy goods.\n\nToday, we know a lot more about Earth's natural satellite.\n\nPhases of the moon\n\nThe moon takes about 30 days to orbit the Earth, which is called a lunar cycle. Each lunar cycle is divided into eight phases based on the moon's position relative to the sun.\n\nUnable to view our graphics?

The days will get longer because more light is shed on Earth up until the summer solstice.\n\nThe summer solstice happens around June 20-21 and sees the most daytime of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. After that, the days will become shorter until the winter solstice on Dec. 21 or 22, when there’s the least daylight of the year.\n\nUpcoming dates for full moons in 2024, (times in EDT), according to NASA:\n\nWhat is the moon made of?\n\nThe lunar surface is composed of 43% oxygen, 20% silicon, 19% magnesium, 10% iron, 3% calcium, 3% aluminum, 0.42% chromium, 0.18% titanium, and 0.12% manganese by weight.\n\nThere are traces of water that may have come from deep beneath the surface and have been found by orbiting spacecraft, according to Space.com.\n\nThe moon has a thick, metallic core. Most of its core is made of iron, with a small amount of nickel. Compared with other terrestrial worlds (like Earth), whose cores are closer to 50% of their diameters, the moon's core is fairly modest, at roughly 20% of its diameter.\n\nHow big is the moon? Its radius is 1,079.6 miles. The moon's width is less than one-third of Earth's, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is a supermoon?\n\nWhen the moon’s orbit brings it closer to Earth than usual, the cosmic combo is called a supermoon. A supermoon occurs when the moon’s orbit is closest to Earth at the same time the moon is full.\n\nThis happens when the full moon falls at perigee – its closest point to Earth in its orbit. Perigee is when the moon is 221,519 miles from Earth and appears bigger and brighter than a normal full moon.\n\nWhen the moon reaches apogee, it’s at its farthest from Earth, a distance of 252,712 miles. If a full moon occurs while the moon is at apogee, it is called a micromoon.\n\nWe'll see four supermoons this year. Starting off with a special seasonal blue moon on Aug. 19, which will be the last blue moon until May 20, 2027. The other full supermoons will occur on Sept. 18, Oct. 17 and Nov. 15, according to EarthSky.org.\n\nWhat is a blood moon?\n\nA blood moon occurs during a total lunar eclipse, which is when the Earth lines up between the moon and the sun. The eclipse blocks direct sunlight to the moon, so the only light it gets passes through the Earth’s atmosphere, which filters out most of the sunlight’s colors, except for red. The atmosphere refracts, or bends, the reddish light toward the moon, which reflects it with a red glow.\n\nThe last blood moon occurred in November 2022, and the next one won't occur until March 2025, according to Space.com.\n\nNames of full moons\n\nThe etymology behind the word “lunatic,” a synonym for mentally ill, comes from the Latin root of luna, which means moon. People as far back as 400 B.C. noticed that the lunar cycle affected people's mental states.\n\nThe gravitational force of the moon causes many visible changes on Earth, affecting the ocean’s tides, animals’ migration habits and humans’ ability to sleep. Full moons have been heralded to have the most influence.\n\nThe Old Farmer’s Almanac, a reference book published since the 18th century, named the full moons for those used by Native American, colonial American and European sources, so their meanings derive from characteristics of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn Christianity, the full moon that appears before the spring equinox is known as the lenten moon, marking the last full moon of winter. The full moon that appears after the equinox is known as the paschal moon to mark the first full moon of spring. The paschal moon determines the date of Easter every year.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice and Ashley R.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has spied clouds on one of the solar system’s most intriguing moons.\n\nIn November, the space observatory turned its infrared gaze on Saturn’s largest moon, Titan. It’s the only moon in our solar system that has a dense atmosphere — four times denser than Earth’s.\n\nTitan’s atmosphere is made of nitrogen and methane, which gives it a fuzzy, orange appearance. This thick haze obscures visible light from reflecting off the moon’s surface, making it difficult to discern features.\n\nThe Webb telescope observes the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye — on November 5, the telescope spotted a bright cloud in Titan’s northern hemisphere and, soon after, detected a second cloud in the atmosphere.\n\nThe larger cloud was located over Titan’s northern polar region near Kraken Mare, the largest known liquid sea of methane on the moon’s surface.\n\nTitan has Earth-like liquid bodies on its surface, but its rivers, lakes and seas are made of liquid ethane and methane, which form clouds and cause rain from the sky. Researchers also believe Titan has an internal liquid water ocean.\n\nThe Webb telescope's instruments captured these views of Titan. Clouds and other features are labeled, including a methane sea called Kraken Mare, the sand dunes of Belet and a bright spot called Adiri. NASA/ESA/CSA\n\n“Detecting clouds is exciting because it validates long-held predictions from computer models about Titan’s climate, that clouds would form readily in the mid-northern hemisphere during its late summertime when the surface is warmed by the Sun,” cowrote Conor Nixon, a planetary scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, on NASA’s Webb blog.\n\nNixon is also the principal investigator on the Webb observation program for Titan.\n\nThe team of astronomers studying the Webb observations reached out to colleagues at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to see if follow-up observations could reveal if the clouds were moving or changing shape.\n\n“We were concerned that the clouds would be gone when we looked at Titan two days later with Keck, but to our delight there were clouds at the same positions, looking like they had changed in shape,” said Imke de Pater, emeritus professor of astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, and lead of the Keck Titan Observing Team, in a statement.\n\nAstronomers compared Webb (left) and Keck images of Titan to see how clouds evolved. Cloud A seems to be rotating, while Cloud B seems to be dissipating. NASA/ESA/CSA\n\nAtmospheric modeling experts helped the team determine that the two telescopes had captured observations of seasonal weather patterns on Titan.\n\nWebb’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument was also able to collect data on Titan’s lower atmosphere, which can’t be seen by ground-based observatories such as Keck due to interference from Earth’s atmosphere, in different wavelengths of infrared light.\n\nThe data, which is still being analyzed, was able to see deeper into Titan’s atmosphere and surface than the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn and its moons for 13 years. Webb’s observations could also reveal the cause of a bright feature over Titan’s south pole.\n\nThe cloud observations were a long time coming.\n\n“We had waited for years to use Webb’s infrared vision to study Titan’s atmosphere, including its fascinating weather patterns and gaseous composition, and also see through the haze to study albedo features on the surface,” Nixon said, referring to the bright and dark patches.\n\n“Titan’s atmosphere is incredibly interesting, not only due to its methane clouds and storms, but also because of what it can tell us about Titan’s past and future — including whether it always had an atmosphere. We were absolutely delighted with the initial results.”\n\nThe team is planning more observations of Titan in June that may provide additional information about the gases in its atmosphere.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/08/total-solar-eclipse-2024-forecast-updates/72869293007/", "title": "Solar eclipse: See video and photos of the sky spectacle", "text": "EAGLE PASS, Texas − In a moment of cosmic alignment that was precisely predicted yet undeniably mysterious, the moon crept across the face of the sun as seen from Earth, casting its shadow onto the United States on Monday.\n\nAnd then it was over: A total eclipse of the sun has come and gone.\n\nThe partial shadow crossed into the U.S. in Texas just after noon local time, and a bit more than an hour later, the minutes of “totality” began. The total eclipse of the sun then traced a path from southern Texas to northern Maine, where it exited into Canada and the ocean beyond.\n\nThe rare event was an astronomical experience like no other. Monday's eclipse was unusually accessible to millions of people. It was widely anticipated not only for its remarkable period of darkness, but for its rare timing: No total solar eclipse would be visible from the contiguous United States again until 2044. While millions of Americans may have seen today’s eclipse, a small group in Texas was among the very first.\n\nEdge of eclipse shadow began in south Texas\n\nAlejandra Martinez, a seventh-grade science teacher from the south Texas border city of Eagle Pass, peered up at the gray, gauzy sky, anxiously awaiting the solar eclipse’s entrance into the USA.\n\nSitting with a telescope under a camping canopy in a corner of the county airport, Martinez, 42, and two other science enthusiasts had been recruited by NASA to participate in an effort called Citizen CATE 2024, where more than 30 teams perched in the eclipse’s path will record the shadowy trek across the country.\n\nIn this spot, less than five miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, she and her team would be among the first people in the U.S. to witness the phenomenon. Eagle Pass sits near the very beginning of the eclipse’s track from southwest to northeast across the country. It also sits very near dead-center of it, where the period of “totality” will be the longest. That total shadow was still more than an hour away when the edge of the shadow began to darken the sky.\n\nMartinez, dressed in a “This Totality Rocks” T-shirt and eclipse-themed skirt, watched as the penumbra crept across the airfield, about 10 minutes past noon local time. She put on her eclipse glasses and peered up at the sky. The gauzy clouds parted. “There it is! There it is!” she yelled. “First contact. It’s begun!”\n\nClouds came and went as the shadow grew for the next hour. As totality approached Eagle Pass, the sky shaded a dull gray then a heavy brown and the temperature dropped a few degrees. Only a sliver of the sun remained.\n\nA few seconds before 1:27 p.m. CT, the crowd counted down, “3..2..1…” The sun was gone, completely covered by the moon. Darkness spread over the small airport grounds. “Oh my god,” Martinez said, a hand covering her heart. “This is so cool!”\n\nHow to tell if you have eye damage from looking at a partial eclipse?\n\nFor those who took a chance and looked at the sun without protective eyewear during the eclipse, concerns may arise if their vision starts to seem impaired. Have they suffered eclipse blindness?\n\nLooking directly at the sun even briefly without the proper safety glasses can result in eye damage, either temporary or permanent. The body's natural squinting reaction in normal circumstances prevents people from staring directly at the sun, but that reflex may not be activated during partial eclipses, even though a partly shielded sun can still burn the retina.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology says pain won't be an indication of damaged eyes because the retina lacks pain nerves. Worrisome signs are instead blurry vision, headaches, light sensitivity, blind spots in the central vision, distorted vision and changes in color perception. Anyone experiencing those symptoms should see an ophthalmologist, the AAO says.\n\nWhat was the timeline of the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThe total eclipse began in Mexico at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, Monday before crossing into Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. It ended in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT. Even those who weren't in the path of totality could see a percentage of the eclipse.\n\nTo find out exactly when the eclipse occurred in your area, you can search by USA TODAY's database by ZIP code for a viewing guide.\n\nStudents in Washington get hands-on learning\n\nDozens of students spilled out of Ida B. Wells Middle School in Washington, D.C., gripping cardboard solar eclipse glasses and chatting with excitement. “Why is the sun shaped as a moon?” one student asked after looking toward the sun. “Why is it not getting dark?’’ asked another.\n\nTeacher Troy Mangum, who the students called “Mr. Mango,’’ slowly explained the science behind the experience as he cautioned others to put on their glasses. Students at the school in northwest D.C. had had lessons about the eclipse leading up the day’s teaching outside the classroom.\n\n“Anytime we can get hands on or dynamic learning … it’s invaluable,’’ said Mangum, a social emotional learning coach. “We talked about it so much. It’s nice to see them get excited about qeeky Mr. Mango type of stuff.”\n\nSkylar Cruel, 12, had come outside with her science class. “I just really wanted to see it,’’ she said. “You get to see it turn from light to dark.”\n\nSteps away at Whittier Elementary School, which focuses on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), younger students put on their glasses and tilted their heads up toward the sun behind their school.\n\nMichael Haile joined his daughter, Markan Worku, 9, a student at Whittier, and brought along his 5-year-old son, Keab. He called it a memorable experience for his children. Markan, who had been learning about solar eclipses in her third-grade class, simply said, “This is cool!’’\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nIn Michigan, a bonding experience for a mother and her three kids\n\nIn Michigan, eclipse enthusiasts packed a watch party along the Detroit Riverwalk near Cullen Plaza. They sat on the grass, on benches and berms. For Janelle Ikonen of Waterford, it was a chance to bond with her three children − Hannah, 9; Elim, 12; and Isaac, 14 − whom she took out of school for the day.\n\n“I wanted to experience a unique event with them,” said Ikonen, 47. “It’s one of my big deals to me, to experience things with my kids. … I hope they’ll remember spending time with me.”\n\nIn Grand Rapids, where 94% coverage of the sun was expected, viewers gathered on the city's “Blue Bridge,” which offered a view of the eclipse over the Grand River. With no cloud cover over the city, visitors had an unobstructed scene. The Grand Rapids Public Museum set up a series of solar telescopes.\n\nJill and Wes Johnson, 50 and 14, were among those awaiting max coverage. They’d considered traveling from Grand Rapids to a place with total coverage, but decided 94% coverage was worthwhile enough to stay home.\n\n“I think people are excited to see something unique,” Jill Johnson said.\n\n− Georgea Kovanis and Arpan Lobo, Detroit Free Press\n\nUS women's soccer team takes in eclipse ahead of title game\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio − The U.S. women’s national soccer team took a break from SheBelieves Cup preparation to watch the eclipse.\n\nSeveral team members, including World Cup veterans Crystal Dunn, Alyssa Naeher, Naomi Girma and Trinity Rodman, coaches and staff members donned eclipse glasses and went outside their hotel to see the rare event.\n\nAs the sky darkened and the moon moved in front of the sun, someone yelled, “Come on, keep going!” Columbus is just outside the path of totality, so all but a sliver of the sun wound up being covered.\n\nThe USWNT is in Columbus for the final of the SheBelieves Cup on Tuesday night against Canada.\n\n− Nancy Armour\n\nWitnessing the first total eclipse from a cruise ship\n\nPassengers aboard Holland America's Koningsdam cruise ship eagerly gathered on the top decks at 10 a.m. local time to watch the spectacle of a solar eclipse.\n\nPositioned off the coast of Mazatlan, Mexico − the first city in North America to witness the total eclipse − the ship provided an ideal vantage point for viewing the celestial event. Accompanied by an astronomer, the captain meticulously adjusted the ship's position to ensure the best possible view.\n\nDan Fueller, an experienced eclipse observer who had previously seen similar phenomena from ships in 1991 and 1998, emphasized the advantages of viewing the eclipse from a cruise ship. He noted the flexibility of the ship's mobility allowed for optimal positioning along the eclipse's path, ensuring unobstructed views.\n\n\"You're on a cruise ship and (the best view) is a little bit farther to the west or a little bit farther to the east − along the path, there's a clear sky − the ship can move. If you're on land and there's not a road there, you better have a tank.\"\n\n− Joshuan Rivera\n\nPartial eclipse 'like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun'\n\nIn Parthenon, Arkansas, the eclipse began near the Buffalo National River. Five friends traveled from Florida to be on a rock outcropping to witness the celestial event.\n\n“Yes! I see it!” Angie Printiss exclaimed.\n\n“Oh ya! You can see it,” said Kate Estes. “It’s like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun.”\n\nAt 20 minutes before totality, the sky got noticeably darker. The shadow of crescent sun shapes played off the limestone rocks.\n\n“It looks like water − like fish scales,” Estes said. “That is so weird, when the trees move you can really see it.”\n\n− Jennifer Portman\n\nNew Englanders travel for better view of the eclipse\n\nCrowds ballooned into the thousands midday Monday in the center of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, as the nearly cloudless sky and warm sun boosted temperatures to an unseasonably 60 degrees.\n\nJim and Kim Cooper drove over from New Hampton, New Hampshire, their first time doing more than just passing through the town locals call St. Jays. Their son had proposed to his girlfriend in Tennessee during the 2017 eclipse and then had an eclipse-themed wedding, but the Coopers had never seen a total eclipse for themselves, so they decided to come to the closest place where they could be assured of a good view.\n\nJeffrey Breau had seen that 2017 eclipse for himself and was so impressed that he convinced family members to join him this time. Breau’s girlfriend, Nell Hawley, came up with him from Cambridge, Massachusetts, while his brother Alex and his girlfriend Diana Ventura drove up from New York City. The Breau brothers' father, Walter, joined them in taking in their first eclipse.\n\n“I would have been OK watching it in the yard,” Walter said, though he would only have seen a partial eclipse from there. “That’s what you think now,” Jeffrey said quickly. “Talk to me in two hours.”\n\n− Karen Weintraub\n\nKids bring homemade eclipse viewers to National Mall\n\nLucas and Lucy Porto Banco didn’t need to buy fancy eclipse glasses – the 7- and 10-year-old siblings made their own eclipse viewers from two cardboard shoe boxes left over from a couple of their mom’s recent shoe purchases.With the help of a YouTube tutorial video, they made two holes in each box with a whittling knife and taped tin foil over. Then they used dry spaghetti to poke holes in the tin foil for the sun’s light to pass through and project onto the dark inside of the box.The kids put together the viewer in little more than five minutes, Lucy said. “Maybe 15, with covering all the gaps in the shoe box,” she said.Even with his own eclipse-viewing creation, Lucas said he may still take advantage of his eclipse glasses. “I’m going to do both,” he said.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat is an 'umbra?' − and other eclipse words\n\nAstronomers and eclipse enthusiasts used a bunch of specialized words Monday as the nation experienced its first solar eclipse since 2017 and the last one for until 2044. Here are a few of those terms and what they mean, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nBaily's Beads – This refers to the beaded appearance of the moon's edge as the eclipse nears totality. Shafts of sunlight shine through deep valleys on the moon's surface, which causes the effect known to observers as Bailey's Beads.\n\nUmbra – The darkest part of the moon’s shadow, within which the entirety of the sun's bright face is blocked. An observer standing in the umbra sees a total solar eclipse.\n\nPenumbra: The lighter part of the moon's shadow, making up its outer portion, where light can reach.\n\nCorona – The sun’s upper atmosphere, visible as a pearly glow around the eclipsed sun during totality.\n\nTotality – The maximum phase of a total solar eclipse, during which the moon’s disk completely covers the sun's bright face. It can last from a fraction of a second to a maximum of 7 minutes, 31 seconds, depending on viewing location and other factors.\n\n− Dale Denwalt, The Oklahoman\n\nA last-minute search for glasses for 'a perfect spot'\n\nPatsy Faoro walked toward a half dozen people gathered at the gate of Turner Farm Park in Great Falls, Virginia. The people were awaiting the opening of an eclipse viewing event complete with telescopes and educational presentations.\n\nFaoro, who lives near the park in this upscale Northern Virginia neighborhood, just wanted glasses to safely view the eclipse.\n\nShe visited CVS, Safeway and a 7/11 convenience store, all of which had advertised the availability of glasses to view the eclipse. None of the retailers had any glasses remaining when Faoro checked this morning.\n\n“We have this great big open space that’s a perfect spot,” said Faoro, who viewed her first eclipse in the 1970s. “We just need some glasses.”\n\n− Ken Alltucker\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway event draws tens of thousands\n\nTory Patrick, 41, is hoping to give her four children a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity. Patrick and her family traveled 160 miles to Indianapolis Motor Speedway from their home in Granger, Indiana. They were expected to have 97% totality at home, but it’s not the same as total coverage, she said.\n\n“They will be getting the full experience that they can’t read about in textbooks,” Patrick said.\n\nPatrick and her sister Cally Gannon, 39, from Cincinnati, met in Indianapolis to view the eclipse from the speedway. They camped outside IMS over the weekend ahead of the event and on Sunday afternoon saw a double rainbow over the speedway’s iconic pagoda. An estimated 50,000 tickets were sold for the day’s festivities, presented in partnership with NASA and Purdue University.\n\nElsewhere in the stands, Ryan Harper, 30, knows today is special.\n\n“We’re right in totality,” he said. “This sometimes doesn’t happen in people’s lifetimes.\n\n— Sarah Bowman and Jade Thomas\n\nFamily travels from Baltimore to Rochester, N.Y., to view the eclipse\n\nWhen Maze Pelham of Baltimore was a fifth-grader, he watched news of the 2017 solar eclipse and vowed to witness the next notable solar eclipse. That eclipse, and that day, has come. And this is why he and his parents, Janice and Sonney Pelham, left Maryland around 1 a.m. on Monday and drove nearly seven hours to Rochester, New York.\n\n“I said to myself I would go to the next one,” Maze Pelham said while seated with his parents on lawn chairs at downtown Rochester’s Parcel 5 park, where he and hundreds of others are awaiting a view of the full eclipse. “It’s a promise I made to myself.”\n\n– Democrat and Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network\n\nIn Brooklyn: Eclipses glasses, check. Lawn chair, check.\n\nRalph Emerson held a pair of paper sunglasses in his hands while riding the subway to Brooklyn's sprawling Prospect Park on Monday. He exited the train with a folded lawn chair strapped across his shoulder, and said he felt energized and full of anticipation.\n\n\"This is special,\" Emerson, 61, said. \"I haven't woken up with this much excitement since the Super Bowl.\"\n\nWalking to the park's botanic garden, Emerson said appreciating natural phenomena makes it easier to manage the stresses that come with living in a big city. Also like a big sports game, the eclipse will draw lots of people together to experience something much larger than themselves, in community, he said.\n\n\"A lot of times it's tragedies that bring us together, but sometimes things like this do,\" he said.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nTexas Eclipse Festival cut short by weather\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival was canceled Monday in Burnet County, 50 miles northwest of Austin, because of weather concerns. The festival, which included bands and other events, began Sunday and was supposed to wrap up Tuesday.\n\n\"We regret to inform you of the severe weather forecast, including risks of high winds, tornadic activity, large hail, and thunderstorms for later today, including during the eclipse, Tuesday, and Wednesday,\" festival organizers said on their website. \"Your safety is our top priority.\"\n\nFestivalgoers were urged to leave early for safety and to beat traffic. Guests, however, were allowed to stay \"provided they pack and are prepared to depart after totality.\"\n\nTraffic jams, collisions mar eclipse watchers' travel\n\nTraffic crashes and road delays were reported across the nation as Americans flocked to prime locations to gaze up at the rare solar eclipse. Local roads and highways in states including Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Vermont and New Hampshire were overwhelmed with eclipse chasers, many of whom were from out of state. The most intense bottlenecks appeared to be in the path of totality, where spectators will be able to view the full eclipse.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a crash around 7:30 a.m. local time narrowed eastbound lanes on I-40, a major transcontinental highway that runs from California to North Carolina. The crash occurred not far from several state parks that were hosting eclipse events, and it's also within driving distance of the full eclipse path, which includes parts of southeastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nMultiple crashes were reported on an interstate in Waco, Texas, a city in the path of totality, where several festivities and eclipse viewing events were scheduled. The crashes all occurred on I-35, which runs from southern Texas to Minnesota.\n\n\"Expect major traffic delays in this area,\" the Texas Department of Transportation said in a statement.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nAirport draws a crowd of jets for eclipse\n\nEAGLE PASS, Texas − Maverick County International Airport in Eagle Pass, Texas, usually sees maybe three private planes a day. By 10 a.m. CT on Monday, more than 10 planes crowded the tarmac, including Cessnas, Pipers and at least one corporate jet − all there to catch an early glimpse of the total solar eclipse. Eagle Pass will be one of the first American cities to witness the phenomenon. Some watchers, like Brandon Beck, 43, flew in Sunday night from San Diego and spent the night in a sleeping bag on the tarmac next to his friend’s Mooney single-prop piston four-seater.“We’re so lucky to be on a planet where the sun is the perfect size and perfect distance to create that effect,” he said. “It’s obligatory. We have to see it.”\n\nFirst the Cherry Blossoms, then the eclipse\n\nWASHINGTON − The Cherry Blossoms brought Ali and Aurore Youssouf to the city all the way from Paris, but the pair were delighted to learn that their trip would overlap with the eclipse. The day is extra special for Aurore Youssouf, 43, who has never seen an eclipse before. On Monday morning, the couple arrived by chance at the National Mall early enough to snag a few pairs of free eclipse glasses distributed by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for the occasion.“We didn’t even know. We just ended up here and found out that they were giving away some glasses,” said Ali Youssouf, 46.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nAwaiting eclipse − and hail − in Texas\n\nKERRVILLE, Texas − Forecasts called for considerable cloudiness, rain and possible hail, but retired NASA engineer Jeff Stone stayed positive as he and his wife prepared to host more than a dozen people for a watch party at their hilltop home in Texas Hill Country. Stone, an eclipse enthusiast who had met family in Missouri to watch the solar eclipse of 2017, said he recently reviewed video footage of that event and said current conditions weren’t that much different than they were back then.\n\n“I’m outside and seeing patches of blue among scattered clouds, so we’re remaining hopeful,” he said.\n\nAbout 150 miles to the northeast in Gatesville, lead pastor Eric Moffett of Coryell Community Church said a similar forecast did little to deter an expected gathering of about 800 visitors for the church’s family-oriented “Eclipse at the Crosses” event. Many, if not most, were from out of town or even out of country − Canada, Wales, France, Italy. Many locals were staying home to avoid the crowd, he said.\n\n“It’s partly cloudy, but the sun is shining on me right now,” he said. “We are praying that it stays that way.”\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nWhat is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching our planet, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon and the sun are on exact opposite sides of Earth. The Earth blocks the sunlight that normally reaches the moon. Instead of that sunlight hitting the moon’s surface, Earth's shadow falls on it.\n\nA lunar eclipse can last for a few hours, while a solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes. Solar eclipses also rarely occur, while lunar eclipses are comparatively more frequent. While at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, total lunar eclipses are still rare, NASA says. Another major difference: No special glasses or gizmos are needed to view the a lunar eclipse, and people can directly stare at the moon.\n\n− Saman Shafiq\n\nSolar eclipse, lunar eclipse: What is the difference?\n\nCan you drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nThe 2024 solar eclipse will shroud much of the United States in darkness on Monday, leaving many people to wonder: Is it safe to drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nIt is safe to drive during an eclipse as long as you don't look up at the sky. AAA is telling drivers to be focused on the road if they are operating a car during the total solar eclipse. But the automobile insurance company is advising Americans who want to safely view the total eclipse to \"find a safe place to park (not on the side of a road or highway) away from other traffic and then wear your eclipse glasses,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokeswoman from AAA.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally,\" Diaz said. \"People will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.\"\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse: Congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after totality, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests the worst of the traffic – on interstates and rural back roads alike – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to leave all at once.\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again. According to NASA, after Monday's total solar eclipse, the next one viewable from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse. The path of totality during the 2044 eclipse will only touch three states, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. The eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nBut another eclipse scheduledfor Saturday, Aug. 12, 2045, will trace a path of totality over California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Gabe Hauari and Eric Lagatta\n\nEclipse and pets: It's not the sky that's the problem\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets to experience the April 2024 total solar eclipse. Experts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and eager people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Dogs especially will take their cues from their owners rather than the celestial event.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” Carlson said.\n\n− Elizabeth Weise\n\nA guide to the solar eclipse for kids\n\nHere's an easy-to read, illustrated guide to help kids understand what the April 8 total solar eclipse means, where it will be visible and how you can watch it safely. It also shows them how an ordinary kitchen colander can easily be used to view a solar eclipse − the colander's holes can project crescent images of the sun onto the ground. There are even pages that can be downloaded and colored.\n\nTrump's eclipse experience lit up internet in 2017\n\nSeven years ago, when the last total solar eclipse crossed over North America, a photo of then-President Donald Trump seemingly gazing at the sun with his naked eyes set the internet ablaze. During the afternoon of Aug. 21, 2017, Trump, who was president at the time, was joined by then first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron to watch the rare phenomenon from the Truman Balcony at the White House. Photos taken by members of the media captured all three donning eclipse glasses while looking at the eclipse.\n\nBut at one point during the viewing, the former president was captured in photos and videos without proper eye protection, seemingly gazing directly at the sun. Looking at an eclipse before or after the brief phase of totality without proper eyewear can lead to eye damage.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse? What to know about the next eclipse's path, timing\n\nHow to make a solar eclipse viewer\n\nPeople who didn't manage to get their hands on glasses are not completely down and out. There are other safe ways to view the eclipse, say experts, and a lot of them only require a little bit of craftiness and items you can find lying around the house.\n\nSteps to make the cereal box eclipse viewer (And here is a video aid):\n\nGet an empty, clean cereal box.\n\nCut a white piece of cardboard that will fit snuggly in the bottom of the box, or secure it permanently by gluing it in place.\n\nCut the top of the cereal box, removing both ends and leaving the center intact.\n\nPut a piece of tape across the center of the top to securely hold it closed.\n\nTape a piece of heavy-duty foil or double a single layer for additional strength, covering one of the openings at the top of the cereal box. The other opening will remain open for viewing.\n\nUsing a small nail (approximately 3mm in diameter) push a hole in the foil.\n\nCover the entire box with construction paper, leaving the single-viewing opening and the foil uncovered.\n\nThe finished box should be held with the pin-hole side facing the sun. It may take a little practice pointing the box. With your back facing the sun, look through the viewing opening. A small image of the sun, about ½ cm in diameter, can be seen projected on the white paper inside the box.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdrid\n\nWhat is the path of the solar eclipse called?\n\nThose in the direct line of the eclipse will be treated to an incredible sight as the moon completely blots out the sun's disk, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness and revealing the sun's elusive outermost layer called the corona. That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in August 2017.\n\nHow to look at eclipse without glasses\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nHow fast does an eclipse shadow travel?\n\nAccording to a post from the National Weather Service in Indianapolis on X, an eclipse shadow travels at speeds from 1,100 to 5,000 mph. Near the equator, it travels at around 1,100 mph and increases in speed as it approaches the poles.\n\nThe eclipse party is over? Time to recycle those glasses!\n\nAstronomers Without Borders, or AWB, a non-profit organization running its second nationwide eclipse glasses recycling drive. Her business will join over 300 schools, museums, city governments, commercial businesses, community organizations and local libraries that will collect and ship an estimated millions of glasses to be repurposed for use by underserved communities around the world in future solar eclipses.\n\nAWB launched its first run of the program after the last solar eclipse in 2017 when volunteer centers across the country collected millions of the glass. After vetting them for reuse, more than half a million glasses were distributed to Africa, Asia and South America.\n\nPeople can visit AWB's website to find their nearest participating collection center and learn more about recycling the glasses, said Andrew Fazekas, the organization's communication manager.\n\n\"We figure there's probably going to be tens of millions of glasses out there at the very least,\" he said. \"And most of them are probably very gently used.\"\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2024/04/08/live-updates-2024-solar-eclipse-today-in-oklahoma/73215887007/", "title": "Recap: 2024 solar eclipse today in Oklahoma", "text": "An extraordinarily rare event took place this afternoon as the moon's shadow passed over southeastern Oklahoma, giving those in the path of a total solar eclipse an incredible show.\n\nOklahoma City still saw an impressive partial eclipse beginning around 12:30 p.m. with the peak at 1:45 p.m.\n\nThe entire path of totality, where the moon completely blocks the sun, was seen by millions of people as it crossed over San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Idabel, Little Rock, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo and Montreal.\n\nDo not look directly at the sun without specialized protective eyewear. Looking at the sun during a partial eclipse can cause severe and permanent eye damage. Sunglasses will not protect you. Even welding goggles might not be strong enough to block the full spectrum of the sun's powerful radiation.\n\nA total solar eclipse can only be viewed with the naked eye during totality, which typically lasts just a few minutes and only in specific areas.\n\nCrowd at Science Museum Oklahoma wowed by eclipse\n\nDozens of families were out at Science Museum Oklahoma on Monday afternoon to witness the partial solar eclipse. Several telescopes and eclipse-viewing devices were set up outside.\n\nKenda Davenport was out with her daughters, Taylor and Selah Hall.\n\n\"I wanted to have this experience with them,\" Davenport said.\n\nAs they waited in line for a telescope to view a sliver of the sun peeking out from behind the moon, Davenport asked her girls, ages 13 and 15, to make a pledge that they'll make plans for the next total solar eclipse coming through Oklahoma in 2045.\n\n\"Promise me right now you're gonna take my grandbabies to see it, wherever it is. A hundred percent,\" she said.\n\n-Dale Denwalt\n\nTotal solar eclipse has reached Oklahoma\n\nThe moon's umbra (the shadow of totality) crossed over southeastern Oklahoma at approximately 1:44 p.m.\n\nIn communities outside the path of totality, the partial eclipse will last about two and a half hours, and the show will be over by 3 p.m. Click here to get precise eclipse times for your location.\n\n-Cheyenne Derksen\n\nTotal solar eclipse has reached Mexico on its way to Oklahoma\n\nTotality has made landfall at Mazatlán, Mexico.\n\nThe moon's umbra (the shadow of totality) is now racing northeast at the equivalent of over 1,500 miles per hour, and will reach southeastern Oklahoma at approximately 1:44 p.m.\n\n-Dale Denwalt\n\nLive eclipse viewing: Watch the 2024 solar eclipse live\n\nThe eclipse has begun; partial eclipse now visible in Oklahoma\n\nIn Oklahoma City, the moon has begun to obscure, or occlude, the sun's disk. If you have an eclipse viewer or special eclipse glasses, you can now begin to see the the first little nibble.\n\nThe partial eclipse will last about two and a half hours.

Expect some of the worst traffic after 2 p.m. when totality has passed through the area.\n\nBe safe out there.\n\n-Dale Denwalt\n\nWhat is an 'umbra?' – and other eclipse words\n\nAstronomers and eclipse enthusiasts are using a bunch of specialized words today. Here are a few of them and what they mean, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nBailey's Beads – This refers to the beaded appearance of the moon's edge as the eclipse nears totality. Shafts of sunlight shine through deep valleys on the moon's surface, which causes the effect known to observers as Bailey's Beads.\n\nCorona – The sun’s upper atmosphere, visible as a pearly glow around the eclipsed sun during totality.\n\nPartial eclipse – A solar eclipse where the moon covers only a portion of the sun. A partial eclipse precedes and follows totality or annularity, but a partial can also occur by itself.\n\nShadow bands (or snakes) – Very faint, shimmering ripples of dark and light moving across the ground, walls, or clouds. These hard-to-see bands result from atmospheric “twinkling” of the thin solar crescent just before and after totality. They’re best seen against a white background.\n\nTotality – The maximum phase of a total solar eclipse, during which the moon’s disk completely covers the sun's bright face. It can last from a fraction of a second to a maximum of 7 minutes 31 seconds, depending on viewing location and other factors.\n\nUmbra – The darkest part of the moon’s shadow, within which the entirety of the sun's bright face is blocked. An observer standing in the umbra sees a total solar eclipse.\n\n-Dale Denwalt\n\nSevere weather risk tonight in southern Oklahoma\n\nIf you're planning on staying in southern Oklahoma after the eclipse this afternoon, be aware that severe weather is predicted in the evening hours.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Norman, severe weather could form after 8 p.m. While the tornado risk is low, hail and high wind has been forecast for much of the state south of Interstate 40.\n\n-Dale Denwalt\n\nWhere can I watch the eclipse in OKC?\n\nWhile you can watch the eclipse from anywhere you can see the sky, Science Museum Oklahoma at 2020 Remington Place is set up today with several ways to improve your viewing experience. No admission is required for outside activities.\n\nTelescopes with special filters will be set up in front of the museum for viewing the eclipse safely, and materials will be provided so that visitors can create their own eclipse viewer.\n\nCheck inside for eclipse-related activities and live feeds from the path of totality.\n\n-Dale Denwalt\n\nWhat time does the eclipse start in Oklahoma?\n\nCan't see our graphics? Click here to reload the page.\n\nWhat time is the eclipse in Tulsa, Oklahoma?\n\nThe eclipse will enter Oklahoma as it crosses the Red River at about 12:27 p.m., and exit the state at about 3:07 p.m., according to National Eclipse. The total eclipse, the direct casting of the moon's shadow, will only last from about 1:44 p.m. to 1:51 p.m.\n\nThough the path of totality only crosses a portion of the state, other cities will still have a spectacular view.\n\nIn Tulsa, the eclipse will start at 12:30 p.m., peak around 1:48 p.m., and end at 3:07 p.m.\n\n-Cheyenne Derksen\n\nOklahoma eclipse weather, clouds outlook\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa said there's a moderate to high likelihood the low cloud cover will remain north of the path of totality, which includes a chunk of southeast Oklahoma.\n\nThick, upper level clouds could stay mostly north as well, leaving mostly thinner cloud conditions across southeast Oklahoma, allowing for the eclipse to be seen through the clouds in these areas and in areas to the northeast.\n\nAccording to USA Today, low clouds are the worst clouds for an eclipse. Wispy, high cirrus clouds would still allow the eclipse to be seen from the ground, while cumulus clouds are more unpredictable.\n\nThere is also a threat of severe storms expected in southern Oklahoma starting around 9 p.m. Monday night.\n\n-Jana Hayes\n\nLive look at Oklahoma road conditions\n\nWhat color clothes are best for the solar eclipse? Purkinje effect\n\nThanks to a phenomenon known as the Purkinje Effect, our eyes are more sensitive to cooler colors rather than warm colors in low light.\n\nIn the four to five minutes before the total eclipse, which is called the mesopic vision zone, your surroundings will start to appear less colorful, turning grayish or silvery.\n\nThis will especially be noticeable with warm colors, but cooler colors like green are \"going to pop and look brighter against the dimming surroundings,\" according to Solar Eyeglasses.\n\nTo experience the effect, scientists recommend wearing reds and greens to enhance your eclipse viewing experience.\n\n\"This Purkinje effect during the coming eclipse will turn the whole experience from just watching the sky go dark to a real-life science demo on your clothes,\" a Solar Eyeglasses spokesperson said. \"But to really see the changes in color saturation, lots of people need to wear these complimentary red and green colors. Two or five in a group of 100 wouldn’t help.\"\n\n-Dale Denwalt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/12/06/nj-drone-sightings-video-social-media-bigger-picture/76800935007/", "title": "Drones in NJ flooding social media. Here's bigger picture", "text": "North Jersey has been on edge as mysterious drones reportedly fill the skies — and our imaginations and social media feeds.\n\nWith purported sightings from Wyckoff to Wantage, and the Raritan River to Rockaway Township, authorities have felt compelled to issue both warnings and public assurances in recent days.\n\nWhere's the frenzy coming from? Many North Jersey residents are looking at the sky and seeing lights that sincerely unnerve them. But psychologists and social scientists say there are other factors that have to be taken into account: our human tendencies to follow a crowd and social media's ability to amplify fears and narratives.\n\nAs authorities scramble to identify the source, if any, of the objects, the drone story is reverberating in an era of declining trust in institutions and a desire for security in uncertain times.\n\n\"It is making people anxious,\" said Richard Waldron, a Closter-based psychologist. \"It's kind of like a Peeping Tom, and it gets everybody's vigilance up — they become hypervigilant to it.\"\n\nLarge drones over NJ and a fixed-wing aircraft\n\nReports of unidentified drones have spread on social media since mid-November. What began in Morris County as a few scattered sightings quickly became a viral sensation, prompting authorities at Picatinny Arsenal, a military research facility in Rockaway and Jefferson townships, to issue warnings against flying drones over its airspace.\n\nThe FBI said last week that it was investigating the drone reports as well as what it described as a \"possible fixed-wing aircraft\" along the Raritan River, whose branches flow near the military arsenal and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course.\n\nBut the reports have spread well beyond those potential targets to small towns across New Jersey. Just check your local Facebook group.\n\nIn a study by scientists at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken in 2009, near the dawn of the social-media era, researchers found that people's perceptions of online information can be swayed by its apparent popularity.\n\nThe research by the school's Center for Decision Technologies made use of the online publishing platform Digg.com. By manipulating the number of \"upvotes\" a post had, the scientists found they could increase the number of real-life readers who rated articles positively. It worked regardless of the nature of the content, the authors said in \"2,377 People Like this Article: The Influence of Others’ Decisions on Yours.\"\n\nThe popularity of a narrative becomes its own validation and can transform anecdotal accounts into ironclad evidence, said researchers Yasuaki Sakamoto, Jing Ma and Jeffrey Nickerson. \"Although people may not be explicitly processing the information about others’ choices, they may be unconsciously influenced by it,\" they wrote.\n\nIt's not a stretch to imagine that the more people see posts about drones flooding the skies, the more likely they are to interpret inconsistent information — maybe those lights are just a plane? — as proof of a trending phenomenon.\n\nStill, social media doesn't have to be a negative influence. It can connect us to knowledgeable sources.\n\nCivil Air Patrol weighs in\n\nIn Rockaway Township, for example, Chris Thomas took to Facebook recently to educate fellow Morris County residents on the difference between drones and planes, which can be admittedly difficult to distinguish in the dark skies that accompany a new moon.\n\nPut simply, drones typically have two front lights of one color and two back lights of another, which flash together. Airplanes, on the other hand, have distinct red and green lights on either wing and white strobes that are absent on drones.\n\n\"People see strobe lights in the sky and often assume it's a drone, but 99% of the time, it's an airplane,\" Thomas said.\n\nBut Thomas, who serves as an aerospace education officer in the U.S. Civil Air Patrol and is a certified drone pilot, admits the discussion isn't so cut and dried these days.\n\nJust ask his wife, who said she has seen one of the mysterious drones.\n\n“We are in a debate over whether a blinking light in the sky was a drone or another type of aircraft,” Thomas said. “But I'm very skeptical as to the possibility of a drone anywhere around us.\"\n\nThough he may be a skeptic, quick, blurry videos posted online will continue to gain traction for a while because there's something deeper going on, said Waldron, the Closter psychologist.\n\nAmerica has communal PTSD\n\n\"If you go back for a bunch of years, everybody thought this country, up until 9/11, was relatively safe. That got shattered,\" Waldron said. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were followed by the financial crisis, then COVID and a wild political cycle, he said.\n\n\"The country has been going through its own communal post-traumatic stress disorder,\" Waldron said.\n\n\"I am 73 years old, and there has been no time in my lifetime like this,\" he added. \"This is a whole new thing. I study all this, and this is just new territory — very unknown and very, very scary in many ways.\"\n\nWe expect what we read to be true. The American Psychological Association noted on its website in March that \"detecting false information is difficult. When we encounter new information, we tend to focus on understanding it and deciding what to do next, rather than evaluating it for accuracy. It takes effort to compare new information with what we already know; when new information is false but plausible, we can learn it as fact.\"\n\nThe APA said people are also more likely to trust information from \"in-group sources rather than out-group ones\" — say, neighbors or Facebook friends. People are also more likely to believe information that stirs anxious or angry feelings.\n\nThis may be a unique moment, but the tenor of the time reminds Waldron, a history buff, of the disillusionment that followed the assassinations of 1960s leaders even as the Vietnam War was picking up steam. The collective trust in government and media that helped people feel secure began to erode. Then an infamous conspiracy theory emerged.\n\nThe official investigation into President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone when he shot the president. Many doubted this conclusion, and rumors spread of groups like the CIA, the Mafia or even Cuba working to take Kennedy down after the Bay of Pigs invasion.\n\nContrast that with a present era marked by its own political instability, unreliable information and rapid societal changes. Stepping out to look for drones in the sky seems like a harmless pastime.\n\nHow many are truly filling the sky? Today's leaders could do better by making more definitive statements, Waldron added.\n\n\"It would be nice to get out ahead of it and have somebody speak with authority with actual information,\" he said. \"That would make people feel better. But to say, 'We don't know,' that's not going to help people go to sleep between 2 and 5 a.m. up in Morristown.\"\n\nGene Myers covers disability and mental health for NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY Network.

All appeared well when Astrobotic was able to make contact with the vehicle, but the snag now threatens the spacecraft's ability to land on the moon at all.\n\nThe lander had hitched a ride Monday morning aboard the United Launch Alliance's shiny new Vulcan rocket, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. While NASA has a payload bound for the lunar surface, the space agency is merely a customer on what could end up being the first U.S. commercial spacecraft to ever touch down on the moon – if it can get there.\n\nThe flight represents the dawning commercial space age and is a vital step in NASA’s goal of putting astronauts back on the moon for the first time since the last Apollo mission in 1972.\n\nHere's what to know about the mission, and what's next as American astronauts prepare to travel back to the moon in the coming years.\n\nThe year ahead in space: A return to the moon and a rare eclipse among 5 great space events on the horizon in 2024\n\nWhat do we know about the Astrobotic's lander anomaly?\n\nThe Peregrine lander, which was designed and is operated by Astrobotic, separated from the Vulcan rocket about an hour after launch before powering onward toward the moon, the company said.\n\nAs the lander began receiving telemetry via the NASA Deep Space Network, the avionics systems all powered on and performed as expected while the craft entered \"a safe operational state,\" Astrobotic said.\n\nBut hours later, Astrobotic reported a propulsion anomaly that interfered with the craft's ability to achieve a sun-facing position, which is necessary to provide solar power to charge the spacecraft’s batteries. As the batteries began reaching \"operationally low levels,\" the company said, the ship's ability to land on the moon became threatened.\n\nThe team performed an improvised maneuver to reorient the solar panels toward the sun, which caused an expected temporary communication loss with the spacecraft that was later restored. But it wasn't long until another setback when the propulsion system's failure caused \"a critical loss of propellant,\" Astrobotic said.\n\n\"The team is working hard to try to stabilize this loss, but given the situation, we have prioritized maximizing the science and data we can capture,\" Astrobotic said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter, just after 1 p.m. EST Monday. \"We are currently assessing what alternative mission profiles may be feasible at this time.\"\n\nWhen is the Peregrine lander scheduled to reach the moon?\n\nThe Peregrine mission is one of two NASA-supported private endeavors racing to get the U.S. back on the moon this year.\n\nHouston’s Intuitive Machines is the second company with lunar ambitions. It aims to launch a lander in mid-February aboard a flight with SpaceX.\n\nIf everything goes as planned, it will take Astrobotic two weeks to get to the moon and another month in lunar orbit before a landing is attempted on Feb. 23.\n\nWhat happens once the lander touches down on the moon?\n\nPeregrine is carrying 20 payloads from seven nations and 16 commercial customers, including space agencies like NASA, universities, companies and others.\n\nThe scientific instruments NASA has aboard the lander will help the space agency to conduct a variety of experiments and studies of the lunar surface. The mission will prove crucial in helping the space agency search for evidence of water and other resources that will support human exploration of the moon as part of its Artemis program.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson called the launch \"a giant leap for humanity\" in a statement reaffirming the agency's intention of returning humans to the moon.\n\nNASA spent tens of millions of dollars for a spot for its cargo on the spacecraft, which represents the debut of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program (CLPS). With a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028, the program will see NASA more often partnering with private companies to help place scientific payloads on the lunar surface.\n\n\"These successes bring us one step closer to seven nations landing on the Moon, six of which have never been to the Moon before,\" Astrobotic CEO John Thornton said in a statement.\n\nWhat are NASA's lunar plans?\n\nThe mission will pave the way in the years ahead for NASA to send astronauts back to the moon for the first time in five decades.\n\nAs early as November, the space agency will first send a group of spacefarers on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon – but not touching down – as part of Artemis II. The crew's purpose is to test the capabilities of NASA's Space Launch System rocket and a crewed Orion spacecraft needed for deep-space exploration before the ultimate goal.\n\nThe Artemis III crew will have the honor of landing on the lunar surface itself, perhaps as early as 2025. The crew, which will include the first woman and first person of color to land on the moon, will help establish a permanent human presence on and around the moon to serve as a base of operations for missions to Mars.\n\n“These high-risk missions will not only conduct new science at the Moon, but they are supporting a growing commercial space economy while showing the strength of American technology and innovation,\" Nelson said. \"We have so much science to learn through CLPS missions that will help us better understand the evolution of our solar system and shape the future of human exploration for the Artemis generation.”\n\nNavajo Nation objects to human remains taken to moon\n\nBut not all were pleased about the mission.\n\nThe Navajo Nation, the largest tribe of Native Americans in the United States, objected to payloads on board the lander that contained the remains of people destined for a lunar burial.\n\n\"The sacredness of the moon is deeply embedded in the spirituality and heritage of many Indigenous cultures, including our own,\" Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren said in a statement. “The placement of human remains on the moon is a profound desecration of this celestial body revered by our people.”\n\nTwo private companies, Celestis and Elysium, paid to send the cremated human ashes and DNA of its customers to the moon, which included notable names such as “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nDespite a last-minute meeting convened Friday with the White House, those payloads departed aboard the Peregrine lander.\n\n\"No individual religion can or should dictate whether a space mission should be approved,\" Celestis CEO Charles Chafer said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"No one, and no religion, owns the moon and were the beliefs of the world’s multitude of religions considered it’s quite likely that no missions would ever be approved.\"\n\nWhat's next for ULA, Astrobotic?\n\nThe United Launch Alliance is hoping to earn certification to carry Space Force national security payloads, and this launch was a pivotal step toward that goal.\n\nOfficials are targeting April for the Vulcan's second flight, followed by a summer launch of the first Vulcan mission to support national security in space, the company said.\n\nAstrobotic plans to continue its lunar exploration with another launch at the end of the year. The Griffin, the largest lunar lander since the Apollo lunar module, will carry NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the south pole of the moon, where it will search for water ice.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Demonstrations led the university to end classified war research and stop military recruitment, among other changes, wrote Rosalind Rosenberg, a professor of history at Barnard College, for Barnard Magazine.\n\nToday's demonstrators also have specific changes in mind, often involving divestment from Israel, citing the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinian people who died in Gaza amid Israel's bombardment and ground assault. That military campaign was triggered by Hamas' incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, when about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 240 people were taken hostage.\n\nBut as campus authorities react swiftly, citing safety concerns and calling in police to break up encampents, it's unclear if or how the current protests will influence the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nUSA TODAY revisited four monumental campus protests to explain how college protests have become a staple of American life and often influence the outcomes of political strife. Here's a look at how previous campus protests unfolded — and whether they were successful in their causes.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley: Free Speech in 1960s\n\nAt the University of California Berkeley starting in 1964, students protested the university's limits on political activities and free speech during the civil rights movement and Vietnam-war era.\n\n\"In the wake of McCarthyism’s anti-Communist sentiments during the 1950s, public universities in California had enacted numerous regulations limiting students’ political activities,\" wrote Karen Aichinger for the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee University. \"At the University of California, Berkeley, student groups taking part in any on- or off-campus political activities were banned from campus.\"\n\nWhat transpired were \"small sit-ins and demonstrations\" that \"escalated into a series of large-scale rallies and protests demanding full constitutional rights on campus,\" reads the UC Berkeley website.\n\nNearly 800 students were arrested by local police as a result.\n\nThe students' protest ultimately worked in their favor. The university eventually overturned policies that would restrict the content of speech or advocacy, according to the college.\n\n\"Today, the Movement stands as a symbol of the importance of protecting and preserving free speech and academic freedom,\" reads the UC Berkeley website.\n\nKent State University in Ohio: Vietnam War in 1970\n\nThe most prolific university protest of the Vietnam War happened at Kent State University in Ohio in May 1970. Students started protesting the Vietnam War and the U.S. invasion of Cambodia on their campus on May 2. Two days later, the National Guard opened fire into a sea of antiwar protesters and passerbys. The soldiers killed four young people – Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer, and William Knox Schroeder – and injured several others with their violence.\n\n\"The impact of the shootings was dramatic,\" wrote Jerry Lewis and Thomas Hensley in an article for Kent State University. \"The event triggered a nationwide student strike that forced hundreds of colleges and universities to close.\"\n\nThe shootings also influenced national politics, Lewis and Hensley wrote.\n\n\"In The Ends of Power, (H.R.) Haldeman, (a top aide to President Richard Nixon), states that the shootings at Kent State began the slide into Watergate, eventually destroying the Nixon administration,\" the article reads.\n\nToday, the protest and shootings \"certainly come to symbolize the deep political and social divisions that so sharply divided the country during the Vietnam War era,\" Lewis and Hensley wrote.\n\nJackson State College in Mississippi: Racial Injustice in 1970\n\nDays after the shootings at Kent State, police opened gunfire at a college dormitory Jackson State College in Mississippi, a school with a predominantly Black student population.\n\nBlack students there were protesting racial injustice, including how they were treated by white drivers speeding on campus, according to the university.\n\nPolice received a call that Black young people were throwing rocks at white drivers near the campus. Police arrived at the scene and shot hundreds of bullets into Alexander Hall, according to an FBI report, NPR reported. Police killed two students – Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl Green – and injured 12 others. The college also canceled its graduation due to the killings and unrest.\n\nAt a 2021 commencement ceremony, the university honored 74 of the students who were unable to walk the stage in 1970, NBC reported. At the commencement ceremony, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said police “unjustly gunned down two innocent young Black men, terrorized and traumatized a community of Black students and committed one of the gravest sins in our city’s history,\" NBC reported.\n\nThe killings at Jackson State College and Kent State University national sparked outrage. College students across the nation protested on their campuses, according to the Zinn Education Project, a collaboration of historical content from the groups Rethinking Schools and Teaching for Change.\n\n\"The spring of 1970 saw the first general student strike in the history of the United States, students from over four hundred colleges and universities calling off classes to protest the invasion of Cambodia, the Kent State affair, the killing of two black students at Jackson State College in Mississippi, and the continuation of the war,\" wrote Howard Zinn in the book \"You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train.\"\n\nAngus Johnston, an adjunct assistant professor at Hostos Community College of the City University of New York and a historian of student activism, said after both events: \"There was a period of about 30 years or so where it tended to be fairly unlikely that campuses would respond with mass arrests even in the case of admin building occupations.\"\n\nNationwide: South Africa anti-Apartheid protests in 1985\n\nAnother form of popular college campus protest occurred in the 1980's. Students across the country wanted their colleges to cut ties with groups that supported from the South African apartheid.\n\n\"Under apartheid, race restricted every aspect of life for South Africans who were Black, Indian and colored — a multiracial classification created by the government,\" The New York Times reported. \"There were strict limits on where they could live, attend school, work and travel.\n\nColumbia University was at the center of the movement. Students led by the Coalition for a Free South Africa at Columbia University \"blockaded Hamilton Hall, the university’s administrative building, leading to the first successful divestiture campaign at the university,\" reads a summary of the events from the Zinn Education Project.\n\nThere was less pushback for protesters during this time, due to a “certain embarrassment among elites in the United States that there was complicity with South Africa’s white government,” said Daniel Farber, a history professor at the University of Kansas who has studied American activism, reports Vox Media.\n\nColumbia University was one of the first colleges to divest from doing business with South Africa and 155 universities followed suit. U.S. Congress also passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act in 1986, which aimed to prevent new trade and investment between the nation and South Africa.\n\nWhat is the future of college protests in America?\n\nFree speech experts told USA TODAY that students should continue to peacefully protest in open campus spaces to avoid conflict.\n\nAlex Morey, the director of campus rights advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, encourages universities to remain neutral in times of unrest and not to call in authorities unless a demonstration turns violent. The national nonprofit defends Americans rights to free speech and thought.\n\n\"Peaceful protest is a hallmark of a healthy speech climate on American college campuses and it has been for decades – whether it's the Berkeley free speech movement, or students protesting the Vietnam War era or civil rights,\" Morey said. \"Generations of students have felt passionately about certain issues and the open air places on campuses are great places to support their views.\"\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

Step down, Communist Party!” some protesters yelled among hundreds who gathered in the financial hub Shanghai – one of multiple major cities where protests broke out following a deadly fire Thursday at an apartment block in the far western region of Xinjiang.\n\nThe fire appeared to act as a catalyst for searing public anger over China’s strict zero-Covid measures after videos emerged that seemed to suggest lockdown measures delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05\n\nFrom Shanghai to the capital Beijing, residents gathered to grieve the 10 people killed in the blaze in Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi, speak out against zero-Covid and call for freedom and democracy. On dozens of university campuses, students demonstrated or put up protest posters. In many parts of the country, residents in locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets, following mass anti-lockdown protests that swept Urumqi on Friday night.\n\nSuch widespread scenes of anger and defiance – some of which stretched into the early hours of Monday morning – are exceptionally rare in China, where the ruling Communist Party ruthlessly cracks down on all expressions of dissent. But three years into the pandemic, many people have been pushed to the brink by the government’s incessant use of lockdowns, Covid tests and quarantines – as well as ever-tightening censorship and continued onslaught on personal freedoms.\n\nThe ratcheting-up of restrictions in recent months, coupled with a series of heartbreaking deaths blamed on an over-zealous policing of the controls, has brought matters to a head.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He fully supported China's zero-Covid policy.

Hear why he changed his mind 03:30\n\nChinese stock markets and the yuan tumbled in early trade Monday amid concern about the government’s potential response to the protests, which varied from city to city and in some areas became more heavy-handed as the weekend progressed.\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian deflected questions about the protests and claimed that social media posts linking the Xinjiang fire with Covid policies had “ulterior motives.”\n\nAuthorities had been “making adjustments based on realities on the ground,” he said. When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022. AP\n\nBrewing anger over the fire deaths led to remarkable acts of defiance in Shanghai, where many of its 25 million residents hold deep resentment toward the government’s zero-Covid policy after being subjected to a two-month lockdown in the spring.\n\nLate on Saturday night, hundreds of residents gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, which was named after the city, to mourn the victims of the Xinjiang fire, according to videos widely circulated – and promptly censored – on Chinese social media and a witness account.\n\nSurrounding a makeshift memorial of candles, flowers and placards, the crowd held up blank sheets of white paper – in what is traditionally a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why protesters in China are holding up white paper 01:32 - Source: CNN Why protesters in China are holding up white paper 01:32\n\nIn multiple videos seen by CNN, people could be heard shouting demands for Xi and the Communist Party to “step down.” The crowd also chanted, “Don’t want Covid test, want freedom!” and “Don’t want dictatorship, want democracy!”\n\nSome videos show people singing China’s national anthem and The Internationale, a standard of the socialist movement, while holding banners protesting the country’s exceptionally stringent pandemic measures.\n\nRows of police officers, who initially looked on from the outside, started to move in to push back and divide the crowd around 3 a.m., sparking tense face-offs with the protesters, according to a witness.\n\nThe witness told CNN they saw several people arrested and taken into a police vehicle next to the makeshift memorial after 4.30 a.m. They also saw several protesters being grabbed by the officers from the crowd and taken behind the police line. The protest gradually dispersed before dawn, the witness said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Shanghai residents returned to the site to continue protesting despite a heavy police presence and road blocks.\n\nVideos showed hundreds of people at an intersection shouting “Release the people!” in a demand for the police to free detained demonstrators.\n\nCrowds shouting \"Release the people!\" in Shanghai. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nThis time around, police adopted a more hardline approach, moving faster and more aggressively to make arrests and disperse the crowds.\n\nIn one video, a man holding a bundle of chrysanthemum gave a speech while walking on a pedestrian crossing, as a police officer tried to stop him.\n\n“We need to be braver! Am I breaking the law by holding flowers?” he asked the crowd, who shouted “No!” in reply.\n\n“We Chinese need to be braver!” he said to the applause of the crowd. “So many of us were arrested yesterday. Are they without job or without family? We should not be afraid!”\n\nThe man put up a struggle as more than a dozen officers forced him into a police car, as the angry crowd shouted “Release him!” and rushed toward the vehicle.\n\nOther videos show chaotic scenes of police pushing, dragging and beating protesters.\n\nIn the evening, after one protester was violently dragged away, hundreds of people shouted “triads” at the police, in reference to local crime gangs, according to a livestream.\n\nBBC journalist Edward Lawrence was arrested at the scene of the Shanghai protests on Sunday night and later released, according to a statement from the BBC. A BBC spokesperson expressed concern about Lawrence’s treatment, claiming he was “beaten and kicked by the police.”\n\nOn Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao acknowledged Lawrence’s arrest, claiming he had not identified himself as a journalist before being detained.\n\nPolice officers block Shanghai's Urumqi Road on Sunday. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDemonstration spreads\n\nBy Sunday evening, mass demonstrations had spread to Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan, where thousands of residents called for not only an end to Covid restrictions, but more remarkably, political freedoms.\n\nIn Beijing, hundreds of mostly young people demonstrated in the commercial heart of the city well into the small hours of Monday. A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom! We want freedom!” the crowd chanted under an overpass.\n\nA Beijing protester holds a candal in demonstrations on Sunday night. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Selina Wang at the protest, a demonstrator said he was shocked by the turnout.\n\n“Every conscientious Chinese should be here. They don’t have to voice their opinions, but I hope they can stand with us,” he said.\n\nIn the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu, large crowds demonstrated along the bustling river banks in a popular food and shopping district, according to a protester interviewed by CNN and videos circulating online.\n\nThe gathering started with a minute of silence to mourn the Xinjiang fire victims, later turning political as the crowd grew in size, numbering into the hundreds.\n\n“Opposition to dictatorship!” the crowd chanted. “We don’t want lifelong rulers. We don’t want emperors!” they shouted in a thinly veiled reference to Xi, who last month began a norm-shattering third term in office.\n\nProtesters hold up blank papers and chant slogans as they march in protest in Beijing on Sunday night. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nIn the southern city of Guangzhou, hundreds gathered on a public square in Haizhu district – the epicenter of the city’s ongoing Covid outbreak that has been locked down for weeks.\n\n“We don’t want lockdowns, we want freedom! Freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of arts, freedom of movement, personal freedoms. Give me back my freedom!” The crowd shouted.\n\nUniversity campuses\n\nAcross China, protests have also broken out on university campuses – which are particularly politically sensitive to the Communist Party, given the history of the student-led Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday morning, about 100 students gathered around a protest slogan painted on a wall at the prestigious Peking University in Beijing. A student told CNN that when he arrived at the scene at around 1 a.m., security guards were using jackets to cover the protest sign.\n\nA security guard tries to cover a protest slogan against zero-Covid on the campus of Peking University in Beijing.

No to Covid test, yes to food,” read the message written in red paint, echoing the slogan of a protest that took place on a Beijing overpass in October, just days before a key Communist Party meeting at which Xi secured a third term in power.\n\n“Open your eyes and look at the world, dynamic zero-Covid is a lie,” the protest slogan at Peking University read.\n\nThe student said security guards later covered the slogan with black paint.\n\nStudents at the Communication University of China, Nanjing gather in a vigil on Saturday evening to mourn the victims of the Xinjiang fire. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nStudents later gathered to sing the The Internationale before being dispersed by teachers and security guards.\n\nIn the eastern province of Jiangsu, at least dozens of students from Communication University of China, Nanjing gathered on Saturday evening to mourn those who died in the Xinjiang fire. Videos show the students holding up sheets of white paper and mobile phone flashlights.\n\nIn one video, a university official could be heard warning the students: “You will pay for what you did today.”\n\nHundreds of students at Tsinghua University in Beijing gathered on Sunday to protest against zero-Covid and censorship. Obtained by CNN\n\n“You too, and so will the country,” a student shouted in reply.\n\nThe campus protests continued on Sunday. At Tsinghua University, another elite university in Beijing, hundreds of students gathered on a square to protest against zero-Covid and censorship.\n\nVideos and images circulating on social media show students holding up sheets of white paper and shouting: “Democracy and rule of law!

Protesters passed by without stopping, chanting \"Hands up, don't shoot!\" About three and a half hours after leaving East High School, the crowd of about 500 people arrived peacefully back at their starting point around 10:40 p.m. Most left immediately.\n\nDes Moines Black Lives Matter coordinated the march, which marked the seventh straight day of events in the capital city decrying police brutality and systemic racism, sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nJust before the march started at East at 7 p.m., a young man there was detained, then released, after police said they mistakenly thought he had warrants for his arrest.\n\nThey walked downtown, then sat in the intersection at Sixth and Walnut streets near the Polk County Justice Center, where speakers called on Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert to condemn \"acts of violence\" toward protesters. On Monday, police used tear gas and flash-bangs to disperse people from the Capitol hours after curfew.\n\nContinuing on their route, dotted with food and water stations along the way, protesters danced outside the Polk County Courthouse building before gathering outside Tipsy Crow Tavern. There, they chanted, \"Enough is enough! We won't spend our bucks!\" Calling out what many consider a discriminatory dress code, the protesters successfully urged several customers to leave the bar.\n\nHere's what Register journalists reported Thursday:\n\nProtesters meet at East High School, march through downtown\n\n10:40 p.m.: After walking past the Iowa State Capitol, which was being guarded by police, the march ended back where it started at East High School. After celebratory cheers and applause, demonstrators urged others to leave peacefully and go home.\n\n9:45 p.m.: Protesters stopped to chant \"Enough is enough! We won't spend our bucks!\" outside Tipsy Crow Tavern on 3rd Street.\n\nThe bar owner Steven McFadden in 2017 announced a dress code that barred patrons from wearing clothing such as baggy jeans, plain T-shirts and construction boots. The dress code sign was then removed after a firestorm of criticism on social media calling it racist.\n\nSeveral patrons left the bar Thursday night at the encouragement of protesters, then workers were seen locking the door. The crowd cheered and moved along on their march back to the East Village.\n\nReached by phone Thursday night, McFadden said \"every bar downtown has a dress code. Don't act like it's just me.\" He also said, \"I believe a person has the right to protect their home, business and family from terrorism and violence. At the same time I believe in peaceful protest.\"\n\nHe declined to comment about screenshots of Facebook comments that apparently show him saying it's \"time to go live ammo.\"\n\n9:35 p.m.: After dancing and more chants outside the old Polk County Courthouse on Mulberry Street, the protesters resumed their march through the Court Avenue district toward the East Village. Many left their protest signs at the Courthouse building.\n\n9:04 p.m.: Hundreds of protesters remained seated in the intersection of Sixth and Walnut streets downtown, where a speaker discussed DarQuan Jones, 22, who recently suffered multiple facial fractures, a broken wrist and other injuries that required 10 stitches during what he, his family and the NAACP of Des Moines say was a racially motivated attack. The crowd chanted \"charge those racists\" in response.\n\nThey continued chants including \"defund police\" and \"take their tanks.\"\n\n8:28 p.m.: Marching protesters cross the river into downtown Des Moines, led by two cars. They chant: \"No justice! No peace! Prosecute the police!\"\n\nThe group, still roughly 500 people, continued to march west on Grand Avenue, then sit in the intersection at Sixth and Walnut, near the Polk County Justice Center. Speakers call on Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert to condemn \"acts of violence\" toward protesters.\n\n8:02 p.m.: Anthony Arroyo, 21, of Des Moines preps chips, ham and cheese sandwiches, and PB&Js for marchers in the East Village. His group, Food For Fighters, started three days ago and has already raised $5,000, he says.\n\n7:45 p.m.: About 400 protesters marched past the Iowa State Capitol, where lawmakers have resumed their session, and continue through the East Village while chanting \"Hands up, don't shoot!\" Tubs of snacks sit along their route.\n\n7:13 p.m.: Des Moines Black Lives Matters tweets: \"After roughly questioning him, @DMPolice released him saying they 'got the wrong guy.' What an unacceptable lie. They are so clearly trying to undermine our entire movement.\"\n\nKadeem Brown later tells a Register reporter that the police mistakenly thought there were warrants for his arrest. \"You should have seen their faces when they found out they had the wrong person,\" he said.\n\nDes Moines Police Sgt. Paul Parizek confirmed to the Register that police detained someone who was thought to have warrants, but did not, and was released.\n\n7:09 p.m.: The crowd of about 400 protesters began to march from East High School. Like Wednesday night, the group pledges to stay peaceful, but makes a new demand the the release of the man who apprehended before the march. A chant of \"bring him back!” ensues.\n\n6:42 p.m.: A young man was arrested minutes before the Des Moines Black Lives Matter protest was set to begin. Two witnesses, Patrick and Stephanie Brennan, said they were pulling into the parking lot when an officer pulled a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask off his bike and put him in the back of a police car, then removed his mask and asked for an ID. A Register reporter who interviewed the man minutes earlier said he identified himself as Kadeem Brown.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Cody Martin, 29, of Des Moines holds up a sign reading \"Black lives matter more than white comfort!\" It's his first night protesting, since he wanted to wait for the curfew to end.\n\n“Peaceful civil disobedience is the best thing to do right now,\" he said. He said that after generations of systematic racism, \"white people should feel uncomfortable right now.\"\n\n6:20 p.m.: People began to gather at East High School for a Des Moines Black Lives Matter protest. One attendee, Wallace Mazon, 25, of Des Moines, said he's protested every night since Friday, including last night outside Mayor Frank Cownie's house.\n\n\"People are using their people power (and) community power to directly influence our elected officials to demand that things change in our community,\" he said.\n\nVolunteers set up a supplies station, including free face masks, snacks and water.\n\n11 a.m.: Des Moines Black Lives Matter has announced a protest at East High School at 7 p.m. It will be the seventh night of protests in Des Moines since George Floyd's death more than a week ago.\n\nLawmakers outline policing proposal\n\n9:00 p.m.: The NAACP of Des Moines is circulating a petition with three proposals to address police misconduct. They are the same actions that Democratic lawmakers detailed in their \"Plan for a More Perfect Union\" Thursday morning outside the Iowa State Capitol. Supporters of the plan want to ban police choke holds, make it illegal to rehire police fired for misconduct, and allow the attorney general to investigate police misconduct.\n\nIowa bail funds raises $250,000\n\n7:30 p.m.: Advocacy and political groups have collected more than $250,000 this week to pay bail for people arrested during Iowa civil rights protests, including those accused of vandalism and burglary.\n\nMore than 50 people have received bail assistance from the groups. All Iowa protesters who had been arrested in the past week and were legally eligible for release had been freed as of Thursday afternoon, said Elizabeth Rook Panicucci, co-founder of the Eastern Iowa Community Bond Project, a nonprofit group in Iowa City.\n\nThe effort to free civil rights protesters began Sunday, when the Central Iowa Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America launched what it called the Des Moines Mutual Aid Bail Fund.\n\nThe link provided by the group shows that more than $163,000 had been collected by noon Thursday. But the tally is far greater because the Iowa City group is assisting and collecting money through ActBlue, a nonprofit that raises money for Democratic candidates and their causes, said Panicucci.\n\nGovernor signs voting rights legislation\n\n7:25 p.m.: Gov. Kim Reynolds signed legislation on Thursday that will place conditions on her plan to automatically restore voting rights to some Iowa felons, paving the way for Republicans to pass the proposal.\n\nReynolds pointed to the bill as a sign of how her administration is acting to deal with racial justice. Democrats, however, sharply criticized the bill's limits on which felons would get their voting rights back. They also laid out their demands for immediate action to prevent police violence in the state as Iowans geared up to protest racial injustice for another night.\n\nIowa City mayor 'not OK' with use of tear gas\n\n7:20 p.m. Iowa City’s mayor said Thursday he was “not OK” with the police using chemical agents to disperse protesters and called on all sides to work together to improve the lives of black residents.\n\nMayor Bruce Teague, who is black and has supported those protesting against police brutality, said he was “heartbroken” that officers with the Iowa State Patrol and Iowa City Police Department used chemical munitions against protesters late Wednesday.\n\n—Associated Press\n\nWaterloo police charge 2 after attack on reporter at protest\n\n6 p.m.: Waterloo police on Thursday charged two people after an attack on a reporter during a late-night protest.\n\nPolice charged Irwin Leon Wade III, 29, of Waterloo, with disorderly conduct and rioting, and set his bond at $11,000, according to the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. A 16-year-old also was arrested on similar charges.\n\nThey were arrested in connection with an attack after a march in Waterloo just before midnight Tuesday. Those who remained from the earlier protest over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis had climbed onto a Highway 218 overpass and were followed by Courier reporter Jeff Reinitz.\n\nWade allegedly demanded that Reinitz leave and then tried to hit him when he refused. Wade is charged with punching another demonstrator who tried to help the reporter.\n\nAfter another person tried to knock a camera from Reinitz's hand, he was allegedly struck in the head by the 16-year-old.\n\nThe reporter continued to cover the protest until it disbanded a short time later.\n\nOnline court records didn't indicate if Wade has a lawyer who could answer questions about his arrest.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nDes Moines City Council to vote on anti-racial profiling ordinance\n\n5:45 p.m.: After a week of mostly peaceful protests throughout the capital city — including one that reached Mayor Frank Cownie’s front lawn — the Des Moines City Council could pass an anti-racial profiling ordinance at its meeting Monday.\n\nAn item regarding “unbiased policing policy” was listed at the bottom of the City Council agenda. The language of the ordinance changes wasn’t immediately available early Thursday evening.\n\nHowever, the sections of city code listed on the agenda didn’t match the code changes banning racial profiling that the council initially approved in March. The changes would add six new sections to the city code that governs police.\n\nIt also asks the council to approve the first reading of the ordinance, which indicates that the measure is significantly different from what was approved in March.\n\nCownie told the protesters who arrived at his house Wednesday night that the ordinance would be up for a vote Monday. “I believe it will be passed,” he told the hundreds in the street.\n\nThe ordinance initially approved would’ve made racial profiling an “illegal discriminatory municipal practice” that could be grounds for an officer or employee’s firing. It would’ve reinforce the police department’s policy that bans racial profiling, though police would still investigate racial profiling complaints lodged against its officers.\n\nActivists were concerned that the ordinance didn’t go far enough to define racial profiling — that it allowed a loophole for offending officers to escape punishment. Groups like Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, the ACLU of Iowa and the Iowa-Nebraska NAACP proposed several other provisions in a racial profiling ordinance that were left out. Those included the formation of a citizen review board to examine complaints against police, the banning of pretextual stops and making marijuana possession police’s lowest enforcement priority.\n\n— Austin Cannon\n\nIowa native Ashton Kutcher on Black Lives Matter\n\n5:00 p.m.: Iowa native Ashton Kutcher addressed those who cried \"All Lives Matter\" in response to his Black Lives Matter social media posts.\n\nIn an emotional video shared to Instagram on Tuesday, Kutcher said he didn't want to dismiss those who disagreed with him, but wanted to take a moment to \"educate\" them.\n\n\"I think what folks that are writing ‘All Lives Matter' need to understand is that for some people black lives don't matter at all,\" Kutcher said.\n\nUI to review use of tear gas by police\n\n4:00 p.m.: University of Iowa officials say they are reviewing local law enforcement agencies' use of tear gas on demonstrators, including student demonstrators, protesting police brutality late Wednesday in the aftermath of George Floyd's death.\n\nIn addressing the Iowa Board of Regents on Thursday, some UI officials asserted that they were reviewing whether improper force was used.\n\nSarah Hansen, UI's vice president for student life, said life has \"gotten so much more complicated\" for students in the aftermath of Floyd's death in the custody of Minneapolis police.\n\nOrganizers ask UI to cut ties with police\n\n3:47 p.m.: The Des Moines-based Black Lives Matter group is calling for the University of Iowa to \"terminate any relationships or contracts\" with the Iowa City Police Department.\n\nIn a tweet, the group referenced last night's protest in Iowa City, where local police used tear gas and flash bangs against hundreds of protesters around midnight.\n\nMetro police disavow neck holds\n\n3:45 p.m.: Des Moines metro police forces said they were disturbed to see a Minneapolis police officer use a discredited restraint tactic on George Floyd, whose death after being arrested on Memorial Day has led to multiple nights of protests and unrest across the nation, including in Iowa.\n\nThey said they do not teach officers the move the officer used on Floyd, nor do they condone its use.\n\nSince at least the 1980s, Iowa officers have realized the pinning technique used by Derek Chauvin — who has since been charged with second-degree murder — is dangerous, said former Des Moines Police Chief Judy Bradshaw, now the director of the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy in Johnston.\n\n\"When they say ‘I can’t breathe,’ that is significant,\" Bradshaw said.\n\nCounty, city officials lift nightly curfew\n\n2:35 p.m.: West Des Moines Mayor Steve Gaer lifted the city's 9 p.m. curfew, about an hour after the Polk County Board of Supervisors did the same, meeting one of the demands of protesters.\n\nThe 9 p.m. curfew for West Des Moines, which spans parts of Polk, Dallas, Madison and Warren counties, is no longer in effect, a news release said.\n\n1 p.m.: Following two nights of peaceful protests, the Polk County Board of Supervisors has lifted the nightly 9 p.m. curfew, effective tonight.\n\nIt had been in place since Sunday in response to protests that had turned violent and destructive.\n\n\"We trust protesters to continue this important work in a peaceful manner,\" Chairman Matt McCoy said, reading a prepared statement at a public meeting.\n\nIf lifting the curfew results in more violence, \"we stand ready to act in an appropriate matter,\" he said.\n\nThe curfew was lifted one day after a group of protesters asked Mayor Frank Cownie to suspend it as part of a list of four demands it listed while outside the mayor's house late Wednesday.\n\nArts group picks up trash in name of black community\n\n11:45 a.m.: Movement 515, an urban arts community, has gathered a group of young people who are picking up trash across the Des Moines metro, in Ankeny, Waukee, West Des Moines and downtown.\n\nParticipants are also hanging up signs with poetry and other words of support for the black community as they move around those communities. Some signs suggested anti-racist books, documentaries and nonprofits to research, and others called for #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd.\n\nThe group had a small dance party and heard from two poets Thursday morning at Evergreen Park before splitting up to clean up litter.\n\nThey are doing the \"Pick Up, Put Up\" event to provide a space for people who want to get involved, but who may not want to join the larger protests.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of people are getting the message misconstrued with the rebellions we have going on around this country and about our protests. And they feel like we're trying to separate people, make whites hate black, make blacks hate white,\" said organizer Jassma'ray Johnson, 19, of Des Moines.\n\n\"… And that's not what we’re trying to do, we’re just trying to get equality, and we’re trying to make sure everyone is loved and we’re trying to build community. So I thought this event was perfect.\"\n\nBlack leaders work to turn protests into lasting change\n\n6 a.m.: Iowa's African American leaders are working with young protesters to ensure their messages are heard well beyond when the large gatherings and marches end.\n\nThey're hopeful to organize an enduring movement to achieve lasting justice, particularly by encouraging young people to continue staying civically engaged and/or run for office.\n\n\"So the decision-makers look like the protesters,\" said Kameron Middlebrooks, president of the Des Moines chapter of the NAACP. \"And if they don't look like them, they think like them.\"\n\nOnly five Iowa legislators are black. No one on the Des Moines City Council is African American.\n\nTear gas used on Iowa City protesters looking to block I-80\n\nMidnight: Iowa City police used tear gas and flash bangs against hundreds of protesters who attempted to move onto Interstate Highway 80.\n\nThe protest began at 6 p.m. Wednesday and amassed a quick-moving crowd, several hundred strong. Protesters pushed into the street, blocking traffic and chanting as they spent hours walking from the Pentacrest on the University of Iowa campus to U.S. Highway 6 and back.\n\nThe use of force was deployed as protesters set out to block traffic on the interstate.\n\nYour subscription makes work like this possible.

For three days, Rezan trekked a rocky mountain range and walked through minefields along a winding path forged by seasoned smugglers to circumnavigate the country’s heavily armed Revolutionary Guards. It was a trip too dangerous for respite of much more than a few stolen moments at a time.\n\n“I knew that if an officer spotted us, we would die immediately,” said the 19-year-old Iranian-Kurdish activist, whom CNN is identifying by her pseudonym Rezan for security purposes. She was traveling to the border with Iraq, one of Iran’s most militarized frontiers, where according to rights groups, many have been shot to death by Iranian security forces for crossing illegally, or for smuggling illicit goods.\n\nShe had fled her hometown of Sanandaj in western Iran where security forces were wreaking death and destruction on the protest sites. Demonstrators were arbitrarily detained, some were shot dead in front of her, she said. Many were beaten up on the streets. In the second week of the protests, security forces pulled Rezan by her uncovered hair, she said. As she was being dragged down the street, screaming in agony, she saw her friends forcefully detained and children getting beaten.\n\nAlex Platt/CNN\n\n“They pulled my hair. They beat me. They dragged me,” she said, recounting the brutal crackdown in the Kurdish-majority city. “At the same time, I could see the same thing happening to many other people, including children.”\n\nSanandaj has seen the some of the largest protests in Iran, the biggest outside of Tehran, since the uprising began in mid-September.\n\nRezan said she had no choice but to take the long and perilous journey with smugglers to Iraq. Leaving Iran through the nearest official border crossing – a mere three-hour car ride away — could have led to her arrest. Staying in Sanandaj could have resulted in her death at the hands of the security forces.\n\n“(Here) I can get my rights to live as a woman. I want to fight for the rights of women. I want to fight for human rights,” she told CNN from northern Iraq. After she arrived here earlier this month, she decided to change tack. No longer a peaceful protester, Rezan decided to take up arms, enlisting with an Iranian-Kurdish militant group that has positions in the arid valleys of Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nA man walks past the carcass of a vehicle weeks after it was attacked by Iranian drones and missiles. Alex Platt/CNN\n\nIran’s dissidents flee\n\nRezan is one of multiple Iranian dissidents who fled the country in the last month, escaping the regime’s violent bid to quash demonstrations that erupted after the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa “Zhina” Amini during her detention by Iranian morality police for allegedly wearing a hijab improperly.\n\nThe number of dissidents who have left Iran since the protests started is unknown. In the Kurdish-administered region of northern Iraq (KRG) — which borders the predominantly Kurdish west of Iran — many of the exiled activists keep a low profile, hiding in safe houses. They said they fear reprisals against their families back home, where mass detentions have become commonplace in Kurdish-majority areas.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses and social media videos, the people in those regions have endured some of the most heavy-handed tactics used by Iran’s security forces in their brutal campaign to crush the protest movement.\n\nIn Kurdish-majority regions, evidence of security forces indiscriminately shooting at crowds of protesters is widespread. The Iranian government also appears to have deployed members of its elite fighting force, the Revolutionary Guards, to these areas to face off with demonstrators, according to eyewitnesses and video from the protest sites.\n\nIran’s Revolutionary Guards typically fight the regime’s battles further afield, namely in Iraq and Syria, propping up brutal dictatorships as well as fighting extremist groups such as ISIS.\n\nFor the Kurds, the intensified crackdown in the country’s west underscores decades of well-documented ethnic marginalization by Iran’s central government. These are grievances that Iran’s other ethnic minorities share and that precede clerical rule in Iran.\n\nThe nearly 10-million strong Kurdish population is the third largest ethnic group in Iran. Governments in Tehran — including the regime of the pro-Western Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who was overthrown in 1979 — have eyed the group with suspicion because of their long-standing aspirations to secede from the state and establish a republic alongside Kurdish communities in neighboring countries.\n\nFamily support\n\nCrouched under the shade of a tree in a dusty valley alongside her sisters-in-arms in northern Iraq, Rezan clasps her AK-47 rifle, her faltering voice betraying a lingering fear of Iranian reprisals. After she fled Iran, the authorities there called her family and threatened to arrest her siblings, she said.\n\nBut her family supports her militancy, she said, with her mother vowing to bury every one of her children rather than hand them over to the authorities. “I carry a weapon because we want to show the Iranian Kurds that they have someone standing behind them,” Rezan said from one of the bases of her militant group, the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK). “I want to protect the Kurds there because the Kurds are protecting themselves with rocks.”\n\nProtesters across Iran are largely unarmed. Yet Iran blames Kurdish-Iranian armed groups in Iraqi Kurdistan for instigating unrest in Kurdish-majority areas. It has repeatedly struck Iranian-Kurdish targets in Iraq with drones and missiles since the protests began, killing scores of people.\n\nGen. Hussein Yazdanpanah, who heads the Kurdistan Freedom Party, accuses Tehran of using him as a 'scapegoat' for the protests that have gripped Iran. Alex Platt/CNN\n\nLast Saturday, Iran’s Armed Forces chief accused the Iraqi Kurdistan region – which has a semi-autonomous government – of harboring 3,000 Iranian-Kurdish militants, and vowed to continue to attack their bases unless the government disarms the fighters.\n\n“Iran’s operations against terrorists will continue. No matter how long it takes, we will continue this operation and a bigger one,” said Maj. Gen. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, the chief of staff of Iran’s Armed Forces.\n\nPAK and other Iraq-based Kurdish-Iranian armed groups say they have not supported the protests in any concrete way. But they have called on the United States to intervene on behalf of the demonstrators, and have said they are prepared to help Kurds in Iran take up arms in case of a further escalation in Iran’s crisis.\n\n“What’s happening on the streets with the protesters was not engineered at my base,” PAK’s leader, Gen. Hussein Yazdanpanah, told CNN. He was speaking from one of the group’s barracks that was blown up by Iranian missiles and drones on September 28, killing eight militants.\n\nOn September 28, one of the militant barracks of an Iranian-Kurdish armed groups based in Iraqi Kurdistan was attacked by Iranian drones and missiles. Alex Platt/CNN\n\n“(Iran) is using us as a scapegoat for the protests in Iran and to distract media attention from Iran,” said Yazdanpanah, who believes that he was the target of that attack.\n\n“I won’t hide the fact that I am a military support for my people,” he said, standing amid the destruction at his base near the town of Altun Kupri. The stench of two militants slain in the attack, but whose bodies have not yet been recovered, rises up from the rubble.\n\n“For a revolution to succeed there has to be military support for the people,” he added. “(Iran) wanted people to question this principle. (By bombing the base) they wanted to say to them that there is no military support to protect you.”\n\nFear of reprisals\n\nAcross the country, protesters with a variety of grievances — namely related to the dire state of Iran’s economy and the marginalization of ethnic groups — have coalesced around an anti-regime movement that was ignited by Amini’s death.\n\nWomen have been at the forefront of the protests, arguing that Amini’s demise at the hands of the notorious morality police highlights women’s plight under Islamic Republic laws that restrict their dress and behavior.\n\nKurds in Iran also saw their grievances reflected in Amini’s death. The young woman’s Kurdish name — Zhina — was banned by a clerical establishment that bars ethnic minority names, ostensibly to prevent sowing ethnic divisions in the country. Amini also was crying for help in her Kurdish mother tongue when morality police officers violently forced her into a van, according to activists.\n\nAn out of focus images of a family who last month fled the western Iranian city of Saqqez -- the hometown of Zhina Mahsa Amini -- where Iranian security forces have tried to violently quell protests. The family says they fear the long arms of Iran's regime, even in the relative safety of Iraqi Kurdistan where they now live in hiding. Alex Platt/CNN\n\nThe first large protests in Iran’s current uprising erupted in Amini’s Kurdish-majority hometown of Saqqez in western Iran, which has also been subjected to a violent crackdown. “When we were in Iran, I joined the protests with friends. Two days later, two of my friends got kidnapped and one of them got injured,” said one man who fled Saqqez to Iraqi Kurdistan, who CNN is not naming for security reasons.\n\nSeated on carpet under a tree to avoid any identification of their safe house, the man and his family said they worry about the long arms of Iran’s regime. The family cover their faces with medical masks, the man wears long sleeves to cover identifying tattoos and a plastic tarp is hung up to obscure them from the ever-present fear of incoming Iranian drones.\n\nHe and his family decided to leave Iran when he saw security forces kill his friend near a mosque in the first days of the uprising, the man said. “How can they claim to be an Islamic Republic when I saw them murdering my friend outside a mosque?” he asked in disbelief.\n\nFreshly dug graves draped in the Kurdish nationalist flag where six of the eight militants who were killed in the September 28 Iranian attack were laid to rest. Two of the bodies have not yet been recovered. Alex Platt/CNN\n\nHe said the community could not retrieve his friend’s body until night fell, after which they secretly buried their dead. His testimony is similar to multiple accounts CNN has heard since the start of Iran’s uprising. Many in the Kurdish areas of Iran report opting not to receive medical care for injured protesters in hospitals, for fear of arrest by authorities. Eyewitnesses also say some have even avoided sending their dead to morgues, for fear of reprisals against family members.\n\nAt least 215 people have been killed since the nationwide protests and subsequent government crackdown started in September, Norway-based rights group Iran HR said Monday.\n\nAccording to Iran HR, the death toll associated with the demonstrations in response to Amini’s death is 122, while another 93 people were killed during separate protests in the Sistan and Baluchistan province. CNN cannot independently verify the death toll and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists.\n\nSince they fled, dissidents in Iraqi Kurdistan say they remain in contact with the loved ones they left behind. Every phone call to their families comes with news of an intensified crackdown, as well as reports of people defying security forces and continuing to pour into the streets.\n\n“From what I know, my family is part of the revolution and the revolution continues to this day,” said Rezan. “They are ready to die to get our rights.”", "authors": ["Tamara Qiblawi Nima Elbagir Barbara Arvanitidis Alex Platt Gianluca Mezzofiore Celine Alkhaldi Muhammad Jambaz", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Nima Elbagir", "Barbara Arvanitidis", "Alex Platt", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Celine Alkhaldi", "Muhammad Jambaz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/04/30/trump-cuts-coal-appalachia/83251537007/", "title": "In West Virginia, Trump's cuts complicate hopes for a coal revival", "text": "FOSTER, West Virginia— Robert Cash, a third-generation coal miner, prays each morning with his fellow miners before going underground for a long shift.\n\nIn the coalfields of Appalachian West Virginia, everyone hopes the mine will keep giving up its coal to pay rare six-figure salaries. But their prayers ask that they return safely to the surface.\n\nWhile fatal accidents have fallen over the years, cases of black lung disease resurged in the last two decades. It has laid low colleagues and neighbors. Cash, 55, fears it will arrive for him one day, too.\n\nCash is among those here hoping that President Trump’s promises to revive the coal industry’s fortunes after years of decline from cheaper natural gas, rising mining costs and environmental regulation will pan out. But in recent weeks, those hopes have been complicated by worries that Trump’s federal cost-cutting is simultaneously weakening mine safety.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump’s federal workforce cuts hit the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), hobbling the work of a black lung surveillance and prevention program, according to union and health workers.\n\nIn addition, the administration delayed a new rule set to go into effect April 14 that would cut in half exposure limits of silica dust, a driver of resurgent black lung that now affects one in five coal miners in Appalachia. And the administration has been reviewing ending the leases of more than 30 Mine Safety and Health Administration offices.\n\n“At the end of the day, the most valuable thing in the mines is the miners,” Cash told USA TODAY.\n\nThose concerns have produced a growing pushback in West Virginia, with Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and others calling on the Trump administration to reconsider changes. One coal miner in danger of developing black lung has filed a federal suit challenging the layoffs.\n\n“That would make anybody think about their decision to go in the mines,” said Josh Roberts, head of health and safety for the United Mine Workers of America, which recently joined a legal battle over the silica rule to keep it from falling by the wayside.\n\nIn what health workers hope could be a sign that those voices are being heard, several dozen laid-off NIOSH staff including some working on the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program got phone calls on April 28 asking them to return from administrative leave but without signaling a change in their planned termination in June, a union leader told USA TODAY on April 29.\n\nCapito said on social media April 29 that some NIOSH functions for coal miner safety were “slated to resume with some select staff\" but that \"my understanding is that this is temporary, so my focus will continue to be on working with @HHSGov on permanently restoring these functions and personnel in the most efficient and effective manner.“\n\nTrump administration officials said that NIOSH would join the Administration for a Healthy America and that critical programs would remain intact.\n\n“There is no greater ally to America’s coal miners than President Trump, who immediately unleashed American energy upon taking office and signed an Executive Order to expand production of critical minerals. He is using every lever of his executive power to carry out his energy dominance agenda while keeping our hardworking coal miners safe,” Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nIn West Virginia, where 7 in 10 voters supported Trump last year and coal mines employed about 14,000 workers in 2023, the delay in new silica standards and worries about mine safety programs are not the only concerns creating caution and uncertainty around a promised revival.\n\nWest Virginia produces 28% of U.S. coal exports to other countries, according to the federal Energy Information Agency. Chris Hamilton, head of the West Virginia Coal Association, said the state produces about half of U.S metallurgical coal exported to China, which is now a key target of Trump’s trade war. Others noted that despite Trump’s attempt to ease environmental regulations, competition remains from less expensive natural gas and renewables.\n\nBut Cash said Trump’s attempt to extend the lives of coal-fired power plants and encourage more U.S.-based manufacturing, such as steelmaking that relies on coal, could eventually boost local mining jobs -- whose incomes are hard to replace in his corner of Appalachia.\n\nIf, that is, they can do it safely.\n\nFederal cuts lead to coal-safety concerns\n\nIn early April, Noemi Hall’s pinging phone woke her up at 5:30 a.m. with texts from colleagues at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health who had gotten reduction-in-force notices.\n\nShe jumped into her car and drove to their Morgantown office building, where she worked as an epidemiologist in NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division, primarily supporting the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program.\n\nHer badge still worked. But she quickly discovered that she, too, got a reduction notice. She packed up what she could and grabbed her diplomas off the wall. She said the cuts have since stymied the program’s work.\n\nLaid-off staffers included those who helped process lung X-rays, critical for miners to obtain black lung benefits or to be relocated to a less dusty work setting, she said. A mobile clinic that travels to remote coal communities to screen workers has been idled.\n\n“I am incredibly worried for the health of these coal miners,” she said.\n\nOn April 8, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced it would pause enforcement set to start April 14 of new, long-sought limits on silica dust exposure, citing the restructuring. The rule has faced a legal challenge from industry groups who say it would be costly.\n\nCutting programs to prevent black lung and its costly treatments and benefits make little financial sense, said Cathy Tinney-Zara, the union president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3430, which represents some of the laid-off workers who organized a rally in Morgantown on April 23.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry Wiley, a West Virginia coal miner, filed a federal lawsuit alleging he is unable to process his mine-transfer rights because of the cuts affecting the NIOSH facility in Morgantown, which union officials estimated to have affected at least 185 union workers.\n\nCases of black lung, an incurable illness, fell before it began resurging, particularly in Appalachia, nearly two decades ago. It came as more rock was mined to reach ever smaller and more remote coal, mine union officials said. That in turn increased silica dust exposure.\n\nA NIOSH study in 2018 found that 10% of underground coal miners who had worked for at least 25 years had black lung, up from 7% in 2012. In central Appalachia, that figure reached 20%, the highest level recorded in 25 years. That rise included more progressive massive fibrosis, the most severe form of the disease, and more cases among younger miners.\n\nEnforcement of stricter exposure limits, which require more respirators and dust monitors, falls to mine safety inspectors as DOGE considers closing office buildings. The Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center said the offices slated for closure nationwide performed more than 16,000 safety and health inspections between February 2024 and 2025.\n\nRoberts, of the United Mine Workers, said fewer physical locations will only make it harder for inspectors to reach mines in remote parts of Appalachia, where miners often commute for an hour or two each way through remote winding mountain roads.\n\n“We want the coal industry to be successful. We want there to be mining jobs for years to come. But I don't think anybody would want to do that at the cost of health and safety,” he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Labor said this week it was looking to “identify workable solutions” to keep Mine Safety and Health Administration teams on the ground, continuing their critical mission to prevent death, illness, and injury and promote safe and healthy workplaces for our miners.”\n\nStanley Stewart knows all too well the importance of safety measures. And the need for strict enforcement.\n\nHe was 300 feet underground at the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia in 2010 when an explosion caused by excess methane gas and flammable coal dust killed 29 of Stewart’s co-workers. Stewart survived but had to stack the bodies of fellow miners.\n\nIt was later found that inspectors had cited the mine for excess coal dust and methane, and the disaster drove stepped-up safety rules and inspections, according to the Associated Press.\n\nStewart, now retired in Orgas, West Virginia, told USA TODAY that cutting resources for miner safety would endanger workers.\n\n“If you ain’t got them people there to enforce the laws and try to make them behave, then you know, the miners are going to have hell to pay,” he said.\n\nCoal operators hopeful but cautious\n\nOn a chilly mid-April morning, workers and leaders from coal and related businesses poured into the convention center in Charleston for the annual Coal Show and symposium amid a new air of hope.\n\nAttendees walked past displays of shining new equipment such as the low-slung “mantrip” that takes miners deep underground. A woman in a “coal queen” sash talked to visitors. Nearby was a sign for a job fair, with tables set up by businesses hoping to ramp up staffing.\n\nHamilton, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, whose members include coal companies, said he thinks Trump will do more this time to boost coal than he was able in his first term.\n\nTrump’s executive orders, signed April 8, include efforts to extract coal on federal lands, speed mining permits and extend the life of coal-fired power plants. The administration is also seeking to roll back environmental regulations, including exemptions for some coal-fired power plants from rules to curb toxic emissions.\n\nExperts have said that competition from natural gas and renewables likely would dissuade utilities from opening new coal-fired power plants or restoring coal to its former place. Coal now generates less than 20% of U.S. electricity, down from about 50% in 2000, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nAnd Trump’s moves have drawn criticism from environmental groups, who note that burning coal is the most polluting of all fossil fuels and accounts for roughly 40 percent of the world’s industrial carbon dioxide emissions, the main driver of global warming.\n\nBut Hamilton said extending the lifetime of existing coal plants could help a state that once shipped coal to 165 coal plants, a figure now down to 35.\n\n“The working miners and their families, they've been going to bed at night and waking up every morning wondering whether they were going to have a job,” he said. “They're seeing signs that maybe this time around, the Trump administration will be able to effectively change and ensure that coal is a bigger part of our nation's energy mix going forward.”\n\nMeanwhile, Hamilton said the tariff battle with China has led some coal operators to stockpile mined coal. It’s unclear if or when those producers will need to find new markets, but Hamilton said he believes demand in other countries could take up the slack.\n\n“There’s concern. There are some markets that are in jeopardy at the current time,” he said earlier in April. “But we think at the end of the day, that's going to be corrected.”\n\nIndeed, despite the uncertainty, many in the once-blue state turned deep red are willing to give Trump time.\n\nFew forget that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on cleaner energy and transitioning workers to new industries, saying, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”\n\nA changing coal job market\n\nDuring coal’s better years in the mountains of West Virginia, a miner could spend a career in the same mine, where large seams took decades to extract, Roberts said.\n\nBut over time, shrinking coal seams became more expensive to mine, making companies more sensitive to price dips. That meant frequent idling and closures. And on-and-off work.\n\n“I've worked with guys who went straight from high school to retirement at one coal mine. That's just unheard of nowadays,” Roberts said. “Now, if you get five years at a coal mine, you've been there a while.”\n\nBetween 2011 and 2022, coal industry employment fell by around 57%, a decline that hit the hardest in Appalachian coal producing states including West Virginia and Kentucky.\n\nSome entered job retraining but few could replace the pay. Some have given up and left the state to find jobs.\n\n“There was a period there when there was a downturn in coal, when a lot of mines shut down and people moved out of state, found other careers, so they either moved on or got to the age they're retired and completely out of the industry now,” said Brian Lacy, United Mine Workers of America District 17 Vice President.\n\nEven with a hoped-for uptick in jobs, he said experienced miners remain difficult for some companies to find. There are now efforts to revive new-miner apprentice programs.\n\nAt the Coal Show job fair, employers from several related industries looking for truckers, welders and machinists had set up at tables with pens and applications. On this day, some weren’t yet seeing many applicants.\n\nKeith Lester, a manager from a company that makes mining equipment, said his company was leaning into coal on the expectation that mining would increase. But how long federal coal policies would stay in place remained an ever-present question.\n\n“Sad to say, it all rises with whoever is sitting in Washington in this industry,” he said.\n\nMany would like to see a boost in coal to support the small towns that once survived off the industry but over the years have faced poverty and depopulation. Federal funding now makes up nearly 45% of the state’s revenue, according to a Wallethub analysis.\n\nStewart, the Upper Big Branch survivor, said he is skeptical the administration’s coal push will ever bring back the days when large coal seams and jobs were seemingly everywhere.\n\n“When I grew up you could hardly find a place to park up in Whitesville. Now it's a ghost town,” he said. “At least in my area, I don't ever see coal ruling again.”\n\nMiners caught between jobs and health\n\nAfter spending the day in Boone Memorial Hospital in Madison, West Virginia, helping miners with X-rays and breathing tests to qualify for black lung benefits, physician Drew Harris headed just over the Virginia border to Haysi, population 498.\n\nInside an exam room at Stone Mountain Medical Center, which sees more than 1,600 black lung patients a year, Ralph Colley, 64, sat on a chair with an oxygen line in his nose leading to a tank he carries everywhere. Harris held a stethoscope to his chest.\n\n“You’ve got a lot of black lung,” he told Colley.\n\nColley spent 37 years in dozens of mines in the region, from shoveling coal to working as a boss. Some mines were so small, he said, it was like working under a table.\n\nAs the seams grew narrower over the years, more rock was mined along with the coal, including silica-rich sandstone. He’d come out of the mine with a thick coat of rock dust on his hat.\n\nBy 2016, a lack of oxygen in his lungs made it too dangerous to work.\n\n“I was getting lost in the mines, I’d get confused and sit down and try to figure out how to get out. My brain just wouldn’t work,” he said. Nowadays, he said he spends his days inside his house, looking out his window, struggling to sleep or walk.\n\nThere’s no cure for black lung, only management. Harris told Colley he needed a lung transplant. He promised to talk to programs at hospitals in other states.\n\nColley is like most of Harris’ patients: Despite the price they paid for working in coal mines, few regret it. But Colley said safety measures that were hard-won over the decades should not fade away.\n\nThat was also on Hall's mind in Morgantown. She said that on the night of April 28, she got a phone call from local management telling her to report to work next week. She isn’t sure what that means yet for her termination, which was set for June after she was placed on administrative leave. “I hope the return to work order is a positive step to full reinstatement of operations for the coal workers’ health surveillance program that is so vital for the health of the nation's coal miners,\" she said.\n\nBack in Foster, Cash sat on a picnic table outside his home tucked in a valley framed by mountains where spring leaves were budding. It had been several months since his mine, which produced metallurgical coal, was idled by shrinking profits.\n\nHe was waiting for a new company mine to open. Tariffs, he said, probably aren’t helping. How the Trump administration’s policies would eventually land – or last – he couldn’t be sure.\n\nHe wants to work in mining for another 12 years before he retires. He loves the camaraderie, the family-like closeness of fellow miners. The prayers they say every day.\n\nUncertainty had always been part of being a coal miner. As soon as he could get back underground, he was ready.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/08/24/wisconsin-police-shooting-black-man-jacob-blake-national-guard-way-kenosha-7-shots-in-the-back/3430507001/", "title": "Kenosha on edge after police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin", "text": "Editor's note, Jan. 5, 2021: The police officers involved in the Jacob Blake shooting will not face criminal charges. See the latest here.\n\nThree months after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, sparking national protests, police in Kenosha shot a Black man in the back as he got into a car with his children inside, according to video and a statement from the attorney representing the man’s family.\n\nViolent unrest broke out after video of the shooting of Jacob Blake, 29, was widely disseminated on social media Sunday evening, prompting Gov. Tony Evers on Monday to call out the National Guard. The incident also propelled Wisconsin, already a battleground state in the upcoming presidential election, into the center of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the shots \"pierce the soul of our nation.\"\n\n\"Equal justice has not been real for Black Americans and so many others,” Biden went on to say. “We are at an inflection point. We must dismantle systemic racism. It is the urgent task before us. We must fight to honor the ideals laid in the original American promise, which we are yet to attain: That all men and women are created equal, but more importantly that they must be treated equally.\"\n\nBlake, who was shot at close range at least seven times, was in stable condition Monday after surgery, his father said in a Facebook video.\n\n“Stable. Still here,\" said his father, also named Jacob Blake. \"You can't take nothing that's not yours if you're not supposed to get it.\"\n\nAngry crowds gathered soon after Blake was shot shortly after 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nAt least three Kenosha garbage trucks were burned out and windows were shattered at several businesses. Written with spray paint on the courthouse: “They kill us because they fear us.” “Honor the dead.” And “Be water, spread fire.”\n\nA police officer was injured when he was struck by a brick. He was recovering and doing well Monday, Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian said at a news conference.\n\nThe unrest continued into Monday, as angry crowds tried to shove their way into the the Public Safety Building for an afternoon news conference. Later, police used tear gas on crowds gathered past the city's 8 p.m. curfew.\n\nThe events echoed those that occurred after Floyd’s death around the country, including in Milwaukee after the death of Joel Acevedo at the hands of an off-duty Milwaukee police officer.\n\nWisconsin DOJ to lead inquiry into shooting\n\nThe investigation into the shooting is being led by the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation.\n\nAttorney General Josh Kaul declined to provide further details about the shooting at a news conference Monday afternoon and did not answer questions about whether Blake had been armed during any point of the incident. He also did not say how many officers were involved in the shooting and did not name the officers.\n\nAuthorities said earlier in the day the officers had been placed on administrative leave.\n\n\"We understand that there is a need for this investigation to move swiftly,\" Kaul said. \"But we're only going to do so to the extent that is consistent with protecting the integrity of this investigation, because it is vital we get as full and thorough investigation as possible so we can pursue justice fully in this case.\"\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office has offered assistance, said Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley.\n\n“It’s my hope that they will do a parallel civil rights investigation. I’m hoping they will do an investigation that takes place at the same time, which will allow this community to heal sooner,” Graveley said.\n\nKenosha police officers are not equipped with body cameras. Antaramian said money for body cameras is in the city's 2022 budget. Officers do have dashboard cameras in their squads but authorities did not say if any part of the shooting had been captured on those cameras.\n\nSince 2003, Kenosha police have fatally shot at least four people. Three were white; one was Black. No officers were charged in any of the incidents.\n\nThe most high-profile among them was Michael Bell, who was shot point-blank in the head in front of his mother and sister in 2004. Bell's father, who shares his name, has spent years advocating for more accountability when police use deadly force. Largely due to his efforts, Wisconsin in 2014 became the first state to require all deaths at the hands or in the custody of police to be reviewed by an outside agency.\n\nDemonstrations continue\n\nAround noon Monday, a crowd gathered in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred to march toward the Kenosha County Courthouse. Some wore shirts that said “Lean on me\" while others held signs proclaiming “Black Lives Matter.”\n\nA group that started with about 50 people grew exponentially as the afternoon wore on. The situation became tense when a news conference scheduled for Civic Center Park was moved inside the Public Safety Building minutes before it was scheduled to begin.\n\nHundreds rushed to the building. Antaramian came out to talk but his words became inaudible as he was quickly surrounded. He went back inside, and many in the crowd attempted to follow.\n\nA door was snapped off its hinges, and police pepper-sprayed the crowd; five or 10 people were hit, including photographers from the Associated Press and Getty Images. Police in riot gear then came to guard the entrance.\n\nAfter waiting in the park, a group of about 200 began marching south on 10th Avenue. People came out of their businesses and looked out windows as the group of marchers passed by, mostly young people and a few families, many carrying signs.\n\nArriving at the intersection of 60th Street and 22nd Avenue, the group sat down for a \"die in,\" blocking the road with bicycles and their bodies and starting chants: \"Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like! Black lives matter! If we don’t get it, shut it down!\"\n\nLater in the day and evening, law enforcement dressed in riot gear again used tear gas against protesters, some of whom threw water bottles at them.\n\nA crowd gathered again in Civic Center Park across from the courthouse past the 8 p.m. curfew. Some stood and chanted \"Black lives matter\" while a few string musicians played classical music, reading from sheet music while a conductor kept them in time.\n\nMeanwhile, all I-94 exit ramps in Kenosha County were closed starting around 6 p.m. with police vehicles and trucks preventing motorists from getting off the highway. The ramp closures were a local decision and Department of Natural Resources vehicles provided support as part of Kenosha County’s mutual aid request, according to Evers' administration.\n\nVideo sparks unrest\n\nThe video posted on social media shows Blake, wearing a white shirt and black shorts, walking to a small gray SUV. There is nothing in his hands. Two male police officers follow him, their guns drawn.\n\nAs Blake opens the door to get into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt, then shoots him in the back at close range. Seven gunshots can be heard, followed by the car’s horn as Blake slumps forward. A woman who followed them to the SUV screams.\n\nThe man who claimed to have made the video, 22-year-old Raysean White, told the Associated Press he saw Blake scuffling with three officers and heard them yell, “Drop the knife! Drop the knife!” before the gunfire erupted. He said he didn’t see a knife in Blake’s hands.\n\nBlake’s family has retained attorney Benjamin Crump, who also represents Floyd’s family. Crump said three of Blake's six children were in the SUV when the shooting occurred.\n\n\"They saw a cop shoot their father,\" Crump tweeted. \"They will be traumatized forever. We cannot let officers violate their duty to PROTECT us. Our kids deserve better!!\"\n\nIn an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Crump said the boys in the SUV are ages 8, 5 and 3.\n\n“Hopefully the governor and everybody will do everything in their power to offer humanity to his family as they try to continue to see him survive this. The humanity that those police officers didn’t offer to him when they shot at him those seven times from point-blank range,” Crump said.\n\nAccording to police radio traffic, Kenosha police were dispatched to the 2800 block of 40th Street at 5:10 p.m. Sunday for “family trouble.”\n\n“Complaint says Jacob Blake isn’t supposed to be there and he took the complainant’s keys and ... is refusing to give them back,” the dispatcher said.\n\nThe caller then said Blake was leaving. The caller gave the dispatcher his license plate number, but not a description of the vehicle. About five minutes after the call came in, police radioed that shots had been fired and they needed backup.\n\nSeven minutes after the original call, at 5:18 p.m., the first ambulance was dispatched.\n\nKenosha police have not released more information about the shooting, saying only that officers were sent to the apartment for a “domestic incident.\" Authorities have not said if Blake was believed to be involved in that situation.\n\nBlake had an open warrant stemming from a domestic case in May, but police officials have not said if the officers were aware of the warrant when they responded to the call Sunday.\n\nA man who lives on Blake's street said about 15 minutes before the shooting, Blake was barbecuing with his kids.\n\nThe neighbor, who did not want his name used for fear of police retaliation, said he went to the store and returned shortly after 5 p.m., when he saw Blake trying to break up a fight.\n\nSeven or eight police officers arrived. They wanted to talk with Blake, but he wasn't interested and started putting his kids in the SUV to leave, the neighbor said.\n\n“He’d be out here with us right now,\" the man said Monday. \"It’s a bad dream. I’m just waiting for him to come outside.”\n\n'Do they see something we don't see on the video?'\n\nPolice are generally permitted to use deadly force if someone poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others. Most officers are trained to use less lethal methods first, if the situation permits. In most departments, shooting someone in the back is prohibited most of the time, but there are exceptions.\n\nJustin Nix, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha, said the video raised several questions.\n\n\"'What are they doing there? Who called them and what was relayed to dispatch and what was relayed from dispatch to the officers?'”\n\nHe said he could tell from watching it that Blake was not armed.\n\n\"I can see he’s trying to get to his vehicle. Then it happens really quickly, one officer tugging on his shirt, then you hear the gunshots. ... Do they see something we don’t see on the video?”\n\nIf they saw Blake reaching for a gun, he said, their use of force might have been justified.\n\n“Officers can use deadly force in Kenosha and elsewhere when they believe there’s an imminent threat to their own lives or the lives of others,\" Nix said. \"It could be appropriate if he’s almost got his hands on a gun and they think he’s about to turn and shoot. Just saying he was shot in the back, there could conceivably be a justification for that — and I’m not saying there was.”\n\nEvers calls for special session\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers on Monday called lawmakers into session to take action on a package of bills aimed at reducing the prevalence of police brutality. The move would ban police chokeholds and no-knock search warrants and make it harder for overly aggressive officers to move from one job to another.\n\nEvers on Sunday had this to say: \"While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.\"\n\nBut Republicans who control the state Legislature and Evers don't see eye to eye on the moment's urgency.\n\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos said he's forming a task force focusing on racial disparities, educational opportunities, public safety and police policies and standards.\n\nSuch task forces typically take months to develop proposed legislation.\n\n\"This is not a time for political posturing or to suggest defunding law enforcement. When a community is hurting, the most important thing that we can do is to listen,\" Vos, R-Rochester, said in statement. \"We must find a path forward as a society that brings everyone together.”\n\nA GoFundMe page for Blake's family can be found at https://www.gofundme.com/f/justiceforjacobblake.\n\nJessica Rodriguez, Molly Beck, Evan Casey, Sophie Carson, Elliot Hughes, Ashley Luthern, Jordyn Noenning, Talis Shelbourne and Bruce Vielmetti of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.\n\nContact Gina Barton at (414) 224-2125 or gbarton@gannett.com.

The day after he was inaugurated, more than two million people across the world called for a \"revolution\" as a bulwark against the new administration they feared would roll back reproductive, civil and human rights.\n\nThe year that followed was no less dramatic.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted from the White House over his Russian contacts. NFL players continued to kneel. There were multiple data breaches, but none larger than Equifax, which compromised the personal information of nearly half of all Americans.\n\nInevitably, there was tragedy. The catastrophic 2017 hurricane season brought us Harvey, Irma and Maria, which Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico will spend years recovering from. New York City saw its worst terrorist attack since 9/11. In Las Vegas, 58 people died in the worst mass shooting in American history.\n\nBut there was also wonder. For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. We celebrated the news that one of our own, California native Meghan Markle, is set to wed Prince Harry and become the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family.\n\nIn the end, 2017 closes with hope. Women punctuated the year with the powerful rallying cry #metoo, prompting a national reckoning on a culture of sexual violence that has persisted unabated for far too long.\n\nAfter another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state — the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about.\n\nAlabama: Roy Moore and America’s reckoning on sexual violence\n\nThe eyes of a nation were fixed on Alabama this December to see who the state would choose to take over its open Senate seat in an election that was seen not only as a referendum on President Trump — who supported embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore — but also on the country's tolerance of predatory sexual behavior. Trump was elected in spite of more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. But Moore, who was accused in November of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple teenage girls when he was in his 30s, was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones. It is the first time in 25 years that Alabama has elected a Democrat to the Senate.\n\nThe Alabama special election came during what America has come to refer to as its \"post-Weinstein moment,\" a reckoning on powerful men who have abused women with impunity, and who, until recently, rarely faced consequences. Since the reports Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein harassed, abused and assaulted more than 80 women over several decades, women around the country who have long suffered in silence flooded social media under the hashtag #metoo and made public statements about the sexual misconduct they've endured. For many Americans, this reckoning is complicated by Trump's presence in the White House. Trump's accusers have revived calls for a congressional investigation into his misconduct. Some say Jones’ victory will embolden Democrats to do just that.\n\nAlaska: Fear of climate change rises after U.S. leaves Paris Accord\n\nIn 2017, America became the only country on Earth not part of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Trump decided to leave the pact in June. The Paris agreement, negotiated by former president Barack Obama, aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Alaska, climate change is always front-of-mind. Many residents of Sarichef Island and an Iñupiaq village of 650 blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island’s erosion and fear leaving the Paris agreement will supercharge destruction that's already occurring.\n\nArizona: McCain, battling brain cancer, stops Obamacare repeal\n\nIt was a tense July night on the Senate floor when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — roughly a week after announcing his brain cancer diagnosis — sunk the GOP-backed \"skinny repeal\" of Obamacare with a dramatic \"thumbs down.\" Before the vote, congressional leaders had struggled to reach consensus on a plan to replace former president Barack Obama's signature health care law, which the GOP had promised for seven years to expunge the law from the books. Republicans ultimately scrapped a vote on a last-ditch Obamacare repeal effort in September, which McCain also opposed. As for his health, McCain said in September he would continue treatments for brain cancer while also doing his job on Capitol Hill.\n\nArkansas: Controversial Ten Commandments monument destroyed after less than 24 hours\n\nAfter years of fierce debate, Arkansas built a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol building. Less than 24 hours later, the monument was razed. Michael Tate Reed, 32, plowed his car through the statue while filming the incident on his cellphone and posting the video on Facebook, authorities said. The 6-foot, 6,000-pound memorial drew the ire of opponents like the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Temple of Satan, who said the monument was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. Supporters saw it as a way to celebrate the role the Ten Commandments played in this country’s law. State Sen. Jason Rapert, who led the push to initially erect the monument, vowed to raise funds to build its replacement.\n\nCalifornia: Meghan Markle, America's fairy-tale royal bride\n\nRoyal wedding bells are ringing yet again. Suits actress and California native Meghan Markle is set to wed Prince Harry, the world's most eligible royal bachelor. The couple announced their engagement in November. Markle, who was raised in Los Angeles, will make history as the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. After they wed, Harry will likely receive a new royal title as a duke from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Markle will, like Duchess Kate, be known as a titled royal duchess, HRH Meghan, Duchess of so-and-so. Also in royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton announced they are expecting their third child. Sister Pippa Middleton's May wedding was the A-list event of the year.\n\nColorado: Baker's confections vs. gay couple's affections\n\nIn 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins went into baker Jack Phillips' Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., to buy a cake for their wedding. But Phillips doesn't do cakes for same-sex weddings. Craig and Mullins said Phillips' refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Five years later, their disagreement over a cake went all the way to the Supreme Court in a case testing the Constitution's guarantee of free speech and religion against state laws prohibiting discrimination. The court, bolstered in April by the addition of stalwart conservative and fellow Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, appeared split down the middle when the justices heard oral arguments Dec. 5. The decision, which will likely hinge on Justice Anthony Kennedy, isn't expected until next year.\n\nConnecticut: Hate crime, or roommate feud gone too far?\n\nIn late October, former University of Hartford student Briana Brochu was charged with breach of peace and criminal mischief for tampering with items that belonged to her roommate, who is black. Brochu admitted she licked Chennel \"Jazzy\" Rowe's eating utensils and smeared bodily fluids on her backpack. Rowe posted a Facebook video about the incident, which quickly viral, and prompted backlash on social media as many questioned whether Brochu's actions were racially motivated. The Connecticut NAACP and others called on Hartford prosecutors to file a hate crime charge against Brochu, but Brochu's lawyer, Thomas Stevens, told the Hartford Courant he does not believe the charge will be added. Stevens told the paper there was nothing \"racial that motivated\" the incident, and said they were simply roommates who did not get along.\n\nDelaware: Beau's death convinced Joe Biden not to run for president\n\nHad he run for president, Joe Biden believes he would have taken the oath of office Jan. 20 rather than the train home to Wilmington. The former vice president and Delaware senator, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom days before leaving office, revealed in his emotional book that he originally considered staying out of the 2016 race to pave the way for his son Beau's budding political career, and Beau’s death following a brutal bout with cancer ultimately convinced him it wasn’t the time to make the run. So what about a 2020 push? He hasn’t ruled it out quite yet.\n\nFlorida: Irma devastates the Gulf coast\n\nHurricane Irma sawed up Florida's Gulf coast in early September, the strongest hurricane the Sunshine State had faced in a decade. Its slow crawl toward Florida caused a run on hardware store and grocery essentials, while evacuation orders threw the state's highways into a standstill. After it pummeled Key West, the storm struck the Naples area, taking down trees and causing flooding across the state. All told, millions lost power and dozens died, including 14 people at a Hollywood nursing home, where a power outage left residents in sweltering conditions for three days. It sparked a criminal investigation in which 12 of the deaths were deemed homicides. Now, state lawmakers seek laws requiring assisted living facilities to have generators.\n\nGeorgia: Equifax data breach leaves millions of consumers vulnerable\n\nAtlanta-based company Equifax, once trusted to handle our credit scores, has become a pariah of the financial world since hackers stole the vital information of 145 million Americans in Equifax’s system. The breach announced this September included Social Security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth. How did Equifax get into the mess? A security patch for a known system bug was issued but Equifax hadn’t installed it. Lawmakers asked questions, the CEO resigned, and a good chunk of America freaked out. One way consumers tried to protect themselves was by freezing their credit, but since everyone tried to do it at once, there were problems. Here's how to protect yourself from a breach.\n\nHawaii: Trump travel ban found trouble in paradise\n\nThe Aloha State was not a welcoming place for President Trump's plans to ban travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. The administration issued three versions of the ban in 2017 and all three were blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii. But despite the Hawaii bench’s best efforts to thwart the ban, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this month that Trump’s order can take full effect while legal challenges against the latest version are still tied up in courts. By allowing the full travel ban to take effect for now, the justices may be signaling that they are likely to uphold it on the merits at a later date.\n\nIdaho: Bergdahl avoids jail time for disappearing from Afghanistan base\n\nSgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army soldier who disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, avoided jail time despite pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy. Former president Barack Obama won freedom for the Idaho native in 2014 by negotiating a prisoner swap with the Taliban militants. His case even became the subject of the second season of the podcast Serial. Bergdahl faced a life sentence for abandoning his post, but a military judge ruled to reduce him in rank to private and dishonorably discharge him. President Trump slammed the decision in a tweet, calling it, \"a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.\"\n\nIllinois: Conspiracy, obstruction charges in Laquan McDonald killing\n\nThe dash cam footage was chilling. Sixteen shots fired at Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police. Now prosecutors say three Chicago police officers were trying to \"conceal the true facts\" in McDonald's death. A Cook County grand jury indicted the officers in June with state charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and misconduct. \"These defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial 'code of silence,'\" special prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes said of the alleged coverup. Officer Jason Van Dyke previously pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trail on first-degree murder charges.\n\nIndiana: A canceled wedding, but love prevails\n\nWhen an Indiana couple called off their $30,000 wedding a week before the big day, they were stuck with a non-refundable reception. What did would-be bride Sarah Cummins do? She invited guests from four area homeless shelters. Her generosity inspired a local man to donate suits for guests, his tailor donated a few more and another local business contributed dresses and accessories. The July dinner, which included chicken, salmon, wedding cake and even a late-night snack of pizza, turned a painful situation positive, Cummins said. She now volunteers for a center for homeless families in Indianapolis.\n\nIowa: A giant wave connects sick kids to the outside world\n\nThe new children's hospital practically hangs over the University of Iowa's Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Before the season kicked off, a fan named Krista Young had an idea: \"Kinnick should hold a 'wave to the kids' minute during every game.\" The Facebook post went viral and on Sept. 2, when the Hawkeyes' football team hosted the Wyoming Cowboys, 68,000-plus fans rose, turned to the hospital and offered a long, sustained wave to sick children — some of whom haven't left in months — gathered near the windows to watch the game. Kristen Brown, a nurse at the Stead Family Children's Hospital, said the now-regular waves connect kids to the outside world. \"Anytime we can make them feel normal and a part of something, it's very meaningful,\" she said.\n\nKansas: Principal resigns after student newspaper questions her credentials\n\nA team of high school journalism students in Kansas published an investigative story questioning their incoming principal's qualifications. And then she resigned. The student reporters received national recognition after they revealed that Amy Robertson, their would-be new principal, received her master's and doctoral degrees from Corllins University, an unaccredited online school. Robertson, who currently works with an education consulting firm in Dubai, said she received her degrees before the university lost accreditation. The Pittsburg School Board accepted Robertson's resignation in April.\n\nKentucky: Passenger's removal from United flight sparks uproar\n\nOn April 9, Kentucky doctor David Dao was shown on video being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville. Dao was among four passengers scheduled to be removed to accommodate crew members. The footage of Dao screaming as he was pulled from the plane went viral. Days later, Dao's lawyer said he suffered a concussion and broken nose. The incident prompted United to make changes to its passenger policies. Two security officers involved in the incident were fired.\n\nLouisiana: 'I'm back': Steve Scalise returns to Congress after shooting\n\nWith two words, \"I'm back,\" Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise tweeted his remarkable return to the U.S. Capitol after a gunman critically wounded him during a congressional baseball team practice on June 14 outside Washington, D.C. Four others were shot before the gunman was killed. Scalise was discharged from the hospital six weeks later to begin a process of intensive rehabilitation. On September 28, Scalise got back to work, tweeting a photo of him and his wife Jennifer looking out at the National Mall from the Capitol. His return to the House floor was met by a standing ovation. \"You have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's House.\"\n\nMaine: Thousands send Christmas cards to dying boy\n\nJacob Thompson just wanted to celebrate one more Christmas. The 9-year-old from Maine, who had been diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma in February 2014, made a simple request when he was admitted to the hospital in October and was told he had only a month to live: Send Christmas cards. Tens of thousands of cards flew into Jacob's small hospital room as the boy's story captured the hearts of people across the nation. Having a love for penguins, he even got a special visit when the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut brought the tuxedo birds to meet their young fan. Thompson died Nov. 19.\n\nMaryland: The day the NFL took a knee\n\nNFL players responded in full force on a Sunday in September after President Trump repeatedly called for punishing players who didn’t stand during the national anthem. In the first game that day, a number of teammates from the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars either knelt or locked arms at a high-profile game in London. Landover, Md.-based Washington Redskins players stood with arms locked, though some players chose to kneel. And across the league demonstrations spread, as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity. The protests first began in the 2016 season, when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick said it was his way of speaking out against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nMassachusetts: Michelle Carter gets 15 months in prison for texting boyfriend to commit suicide\n\n\"You can't think about it. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it.\" Michelle Carter, 20, sent dozens of texts like this encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy III, 18, to commit suicide, which Roy eventually did after Carter instructed him to get back in a truck filling with carbon monoxide. Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, of which she'll serve 15 months. The case was the first to determine the legality of telling someone to commit suicide. Legal experts are concerned that it could set a bad legal precedent.\n\nMichigan: '90s grunge lost an icon in Chris Cornell\n\nSoundgarden singer Chris Cornell's distinctive, nearly four-octave wail was nearly synonymous with the grunge-music era of the 1990s. Just hours after performing for a Detroit crowd in May, the 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his hotel room. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death a suicide by hanging, although his family questioned the findings. Cornell was just one among many celebrities we lost this year.\n\nMinnesota: #MeToo movement hits Minnesota hard\n\nDemocratic Senator Al Franken announced his resignation in December after more than a half dozen women said he touched them improperly or made unwanted sexual advances. Franken disputed some accusations and suggested he was being held to a different standard than President Trump. Franken became the second member of Congress to announce his resignation due to sexual harassment allegations in 2017. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights icon first elected to the House in 1964, stepped down after several women accused him of harassment. Franken's fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor, the iconic Prairie Home Companion host, was fired in November after allegations of \"inappropriate behavior.\"\n\nMississippi: Bringing 'insane asylum' dead back to life\n\nUp to 7,000 dead bodies are buried underneath the University of Mississippi Medical Center campus. They are former patients of the state's first mental institution, called simply the Insane Asylum, built in 1855. Underground radar shows the coffins stretch across 20 acres of the campus. UMMC discovered 66 coffins while doing construction on the campus in 2013, but has since detected thousands more. UMMC is now teaming up with a professor from Millsaps College in Jackson for a possible National Endowment of Humanities grant that would fund a study of the asylum and its history as well as engage families whose ancestors lived there. The center is looking at exhuming the bodies, and preserving as well as studying the remains.\n\nMissouri: Girl mistakes elk for deer, shoots it dead, story goes viral\n\nAbby Wilson, 14, was hunting alone when she said she spotted a very large white-tailed deer and pulled the trigger. The problem? It wasn't a deer. It was an elk. Her father, Donald White, immediately called the conservation department upon realizing his daughter's mistake. Because there's no elk hunting season in Missouri, the animals are protected and wildlife officials are determining whether to issue any citations or warnings to the young hunter. After the story went viral, White said comments directed at her, including that she should be locked up, amounted to bullying.\n\nMontana: Body slam shows just one of many threats facing journalists\n\nThe first year of the Trump era was a tough one for American journalists. On top of competing with \"alternative facts\" and being labeled the \"enemy of the American people\" by the president, some reporters were physically stopped from doing their jobs. In May, wealthy businessman Greg Gianforte, who was running for Montana's open House seat, was arrested for assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of the election. Gianforte won over Montana voters but apparently lied to investigators after the body slam.\n\nNebraska: Sasse sasses Trump\n\nIt's no secret that Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse took his fair share of jabs at President Trump this year. The young Republican from Plainview recently asked the president if he was \"recanting\" his oath of office following an apparent threat of the freedom of the press. He also called out Trump for his Twitter attack on the hosts of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" saying \"it's beneath the dignity of your office.\" Sasse's and other GOP legislators', well, sass, highlights Trump's struggle to make nice with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nNevada: Deadliest year for mass killings in more than a decade\n\nOn Oct. 1, America changed forever when a gunman shattered his hotel windows at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas and opened fire on 22,000 country music fans at the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival. Fifty-eight would die in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nearly 500 were injured. The gunman's motive remains a mystery. A wounded country came together again in November when a gunman killed 25 people, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas. With that, 2017 earned a bitter honor of being the most deadly year for mass killings in the U.S. in more than a decade. Three of the five largest mass killings — in Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. — have taken place since June 2016.\n\nNew Hampshire: Voter fraud or bogus claims?\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, President Trump called for a crackdown on voter fraud. Trump claimed he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. The solution? A voter fraud election commission was set up to investigate the matter. To date, legal experts and the New Hampshire deputy secretary of state said there is no evidence of voter fraud and the commission itself seems to have gone dark in recent weeks, with the last meeting held Sept. 12 in the Granite State.\n\nNew Jersey: Chris Christie feels the heat over 'beachgate'\n\nJust before the Fourth of July, Governor Chris Christie was spotted lounging outside his residence on Island Beach State Park. The only problem? He'd just closed that beach to the public — and all the other state parks in New Jersey — thanks to a state government shutdown. The photo became the source of endless memes, and New Jersey residents told the governor to \"get the hell off the beach!\" A few weeks before \"beachgate,\" a poll found Christie's approval ratings had sunk to 15%, making him the least popular governor in any state in the past 20 years. After legislators struck a deal in ending the three day shutdown in time for the holiday, Christie announced he was headed right back to the beach.\n\nNew Mexico: Plague found, and this isn't the first time\n\nThe plague, once called the Black Death, wiped out nearly half of the European population in the Middle Ages. And while it sounds like a disease that should have no place in modern times, each spring and summer cases pop up, often in Western areas. In late June, New Mexico confirmed a total of three cases of the plague in Santa Fe County. According to the New Mexico Department of Health, all three were hospitalized and later released. So, how does one get the plague? It’s typically transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, and while terrifying sounding, it can be treated if the symptoms are recognized early.\n\nNew York: Terror in NYC\n\nIt was New York City's worst terrorist attack since 9/11, and occurred just a few blocks away from where the iconic twin towers crumbled. This November, Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan with ties to the Islamic State, ran down cyclists and pedestrians on a busy bike path before crashing into a school bus, killing 8 people and injuring 12. Saipov's killings occurred mere hours before the city's annual Halloween parade was to kick off, but revelers were undeterred. Amid heavier police presence, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a million people who marched and danced down 6th Avenue in defiance of terror. De Blasio said, \"What New Yorkers showed already is we will not change, we will not be cowed, we will not be thrown off by anything.\"\n\nNorth Carolina: Gerrymandering case struck down case, but what’s next?\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in June struck down dozens of state legislative districts in North Carolina because they disadvantaged black voters. Then, federal judges rejected a request by North Carolina voters to hold special elections next March in new districts once lines are redrawn to eliminate illegal racial gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the deliberate process of redrawing lines to sway electoral outcomes in favor of a certain political party. As Karl Rove once said: \"He who controls redistricting can control Congress.\" The issue has also been disputed in other states across the USA this year, particularly Wisconsin, which has a gerrymandering case before the Supreme Court with far-reaching national implications.\n\nNorth Dakota: Dakota Access Pipeline flows amid controversy\n\nAfter months of protests from environmental groups and Native American activists, the Army said it would allow the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota, completing the disputed project. The 1,200-mile pipeline began transporting crude oil on June 1 from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution hub in Illinois. Activists renewed calls to shut it down after a federal judge ruled the Army Corps of Engineers complied with some, but not all, requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing a permit. The developer of the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has since filed a $1 billion federal lawsuit against several environmental groups accusing them of fraud, eco-terrorism and participation in a criminal enterprise.\n\nOhio: Otto Warmbier's death, and a year of high-stakes tension with North Korea\n\nThe death of Ohio native Otto Warmbier was a heartbreaking moment in a year of marked tensions with North Korea. Warmbier, a college student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea on charges of trying to steal a poster. The 22-year-old was returned home in June in a coma; he died shortly thereafter. Pyongyang denied it tortured or mistreated him, claiming Warmbier contracted botulism and was given a sleeping pill. Throughout 2017, President Trump and Kim Jong Un, whom Trump dubbed \"Little Rocket Man,\" exchanged ever more heated threats over North Korea's rapid development of nuclear weapons that could strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nOklahoma: Another blow to Black Lives Matter\n\n\"Hands up, don't shoot,\" became a rallying cry after Michael Brown was killed in 2014 in Ferguson, Mo. Terence Crutcher had his hands up. Police shot. In May, a jury acquitted of first-degree manslaughter white Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby, who says she fired out of fear last year when she killed 40-year-old Crutcher. His family burst into tears at the verdict. In a video of the incident, the Tulsa Police Department can be heard saying Crutcher \"looks like a bad dude.\" Crutcher's twin sister later said, \"That 'big bad dude' was a father ... a son.\" The controversial verdict led to protests from Black Lives Matter. Shelby has since resigned from the Tulsa Police Department.\n\nOregon: The Great American Eclipse captivates a nation\n\nFor the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. Americans paused and enjoyed some unity as the moon passed between the sun and the Earth. Many traveled to the path of totality to experience the eerie darkness. From coast to coast, Americans watched — hopefully while wearing eclipse glasses — as the moon's shadow traced its 67-mile wide path across the country starting in Oregon. Those 2-3 minutes of darkness brought millions of tourist dollars to hotels, campgrounds, restaurants and museums in cities in the eclipse path.\n\nPennsylvania: They gave him 18 drinks. Then, left him to die\n\nThe horrifying death of a 19-year-old fraternity pledge captured on video exposed dangerous hazing rituals by members of Penn State University's Beta Theta Pi. After frat brothers gave Timothy Piazza 18 drinks in less than one hour and 22 minutes, his blood-alcohol content was about four times the legal limit for driving. Piazza was found unconscious in the basement the next day and later died. At least two dozen face charges in the case. Three other pledges across the nation died this year in Greek-related drinking incidents.\n\nRhode Island: Michael Flynn, and the role of Russia in the 2016 election\n\nDespite being one of the most vulnerable figures in special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn remained beloved in his Rhode Island hometown in 2017. Flynn was ousted from the White House just weeks after President Trump's inauguration over his Russian contacts, and in December, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn is among four campaign aides charged so far in Mueller's investigation. Flynn is the only one who served in Trump's administration. The only other guilty plea is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign associate Rick Gates have been charged and pleaded not guilty. In addition to Mueller's investigation, three Congressional committees are looking at Russia.\n\nSouth Carolina: Governor stands by Trump amid sanctuary city crackdown\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made it clear in October that the Palmetto State would not tolerate any cities acting as sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. The governor's strong condemnation of sanctuary cities came months after President Trump's executive order cracking down on cities that limit cooperation with immigration agencies. Following the order, leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities, including New York City, Chicago, and Boston, flatly stated they would not cooperate with the president. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked Trump's executive order on sanctuary cities.\n\nSouth Dakota: Old gold mine might hold treasured info on why we exist\n\nResearchers are in search of a different kind of treasure in a rural South Dakota gold mine: potential secrets explaining how the universe was created. The mine in Lead, S.D., that once hosted gold rushes in the 1800s will serve as home to scientists participating in the largest U.S.-based particle physics experiment. The experiment will determine whether particles called neutrinos help explain our existence. Over the next 10 years, workers will remove more than 870,000 tons of rock and install a four-story, 70,000-ton neutrino detector. The collaboration will involve 1,000 scientists from more than 30 countries.\n\nTennessee: Tuition-free community college\n\nTennessee students can put away their checkbooks if community colleges are in their future. In May, the southern state became the first to offer a tuition-free education to nearly every resident without a degree. Even though Tennessee was the first state to pass the measure, it isn't without precursors. New York legislators passed a budget in April that covered tuition for families making less than $100,000 a year. In February, San Francisco voters passed a tax measure that would cover community college tuition for anyone who lived in the city for more than a year, though the state of California did not follow suit.\n\nTexas: Hurricane Harvey hit hard\n\nHurricane Harvey's historic downpour brought destruction to the Texas Gulf coast. Harvey killed dozens, dumped more than 50 inches of rain and drove thousands from their homes. Its effects will be felt for months and years into the future. Amid the destruction, people stepped up to help. There was Houston Texans star J.J. Watt raising more than $37 million in online donations, human chains pulling people to safety and an impromptu gospel singing performance at a shelter. Watt perhaps put it best: \"When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest.\"\n\nUtah: Outcry over nurse's arrest for refusing to draw unconscious patient's blood\n\nA Utah police officer was fired after he arrested a nurse who refused to let him draw blood from an unconscious patient without a warrant. Body cam footage of the arrest shows Detective Jeff Payne dragging Alex Wubbels from University Hospital while she sobs \"this is crazy.\" An investigation was opened after video of the arrest went viral, and Wubbels received a $500,000 settlement from the city and the university that runs the hospital. She said she would give a portion of the settlement to the nurses union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job.\n\nVermont: This 13-year-old wants to be governor\n\nEthan Sonneborn, 13, has some lofty political ambitions. The young Democrat announced this summer that he's running for governor in 2018, and with Vermont's founders imposing no age requirement for its highest office, his path to power is a little easier. The Bristol resident follows the news closely, chooses his words deliberately and sees his age as an asset, not a liability. \"We elected our oldest president ever,\" Sonneborn said, \"and he tweets like a kindergartner.\" His views on the president echo those of prominent Vermont progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told USA TODAY one year after the election that Trump's presidency is an \"unprecedented disaster.\" A hot topic Sonneborn would have to address if elected: recreational marijuana. Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a legalization bill in May, a decision with which Sonneborn took issue.\n\nVirginia: White supremacy in Charlottesville\n\nIt's 2017, and there were neo-Nazis in the streets. In August, hundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis descended upon Charlottesville, Va., for a \"Unite the Right\" rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally turned violent when James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, who had expressed support for neo-Nazi positions, drove his car at high speed into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. President Trump was reticent to condemn the white supremacists, saying \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence. After his comments, Heyer's mother said she wouldn't take phone calls from the president. The rally was headlined by far-right white nationalist Richard Spencer, who returned to the city for another protest in October. Here's why Charlottesville has become ground zero for white supremacists.\n\nWashington: Amazon's new dome home\n\nAmazon joined Apple and Google in the race to build futuristic tech headquarters, introducing the Spheres, three (you guessed it) spheres that will \"round\" out the Seattle cityscape. The tallest of the glass and metal orbs rises 90 feet and is more than 130 feet in diameter, with two smaller spheres on each side. The space will host up to 800 employees for potential meetings, meals and mingling. It will also feature plenty of plant life, along with tree-house meeting rooms, a river and waterfalls, and a green \"bird's nest\" conference room. The rest of the public can visit through shops located near the entrance or by signing up for tours once it opens next year.\n\nWest Virginia: Coal country digs Trump\n\nWest Virginia, once a Democratic stronghold, is now Trump country. West Virginia’s conservative shift has been so pronounced that Gov. Jim Justice changed his political stripes in August and flipped from Democrat to Republican after just seven months in office. The state hasn't gone Democrat in a presidential election since 1996, and Hillary Clinton lost there by more than 40%. President Trump, who promised to bring coal mining jobs back, also got 77% of the vote in the Republican primary there. Trump took a lot of heat for politicizing the Boy Scout Jamboree held in West Virginia in July (prompting an apology from the Boy Scouts) but he was right back in the state the following week to rally the base and tout an end to \"war on beautiful clean coal.\"\n\nWisconsin: Blacked-out vacationers suspect tainted booze\n\nAbbey Conner went on a family vacation to an all-inclusive Mexican resort in January, but shortly after arriving, she was found face down in the pool, brain dead. Connor's death days later sparked a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that found 100-plus people saying they blacked out from moderate to light drinking at Mexican resorts. Some were robbed. Others were raped. Few ever found justice. The State Department issued an alert about possibly tainted or counterfeit alcohol. Mexican officials swept tourist spots and claimed to seize 10,000 gallons of illegal booze from a shoddy distributer. They reported no such evidence at the resort where Connor drowned.\n\nWyoming: Trump national parks moves met with backlash\n\nThis year may have been your last chance to visit Yellowstone without doling out $70 to do so. The Trump administration in October proposed a price increase for the Wyoming landmark and 16 other national parks. Trump also faced criticism — and legal action — for his decision to shrink federally protected land by about two million acres in Bear Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah earlier this month. In April, Trump signed an executive order to review more than a dozen national monuments across the USA.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Nation's capital becomes epicenter of the #resistance\n\nHome to the most massive manifestations of opposition to the Trump agenda in a year that saw #resistance protests and marches against the administration across the country, Washington, D.C., became a hotbed for public demonstrations countering the president. The Women's March on Washington was the first and fiercest, coming the day after Trump's inauguration (which did NOT draw the biggest crowd to the National Mall in history, despite some claims to the contrary) and drawing an estimated 500,000 people angered at a president accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. Huge crowds also gathered for the March for Science, the People's Climate March and the March for Truth. Forgot about September's pro-Trump, Mother of All Rallies? It's understandable. Only a thousand folks turned out and it was held the same day as the historic Juggalo March.\n\nPuerto Rico: Maria devastates Puerto Rico, fueling feud with Trump\n\nHurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico in late September, causing unprecedented devastation to the island of 3.4 million people. The storm knocked out the majority of Puerto Rico's power and sparked a feud between the island and President Trump. For those unclear, Puerto Rico is indeed part of the United States — it's a commonwealth — and yes, its residents are U.S. citizens. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz took shots at Trump for the government's response to Maria, which she called \"inadequate.\" Trump publicly bashed Cruz, saying she had \"poor leadership ability.\" Months after the storm, large parts of the island remained without power, prompting Washington to seek efforts to modernize Puerto Rico's power grid.\n\nGuam: Priest sex abuse cases shatter faith on Guam\n\nThe predominantly Catholic island of Guam was rocked when a Pacific Daily News investigation unearthed decades of sexual assault, manipulation and intimidation against children reared on the remote U.S. territory by some of its most revered men, the Catholic clergy. At least 143 cases of child sexual abuse have been reported against Catholic priests tied to Guam. Of those cases, 87 involve a single former priest and scoutmaster, Louis Brouillard, who allegedly committed horrendous sexual crimes against children, including accounts of rape, drugging and even tying up a boy before forced sex acts. Also among the accusations: a boy fondled on the way to his grandmother's burial, and another molested for the first time on his seventh birthday, then raped or assaulted 100 more times.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands: Ravaged by back-to-back hurricanes\n\nBefore Hurricanes Irma and Maria made their way to Florida and Puerto Rico, they tore through the U.S. Virgin Islands, a cluster of American islands in the Caribbean. Weeks after the back-to-back September storms, Virgin Islanders – who are Americans by birth – were in the grips of a long and painful recovery. Thousands went without power, and telephone and internet coverage remained spotty. Many fled – perhaps never to return. When USA TODAY reporter Fredreka Schouten returned home, she found family and friends' houses torn apart, and her former school with windows blown out and metal littered about. The destruction brought back memories of past devastating storms – Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nRemember when?\n\nThis is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.

But among seas of people in red, white and gold merch, flags and signs with Swift’s name also wave in the breeze. You’ll often hear more about the musician than her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nAnd as the 2024 presidential election approaches, you’ll also hear about Swift’s seismic endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSwift’s support was by far the most coveted endorsement of the election season. She fueled months of anticipation as liberal Swifties organized – and conspiracy theories about her public persona cropped up among parts of the right.\n\nSwift’s connection to the NFL has represented American fandom at its peak: Football; pop music and, for the last few months, political speculation about when she would formally endorse the Democratic nominee.\n\nMoments after Harris and former President Donald Trump's debate, Swift backed the vice president in an Instagram post to her 284 million followers, calling her “a steady-handed, gifted leader.”\n\nThe cultural and financial juggernaut didn't mention Trump, except to call out fake images of her supporting him, which the former president reposted on Truth Social. She signed her Tuesday statement as a “childless cat lady,” a reference to Sen. JD Vance’s comments about people without children.\n\nSwift’s attendance at football games has always sparked controversy, with some fans saying she draws attention to the sport and others calling the songwriter a distraction. Endorsing a presidential candidate didn’t make Swift a less contentious presence at the Chiefs’ Sunday game against the Cincinnati Bengals, which they narrowly won.\n\nSheena Bryant, a 38-year-old realtor from Branson, Missouri, spent Sunday afternoon tailgating outside Arrowhead Stadium. She’s a Republican but said she enjoys Swift’s music.\n\n\"I wasn't a big fan of (Swift's endorsement,)\" Bryant said. She believes everyone has a right to endorse either party, but she's hopeful Republicans can notch victories this fall and act on abortion and the southern border.\n\n\"Hopefully her followers will ask deeper level questions of why they're supporting,\" Bryant said, explaining that she thinks young women, a pivotal voting bloc this fall, could be particularly persuaded by Swift.\n\nChiefs fans also had plenty to say about Swift’s friendship with Brittany Mahomes, the businesswoman and wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. While Brittany Mahomes hasn’t publicly endorsed a 2024 candidate, she drew attention after appearing to like a MAGA Instagram post last month.\n\nChiefs fans on Sunday said friends with different political positions should respect each other. Jason Schuler, a 46 year old from Kansas City who works in development with children with disabilities, said “that’s what this country’s lost.”\n\n“If my buddy over here has a difference of opinion with me, which we often do, it doesn’t mean that he’s wrong or I’m wrong,” Schuler said.\n\nTrump and Vance tried to shake off Swift’s endorsement last week. Vance told Fox News Swift’s wealth makes her “fundamentally disconnected” from most Americans.\n\nTrump in a Sunday morning post on Truth Social to his 7.7 million followers said, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”\n\nThe former president also warned in an interview with Fox last week that Swift could “pay a price” for her statement among music consumers.\n\nBut if you walk around Arrowhead Stadium’s wide concourses on game day, you’ll see a clear sign Swift’s fans haven’t abandoned her: Friendship bracelets.\n\n‘Thank you Taylor’\n\nFriendship bracelets became the signature Swiftie accessory during her record-breaking Eras Tour. They’re a reference to Swift’s song “You’re on Your Own Kid,” in which she sings “So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.”\n\nLauren Burwell, a 33-year-old director of a youth behavioral mental health program, sat outside Arrowhead Stadium waiting for a friend before the Chiefs game. She wore friendship bracelets referencing the Chiefs, but also Swift’s song “Betty” and her album “The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\nShe said she loved Swift’s endorsement and reposted it on Instagram.\n\n“The best thing about her is that she just wants people to vote and just do their research. So when I saw that, my first thought was ‘Thank you Taylor,’” Burwell said.\n\nRyann Williams and Hilary Embry sat near a bar inside Arrowhead Stadium after kickoff. They called themselves \"big fans\" of Swift's endorsement.\n\nAsked about Trump's post saying he hates Swift, Williams called it \"really childish.\" But both women said they feared Swift could face violence as the former president's escalates his insults against her.\n\n\"Mostly I hope that Taylor stays safe, you know? I hope it doesn't incite any sort of activity against her. He has a lot of influence, just like she does. It feels dangerous and scary,\" the 36-year-old environmental scientist from Kansas City, said.\n\n\"I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,\" Embry a 37-year-old salon owner from Kansas City, added.\n\nSwift’s Harris endorsement isn't the first time she’s talked about politics. The 14-time Grammy winner endorsed President Joe Biden and Harris in 2020, and she’s said she regrets not getting involved in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSwift in her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana” also knocked Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., calling her “Trump in a wig.”\n\nSome of Swift’s presence in American politics hasn’t been voluntary. Conservative conspiracy theories swirled earlier this year that Swift was part of a Pentagon plot fueled by Democrats to sway the 2024 election. Others falsely alleged her relationship with Kelce is a PR effort to boost the Chiefs, or the NFL as a whole.\n\nA Monmouth University poll released in February found nearly one in five Americans said they believed a fake theory that Swift was involved in a plan to boost Biden’s reelection campaign, which he ended earlier this summer.\n\nKelce also drew some right-wing critics after he appeared in a Pfizer advertisement encouraging people to get the flu and COVID-19 vaccines. He also collaborated with Bud Light, which faced threats over its work with a transgender influencer.\n\nEven as Swift sparks worldwide conversation, it's not clear how far her endorsement will ripple in November.\n\nDoes Taylor Swift’s endorsement matter?\n\nSwift’s Democratic fans have eagerly awaited her endorsement.\n\nOne example: The group Swifties for Kamala popped up after Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. The largely online organization picked up tens of thousands of followers on social media, hosting a 34,000-person Zoom call last month attended by singer Carole King; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and hordes of Swifties.\n\nCould Swift’s endorsement actually move the needle in a neck-and-neck election?\n\nA Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll from May found that 9.2% of respondents said Swift’s endorsement would have influence in their vote. Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama led the poll, garnering 34.6% and 29.4%, respectively.\n\nThese slices probably won’t base their vote on Swift’s endorsement. Still, it could mean something in the pivotal swing states expected to determine the result of the election. Biden won the “Blank Space” singer’s home state of Pennsylvania in 2020 with 50% of the vote, compared to Trump’s 48.8%.\n\nResonate, a data and intelligence company that analyzes trillions of online interactions, found that 253,000 people in Pennsylvania could potentially view Swift’s endorsement as a factor as they vote this fall, alongside voters in other critical states. But experts have pointed out that celebrity endorsements also have a history of backfiring.\n\nSwift for years has also encouraged her fans to register to vote. It’s another way she could have some sway in 2024. Vote.gov received 405,999 visitors in the day after Swift posted a custom URL to voting resources alongside her endorsement, according to data from the General Services Administration. In the week before, the site had about 30,000 daily visitors.\n\nKathryn Cramer Brownell, a professor of history at Purdue University, told USA TODAY she wasn’t surprised by Swift’s endorsement, since the “All Too Well” singer has previously spoken out about reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights and other issues Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have made centerpieces of their campaign.\n\nBut will Swift win over any MAGA supporters? Maybe not.\n\nHer endorsement is “getting people that perhaps are not as tuned into the election or may not be traditional dedicated partisans. It might open their eyes and get them interested in the campaign,” Brownell said.\n\nAnd Swift’s endorsement doesn’t mark a new chapter for the NFL, or American sports culture generally.\n\nPolitics in American sports dates back to exclusionary hunting laws in colonial America, Matthew Andrews, a teaching professor of history at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill, explained. The intersection extends all the way to the firestorm one-time San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick faced when he started protesting police brutality and injustice by kneeling during the national anthem.\n\n“There are a lot of people who are saying, look, keep politics out of sports, right?” Andrews said. “Sports have always been political. They have always been political in this country from before this was a country.”\n\nAre young voters swayed by Taylor Swift?\n\nAt the University of Missouri-Kansas City, a grassy campus nestled about 8 miles from Arrowhead Stadium, Paige Parquette sat between two friends outside the university's student center. An 18-year-old freshman student who quickly identified as a Swftie, Parquette said she wasn’t surprised by Swift’s endorsement because the singer supported Biden in 2020.\n\nParquette, from Maryland, is a Republican and planning to vote for Trump this fall. She wasn’t disappointed by Swift’s endorsement and said she was glad to see the singer share information on registering to vote.\n\n“I think it’s good for people to know how to go out and get registered to vote because more voters make better representation,\" Parquette said.\n\nStudents dotted throughout the student center, library and performing arts space who spoke to USA TODAY, all said that they took note of Swift’s endorsement. But they were quicker to focus on issues facing the country, namely abortion rights, student debt, grocery prices and the southern border.\n\nNeb Cockrell, another 18-year-old freshman, said they’re not really a Swift fan. But they do think “it was kind of gross that she had to announce that publicly because there was AI of her saying that she was going to vote for Trump.”\n\nThe history major from Kansas City said that they’re focused on a lot of factors as they vote in their first election, particularly abortion access, but “I’m not really basing it off of a celebrity.”\n\nBack outside Arrowhead Stadium, Burwell, sitting under a tent in a red dress, agreed.\n\n\"I'm not influenced by Taylor Swift,\" Burwell said of Swift's endorsement. \"But I'm glad she still did it.\"\n\nSwift was in attendance at the Sunday game. She was seen cheering from a box as the Chiefs eked out their win, united with fans regardless of politics.\n\nContributing: Margie Cullen, Trevor Hughes and Jim Sergent, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/26/russia-ukraine-invasion-update/6947419001/", "title": "Kyiv invasion intensifies as explosions rock Ukraine - live updates", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Saturday, Feb. 26. Follow here for updates on the attack in and around Kyiv on Sunday, Feb. 27.\n\nRussian troops have entered Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv and fighting is underway in the streets, according to the Associated Press.\n\nVideos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and a light vehicle burning on the street. Residents were urged to stay inside.\n\nThe troops in Kharkiv arrived hours after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine targeting airfields and fuel facilities.\n\nEarlier there were two large explosions that rocked an area south of Kyiv just before 1 a.m. One of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said. The mayor of Vasylkiv, about 25 miles south of the capital, said an oil depot there was hit, according to the Associated Press.\n\nElsewhere, Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv. The explosion created mushroom-cloud and could cause an “environmental catastrophe,” warned the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection. Residents were advised to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze and to drink plenty of fluids.\n\nAt least 240 civilian casualties are confirmed by the United Nations, including at least 64 people killed in the fighting — though it believed the “real figures are considerably higher” because many reports of casualties remain to be confirmed. More than 150,000 people have fled the Ukraine to neighboring countries and the United Nations warned that number could grow to 4 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States and its European allies agreed to remove “selected” Russian banks from the international SWIFT messaging system, which allows for the movement of financial transactions.\n\nThey also moved to impose restrictions on Russia's central bank, a measure the White House and its partners said would further hammer Russia's financial systems and hit the country's wealthy and political elites.\n\nTo catch you up:\n\nWhy is Russia invading Ukraine?: Could it be the start of WWIII?

The U.S. and EU responded with weapons and ammunition for the outnumbered Ukrainians and powerful sanctions intended to further isolate Moscow.\n\nHuge explosions lit up the sky early Sunday south of the capital, Kyiv, where people hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale assault by Russian forces.\n\n–Associated Press\n\n'You cannot defeat a whole nation'\n\nOn Sunday morning, Ukranian writer Illarion Pavliuk plans to set out on a dangerous journey to help his countrymen as explosions rock Kyiv, and outgunned Ukrainian forces continue to maintain control of their capital.\n\nPavliuk is not a solider, but he does have a military background. In 2015, he was an intelligence volunteer in the war in Eastern Ukraine. And yet, this is what Ukraine has become – a country where internationally acclaimed artists are forced to kiss their children goodnight before they go off to defend their homeland from the occupying force. \"We will never give up and we are going to win this war. You cannot defeat the whole nation. And Ukrainians are absolutely united as a nation now.\"\n\nHis words are haunting and powerful, with his children in the background.\n\n\"What can I tell you about this war? It is difficult to say a couple of words,\" he says. \"I would never ever imagine my four children dropping their toys and running to sit in the thickest doorway in the house because of cruise missiles above our city; ballistic missiles.\n\n\"And I would never imagine this and I will never forgive Russia.\"\n\n– Carli Pierson, USA TODAY\n\nRead the full interview: 'We will never give up': A father prepares to leave his kids and fight for Ukraine\n\nFrench president asks Belarus leader to order Russian troops to leave\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has asked his Belarus counterpart to demand that the country, Ukraine’s neighbor, quickly order Russian troops to leave.\n\nIn a phone conversation Saturday, Macron denounced “the gravity of a decision that would authorize Russia to deploy nuclear arms on Belarus soil,” a statement by the presidential palace said.\n\nMacron told Alexander Lukashenko that fraternity between the people of Belarus and Ukraine should lead Belarus to “refuse to be a vassal and an accomplice to Russia in the war against Ukraine,” the statement said.\n\nBelarus was one one of several axes used by Russia to launch attacks on Ukraine, with Belarus the point to move toward the capital Kyiv, a senior U.S. defense official has said.\n\nMacron has pushed persistently to try to claw out a ceasefire amid the war, using the telephone to talk to all sides, diplomacy and sanctions by the European Union.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUN: At least 240 civilian casualties\n\nGENEVA — The United Nations says it has confirmed at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed, in the fighting in Ukraine that erupted since Russia’s invasion on Thursday — though it believed the “real figures are considerably higher” because many reports of casualties remain to be confirmed.\n\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs relayed the count late Saturday from the U.N. human rights office, which has strict methodologies and verification procedures about the toll from conflict.\n\nOCHA also said damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, and produced a map of “humanitarian situations” in Ukraine — mostly in northern, eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nThe human rights office had reported early Friday an initial count by its staffers of at least 127 civilian casualties – 25 people killed and 102 injured – mostly from shelling and airstrikes.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUS, allies committed to removing certain Russian banks from SWIFT\n\nThe United States and its European allies have agreed to remove “selected” Russian banks from the international SWIFT messaging system, the White House announced on Saturday. The White House also announced that the US and allied countries will move to impose new ”restrictive measures” on Russia’s central bank.\n\nThe new economic penalties on Moscow come as Russia’s military continues to bombard Kyiv and other population centers in its deadly invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA senior administration official said the U.S. and EU will work to finalize the list of Russian banks that will be barred from the SWIFT system. But Russia will feel the impact of the decision well before it’s enacted, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“I have great confidence the effects of these measures will be felt immediately in Russia’s financial markets,” the official said.\n\nThe U.S. official suggested some banks that handle energy transactions could be exempted in the SWIFT delisting process. That would help cushion the economic blow to Europe, which relies heavily on Russia for oil and gas.\n\nThe SWIFT system is based in Belgium, where officials will have the final sign-off on the list of barred institutions.\n\nThe U.S. and EU countries also announced new steps to limit the sale of “golden passports,” which allows wealthy individuals become citizens of European countries.\n\n– Rebecca Morin, USA TODAY\n\nZelenskyy says he’s open for talks with Russia\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he’s open for talks with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy said in a video message Saturday that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev offered to help organize such talks. He added that “we can only welcome that.”\n\nZelenskyy also said he and Erdogan “agree that a ban on the passage of Russian warships into the Black Sea is very important today,” adding that “it has been done.” Turkey, however, hasn’t announced any ban for Russian warships to move through Turkish Straits following Erdogan’s talk with Zelenskyy.\n\nZelenskyy said that “Ukrainians’ readiness to protect our state, our solidarity and courage have thwarted the scenario of occupation of our country.”\n\n“The world has seen that Ukrainians are strong, Ukrainians are brave, Ukrainians stand on their land and will not surrender it,” he said.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nGermany to send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, drops opposition to SWIFT sanctions for Russia\n\nIn a significant shift, the German government said Saturday it will send weapons and other supplies directly to Ukraine and supports some restrictions of the SWIFT global banking system for Russia.\n\nGermany’s chancellery announced it will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 “Stinger” surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine “as quickly as possible.”\n\n“The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point. It threatens our entire post-war order,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement. “In this situation, it is our duty to help Ukraine, to the best of our ability, to defend itself against Vladimir Putin’s invading army.”\n\nIn addition, the German economy and climate ministry said Germany is allowing the Netherlands to ship 400 German-made anti-tank weapons to Ukraine.\n\nGermany had long stuck to a policy of not exporting deadly weapons to conflict zones, including Ukraine. As recently as Friday, government officials said they would abide by that policy.\n\nGermany on Saturday also joined the rest of the European Union in voicing support for SWIFT sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and German Economics Minister Robert Habeck announced the decision in a joint statement that indicated there might be limits in how far Germany is willing to go on the issue.\n\n“We are working flat out on how to limit the collateral damage of a disconnection from #SWIFT, so that it hits the right people. What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT,” the officials wrote in a statement.\n\nSWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. It is a global messaging system connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nSWIFT was formed in 1973, and is headquartered in Belgium. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in addition to the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and others, NBC News reported. It connects more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, so banks can be informed about transactions.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Zelenskyy said that Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi also voiced his approval for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT.\n\nThe U.S. did not impose removing Russia from SWIFT following concerns from European allies in what was seen as America's harshest punishment at its disposal.\n\nWhat is SWIFT?: How could banning Russia from the banking system impact the country?\n\n– JJ Hensley and Associated Press\n\nRussian forces meet firm resistance on path to Kyiv\n\nRussian forces have grown increasingly frustrated by Ukrainian resistance, particularly near the capital of Kiev, and the Russian advance remains about 18 miles from the city, a senior Defense Department official said Saturday.\n\nRussia has, however, sent reconnaissance forces into Kyiv, the official said, declining to say how many of those troops have penetrated the city.\n\nThe official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said the Pentagon had used several means to determine that Russian forces invading Ukraine had been stalled by determined resistance.\n\nThe official warned that the battlefield situation is fluid and changing rapidly.\n\nAddressing reports that some Russian military vehicles had run out of gas, the official said the invading force sent by Russian President Vladimir Putin had expended more fuel resources than it had planned for.\n\nUkrainian forces continue to contest the airspace over the country with warplanes and missile defense, the official said.\n\nAlso Saturday, the Pentagon announced that $350 in emergency military aid to Ukraine. That package includes Javelin anti-armor missiles, ammunition and body armor, according to the official. Prior to the invasion, military materiel had been arriving in Ukraine by cargo aircraft. U.S. military aid has continued to flow into Ukraine in the last few days but the official declined to say how it has arrived there.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that “the speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.”\n\n“Russian forces are bypassing major Ukrainian population centres while leaving forces to encircle and isolate them,” the ministry said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook and Associated Press\n\nFleeing to the border: Over 150,000 Ukrainians seek refuge\n\nMEDYKA, Poland – At least 150,000 people have fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighboring countries in the wake of the Russian invasion, the U.N. refugee agency said Saturday.\n\nSome walked many miles through the night while others fled by train, car or bus, forming lines miles long at border crossings. They were greeted by waiting relatives and friends or headed on their own to reception centers organized by neighboring governments.\n\n“The numbers and the situation is changing minute by minute,” said Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. “At least 150,000 people have fled, they are refugees outside of Ukraine. ... At least 100,000 people – but probably a much larger number – have been displaced inside Ukraine.”\n\nThose arriving were mostly women, children and the elderly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy banned men of military age from 18 to 60 from leaving. Some Ukrainian men were heading back into Ukraine from Poland to take up arms against the Russian forces.\n\n- The Associated Press\n\nChelsea's Russian billionaire owner hands over Premier League club\n\nLONDON — Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich suddenly handed over the \"stewardship and care\" of the Premier League club to its charitable foundation trustees on Saturday.\n\nThe move came after a member of the British parliament called for the Russian billionaire to hand over the club in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAbramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, made no mention of the war in his statement.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nFormer president Poroschenko: everyone understands risk of death\n\nFormer Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko, Zelenskyy’s predecessor, said he was prepared to die to defend his country.\n\n“I think that we should do our best to protect our nation,” he told CNN in an interview Saturday. “To protect the nation against the Russian aggressor definitely bring the risk of life.”\n\nPoroschenko, who was wearing a flak jacket and standing outside in Kyiv with members of the Ukraine military, sounded clear-eyed and defiant.\n\n“Everybody here – all the young and old people – fully understand that we have this risk,” he said. “Somebody has a choice to go abroad. Somebody has a choice to be the refugee in some regions of Ukraine. But many, the biggest part, make a decision to take the rifle and to protect the nation.”\n\n“I proud for these people. I proud for this country. And I proud to be Ukrainian.”\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nBiden authorizes $350 million more in US military aid for Ukraine\n\nThe Biden administration is providing an additional $350 million in immediate U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as Russia continues a full-scale attack on the country with intense fighting in the capital city of Kyiv.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken announced the drawdown of funds Saturday morning after Biden authorized the emergency military aid late Friday night through the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n\n“This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing,” Blinken said in a statement. “It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation.”\n\nThe aid brings the U.S.’s total assistance to Ukraine to more than $1 billion over the past year, according to Blinken, including $200 million in military assistance in December and $60 million last fall.\n\nZelenskyy has urged Ukraine civilians to join the fight against Russia, and as he remains defiant about not leaving Kyiv, he’s made clear about the need for more help.\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride,” he said in a video Friday.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nIn Kyiv, residents seek shelter after night of explosions, street clashes\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – Russian troops pressed toward Ukraine’s capital Saturday after a night of air strikes and street fighting.\n\nUkrainian officials have reported some success in fending off assaults. A U.S. official told reporters Friday the Pentagon had information suggesting that Moscow had expected a faster advance on Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused an American offer to evacuate, insisting he would stay. “The fight is here,” he said.\n\nSkirmishes reported on the edge of Kyiv suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. A missile struck a high-rise apartment building in the city’s southwestern outskirts near one of Kyiv’s two passenger airports, Mayor Vitali Klitchsko said, leaving a jagged hole of ravaged apartments over several floors. A rescue worker said six civilians were injured.\n\nRussia claims its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets, but civilians have been killed and injured during Europe’s largest ground war since World War II.\n\n– Caren Bohan and Associated Press\n\nTikTok is Russia's newest weapon in arsenal for anti-Ukraine propaganda\n\nIn 2014, Russia flooded the internet with fake accounts pushing disinformation about its takeover of Crimea. Eight years later, experts say Russia is mounting a far more sophisticated propaganda effort as it invades Ukraine.\n\nArmies of trolls and bots stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment. State-controlled media outlets look to divide Western audiences. Clever TikTok videos serve up Russian nationalism with a side of humor.\n\nThe effort amounts to an emerging part of Russia’s war arsenal with the shaping of opinion through orchestrated disinformation fighting alongside actual troops and weapons.\n\nAnalysts at several different research organizations contacted by The Associated Press said they are seeing a sharp increase in online activity by groups affiliated with the Russian state. That’s in keeping with Russia’s strategy of using social media and state-run outlets to galvanize domestic support while seeking to destabilize the Western alliance.\n\nResearchers saw a sudden and dramatic increase in anti-Ukrainian content in the days immediately before the invasion. On Valentine’s Day, for instance, the number of anti-Ukrainian posts created by the sample of Twitter accounts jumped by 11,000% when compared with just days earlier. Analysts believe a significant portion of the accounts are inauthentic and controlled by groups linked to the Russian government.\n\n– David Klepper, The Associated Press\n\nTroops from NATO member nations could be deployed to defend Slovakia\n\nSlovakia’s defense minister says up to 1,200 foreign troops from other NATO members could be deployed in his country in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe plan is part of the NATO initiative to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending forces to help protect them. Slovakia borders Ukraine.\n\nDefense Minister Jaroslav Nad said forces from the Netherlands and Germany are among those expected to come. Germany will also provide the Patriot system to boost Slovakia’s air defense.\n\nThe country’s government and Parliament have not yet approved the plan.\n\nNad also said his country’s government has approved sending arms and fuel worth 11 million euros ($12.4 million) requested by Ukraine. The aid will include 10 million liters (2.6 million gallons) of fuel, 2.4 million liters (630,000 gallons) of aviation fuel and 12,000 pieces of ammunition.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy mobilizes Ukrainian reservists and those eligible for service\n\nAfter Russia launched a military invasion into Ukraine early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called up reservists and those liable for service for a full military mobilization.\n\nAs many Ukrainians fled to neighboring countries, the Ukraine State Border Guard Service announced that men ages 18 to 60 were prohibited from leaving the country, ahead of a possible draft to increase the country's military service.\n\nTalk of conscription led to questions in the U.S. about whether the government could ever reinstate the draft. That is highly unlikely in a country where antiwar sentiment has grown in the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress would have to reinstate the draft since induction authority expired in 1973. If approved, the president would then be authorized to induct civilians through the Selective Service Administration into the armed forces under an amendment to the Military Selective Service Act.\n\nEven though there is no draft currently, almost all men and male immigrants aged 18 to 25 are required to register with the Selective Service. Women make up close to 17% of the U.S. armed forces, but Congress would have to pass legislation amending the act to require women register.\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nRussian protesters risk arrest to decry Putin's war\n\nMOSCOW – Risking arrest and intimidation, Russian citizens have taken to the streets in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities to protest President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussians with prominent platforms – celebrity actors, television presenters, comedians and pop stars – risked their state contracts and jobs to make anti-war statements.\n\nMany Russians have seen horrifying images from the Ukraine conflict, broadcast by independent media. Some show the Russian army destroying apartment blocks with people inside, a tank rolling over a vehicle with an elderly man inside and bleeding women crying for an end to the fighting.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, Sergei Bobovnikov, an antique art expert, joined a street rally Thursday night where hundreds of people crowded the central avenue, Nevsky Prospect.\n\n\"No to war!\" they chanted. \"Hands off Ukraine!\"\n\nSome 1,745 people in 54 Russian cities were detained, at least 957 of them in Moscow, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMeanwhile, cities across Europe saw large gatherings where people voiced their outrage.\n\nIn London, demonstrators outside the Downing Street residence of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held up placards Friday that read \"Stop the war\" and \"Total embargo on Russia.\"\n\nFrom New York to Paris, cities lit up buildings in blue and yellow, the colors of the Ukrainian flag.\n\n– Anna Nemtsova, Caren Bohan and Associated Press\n\nRussian official shrugs off Western sanctions\n\nA senior Russian official has warned that Moscow could react to Western sanctions over its attack on Ukraine by opting out of the last remaining nuclear arms pact and freezing Western assets.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council chaired by President Vladimir Putin, shrugged off a set of crippling sanctions that the U.S., the European Union and other allies slapped on Russia as a reflection of Western “political impotence.”\n\nIn comments posted on his page on Russian social media VKontakte, Medvedev said the sanctions could offer Moscow a pretext for a complete review of its ties with the West, suggesting that Russia could opt out of the New START nuclear arms control treaty that limits the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nCzechs to send more arms to Ukraine\n\nThe Czech Republic’s government has approved a plan to send more arms to Ukraine.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said it is immediately sending machine guns, submachine guns, assault rifles and pistols together with ammunition worth 188 million Czech crowns ($8.6 million).\n\nThe ministry said the Czechs will transport the weapons and deliver them to a place determined by the Ukrainian side.\n\nThe Czech Republic has already agreed to donate some 4,000 pieces of artillery shells worth 36.6 million Czech crowns ($1.7 million) to Ukraine.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\n'Our world is crumbling': Ukrainians try to flee homes with food, belongings amid Russian invasion\n\nPoles quit World Cup qualifying against Russia\n\nWARSAW, Poland -- The Polish Football Association says it will not play its World Cup qualifying match against Russia due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“No more words, time to act!” said association president Cezary Kulesza on Twitter, saying the move was prompted by the “escalation of the aggression.”\n\nThe match had been scheduled for March 24.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nUkrainian health minister: Nearly 200 dead, 1,000 wounded\n\nThe Ukrainian health minister says that 198 people have been killed and more than 1,000 others have been wounded in the Russian offensive.\n\nHealth Minister Viktor Lyashko said Saturday that there were three children among those killed. His statement made it unclear whether the casualties included both military and civilians.\n\nHe said another 1,115 people, including 33 children, were wounded in the Russian invasion that began Thursday with massive air and missile strikes and troops forging into Ukraine from the north, east and south.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy: Ukraine is fighting 'with weapons in hand'\n\nZelenskyy detailed further diplomatic efforts to drum up support for Ukraine Saturday, tweeting about a conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n\"Ukraine is fighting the invader with weapons in hands, defending its freedom and European future.

Will it blunt Putin's Ukraine invasion?\n\nRussia's wealthy oligarchs and political elites flaunt a level of in-your-face affluence across the world. This week, their wealth and connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin made some of them targets of President Joe Biden's sanctions in response to the Kremlin’s ongoing military invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut if the Biden administration really wants to hurt Russian oligarchs enough to rein in Putin's actions in Ukraine, it needs to hit them much harder – and hit a lot more of them, some U.S. officials and kleptocracy experts told USA TODAY.\n\nBy any measure, the new rounds of U.S. financial blockages issued this week go far beyond what has been done in the past to pressure Putin into curbing his rogue behavior, White House officials said. The sweeping actions would cause extreme hardship for some of Russia’s largest financial institutions and a small handful of Russian oligarchs and kleptocrats that Biden said use them as their own “glorified piggy bank.”\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nUS sanctions on Russian oligarchs miss richest of rich\n\nThe term Russian oligarch conjures images of posh London mansions, gold-plated Bentleys and sleek superyachts in the Mediterranean, their decks draped with partiers dripping in jewels.\n\nBut the raft of sanctions on oligarchs announced by President Joe Biden this week in response to the invasion of Ukraine may do little to dim the jet-setting lifestyles of Russia’s ultra-rich and infamous – much less force a withdrawal of tanks and troops.\n\nU.S. sanctions target Russian President Vladmir Putin and a handful of individuals believed to be among his closest security advisers, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nBut the list is just as notable for who isn’t on it — most of the top names from Forbes’ list of the richest Russians whose multi-billion-dollar fortunes are now largely intertwined with the West, from investments in Silicon Valley start-ups to British Premier League soccer teams.\n\nCiting the concerns of European allies, the U.S. also didn’t impose what was seen as the harshest punishment at its disposal, banning Russia from SWIFT, the international financial system that banks use to move money around the world.\n\n-- Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}]}

While an October USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll found nearly 8 in 10 voters said they trust the vote count, that trust was higher among Kamala Harris supporters than Trump supporters.\n\nHere is what we know about current claims of election interference, instances of violence and what officials have said about election security.\n\nLive coverage of Election Day snags: Lawsuits, bomb threats and a Capitol arrest\n\nDon't be fooled on Election Day: 6 false voting claims to look out for\n\nNational and international interference attempts and accusations\n\nU.S. intelligence officials said Russia has pushed out several fake videos in a disinformation campaign as it appears to try to help Trump win the election. One of the videos accused Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, of tipping off now-indicted music producer Sean “Diddy” Combs of a raid in exchange for a bribe.\n\nThe Trump campaign accused Britain's ruling party of interference after the party acknowledged staff members were campaigning for Harris. Federal Election Commission rules state it is legal for foreign nationals to volunteer in U.S. elections so long as they are not compensated.\n\nElection officials and lawmakers are worried that U.S Postal Service delays could prevent thousands of ballots from being counted this year, in what could be an extremely close presidential contest. “Voters should never have to worry about if their ballot will be postmarked on time or if their ballot will reach their election center in time to be counted,” said Rep. David Joyce, R-Ohio.\n\nThe FBI has warned that fake videos claiming voters should “vote remotely” due to terrorist threats at polling places are circulating but are not authentic.\n\nBomb threats were made to polling places in several states but they “appear to originate from Russian email domains,” and none have yet been found to be credible, according to the FBI.\n\nArizona: Voter registration ballots damaged\n\nIn Maricopa County, Arizona, which encompasses Phoenix, 30,000 to 40,000 voter registration forms were returned damaged.

Not even a year later, it has grown global.\n\nPeter and Alison Denbigh made a game called \"Watch Ya Mouth\" that has swept not only the entire country, but the world. It has become a number one best seller on Amazon and they have sold hundreds of thousands of games.\n\nPeter said the two had been watching the move \"The Boss\" when a scene came on where actress Melissa McCarthy is getting her teeth whitened. In order to do so, she had to put in these awkward mouth retractors, which makes it almost impossible to talk.\n\n\"She was trying to talk and it was really funny,\" Peter said. \"We decided this could be more than just a funny moment.\"\n\nThe way it works is people either divide up in teams or play all together for points. The goal is to understand what people are saying with the mouth retractors in their mouths, which is challenging. For Peter and Alison, they've had enough practice that they've gotten really good. The words said with the mouth retractors in are pretty understandable.\n\n\"It's not a brain game, there's not any strategy,\" Peter said.\n\nA person has one minute to go through as many cards that have phrases on them, which range between one and two points.\n\nAlison is the big board game lover. So, the couple has always spent time playing games with friends and family.\n\n\"We have an entire closet full of games,\" Peter said.\n\n\"I have a fascination with games,\" Alison added.\n\nHaunted mill attraction comes to Dooms\n\nAfter watching that movie, the ideas started to come flying in. From there a Kickstarter campaign was started in May 2016. The couple began to check out different mouth retractors and the safety of them and traveled to China to research different manufacturers.\n\nTheir goal was to raise $6,000 to make the first batch of the game. It was one of the only successful Kickstarter campaigns that Peter has done.\n\nAs the Kickstarter campaign ended in June, the couple began sending out games to those who were part of the campaign and finding ways to make more and jumpstart the process of getting it into larger stores in time for the holidays.\n\n\"It's been really quite a ride,\" Peter said. \"I've been involved in small business all my life. I've learned a lot about how to take an idea to the market. It was my goal to make this an exercise in execution.\"\n\nThe Findells record for Tiny Desk Contest\n\nWhat started as a two-person team has now expanded to eight — five of them local. In the beginning they had family members and friends help with packaging and shipping out the product.\n\n\"It was really fun to be starting this business out of our garage,\" Peter said.\n\n\"It's the American dream,\" Alison added.\n\nGoing from a small online marketing campaign, the game started to pick up speed as soon as people started posting videos of them playing the game. It basically went viral, they said.\n\nThe game is now a part of the Amazon Launchpad program, which helps startups get going by teaching them the ins and outs of how selling on Amazon works. There are now expansion packs, an adult version of the game and even a phone app that people can use.\n\nThe couple has called the Shenandoah Valley home for more than a decade and are also James Madison University graduates. What the Denbighs find so special is that this big game came from small beginnings.\n\n\"I grew up in small town West Virginia and moved to Harrisonburg and now live in Staunton,\" Peter said. \"This type of idea has come out of this beautiful small town. Yet it's distributed globally.\n\n\"You don't have to live in Washington, D.C., New York City or Los Angeles to make something like this or to have something go global.\"\n\nTheir company, Skyler Innovations, also utilizes local companies like SupplyOne in Weyers Cave for their packaging, Reo Distribution in Waynesboro for shipping and Vector Industries in Waynesboro for direct fulfillment off the website.\n\nStrange things have happened while playing the game, say the Debrighs. They've seen marriage proposals with people using the game, people peeing their pants playing it and dentures falling out while playing.\n\n\"What's so cool about this game is the customer experience,\" Peter said. \"They're just laughing, just belly laughing.\"\n\n\"We've got the greatest stories,\" Alison said.\n\nMany of the cards are submitted, too. For those who send in phrase ideas, if the couple likes them, they'll use them and put the submitter's name and location on the card itself.\n\nErin Blanton, co-owner of Pufferbelies in Staunton, was one of the only independent toy stores to be able to sell it. She said she is still getting feedback from people who purchased the product over the holidays — many of them said they were excited for the game and couldn't stop laughing.\n\n\"We were super excited when we found out that the game was invented locally,\" she said. \"I had been hearing about it before I knew it was invented locally. Customers were so excited that they could get the game, especially because it does have a local connection.\"\n\nNow, the couple is looking to expand the product in the next few months.\n\nThey still have a lot to tackle, though.\n\nThe product is the only one out there that has a patent pending and now they are competing with knock-off brands and counterfeit products. The counterfeit issue is when someone orders a game from Amazon, but it's through a third party — not Amazon. Some customers may received what they thought was the real thing, when it's something that's cheaply made, including cards with words spelled wrong and incorrect packaging. It's something the Denbighs are working to correct and even going as far to as working with U.S. Customs to correct the problem.\n\n\"It's like Whack-a-Mole,\" Alison said. \"We fix one and another pops up.\"\n\nThe Denbighs advise those purchasing through Amazon to buy directly from Amazon — not the new or used option that may seem cheaper. That's one way the two have found to avoid counterfeits.\n\nThe two will be unveiling some new things at an upcoming toy convention in New York City in February —The American International Toy Fair. For now they are busy coming up with new phrases to try to say with the mouth retractors. The bar for quality is high. But they know when they've hit upon a good one because they can't stop laughing.\n\n\n\nFollow Laura Peters @peterslaura and @peterpants.

That includes production of 100 million masks a month just in the US.\n\n3M's NIOSH-approved N95 mask filters at least 95% of non-oil based air particles. 3M\n\n“We’ve increased N95 production enough that they are now available to all customers again and we are continuing to supply N95s needed by healthcare workers as well as industrial customers,” Ehrlich said. “There’s no longer a shortage of N95s”\n\nWhere can you buy 3M’s N95 masks?\n\nEhrlich said 3M’s N95 masks are for sale at all major retailers, including Home Depot, Target, Lowes, Menards and through Amazon’s 3M store. She said Target also sells a separate advanced filtering face mask from 3M that is not an N95.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon (AMZN) said the retailer currently has a large assortment of N95 masks. According to Amazon (AMZN), it’s selling N95 masks from domestic, international and third-party vendors that it says have met the company’s vetting and product review process.\n\nAll legitimate N95 masks bear a NIOSH marking, meaning they have been approved for use in the workplace by The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nAccording to Target, (TGT) the retailer has a “healthy supply” of a variety of facemasks, including cloth and disposable surgical masks.\n\nN95 masks are generally not intended for use by children.\n\nThe CDC’s guidelines state that although respirators may be available in smaller sizes, they are typically designed to be used by adults in workplaces and have not been tested for broad use by children.\n\n“3M N95s are designed to fit adult faces,” said Dr. Nikki Vars McCullough, vice president and respiratory protection leader at 3M. “Parents who are considering a N95 for their child should make sure the respirators fits and forms a seal to the child’s face. And it’s important that the child is comfortable enough that they won’t remove it.”\n\nThe CDC also cautioned about counterfeit N95 masks. The agency said consumers should watch out for telltale signs of a counterfeit product such as misspellings on the mask, claims that the mask is approved for children and the absence of NIOSH markings.\n\nWhy N95s?\n\nFor nearly two years, we’ve become accustomed to wearing cloth face masks to protect ourselves against coronavirus.\n\nBut a few layers of fabric covering the face are proving to be no match for Omicron.\n\nThe fast-spreading variant has already triggered new record-high hospitalizations in the US, with 45,982 people currently hospitalized with Covid-19, surpassing the previous peak from January 2021, according to government data. On Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the probability is that the Omicron variant will “find just about everybody,” although vaccinated people will fare better.\n\n3M's N95 respirator mask can filter up to 95% of particles in the air. Angus Mordant/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBesides getting vaccinated and boosted, health experts say switching to a mask with a higher caliber of personal protection is critical to helping to mitigate the spread.\n\nA face mask protects against the spread of Covid-19 in two ways: It mitigates the risk of the wearer’s exposure to the virus and also protects others around them from being exposed through a cough, sneeze or even just talking.\n\nThe efficacy of masks is determined by filtration, or how effectively they can block very fine particles in the air, including viruses and bacteria.\n\nUp to this point in the pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention has encouraged the use of a variety of protective face masks, including well-fitted multi-layer cloth masks, disposable surgical masks and medical-grade N95 respirator masks. Properly fitted and certified, N95 masks are able to filter up to 95% of airborne particles.\n\nHowever, given the extreme transmissibility of Omicron, the CDC is expected to update its mask guidance, an agency official told CNN Tuesday.", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/01/milestone-rhino-bigfoot-shooting-jailed-feeding-news-around-states/39874537/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nElmore: A K-9 known as both the best narcotics-sniffing dog in the state and a “knucklehead” was honored at a memorial service Tuesday after he died searching for drugs during a prison sweep. The 5-year-old Belgian Malinois named Jake suddenly became ill July 18 after he came into contact with a powdery synthetic street drug known as flakka during a routine contraband search. He died two days later after developing pneumonia and other complications. Fellow four-legged law enforcement officers yapped in the background at the Staton Kennel Complex in Elmore as Jake received a 21-gun salute, a traditional bugle playing of taps, a commendation from Gov. Kay Ivey and eulogies from law enforcement officials. Officials are still investigating the source of the narcotic at the Staton Correctional Facility.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Repairs and upgrades at earthquake-damaged area schools could cost more than $150 million. The Anchorage Daily News reports the Anchorage School District says the new estimate triples the original assessment of damage caused by the Nov. 30 quake. District officials say two schools need more than $20 million to repair and improve seismic performance; six schools may require at least $10 million; and improvement projects at 14 schools could cost at least $1 million each. District Chief Operating Officer Tom Roth says the estimates include immediate repairs needed and optional improvements that would improve the quake-readiness of schools. Roth says the district has spent $8 million to $9 million so far on post-quake repairs to return facilities to working condition.\n\nArizona\n\nTusayan: Fees could be going up at a large campground near the Grand Canyon’s popular South Rim entrance. A proposal by the Kaibab National Forest would more than double the overnight fees for single sites from $10 to $24 and at double sites from $20 to $48. The cost for large group sites at Ten X Campground also would go up from $75 per night to $125. Forest officials say the proposed hikes better align with prices at nearby recreation areas. They say additional funding would help maintain and expand the site and also allow them to bring in more seasonal workers. Officials say the campground fees haven’t gone up in more than 25 years. The public has until Oct. 31 to comment on the proposal.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State officials say the four companies providing coverage through the state’s insurance exchange under the federal health care overhaul law are seeking an average rate increase of about 2% for next year. Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Monday that all four insurers cited the elimination of an exchange user fee in their rate requests. The highest average initial rate-hike request for individual plans came from Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield at 2.89% and the lowest from QualChoice Life and Health at 0.51%. The average increase requested by Ambetter from AR Health & Wellness was 1.9%, and the average from QCA Health Plan was 0.56%. The requests are subject to an independent actuarial analysis under state law, and the Insurance Department has until Sept. 18 to approve rates for next year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A conservation organization says it has achieved the first successful artificial insemination birth of a southern white rhino in North America, an important step in saving another rhino species from extinction. San Diego Zoo Global says mother Victoria gave birth Sunday to a healthy southern white rhino male calf in the barn at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park after 30 minutes of labor. Victoria was artificially inseminated with frozen semen from southern white rhino Maoto following hormone-induced ovulation. Victoria carried her calf for over a year – 493 days. Mother and calf will remain off exhibit to the public for now to allow them to bond. The calf will eventually be introduced to the other five female rhinos at the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center – including Amani, also pregnant through artificial insemination and due to give birth this fall.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The U.S. Department of Justice has lost track of more than 60 boxes of documents from a 27-year-old criminal investigation into safety and environmental violations at a former nuclear weapons plant, officials said Tuesday. The files were gathered in a two-year grand jury probe of the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, which manufactured plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and had a history of fires, leaks and spills. The files have remained secret since the investigation ended with criminal charges in 1992. Seven groups representing environmentalists, ex-nuclear workers, area residents and public health advocates filed a motion in federal court in January asking that the files be made public. Government attorneys are fighting the request. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver told the activists in a July 24 email that it cannot find the files but now say the search is ongoing.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is seeking scenic Connecticut photos. For the second year, DEEP is holding the Discover Outdoor Connecticut Photo Contest. Photographers from any state may participate, but all submissions must have been taken in Connecticut. Photographers may enter one photo in each of three categories: wildlife; people enjoying the natural world; and scenic landscapes and flora. Judges will select first-, second- and third-place winners in each category. There’s a separate youth category. Entries must be postmarked by Aug. 16. Entry forms can be found on DEEP’s website. First-place winners will have their photograph published in DEEP’s Connecticut Wildlife magazine. Winners will also receive gift cards.\n\nDelaware\n\nBowers: The Murderkill River has claimed a nearby bait shop that stood as an icon to the surrounding town’s history as a commercial fishing hotspot. News outlets report Frenchie’s Bait & Tackle partially slid into the river late Monday. The shop’s front end still sits on the shores of Bower Beach, where it was rebuilt after it burned down in the 1990s. Owner and commercial fisherman William “Frenchie” Poulin says it appears the shop’s eroded pilings gave out. The Bowers Beach Maritime Museum says responding authorities turned off the shop’s power and worked to contain any hazardous materials, such as oil. It says a cat that lived at the shop is now homeless. Councilman Bob McDevitt says no one was injured. Poulin previously served as Bower’s mayor and as a councilman.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city’s Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is asking Maryland to release over $50 million the state has withheld for a month amid ongoing funding disputes. The Washington Post reports Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld recently sent a letter to Maryland officials requesting funds be released immediately, warning Metro’s credit rating could take a hit. Maryland was supposed to release $56 million July 1, which was set to go toward new trains and buses. But Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn says Metro has delayed audits and hasn’t provided adequate information about its spending. The newspaper says the dispute may relate to Gov. Larry Hogan’s view that Maryland spends too much on transit rather than roads.\n\nFlorida\n\nRedington Beach: Authorities and beachgoers came together to protect and transport five pilot whales trapped in shallow water along the state’s western shore. News outlets report the whales were first spotted Monday morning, and biologists and beachgoers swung into action, covering the whales from the climbing sun as the tide pulled away from shore. Biologists determined the whales were healthy enough for transport, and volunteers teamed up to move the heavy creatures. Three whales were returned to the sea, while two others were taken to a Clearwater Marine Aquarium facility in Tarpon Springs for medical treatment and testing. Aquarium spokeswoman Carlee Wendell says pilot whale mass strandings have happened about a dozen times since 1990. Just this month, dozens of disoriented pilot whales were saved from a mass stranding near a Georgia shore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia’s seaports are celebrating another year of record growth, though their chief executive warns business will suffer if the U.S. doesn’t resolve its trade war with China. The Georgia Ports Authority reported Tuesday that its ports at Savannah and Brunswick handled a record 37.5 million tons of cargo in the 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30. That’s a 4.2% increase over the previous year. A whopping 4.5 million container units of imports and exports were shipped through Savannah. Griff Lynch, the port authority’s executive director, said he’s concerned tariffs imposed in the Trump administration’s trade dispute with China, if unresolved, could slow business in the coming year. Lynch said export volumes dipped slightly in June, and “that could very well be linked to the tariffs.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor on Tuesday rescinded an emergency proclamation put in place to deal with Native Hawaiian protesters who are blocking a road to prevent the construction of a giant telescope at a mountain summit they consider sacred. Gov. David Ige said there were no immediate plans to move heavy equipment to Mauna Kea’s summit. He also noted two hurricanes were approaching that could affect the protest area and the rest of the state. Hurricane Erick is forecast to pass south of the Big Island this week. Following right after is Hurricane Flossie, on track to come close to the islands early next week. “For the safety of all involved, we want to deescalate activities,” Ige said. He declared an emergency July 17 to give law enforcement more authority to close areas of the mountain and to use additional National Guard troops to help deliver construction gear.\n\nIdaho\n\nJerome: The University of Idaho has bought land for a public visitor center, classrooms and other facilities supporting what officials say will be the world’s largest research dairy. Bill Loftus with the university’s College of Ag and Life Sciences told The Times-News the new property near Jerome represents a significant step for the planned Idaho Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. Work on the CAFE began over a decade ago, and the university plans to have the dairy up and running in 2024. The project spans three sites: a food processing research and training facility at the College of Southern Idaho; the dairy, which will hold 2,000 head of cattle; and the Discovery Complex, which will be built at the newest property and include classrooms, the visitor center, faculty offices and housing.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s transportation agencies are boosting services to accommodate tens of thousands of people attending Lollapalooza. The Metra commuter train and the CTA subway agencies will expand capacity for one of the nation’s most popular music festivals, which takes place from Thursday through Sunday in Chicago’s Grant Park. The lineup at Lollapalooza this year includes Ariana Grande, Lil Wayne, The Strokes and more than 150 other performers. Over 100,000 people are expected to attend each day. Metra will add trains and adjust schedules on most lines for the four-day event. CTA will add service on rail lines and bus routes. In a statement Friday, CTA President Dorval R. Carter Jr. said there will be ample service to get attendees to the festival “easily and comfortably.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The body of notorious 1930s gangster John Dillinger is expected to be exhumed in September at a local cemetery, but it could be a tough job because his grave is encased in concrete. Digging up the remains more than 85 years after Dillinger was killed by FBI agents also could resolve conspiracy theories that the man some considered a hero during the Great Depression isn’t buried in his marked grave, said Susan Sutton, a historian with the Indiana Historical Society. Among the tales is that his family tricked the FBI into shooting the wrong man. The Indiana State Department of Health approved a permit sought by Dillinger’s nephew to have the body exhumed from Crown Hill Cemetery and reinterred there. Days after his son’s funeral, Dillinger’s father had the casket reburied under a protective cap of concrete and scrap iron topped by four reinforced-concrete slabs, Sutton said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The ousted director of the state Department of Human Services will pursue a wrongful termination lawsuit, alleging he was let go after objecting to a pay arrangement for the governor’s deputy chief of staff, his lawyer said Wednesday. Jerry Foxhoven will file a whistleblower claim with the State Appeal Board, the first step toward pursuing a lawsuit against state government, his attorney Tom Duff said. It’s the latest development stemming from a personnel decision that has put Gov. Kim Reynolds on the defensive and prompted inquiries by state and federal watchdogs. Earlier this month, Reynolds’ spokesman wouldn’t confirm or deny whether Foxhoven’s workplace praise for rapper Tupac Shakur played a role in his being asked to resign, but the governor later said that she’d never heard of the rap icon and that “of course” that wasn’t the reason.\n\nKansas\n\nWellington: The National Glass Museum is temporarily closed after the front of the building collapsed. The front of the museum and most of the front brick facade collapsed overnight Friday. KAKE-TV reports the collapse is blamed on heavy rains during the year. The landlord hopes to rebuild and reopen the museum by the end of September. Pam Meyer, president of the National Depress Glass Association, said the building had been leaning for some time. She said the group plans to stay in Wellington. The museum displays American-made glassware from the Great Depression era. None of the museum pieces were damaged.\n\nKentucky\n\nCave City: Federal officials are investigating a report that a man fired a gunshot while camping at Mammoth Cave National Park, an incident that another camper says was prompted by an alleged sighting of Bigfoot. Mammoth Cave said law enforcement rangers responded early Sunday to a report of a person with a firearm at one of the park’s backcountry campsites. Brad Ginn told news outlets he and his girlfriend were camping nearby and were awakened about 1 a.m. by a man with his son. The man said they were going to investigate strange noises he kept hearing. Ginn said he heard a gunshot minutes later, and the man returned to say Bigfoot had emerged from the woods, so he fired. Ginn said he and his girlfriend decided to leave and report the incident. Park spokeswoman Molly Schroer said an investigation continues, and the park is safe to visit.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 260 new laws are taking effect in the state as August begins. Starting Thursday, people must be at least 16 years old to marry. Medical marijuana patients can inhale cannabis. Women seeking abortions via medication are limited to Louisiana’s three abortion clinics, rather than a doctor’s office. Parents who scuffle with referees at children’s sport events face new penalties. Animal shelters can’t take in stray or unwanted animals solely to euthanize them for research facilities or sell animals for research or experimentation. Louisiana agencies can’t deny or revoke an occupational license when someone falls behind on student loan repayments. Anti-hazing laws get tougher, with new provisions aimed at forcing colleges to report allegations more quickly.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: The Maine Lobster Festival is underway, with festivalgoers planning to eat hundreds of the state’s beloved arthropods and crown a new sea goddess. The decades-old festival takes place near the Rockland waterfront and offers fare including steamed lobster, lobster bisque, lobster mac and cheese, lobster rolls, lobster wraps and lobster Caesar salad. The festival started Wednesday and ends Sunday. Wednesday’s big event is the 72nd Maine Sea Goddess Coronation. That piece of the festival caused a stir in the community last year when the winner lost her crown a day after her coronation over social media posts showing her holding a marijuana cigarette. New leaders of the festival later apologized to the pageant winner, Taylor Hamlin.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Officials in the city are creating unique learning spaces to help students traumatized by violence and poverty. Trauma-sensitive schools offer mental-health clinicians, mindfulness exercises, and abundant “peace corners” with pillows and books where students can retreat and compose themselves. The schools come in response to a growing realization among educators that chronic childhood trauma affects brain development and creates the risk of health problems. The need to address childhood trauma and mental health was underscored in Baltimore in 2015. The death of young black man Freddie Gray in police custody brought renewed attention to poverty, inequity and crime in large swaths of Baltimore. And the city drew national attention when President Donald Trump tweeted that its congressional district is a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An archaeological dig in historic Chinatown has been cut short after it turned up a 1980s music cassette, a toy dinosaur and other bric-a-brac. The city’s Archaeology Program tweeted Tuesday that it was wrapping up its three-week excavation because researchers reached the water table, and it was unsafe to dig further. The excavation of a vacant lot near the neighborhood’s distinctive gateway had been expected to last until early autumn. In recent days, researchers have been humorously tweeting some of their “finds,” including a cassette by Boston R&B group New Edition, a dinosaur toy, linoleum flooring, and other items from the 1970s and 1980s. Researchers had hoped to turn up artifacts shedding new light on Boston’s immigrants from China, Syria, Ireland and England who sought new lives in Chinatown from 1840 to 1980.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A mission to return the Arctic grayling to state waters is nearing a milestone. Juvenile grayling are scheduled to arrive soon at the Oden State Fish Hatchery in Emmet County, where an ultraviolet water disinfection system recently was installed. Fish production manager Ed Eisch of the Department of Natural Resources says the system will prevent fish already in the area from being infected by viruses or bacteria that the newly arrived grayling might bring along. They were collected as eggs in Alaska and have been kept at Michigan State University. The juvenile fish will be reared in isolation at Oden. Once cleared by health testing, they’ll be transferred to Marquette State Fish Hatchery to continue maturing. Grayling are native to Michigan but died out because of logging and overfishing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: About 200 people protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies blocked traffic near a Twin Cities federal building at Fort Snelling on Tuesday. The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building houses an immigration court sometimes referred to as “deportation court.” Demonstrators blocked traffic late Tuesday afternoon in protest of ICE policies at the Mexican border, the separation of families and conditions in immigrant detention centers. Police cited about 25 protesters. Some held signs that read “Close the Camps” and “Abolish Ice.” The protest was part of a national movement called #NeverAgainIsNow, which links the Holocaust to America’s treatment of migrants arriving from Central America.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Wildlife Federation’s Mississippi Wildlife Extravaganza has long been considered the unofficial start of hunting season in the state and draws tens of thousands of outdoor enthusiasts, but this year may prove different. Sportsmen say they’ll boycott the event this weekend, and vendors are dropping out over the organization’s stance on floodwater pumps in the south Delta. Flooding there most of the year has led to damaged homes, loss of crops, business closings and wildlife deaths. At its peak, floodwater covered a reported 550,000 acres of prime farmland and wildlife habitat. Proponents of the pumps say much of the flooding could have been avoided if pumps were installed at the Steele Bayou Control structure to push backwater out. But MWF has publicly opposed the pumps over environmental damage concerns.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A spokesman for the University of Missouri’s flagship campus says the school has identified fewer than 10 students whose parents may have taken advantage of a financial aid loophole. At issue is a practice of wealthy parents transferring guardianship of their children to friends or relatives to make it appear they came from poorer backgrounds, making them eligible for more financial aid. The U.S. Education Department is being urged to make changes to close the loophole. University of Missouri spokesman Christian Basi says the school will pull the funding it provides based on need and notify federal authorities if the determination is made that guardianship changes were done solely to take advantage of financial aid. Basi says no one will be kicked out of school, but the university is “extremely disappointed.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The blood supplier of area hospitals says it needs more donors after its daily blood donation count has fallen by more than half. The Billings Gazette reports Vitalant of Montana aims to get between 150 and 200 units of blood each day, but the daily donation has dropped to about 70 units. St. Vincent Healthcare and the Billings Clinic said in a joint statement that the blood supply is “alarmingly low,” so they need more people to donate regularly. Vitalant donor recruitment manager Erin Baker says the supplier has had trouble attracting donors who are ages 24-40. Most of the donors are 50 and older. Baker says a person would ideally donate blood at least three times a year.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state trooper has cited a driver after pulling over a vehicle that had registration stickers painted onto its license plates. Nebraska State Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas says the vehicle was stopped Monday morning at an Interstate 80 exit in north Lincoln. Trooper Adam Strode spotted the problem, and he ticketed the driver for having fictitious plates and not having valid registration. It’s unclear whether the driver also was the artist whose unsteady hand fashioned two rough red rectangles in the upper right-hand corner of the plates. The number 5 was in the middle, signifying a May expiration for 2020. Thomas says troopers to whom he’s talked told him it was the first time they’d heard of or “seen anything like this.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Airport officials say a 3.1% jump in the number of passengers for the first half of 2019 puts McCarran International Airport on record pace to top 50 million passengers for the year. The Clark County Department of Aviation reports the 4.5 million arriving and departing travelers at the airport in June followed an all-time-high monthly tally of 4.6 million passengers in May. The airport handled a record-high 49.7 million passengers in 2018. McCarran is one of the 10 busiest airports in the nation based on passenger count. Domestic airlines have handled more than 22.8 million McCarran passengers through June, up 2.9% from the first half of 2018. Southwest Airlines is the busiest carrier at the airport, followed by Delta, Spirit, American and United.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHenniker: An annual gathering of current and former foster youth has a rap music theme this year. Participants at Thursday’s Youth Voices Summit at New England College in Henniker will attend workshops on topics such as getting a college degree; finding a job; choosing a career; budgeting; self-advocacy; forming healthy relationships; and finding help for substance abuse. This year’s keynote speaker is Ethan Birch, also known as rapper Six 8. He’s been a vocal youth advocate at several national events, including the Future Business Leaders of America State Convention. In addition to providing the keynote address, Ethan will lead an afternoon workshop on positive rap. The event will also include a listening session led by the Office of the Child Advocate and a youth talent show.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nManasquan: The state’s senior U.S. senator wants federal officials to take more aggressive action to protect beachgoers from wind-swept beach umbrellas. Bob Menendez held a news conference to once again call on the Consumer Product Safety Commission to improve its regulations and develop an aggressive campaign to educate beachgoers on the dangers the umbrellas can pose if they’re not properly staked in the sand. But the Democrat stressed that he wasn’t calling for a ban on umbrellas. A woman was speared in the leg by a beach umbrella last summer in the Jersey Shore community of Seaside Heights. CPSC statistics show that more than 31,000 people were treated at hospitals for umbrella-related injuries from 2008-2017.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The mother of a Navajo girl who was kidnapped and killed in 2016 urged tribal officials and children’s advocates Tuesday to take advantage of tools and funding under a law that expands access to the nation’s Amber Alert system. Pamela Foster spoke during a training at Isleta Pueblo, south of Albuquerque, for tribes seeking to implement the alert system. Despite a 2007 pilot project, it was not in place on the Navajo Nation when her daughter Ashlynne Mike was abducted near Shiprock. Her disappearance was a catalyst for the state to fully implement Amber Alerts. “I want you to know there was nothing worse than finding out there were no Amber Alert systems on the reservation at the time when we needed it most. No roadway digital signs, no text alerts,” Foster said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State ethics officials are threatening to fine a woman up to $75,000 for unregistered lobbying after she rented billboards to criticize state laws on molestation and share her own story of abuse. Kat Sullivan, a nurse who says she was assaulted by a teacher at a private school upstate two decades ago, was part of the successful push that got lawmakers in Albany to relax the statute of limitations on molestation. Sullivan got the billboard idea from the film “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” about a woman who used billboards to seek justice for her daughter’s unsolved murder. Sullivan also set up a website and hired a pilot to fly a plane around Albany carrying a banner supporting the legislation. Then she received a letter saying she could be fined for violating a law requiring individuals to register as lobbyists if they spend more than $5,000 on efforts to influence the Legislature.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHillsborough: Officials are looking for an emu on the loose that was last spotted jumping on the hood of a car before running away. News outlets report that officials say the emu, nicknamed “Eno,” was sighted over the weekend. Orange County Animal Services spokesperson Tenille Fox says it’s believed to be in the Hillsborough area. An Orange County government Twitter account posted an emu’s mugshot Friday with the word “wanted” in red letters. Officials say it’s been on the run for about five weeks. They don’t know where the flightless bird escaped from. Fox says people shouldn’t try to catch it but instead should call animal services. Fox says owning emus is legal in Orange County. She says they’re often kept on farms and don’t usually run away.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A landowners group has sued the state over a new law related to compensation for the use of cavities in underground rock formations. The Bismarck Tribune reports the Northwest Landowners Association filed its lawsuit Monday challenging the law that takes effect Thursday. The group says the new law amounts to the unconstitutional taking of private property rights. Gov. Doug Burgum in April signed the legislation that sought to clarify issues surrounding the cavities known as “pore space,” which may be used to inject saltwater from oil and gas production or for enhanced oil recovery. Under the new law, some landowners cannot be compensated for their pore space. Burgum has said the law clarifies legal issues related to underground injection, which should boost the state’s energy industry.\n\nOhio\n\nGarfield Heights: A judge wants to take a second look at a 10-day jail sentence given to a 79-year-old woman for refusing to stop feeding stray cats in her suburban Cleveland neighborhood. Cleveland.com reports that Garfield Heights Municipal Court Judge Jennifer Weiler wants to hear the case herself after a jail sentence handed down to Nancy Segula by a city magistrate last week was widely criticized. Segula acknowledges repeatedly violating a city ordinance making it illegal for people to feed dogs and cats that aren’t their own. She was sentenced to jail after her fourth appearance in court for the violations. She says she lost her husband and her own cats in 2017, and she began feeding the cats because she’s lonely.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWelch: Authorities are starting a new search for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for nearly 20 years. Craig County District Attorney’s spokeswoman Michelle Lowry says the search for Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible is being held near the Picher area, where authorities have said the girls’ bodies are believed to have been dumped. The girls disappeared Dec. 30, 1999, from Freeman’s home in nearby Welch. Freeman’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were found fatally shot in the burned home. In April 2018, authorities charged 68-year-old Ronnie Dean Busick with four counts of first-degree murder in the case and said two other suspects are dead. Busick has denied involvement in the case and is undergoing a mental competency evaluation.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A real estate investor has donated undeveloped land to Portland Audubon’s Wildlife Sanctuary. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Marty Kehoe and his family have donated Pittock Place. The 22-acre plot borders Forest Park, a public park west of downtown. Audubon officials say the property is one of the largest, most ecologically valuable parcels on the periphery of the park. The land is worth an estimated $14 million and was slated for development of 32 multimillion-dollar homes. Officials say donors raised $200,000 to pay the property’s remaining mortgage, which was Kehoe’s only stipulation. The City of Portland contributed $350,000 to purchase a conservation easement. The city is also expected to provide $150,000 for restoration services including invasive plant removal and water quality protection.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvanians who prefer not to be identified as male or female will soon have a gender-neutral option on their state-issued driver’s licenses. The state joins more than 10 others that have rolled out plans to give residents options. The Daily Item of Sunbury reports Pennsylvania Department of Transportation expects to have the new procedure in place by the middle of next year. It will let motorists use “X” as a third option to indicate gender. A department spokeswoman says the agency is able to make the change on its own and doesn’t need authorization from the Republican-controlled Legislature. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday that the department made the decision, but it’s consistent with his opinions about equity and fairness.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Providence Teachers Union has declared its commitment to work with the state to reform the city’s schools. The report from the union came less than a week after state Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green was given sweeping authority to turn around Providence Public Schools. The union’s document details several reform recommendations, including addressing chronic teacher absenteeism, increasing the number of educators of color and integrating community members into everyday work at schools. Infante-Green responded to the union in a statement saying she welcomes the commitment from teachers. The Department of Education sought control of Providence schools after a searing report last month from the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy labeled it among the worst public school systems in the nation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLexington: The state Department of Education has been granted $8million to buy new school buses thanks to a settlement involving Volkswagen. State leaders including Gov. Henry McMaster made the announcement Tuesday in Lexington. The money will be used to buy 78 school buses that run on propane. The state has been criticized as having one of the worst school bus fleets in the country. Lawmakers set aside $19 million from lottery profits this year for school buses. Charleston’s transit system received money for two electric buses and charging stations. Anderson received money for a bus fueled by compressed natural gas. South Carolina will receive nearly $34 million from the 2016 emissions settlement the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached with Volkswagen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union is creating a new position in the state focusing on indigenous issues. ACLU director of campaigns Sabrina King says the position will be modeled on the organization’s indigenous justice program in Montana. King will supervise the new South Dakota position. The ACLU has long wanted to build on its work on indigenous issues in the state. The idea took on new urgency after South Dakota this year passed laws aimed at potential Keystone XL protests. The laws allow for tougher penalties for so-called riot boosting, defined in part as encouraging violence during a riot. The ACLU is challenging the law in federal court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is providing access to federal grant programs to help communities and volunteer fire departments become better equipped for wildfires. The state Department of Agriculture will accept applications for Hazard Mitigation Assistance program grants from Aug. 5 through Sept. 20. Eligible communities must have crafted or be in the process of crafting a Community Wildfire Prevention Plan. The grants offer full reimbursement up to $20,000 for communities to implement wildfire prevention efforts and education projects. A program to help fire departments serving 10,000 or fewer people will open Aug. 5 and end Sept. 13. The Volunteer Fire Assistance Program offers 50% reimbursement for wildland fire equipment and supplies from $1,000 to $6,000.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Officials have approved a settlement in a federal lawsuit over the bail system in Harris County that ensures that most people accused of misdemeanor offenses don’t languish in jail. The bail system in the state’s most populous county had been deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge following a 2016 lawsuit alleging poor misdemeanor defendants remained jailed because of their poverty. Harris County commissioners approved the settlement by a 3-2 vote Tuesday, with the two Republicans on the court voting against it. The settlement ensures most people charged with misdemeanor offenses would be released within hours of arrest and would get help to ensure they attend future court appearances. The judge handling the lawsuit could give final approval at an Aug. 21 court hearing.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s decision to award a smaller number of medical marijuana grower licenses than allowed by law is being challenged by six companies that say the state granted licenses to unqualified cultivators and had inappropriate interactions with applicants, among other claims. Chris Hughes, director of the state’s Division of Purchasing, confirmed that six rejected applicants met Friday’s appeal deadline. The administrative appeal could further delay the rollout of medical marijuana for the state because state law says licenses cannot be finalized until protests are resolved. Utah’s Department of Agriculture and Food selected eight companies to grow medical marijuana for its program set to open next year. Although the new law allows Utah to award up to 10 licenses at the start of the program, state officials say they chose to only hand out eight to avoid an oversupply of cannabis.\n\nVermont\n\nCastleton: Castleton University has received accreditation from the New England Commission of Higher Learning for the newest extension of its nursing program. The school took over the registered nurse bachelor’s degree program previously offered by Southern Vermont College in Bennington, which closed after the spring semester. The Rutland Herald reports the new program will be in the Vermont Mill Building in Bennington. It used to be home to the radiology and X-ray programs and is being renovated before the fall semester. More than 30 students are enrolled; 25 are from Southern Vermont College. School officials say the nursing shortage is ongoing, and 3,800 nursing positions will be vacant in the next five years. Castleton nursing educators say there’s a plan in the works for a potential master’s program.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A video rental store that is believed to be among the last of its size on the East Coast is set to close this month. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Naro Expanded Video Archival Library in Norfolk will close by the end of August. The store has more than 42,000 video titles and outlasted a vast number of video rental businesses that have already closed across the country. But like them, it fell victim to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Naro Video converted from a business to a nonprofit in 2016 and partially relied on fundraisers. One raised $45,000 from 440 people in less than two days. That likely kept it going for another two years. But such efforts couldn’t provide sustainability over the long term.\n\nWashington\n\nSeatac: Democrats have elected the first female speaker of the state House. With the selection of state Rep. Laurie Jinkins of Tacoma, Washington becomes the eighth state to have a woman in the top spot in the House and is now the second state to have a gay speaker of the House, joining Oregon. “I’m really proud to be the first woman, the first out lesbian serving in this position,” Jenkins said at a news conference after the vote. “I believe very, very strongly that the diversity of our caucus really more and more is representing the diversity of our state and helps us make better decisions for the people of this state. I’m proud to be a part of carrying that forward.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: People recovering from substance abuse disorder can get rides to appointments under a forthcoming project in the area. The Herald-Dispatch reports the Appalachian Regional Commission has provided more than $215,000 for the one-year pilot program. ARC federal co-chair Tim Thomas says it will start in October in the Huntington region. Thomas says those recovering from substance abuse disorder often do not have an active driver’s license or own a vehicle. Rides will be given for recovery and treatment appointments, probation meetings, mandatory court appearances, job interviews or to a new job. Other program sponsors include the Appalachian Transportation Institute, the state Department of Health and Human Resources, the Office of Drug Control Policy and the West Virginia Governor’s Council on Substance Abuse and Prevention.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is pushing to toughen state rules to reduce nitrate contamination in ground and surface water as concerns grow about pollution across the state. Evers announced Wednesday that he is directing the state Department of Natural Resources to establish nitrate performance standards for soil most likely to be contaminated. Environmental group Clean Wisconsin praised the news, saying creating new rules for how nitrates are applied to farm fields is an important step for protecting rural drinking water across the state. Evers is directing state agencies to start the process of creating a rule that will govern the level of nitrates that will be allowable. Studies have shown that agricultural sources such as manure and commercial fertilizer are the most common sources of nitrate pollution.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne Frontier Days officials report a slight increase in attendance at night shows this year, while rodeo attendance saw a slight drop.

When the plans for the new Staybridge Suites were announced in 2016, it was known that the 114-room hotel would displace the city’s only skate park. But the mural that depicted local civil rights celebrities Jo Ann Robinson, Rosa Parks and E.D. Nixon is gone. Mike Reinehr, owner of Alabama Machinery and Supply Co., gave artist Tim Kerr permission to paint the mural in 2015 but granted the hotel’s request to paint over it. After all, he said, the new hotel is mere feet from his building and the mural would have been visible only from the parking lot.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The rapid melting of glaciers because of climate change has created a new market for Alaska’s tour operators. Operators of several tour companies are experiencing an increase in customers booking trips to see the receding glaciers before they lose access to them, the Anchorage Daily News reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The city has named a street after boxing great Muhammad Ali. The former three-time heavyweight champion, who died June 3, 2016, lived the final decade of his life in Paradise Valley. His widow, Lonnie Ali, was among the dignitaries at a ceremony to reveal Muhammad Ali Way street signs on what had been Merrell Street between Central and Third avenues.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: A veterans benefit fair and a recognition ceremony for Korean War veterans will be held Saturday at the Baxter County Fairgrounds.

The Sheriff’s Office says some people chained themselves together while others walked onto the property. The group says it took away about 30 ducklings.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A housing authority accused of violating the federal rights of tenants with disabilities by charging a $300 fee for companion animals has settled a lawsuit for $950,000. The agreement followed a three-year fight over the Meeker Housing Authority’s efforts to tighten restrictions on keeping pets at the federally subsidized apartment building for families. Attorneys said the agency refused to make exceptions for two tenants whose cats and dog were recommended by doctors to cope with depression and anxiety. One of the affected tenants, 23-year-old A.J. White, has severe depression and often refused to get out of bed until he and his father adopted two cats named Genki and Haim. A.J. White has held a job as a cashier for five years and graduated high school but medication can exacerbate his depression and anxiety, said his father, Lonnie White. The cats changed everything.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Retired U.S. District Judge Ellen Bree Burns, the first woman to serve on the federal bench in Connecticut and widely admired as a pioneer and role model, has died at 95. Burns, nominated by President Jimmy Carter in 1978, served nearly four decades on the federal bench. Mobsters, Hells Angels and drug dealers were among those she sent to prison. “Most of my cases now were drug cases,” Burns said shortly before she retired in 2015. “Things haven’t gotten better since the war on drugs began. It’s awful, all the destruction this causes to families, neighborhoods and cities. I look at the families of the defendants and just wonder how awful it is for them.” U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill said of Burns: \"She was just a trailblazer.\"\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic lawmakers want to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. The proposal comes after Democrats who control both chambers of the General Assembly rammed through a minimum wage increase in the middle of the night on the final day of last year’s session but had to delay implementation after Republicans withheld support for a key budget bill. A new bill would increase the $8.75 minimum wage to $11 on Jan. 1, 2020, followed by a $1 raise each year until it hits $15 in 2024.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: City Councilman David Grosso plans to resurrect a bill to decriminalize sex work in the District, and two women were arrested after they climbed flagpoles to hang signs reading “decrim now” in pink letters. A 2017 effort was opposed by Council Chairman Phil Mendelson; Councilman Jack Evans said the 2017 bill would make the city a “mecca for prostitution.”\n\nFlorida\n\nClearwater: A male alligator was found in a kitchen after breaking into a Clearwater home, the Naples Daily News reports. The 10- to 11-foot gator broke in through low windows about 3:30 a.m. Friday; a video of the critter in the resident’s kitchen has since gone viral. The gator knocked over several wine bottles and suffered minor cuts to a shoulder during its capture, Clearwater police spokeswoman Joelle Castelli says. The gator will be taken to a private farm in Fort Meade if deemed to be a candidate for relocation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s public transit agency has laid out a preliminary timeline that delays some highly anticipated construction projects, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority calls for launching two bus rapid transit lines and making other bus improvements by 2025. Construction would also start in the coming years on a streetcar extension. But light rail along the Atlanta Beltline would not be completed until after 2040 and would include only two-thirds of the Beltline loop.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A Maui landlord was ordered to pay nearly $3,000 for taking items from the apartment of his pregnant tenant while police were investigating her disappearance.

Scott’s landlord Nafetalai Finau, 71, was sentenced for taking her things, including a television and baby toys.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Researchers at the University of Idaho say the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere from forest fires in the West is being greatly overestimated, possibly leading to poor land management decisions. Their study published in the journal Global Change Biology say many estimates are 59% to 83% higher than what is found in field observations. The researchers say it’s important to correct overestimates of carbon released during fires because federal and local governments use such estimates when making land management decisions for activities such as logging.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Filmmaker Richard Rowley’s documentary about the 2014 fatal shooting of Chicago teenager Laquan McDonald by police officer Jason Van Dyke will premiere on Showtime June 14 after a screening at the University of Chicago.

A special education teacher at Bailly Preparatory Academy gave the boy the trophy May 23 during a fifth-grade awards luncheon attended by students, parents and the principal. The boy’s father said his family was blindsided. The district’s emergency manager said disciplinary action was being taken against the employees involved but he declined to comment on their employment status.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Because of wet weather, it has been decades since Iowa farmers were so far behind in planting their expected corn and soybean crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that 80% of the expected corn crop had been planted by Sunday, the smallest percentage since 1982. The 41% of the soybean crop that had been planted was the smallest percentage since 1993.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A man is suing the city for nearly $2.78 million in damages for injuries he suffered when he fell through a gap in a highway bridge in the same place four people have plunged through since 2001, including a 14-year-old boy who died. The lawsuit contends Trong Do Turner suffered severe and disabling injuries on July 9, 2017, when he fell through a gap between the northbound and southbound lanes of the Kansas Avenue Bridge where he mistakenly believed there was a sidewalk.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Republican Gov. Matt Bevin says he doesn’t know anything about the circumstances leading to the dismissal of his lieutenant governor’s chief of staff – a shake-up that prompted Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton to send out a tweet asking for prayers in her fight against “dark forces.” Bevin dropped Hampton from his ticket as he launched his reelection campaign. Hampton has said little publicly about her removal. But the dismissal of her top deputy intensified her feud with Bevin’s administration over shake-ups in her office.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Bye-bye, cauliflower rice. See you later, chicken-free strips. State lawmakers have agreed to labeling restrictions that will keep veggie products from being called meat, non-rice products from being described as rice and sugar alternatives from being marketed as sugar. A 31-7 Senate vote Tuesday gave final passage to the bill by Democratic Sen. Francis Thompson. Supporters say they’re making sure consumers know what they’re buying and protecting farmers who have spent millions to brand their products. But opponents say the change will limit veggie product availability in Louisiana.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: It may not qualify as a thrill on Blueberry Hill, but some changes are coming in the way Maine promotes the important crop. The Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine will now have 10 members instead of eight, and five must be representatives of growers, potentially including organic growers and members of tribal groups. The industry has faced low prices to growers and declines in the size of the harvest in recent years.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: As the mid-Atlantic heats up and sharks migrate to northern waters, a great white shark has paid a visit near Ocean City. OCEARCH, a research organization that tracks sharks and other species by satellite, says the tagged shark named Brunswick (after the Georgia city) is 8 feet, 9 inches long and weighs about 430 pounds. Brunswick was first tagged Feb. 26 off the coast of Hilton Head, South Carolina. Since then, he has traveled about 1,290 miles, OCEARCH says.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts could soon be a step closer to banning hand-held cellphone use by motorists. The state Senate is expected to take up legislation on Thursday that aims to crack down on distracted drivers who are blamed for thousands of serious crashes each year. The House passed a similar bill last month. Under the legislation, motorists would be allowed to use only cellphones with hands-free technology.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Planning on spending summer vacation at one of the nation’s top island destinations? There’s a reward out for that. Mackinac Island is offering a program for dining and hotel purchases that gives users 5-10% back through its 906 Rewards Club.

The family-run Red Barn Farm in Northfield hosts weddings and a public pizza night. With the love from the community, the family behind the popular barn never questioned whether they would rebuild. “It was pretty touching, and to have a big group of people come out and help us with that tree mess. It was like, ‘Wow,’ ” owner Tammy Winter told WCCO-TV. The Winters have weddings booked into 2020, including one for their daughter.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Mississippi’s shrimp fleet has received its ceremonial blessing for the 90th time, even as shrimpers worry about floodwaters harming shrimp production. WLOX-TV reports shrimp boats passed through the Biloxi Channel with flags flying after a wreath was dropped from a helicopter to remember those who have died. The Mississippi Sound, a nursery for young shrimp, has been inundated with Mississippi River floodwater released through Louisiana’s Bonnet Carre Spillway. That’s made the protected arm of the Gulf of Mexico much less salty than usual, and could harm shrimp production.\n\nMissouri\n\nJoplin: Those cleaning up from a southwest Missouri tornado outbreak have a new challenge after a heavy rain: mosquitoes. “Nuisance mosquitoes are usually the first populations to take advantage of flooded conditions,” said Howard Pue of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. “But those populations begin to die down as waters recede.” Gary Stubblefield, a volunteer coordinator, said those cleaning up after an EF-3 tornado struck Carl Junction on May 22 have asked for repellent contributions since their second day at the site.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: It’s warming up in Great Falls, but a dry fall followed by a long stretch of subzero weather in February may have had devastating effects on the city’s plant life. City forester Todd Seymanski says some damaged trees and shrubs may have enough stored energy to survive, while others that appear healthy now may fail in the coming months, the Great Falls Tribune reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: The longtime editor of the Norfolk Daily News in northeast Nebraska says he intends to retire this summer. Kent Warneke worked for the Omaha World-Herald before becoming managing editor at the Daily News in 1982. He moved up to become editor and vice president in 1992. Warneke says “there couldn’t be a better place to have spent all these years than in Norfolk at the Daily News.” His successor hasn’t been named.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A burger joint often ranked among the best in Nevada – a sizzling outpost of double cheeseburgers on a wind-scoured stretch of U.S. 95 – has gone on the market. Socorro’s Burger Hut occupies blazing barn-red digs in Mina, a minuscule settlement (population 150 or so) in dusty Mineral County. “I’m getting old, honey,” says owner Soccoro Streight, 74, who has been chief cook and bottle washer for 16 years.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: Two University of New Hampshire students have been accused of using stolen credit cards to pay for tuition.

Chenghan Wang, 20, was accused of using a credit card from Maryland to charge over $6,300 to pay UNH.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New Jersey property-tax payers would get a $125 refundable credit on their income taxes under a proposal that also calls for higher rates on the wealthy that Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy detailed for the first time Monday. A key component of the proposed relief hinges on raising income tax rates for people making $1 million and above from 8.97% to 10.75%.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico School for the Arts jazz instructor Orlando Madrid has been fired for making up fake awards for a student.

Madrid told the newspaper he made the certificates based on judges’ input and that he thought the awards would help with fundraising.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: New York would be the first state in the U.S. to ban the declawing of cats under legislation approved by lawmakers Tuesday at the request of cat owners, animal welfare advocates and many veterinarians who call the procedure cruel and needless. The bill, which would subject veterinarians to $1,000 fines for performing the operation, now heads to the desk of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo,\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreensboro: Two Guilford County judges have made emotional pleas to stop “senseless” violence. Superior Court Judge David Hall sentenced a man Monday to 25 years in prison for second-degree murder and armed robbery, telling him the murder was senseless and calling the robbery that took place days later indicative of the mindset that has “devoured” most of the county. Judge Lora Cubbage scolded a 27-year-old woman accused of ordering the death of a 16-year-old. Cubbage, who is black, shouted that the woman shouldn’t “tell me another black life matters if it doesn’t matter to you.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A longtime pilot and flight instructor says he’s considering legal action to get his license back, claiming he’s the victim of age discrimination. Victor Gelking, 91, says federal regulators revoked his pilot’s and flight instructor licenses after he was involved in a moving violation at Hector International Airport. KFGO reports he’s accused of crossing a closed runway without permission from the control tower. Gelking says he passed his medical exams and that his age is not relevant to his license status.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Just like in the 1963 Alfred Hitchcock film, an Ohio woman reports that she was attacked twice in two nights by red-winged blackbirds at Voice of America Park in West Chester.

Construction has started on a 20,000-square-foot addition, and the existing 42,000 square feet will be renovated. A lunar space module, which stands two stories tall, and an F-117 stealth fighter jet will be the main attractions in the addition. The $5.4 million project will result in about 400 new exhibits.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Harry’s Fresh Foods plans to close its Portland operation in August and lay off 195 employees as it moves to Everett, Washington. Officials say the 80,000-square-foot food processing and packaging site is too small and too poorly maintained to operate economically. Harry’s was established 41 years ago in Oregon City as Harry’s Mustache Restaurant. The company sells refrigerated and frozen soups, meals, side dishes and desserts. Kettle Cuisine of Massachusetts purchased Harry’s in April.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Amid growing demand among mothers and hospitals for breast milk, Pennsylvania is considering regulating milk donations to ban unsafe practices. A bill approved 191-1 in the state House prohibits the sale of human milk by any entity not licensed by the state Department of Health. The legislation sets standards for screening donors and requires licensed milk banks to follow policies set by professional associations or the law. The bill now goes to the Senate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A priest is asking parishioners not to leave his church over a tweet by Rhode Island’s bishop urging Roman Catholics to not support or attend LGBTQ Pride Month events. The Rev. Edward L. Pieroni begged gay and lesbian parishioners not to leave the church. “A lot of people have hung in there, but it’s like, ‘One more slap and we are done.’ I am here to beg you – and I will get on my hands and knees and beg you – not to leave,” Pieroni told the congregation at St. Raymond’s Roman Catholic Church.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The Five Points post office in Columbia will no longer allow homeless to sleep inside overnight.

It has to be torn down.” House Democratic leader Mike Stewart calls the hiring of Buss “extraordinarily disappointing, but unfortunately not surprising.”\n\nTexas\n\nKilleen: Fort Hood’s famous “hug lady” will have a room named after her at the terminal where she hugged thousands of soldiers deploying to war zones. The Killeen Daily Herald reports that Elizabeth Laird will be honored inside the air terminal at Fort Hood, the U.S. Army post that’s one of the largest military bases in the world.

Some local coffee shop owners said they welcomed the addition and weren’t too concerned about the new competition.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A painting of a prominent Lake Champlain geological formation commissioned as part of a New Deal program in the 1930s but hidden behind a wall at the University of Vermont for almost three decades is getting a new chance at public life. Construction workers renovating a building used by UVM’s engineering department discovered the painting last week. The painting was walled in during a renovation in the early 1990s because there was no money to move it. The geological formation, known locally as Lone Rock Point, helps define Burlington’s waterfront by marking the northern boundary of the bay that includes the waterfront park, public beach, pedestrian path, ferry docks and marinas.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: So far this year, Maggie Martino, 13, has coordinated a fundraiser at her school, donated money to the University of Virginia Children’s Hospital, set up book donations to middle schools and encouraged Augusta County to support Limb Loss Awareness Month – all while recovering from a leg amputation in February. The Beverley Manor Middle School student lost her leg following complications from a rare congenital disorder called Parkes Weber syndrome. “It’s been unbelievable how much support and kindness [people] have shown,” says Amber Martino, Maggie’s mom.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A new report finds there are 56 missing American Indian women in the state, with 20 of those from Yakima County and 12 from King County. The 36-page report to the Legislature was compiled by Washington State Patrol Capt. Monica Alexander. Yakama Nation activist Emily Washines says it’s heartbreaking that nearly half of Washington state’s missing Native women cases were in Yakima County.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice is unveiling an advertising campaign to promote the state nationwide. A year ago, the state started an advertising push using John Denver’s iconic song “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” That campaign targeted regional out-of-state markets from Cleveland to Charlotte, North Carolina. Justice has a postgraduate degree in marketing and advertising. One of his 2016 campaign themes was to make the state a tourist mecca in hopes of creating thousands of jobs.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJanesville: Wisconsin-based Bliss Communications will sell its daily newspapers – The Gazette in Janesville and The EagleHerald in Marinette – to Adams Publishing Group in mid-June.

They are the last remaining lottery holdouts in America.\n\nSince 1964, when New Hampshire became the first to offer a state lottery, 44 states have started their own or joined multi-state jackpots. (Mississippi was the most recent state to add lotto games in 2019.)\n\nStates, often under budget pressures, introduced lotteries as a way to add revenue without raising taxes. They found willing partners in gambling companies that benefit from running lottery games.\n\nMore than 200,000 retail stores and other outlets in the United States sell lottery tickets. In 2019, lottery sales topped $91 billion, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.\n\nBut the five holdouts have a number of reasons why they haven’t joined the rest of the country in adopting state lotteries.\n\nAlabama and Utah prohibit gambling in their state constitutions, and religious groups in these conservative states have for years blocked efforts to legalize casinos or adopt lotteries.\n\nUtah, where more than 60% of the the state’s population are members of the Church of Latter Day Saints, has long opposed a lottery.\n\nEfforts to add a lottery have gained strength in Alabama, however, and the state could be getting closer to adopting one.\n\n“Alabama has been trying to pass a lottery since the election of Don Siegelman as governor in 1998. Churches helped defeat a lottery referendum the following year,” said Jonathan D. Cohen, author of “For a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America.”\n\nNow, 24 years later, “I think they might be serious this time, as Mississippi finally got its lottery act together,” he said.\n\nIn Nevada’s case, public lotteries have been blocked by the powerful casino industry, which views sales of lotto tickets in convenience and grocery stores as competition — even though many stores have slot machines instead of lottery tickets.\n\nIn the past, pressure to add lotteries has often come from neighboring states. That’s because when one state adds a lottery, people often flood across state lines to buy tickets. The holdout state then has an incentive to keep the revenue from ticket purchases in its own state.\n\nHawaii and Alaska, of course, don’t have any US neighbors and don’t face this problem.\n\n“That allows them to not have a lottery without people going across the border,” said Victor Matheson, a professor of economics and accounting at College of the Holy Cross who studies lotteries.\n\nConcerns that lower-income households spend a disproportionate share of their incomes on lotteries compared to wealthier households have also blocked lottery expansion.\n\n“A lot of states have been reluctant to start lotteries in the first place,” Matheson said. “They are worried about their regressive nature and gambling addiction.”\n\nAn investigation of state lotteries by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found that in every state where lotteries are legal, stores that sell tickets are disproportionately clustered in lower-income communities. And far more money is wagered every year on instant scratch-off games, which studies show attract more low-income gamblers, than huge jackpot drawings such as Powerball.\n\nRecently, states that have adopted lotteries have emphasized that sales from tickets will go to social programs.\n\nBut lotteries are a “really unwise way to fund education and other public services,” said David Just, a professor of economics at Cornell University who has studied behavioral decisions around lottery tickets. The people likeliest to buy tickets are often the same ones who most rely on these government programs, he said.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/business/walmart-best-buy-gap-promotions", "title": "Here come the discounts at Walmart, Best Buy and Gap | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA glimmer of relief is emerging at the checkout aisle: the return of discounts.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), Gap (GPS), Target (TGT), Bath & Body Works and others are increasing promotions and lowering prices on merchandise to entice inflation-weary shoppers to buy extra goods sitting on their shelves.\n\nMonths ago these chains stocked up on merchandise, preparing for supply chain shortages and what they projected to be robust consumer demand. But since they ordered, their plans have been derailed by the highest inflation in more than 40 years and slumping consumer confidence.\n\nRising inflation has forced many consumers to pull back — particularly low-and-middle income shoppers, several retailers say. Cash-strapped shoppers are struggling to afford groceries and gas and have curtailed their discretionary spending.\n\nThis has left retailers with too much of the wrong stuff: Think back to the early days of the pandemic, when everyone was redoing their homes and buying new laptops. Stores are overloaded with that stuff now, and they need to discount those items to juice demand.\n\n“These retailers have mispositioned their inventory,” said Brian Nagel, a retail analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. “In certain areas, they’re too heavy on inventory and need to clear it out.”\n\nWhere to find discounts\n\nSo shoppers can expect to find more deals on discretionary goods such as clothing, electronics, furniture, home goods and bath items — the stuff that has been highly sought after since the start of the pandemic and many people may have already bought.\n\nWalmart: “The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend,” impacting their ability to buy general merchandise, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said last week. Walmart said it would take more markdowns than it previously expected to throughout the inventory, particularly for clothing.\n\nThe company also introduced a new program for customers to buy refurbished items from brands like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung for cheap.\n\nBest Buy: On Wednesday, Best Buy said inflation was impacting consumer-electronics spending, and the electronics industry would be promoting more stuff.\n\n“As high inflation has continued and consumer sentiment has deteriorated, customer demand within the consumer electronics industry has softened even further,” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said.\n\nGap: Earlier this month, Gap said it has been increasing promotions to move out inventory during its second quarter, while Bath & Body Works said that it did the same as it saw store traffic slowing down.\n\n“Customers, particularly lower-income customers, have become more cost conscious and are limiting purchases and/or seeking out lower-priced sale merchandise,” the company said. “They are being impacted by the overall inflationary environment.”\n\nTarget: Last month, Target said it was carrying too many big, bulky products such as furniture, televisions and kitchen appliances during its previous quarter as consumers moved away from those products. “We didn’t anticipate the magnitude of that shift,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said.\n\nTarget marked down some of those bigger items to make room for products in higher demand.\n\nDiscount stores: Shoppers may also be able to find more bargains at closeout retailers such as TJX (TJX) and Burlington (BURL), which capitalize on inventory gluts. These chains buy up high-end goods for cheap, then turn around and sell them to shoppers at a discount from their original price.\n\n“The buying environment now is better than it has been for years,” Burlington CEO Michael O’Sullivan said last month. “We’re seeing brands that we haven’t seen for a couple of years.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/06/saturday-powerball-jackpot-drawing-updates/86013613007/", "title": "Powerball news ahead of Saturday's huge jackpot.

For more updates read USA TODAY's latest coverage here.\n\nA whopping $1.8 billion jackpot is up for grabs Saturday, and time is running out for players interested in the long-shot odds of winning the second-largest lottery jackpot in American history. The Powerball drawing will start on Saturday, Sept. 6, at 10:59 p.m. ET and ticket sales stop before then.\n\nFor people who can afford a ticket (or two, or more), it's a thrilling chance at life-changing money.\n\n\"Two dollars is a low price to pay to dream about being a billionaire – that's true,\" said Victor Matheson, an economics professor at College of the Holy Cross who has studied the lottery and other forms of gambling for decades. \"But as an investment, it's terrible.\"\n\nPeople across the country will try their luck Saturday, but the chances of winning are astonishingly low − about 1 in 292 million, the lottery association said. By comparison, about 342 million live in the United States, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nHere's what to know ahead of Saturday's drawing and who could win − or not.\n\nDid you beat the odds and win? What to know if you have winning ticket.\n\nHow to play the Powerball\n\nTickets are sold for at least $2 at convenience stores, gas stations and grocery stores, among other locations, in 45 states, Puerto Rico, Washington, DC, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some states sell Powerball tickets online, too.\n\nTo play, players have to choose six numbers among five white balls and one red Powerball. The white balls have to be from 1 to 69, and the red ball is from 1 to 26. All five white balls, in any order, and the red Powerball must match the winning numbers. If no one matches, drawings continue.\n\nIf a player wins, they can choose between an annuity option, of the current estimated amount of $1.8 billion, of one immediate payment with 29 yearly payments that increase by 5% annually. Or people can get a current lump sum of $826.4 million.\n\nMost winners have taken the lump sum payout.\n\nYou don't have to win the jackpot to get a big prize, as lesser prizes can be worth $1 million or more.\n\nIs it too late to buy a ticket? When Powerball ticket sales stop by state.\n\nThe deadline to buy a Powerball ticket varies by state. Most sales close one to two hours before the drawing begins at 10:59 p.m. ET.\n\nMost people on the East Coast have until the late evening to buy a ticket, with cutoffs usually around 10 p.m. local time. People on the West Coast should plan on buying earlier in the evening, with cutoffs as early as 6:45 p.m. local time.\n\nHere's the full list of Powerball ticket purchase cutoff times.\n\n- Jonathan Limehouse, USA TODAY\n\nShould I play the Powerball?\n\nIt depends.\n\nWill it be a lighthearted purchase so you can be a part of a national event, or is it a desperate attempt to recoup lost money? Will buying a lottery ticket eat up a noticeable portion of your income? Do you have an emergency fund? Experts say these questions are essential in determining whether you have a healthy view of the lottery.\n\nThe lottery, including the Powerball, should be seen as an entertainment product – not an investment, experts say. That's because your estimated chances of winning the jackpot are about 1 in 292 million. It can also worsen your mental health, especially if you're spending money you can't afford to lose.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with gambling, call or text 1-800-GAMBLER, operated by the National Council on Problem Gambling.\n\nHow much money would the Powerball winner take home?\n\nThe Powerball winner has to pay a high federal tax plus possible state and local taxes, depending on where they live.\n\nIn the lump sum, winners will automatically pay the IRS a 24% off-the-top federal tax withholding.\n\nThe total lump sum is also subject to a federal marginal tax rate of up to 37%.\n\nStates may tax lottery winnings, such as an 8.82% in New York or a 2.9% in North Dakota. Some cities also tax the winnings.\n\nHow much do Americans spend on the Powerball?\n\nThe average American spends $320 a year on lottery tickets, according to a Sept. 2 analysis from the personal finance site LendingTree.\n\nMassachusetts residents spend the most, a whopping $915 per person. North Dakotans spend the least: a measly $50. The data comes from 2023, the most recent figures available, and covers 45 states with lotteries.\n\nAmericans spent $103 billion on lottery tickets in 2023 for a payout of $69 billion.\n\nWould winning the $1.8 billion jackpot be a dream come true?\n\nRecent history is full of examples of people who won big jackpots only to see their lives take nightmarish turns.\n\nSome lottery winners prove that money doesn't always buy happiness. Some have lost fortunes due to family drama and trauma, seen their homes go up in flames or watched their money disappear due to too much partying and lavish spending. Some were plagued by bad investments and unscrupulous advisors.\n\nThe good news: Those stories are outliers. Studies have shown that winning the lottery can bring a measure of happiness that often correlates with levels of satisfaction that also come with financial stability.\n\nHere's a look at how some people have fared after becoming instant millionaires.\n\n- Phaedra Trethan, USA TODAY\n\nWho plays the Powerball?\n\nAmericans from all backgrounds put up hard-earned money for a chance to win the Powerball – especially when jackpots hit eye-popping figures – but gambling most negatively impacts low-income households, experts told USA TODAY.\n\n\"There's no group that really doesn't play the lottery, but they play at different rates,\" said David Just, a Cornell University economics professor.\n\nAcross socio-economic lines, both the rich and the poor participate in the lottery but lower-income groups play at higher rates than wealthier individuals – and they spend higher percentages of their income on lottery games, research shows.\n\nFederal sales data indicates the lottery is most popular in the Northeast, including in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The lottery also sees higher rates of play during times of economic turmoil, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, fitting other known gambling trends that correlate financial blows to increased risk taking.\n\nRead more on the demographics of the Powerball.\n\nWhat are the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot?\n\nGiven the 1-in-292.2 million odds, you’re more likely to be struck by lightning, killed by a shark or dying by a meteorite or asteroid than winning the jackpot.\n\nWhat are the top lottery jackpots in history?\n\nA winner of the latest Powerball could secure the second-largest lottery jackpot ever.\n\nOf the top 10 lottery jackpots in American history, five were won on Powerball tickets while the other five were for Mega Millions drawings. Eight of the top ten drawings happened this decade. The two others took place in 2016 and 2018.\n\nThe biggest lottery jackpot ever won was a massive $2.04 billion prize in a drawing on Nov. 7, 2022. The winner, Edwin Castro of California, purchased his ticket from Joe's Service Center in Altadena, California, near Los Angeles.

Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, is chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nSince the 2016 election campaign, rhetoric from former President Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans in Congress has inspired right-wing domestic terrorists to violence. In this time, we have seen an uptick of extremists of all types willing to engage in political violence, we’ve seen militia groups mobilized to violence for the 2020 election and we’ve seen political violence continue throughout and beyond Trump’s presidency.\n\nBennie G. Thompson Mark Wilson/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nThis August, after the execution of a federal search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, violent rhetoric from the far-right escalated exponentially, including – shockingly – calls for civil war. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, warned that if former President Trump is prosecuted, there will be “riots in the streets.” MAGA Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona compared the FBI to “brown shirts,” a term used to describe Nazi storm troopers.\n\nSadly, public figures on the extreme right are crippling our efforts to curb this violence by attacking the rule of law and continuing to give extremists the go-ahead, either tacitly or expressly.\n\nIn January 2021, hours before the tragic January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Trump declared to his followers on the National Mall, “[I]f you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama told Trump supporters that “[t]oday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass” while telling the crowd that “our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives,” before asking, “Are you willing to do the same?” And no one will forget GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri pumping his fist in solidarity as rioters assembled at the Capitol demanding the election be overturned.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, insurrectionists testified in court that they were only “following presidential orders,” when they breached the Capitol and threatened the lives of all who work there.\n\nMake no mistake, the January 6 attack was not an isolated incident. I have followed the threat of domestic terrorism for nearly two decades, have watched it grow and have urged action to combat it. According to the Department of Homeland Security, it is the greatest terrorism threat to our homeland. And from what we’ve seen after the 2020 election, it is also clearly a threat to the rule of law and our democracy.\n\nSince 2015, the year Trump declared his candidacy for president, there have been 333 domestic terrorism plots or attacks in the United States – an all-time high. Right-wing extremists have perpetrated 80% of those attacks, resulting in 91 tragic deaths.\n\nOur public spaces increasingly face violence. Mass shootings, hostage taking and other violent plots have reduced state capitols, grocery stores, schools, houses of worship, and concerts to crime scenes. Just last week, the federal government released a bulletin warning that there is a heightened threat to next week’s midterm elections by a rise in violent domestic extremism.\n\nThis rise in domestic terrorism comes at a particularly dangerous moment for the country: A recent survey found that half of the country believes “in the next few years, there will be civil war in the United States,” and more than one in 10 Americans expressed their own willingness to commit political violence “to threaten or intimidate” others.\n\nAccording to experts at the University of Chicago, an estimated 13 million Americans believe force would be justified to restore Trump to the White House, and an estimated 15 million Americans would support using force to prevent the former president from being prosecuted. These startling numbers again underline that our safety and security – as well as the rule of law – are under attack.\n\nHaving spent nearly 30 years in Congress, including as Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security and, since last year, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the US Capitol, I know that not every Republican embraces the MAGA extremism that is turning many to violence. But I also know that MAGA Republicans, and their leader, are drowning out the voices of reason within their party while they erode American democracy. In fact, many on the right are all too willing to exploit this extremism – and resulting division – for political gain.\n\nTo understand how MAGA Republicans exploit their followers and dog-whistle at violence, look no further than their reaction to the FBI’s execution of a lawful search warrant for highly classified documents apparently kept illegally at the former President’s beach club. According to the wide breadth of public reporting, the Department of Justice followed the law and all normal procedures after attempting to obtain the classified documents voluntarily. Although no one is above the law in this country, Trump and MAGA extremist politicians’ immediate reaction was to attack the rule of law and dog-whistle at violence.\n\nKnowing full well that MAGA extremists hang on their every word as marching orders, the former President and Republican leaders shamefully nodded toward violence after the execution of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. The former President said he does “not believe the people will stand for it” and said that if the temperature is not brought down in the country, which he has only dialed up, “terrible things are going to happen.” Extremist members of Congress have called for the FBI, the principal law enforcement agency of the United States, to be defunded.\n\nWhat ensued has been all too predictable. Twitter posts about “civil war” rose nearly 3,000% in a matter of hours after the search. Federal law enforcement saw an increase in threats against their officers. A week later, an armed man attempted to breach an FBI office in Ohio before engaging in an hours-long standoff with police. The incident ended when the man pointed his firearm at police and was shot and killed.\n\nMembers of Congress have also been targeted, with one Democratic Congressman reporting that a caller to his office threatened to use a firearm to assassinate him. I have also received threats. And just last week, an armed intruder steeped in right-wing conspiracy theories broke into Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s home in what appeared to be an attempt to kidnap and attack our country’s third-highest ranking elected official.\n\nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media.

We welcome your ideas and comments.\n\nEchoing the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the intruder shouted, “Where is Nancy?” before bludgeoning her 82-year-old husband Paul Pelosi with a hammer, sending him to the hospital with a fractured skull. Of course, rhetoric directed at the Speaker has been violent in nature for years – and pushed by members of Congress.\n\nMany of us in Congress have recognized that the scourge of domestic terrorism, and the extremism that drives it, are a threat to the homeland. We’ve been investigating it for years. We know it when we see it, and we know ignoring it can have deadly consequences. With our democracy and the rule of law now also on the line, we resolve to combat extremism wherever it may occur – even in the halls of Congress.", "authors": ["Bennie G.

Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nEddie Tipton, mastermind of the \"random number\" scam and former security chief of the Urbandale, Iowa-headquartered Multi-State Lottery Association, remains in prison serving a 2017 sentence that could last up to 25 years. His job also barred him from playing the lottery because the association provides games for state lotteries across the USA.\n\nHis brother, Tommy Tipton, a former justice of the peace from Flatonia, Texas, who admitted helping his brother hijack the world's largest lottery network, served a 75-day jail sentence and has been off probation for 15 months.\n\nUsing \"random\" numbers generated from a computer program designed by his brother at the Multi-State Lottery Association, Tommy Tipton acknowledged that he helped to claim prizes in at least two states: Colorado and Oklahoma.\n\nEddie Tipton was ordered to pay almost $1.7 million in restitution while Tommy Tipton was ordered to pay more than $800,000.\n\nFrom prison, Eddie Tipton has paid almost $800. His brother has repaid $587, court records show.\n\nYet, the brothers retain full or partial ownership in more than $1.8 million of property in Fayette County, Texas, where Flatonia is located about halfway between Houston and San Antonio.\n\nSince Tommy Tipton’s Sept. 15, 2017, release from jail and probation he has:\n\n• Sold at least two properties with a combined market value of more than $635,000.\n\n• Continued to own his longtime home with a pool valued at almost $780,000.\n\n• Remained the sole owner of at least five business or investment properties that have a combined market value of $572,950.\n\n• Continued as a joint owner with his still-imprisoned brother in at least two properties and mineral rights on a third valued at $105,420.\n\nSo far, no state has pursued the legal actions outlined in the Tiptons' plea deals that entitle the defrauded lotteries to lay claim to the brothers' property or to property that the Tiptons placed in the names of associates and family members.\n\nWhen the Register contacted Tommy Tipton, he declined to discuss his current work, income or properties. He said in that brief interview that his brother, Eddie, \"ain’t never done anything wrong in his life\" and vowed the two would once again work together.\n\n\"It's hard. I'm a single dad raising three kids on a very limited income with lots of bills, and when Eddie gets home he probably will create something,” Tommy Tipton said. \"He's a smart, intelligent guy. Hopefully, the future will be better and we’ll get all that stuff paid back.\"\n\nIn 2007, Eddie Tipton built a roughly 5,000-square-foot home in Norwalk, Iowa, a Des Moines suburb. That was two years after he embedded fraudulent computer code into random-number generating software that several state lottery games distributed and used.\n\nThe random-number fraud allowed him to accurately predict at least five winning drawings that totaled more than $24 million in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and Wisconsin.\n\nThe multi-year scheme ultimately unraveled in 2010 after a Des Moines convenience store video captured Eddie Tipton purchasing what would become a $16.5 million ticket. Iowa Lottery officials refused to cash that ticket after some of Tipton's associates on multiple occasions tried to redeem the ticket anonymously.\n\nAfter years spent fighting criminal charges, Eddie Tipton pleaded guilty to \"ongoing criminal conduct\" in 2017.\n\nIowa prosecutors were aware of his Norwalk home that contained a movie theater and gym, overlooked a pond and sat on nearly 23 acres. He sold in July 2015 for $590,000.\n\nBut at the time Eddie Tipton sold his home, prosecutors knew only about the Iowa Hot Lotto ticket that state officials had refused to cash. In late 2015, prosecutors learned that he had rigged lottery wins in other states.\n\nAs a result, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller's office in March 2016 attempted to gain access to Eddie Tipton's Norwalk home; office equipment; multiple vehicles; and his checking, savings and futures trading accounts.\n\nEddie Tipton argued in court filings that the lien was unconstitutional because it would interfere with his constitutional right to counsel and result in a deprivation of property without due process. Judge Brad McCall of Polk County District Court in Des Moines agreed and dismissed the state's attempt to place liens against the property.\n\nSome of the money that Eddie Tipton scammed in rigged drawings was acquired a decade before his arrest, records show.\n\nMany banks and financial institutions are not required to maintain records that old, which made it difficult for prosecutors to directly link Eddie Tipton’s assets with the winnings, said Rob Sand, a former lawyer for the Iowa Attorney General's Office who helped prosecute the Tipton cases.\n\n\"Unless we could very specifically and very clearly show that the money he was paying for them (properties) with was stolen money, we couldn’t do anything about it,” said Sand, who in November was elected as Iowa’s state auditor.\n\nIt's \"absurd\" that states and their lotteries have not taken further action to claim restitution from the Tiptons, Judge Ed Janecka of Fayette County, Texas, told the Register.\n\nIn 2015, Janecka successfully urged Tommy Tipton to resign from his elected judicial position because of Tommy Tipton's involvement in the lottery fraud, Janecka said.\n\n\"This is just wrong, and the states need to come back with a vengeance,\" Janecka said.\n\nThe Register contacted the lotteries and attorneys general offices in each state where Tommy Tipton or Eddie Tipton owe restitution.\n\nConversation is ongoing about which state should take the lead on actions that could result in seizing property, said Jay Finks, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Lottery. Some of the games fraudulently won in the scandal were part of multi-state networks.\n\n“It kind of creates a layer of complication we’re trying to navigate,” Finks said.\n\nThe land records the Register obtained should alert states to take further action, Sand said.\n\n\"Our law-enforcement team in Iowa did not work hard for three years to now see other states make a minimum effort to collect,\" Sand said. \"Hopefully, this is a wake-up call.\"\n\nFollow Jason Clayworth and Rachel Denny Clow on Twitter: @JasonClayworth and @CallerClow\n\nWhat the Tipton brothers owe\n\nHere is what Eddie and Tommy Tipton owe and each state’s response.\n\nIn Oklahoma and Colorado, portions of the restitution are considered joint payments that both brothers owe, instead of individually. The amounts listed for those states are total amounts owed.\n\nColorado\n\n• Amount ordered to be repaid: $1,137,980 by Eddie and Tommy Tipton\n\n• State response: The state received slightly less than $400 of the restitution, said Annie Skinner of the Colorado Attorney General’s Office. The office did not respond to questions about why officials haven’t tried to seize the Tiptons’ properties.\n\nIowa\n\n• Amount ordered to be repaid: Eddie Tipton never was able to claim a $16.5 million Hot Lotto prize in Iowa in 2010, even after enlisting a New York lawyer to set up a Belize-based trust to shield his identity.\n\n• State response: In 2016, the Iowa Court of Appeals reversed one of two fraud convictions against him, saying prosecutors brought the charge after a three-year statute of limitations had expired. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 2017 for his crimes in all the states. Eddie Tipton's job as security chief for the Multi-State Lottery Association also barred him from playing the lottery even without the rigging charges.\n\nOklahoma\n\n• Amount ordered to be repaid: $644,478 by Eddie and Tommy Tipton\n\n• State response: Conversation continues about which states should take the lead on actions that could result in seizing property, said Jay Finks, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Lottery.\n\nKansas\n\n• Amount ordered to be repaid: $30,805.60 by Eddie Tipton\n\n• State response: The state has received no payment, said Jennifer Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Attorney General’s Office.\n\nIowa records indicate Eddie Tipton has paid the state $14.89. Montgomery did not respond to questions about why the state hasn’t tried to seize properties.\n\nWisconsin\n\n• Amount ordered to be repaid: $409,600 by Eddie Tipton\n\n• State response: The state has received $198.12, said Patricia Mayers, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Lottery. The state did not respond to interview requests to the lottery and the state’s attorney general about why officials haven't sought further court action.\n\nWhat the Tipton brothers own\n\nAmong Eddie and Tommy Tipton's properties and recent transactions identified in public records:\n\n• Home with a pool. Tommy Tipton owns his longtime home with a pool in Flatonia, Texas, that has a market value of $779,460.\n\nIn May 2013, he and his now ex-wife, Pamela, transferred that property to a trust – a financial tool sometimes used to protect property from creditors – that remains in their names. The transfer occurred 15 months after the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation and the Iowa Attorney General’s Office announced they had launched an investigation into the lottery scam.\n\n• Business or investment properties. Tommy Tipton owns at least five other properties in Fayette County, Texas, with a combined market value of $572,950.\n\nThe most valuable parcel includes 100 acres of native pasture land with a market value of almost $401,000; others include a gas station, a house, a mobile home and a commercial building.\n\n• Home ownership from prison. Eddie Tipton owns a 55-acre parcel with a home near Flatonia, Texas, that has a current market value of $365,380.\n\n• Joint ownership. Tommy and Eddie Tipton jointly own two properties and mineral rights on a third valued at $105,420 in Fayette County, Texas.\n\nThe most valuable property is 13 acres of land appraised at $80,750; the other property includes a mini-storage commercial site.\n\n• Recently sold. Tommy Tipton sold at least two Fayette County, Texas, properties since his release from jail.\n\nIn January he sold 102 acres of pasture, and in March he sold a 5.7-acre vacant residential plot. The market values of the properties are listed as $580,730 and $54,490, respectively.\n\n• Recently purchased. On March 25, 11 days after Tommy Tipton sold the 5.7-acre parcel, a home assessed at $36,240 was deeded to his daughter.\n\nThe mailing address for the property remains the same address as Tommy Tipton's pool home. She did not return requests for an interview.\n\n.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/lottery/2025/09/07/who-won-the-powerball-drawing-on-sept-6-1-8-billion-jackpot/85994348007/", "title": "Who won the Powerball drawing on Sept. 6? $1.8 billion jackpot", "text": "Two lucky players brought an end to a winnerless Powerball streak that lasted 41 draws on Saturday, Sept. 6, landing the second-largest jackpot in United States history.\n\nThe Sept. 6 Powerball jackpot clocked in around an eye-popping $1.8 billion.

(AP) — Testimony began Monday in a Delaware courtroom where a Tesla shareholder is challenging a compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth more than $55 billion.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the performance-based stock option grant was negotiated by a compensation committee and approved in 2018 by Tesla board members who had conflicts of interest due to personal and professional ties to Musk.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in 2018, also alleges that the shareholder vote to approve that compensation was based on an incomplete and misleading proxy statement.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiff alleges that proxy wrongly described members of the compensation committee as \"independent,\" and characterized all the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as \"stretch\" goals meant to be difficult to achieve, even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote.\n\n\"Any action by stockholders based on a materially misleading proxy is a nullity and the grant fails,\" according to a brief by the plaintiff's attorneys.\n\nTesla owners worry: Tesla recalls more than 40,000 vehicles for possible loss of power steering\n\nAttorneys for the defendants countered in their pretrial brief that two institutional proxy advisers noted that the plan would require \"significant and perhaps historic achievements\" and require growth that \"appear stretching by any benchmark.\"\n\nThe first witness to testify was Ira Ehrenpreis, a prominent venture capitalist and longtime friend of Musk who chaired Tesla's compensation committee when the grant was formulated.\n\nAre you in danger? Remove these 5 dangerous tech gadgets from your home\n\nUnder the plan, Musk stood to reap billions if the electric car and solar panel maker hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones.\n\nFor each of incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who already owned about 22% of Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant.\n\nHis interest in the company would grow to about 28% if the company's market capitalization grew by $600 billion.\n\nEach milestone in the plan includes expanding Tesla's market capitalization by $50 billion and meeting an aggressive revenue or pretax profit growth target. Musk stood to receive the full benefit of the pay plan, $55.8 billion, only if Tesla hit a market capitalization of $650 billion and unprecedented revenues and earnings within a decade.\n\nTo date, Tesla has achieved all 12 of the market capitalization milestones and 11 of the operational milestones, resulting in the vesting of 11 of the grant's 12 installments and providing Musk over $52.4B in stock option gains, according to the lawsuit. Since the grant was awarded, Tesla's market capitalization has increased from $59 billion to more than $690 billion, having briefly hit $1 trillion early this year.\n\nShares of Tesla Inc. have been battered this year, like all automakers, due to a mix of backed-up supply chains and soaring inflation. Tesla shares have fallen 46% this year, while shares of Ford and GM have fallen around 31%.\n\nHowever, the Austin, Texas, company earned $5.5 billion in 2021, blowing away the previous year's profit of $721 million. It also produced a record 936,000 vehicles, nearly double what the company rolled off the assembly line in 2020.\n\nEhrenpreis testified that much of Tesla's success has been the result of Musk's leadership, which he said combined bold vision with \"a maniacal focus on execution.\"\n\n\"He has both a bold vision, but he has been as hard working a CEO as there can be,\" Ehrenpreis said.\n\nUnder questioning from defense attorney Evan Chesler, Ehrenpreis described the nearly yearlong process under which he and other directors discussed and developed the compensation plan with the help of legal advisers and independent consultants, as well as input from major institutional investors.\n\nEhrenpreis described the milestones in the plans as \"extraordinarily ambitious and difficult.\"\n\nAccording to minutes from a 2017 meeting of the compensation committee, the directors wanted to properly balance the motivation of \"stretch\" goals for Musk while avoiding \"demotivating factors created by seemingly impractical, unrealistic or unachievable goals.\"\n\nFakes abound: Twitter blue parody accounts flood the platform after new subscription service rollout\n\nEhrenpreis also testified that his friendship with Musk played no role in his vote to approve the plan.\n\n\"I felt that it was very important to ensure Elon's leadership in this next chapter of the company's life,\" he said, adding it was the kind of ambitious plan that drives Musk and would create one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nAlso testifying Monday was Todd Maron, Tesla's former general counsel.\n\nMaron testified that Musk never dictated terms of the plan, but that the process was cooperative and collaborative, \"not a knock-down, drag-out affair.\"\n\n\"There would be times when the board wanted something and Elon didn't,\" he said.\n\nIn his cross-examination of Maron, plaintiff attorney Jeroen van Kwawegen questioned whether the compensation plan was even needed to keep Musk as the helm, noting that there is no evidence he has ever thought about leaving Tesla.\n\n'This is a dicey moment': Amazon, Apple, other tech giants lose billions in value as market wobbles\n\n\"I intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,\" Musk said in analyst call in May 2017, just weeks after work on the new compensation plan began.\n\nPlaintiff's attorneys pointed to an email to Maron in July 2017 in which Musk said he wanted to use proceeds from the new compensation plan to help finance his dream of colonizing Mars.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/business/tesla-elon-musk-pay-trial-final-day", "title": "Elon Musk's $50 billion trial comes to an end today | CNN Business", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nThe trial for the Tesla shareholder lawsuit examining CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented compensation package wrapped up Friday afternoon. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick did not issue a ruling from the bench, and it could be weeks to months before a ruling.\n\n“We have a lot of work ahead of us,” McCormick told both side’s attorneys as the trial concluded. “I won’t insult you with the typical talk I give at this point which is settlement is still achievable.”\n\nTesla awarded Musk a pay package in 2018 that helped make him the richest person on Earth. The net value of the compensation package is $50.9 billion today, after Tesla’s valuation soared more than 1,000% at its peak since shareholders approved the package.\n\nPlaintiff Richard Tornetta originally filed the lawsuit in June 2018, alleging that Musk exploited his control of Tesla and the board of directors to secure the compensation to “fund his personal ambition to colonize Mars.” The Delaware Court of Chancery has heard arguments this week in Wilmington.\n\nTornetta and his lawyers allege that Musk and the board failed to uphold their financial responsibilities to shareholders. Tesla says its board of directors has a legal responsibility for shareholders’ money in addition to overseeing management, which includes Musk.\n\nTornetta argued that the huge pay package wasn’t needed to incentivize Musk as he already owned the largest stake of Tesla.\n\nTestimony was heard this week from a who’s-who of Tesla insiders including Musk, board chair Robyn Denholm, former chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja, former board member Antonio Gracias, and board members Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch.\n\nThe trial Friday included testimony from expert witnesses.\n\nKevin Murphy, a University of Southern California business school professor, testified on behalf of Tesla and the other defendants that the pay package was reasonable. He also said that Tesla’s board members were considered independent under NASDAQ’s standards. The independence of the directors is a central theme of the case.\n\nTornetta’s lawyers have highlighted the friendships between Musk and many of his board members who created the deal. Some have vacationed together in places like magician David Copperfield’s private island in the Bahamas, where Musk summoned his brother Kimbal and Gracias in 2017 to determine if James Murdoch should join Tesla’s board, according to Kimbal’s deposition which played in court this week. Murdoch, who described himself as a friend of Elon Musk’s since 2006, joined them on Copperfield’s Island for part of the trip, and joined the board shortly thereafter.\n\nSeveral corporate governance experts told CNN Business that it’s clear Tesla’s board of directors lacks independence from Musk.\n\n“It’s safe to say that Musk has a lot of power – and probably too much power – over the Tesla board,” George S. Georgiev a professor who studies corporate governance at Emory University school of law, told CNN Business. “The Tesla board has been extremely indulgent despite Musk’s many transgressions over the years, including his skirmishes with the SEC.”\n\nDenholm, chair of Tesla’s board, revealed after extensive questioning in her testimony that she was unaware of the details of how Musk handles an SEC settlement that required him to not tweet about certain topics, such as Tesla’s financial condition and new business lines, unless he obtained pre-approval from an “experienced securities lawyer.”\n\nMusk explained in his deposition that he sends certain tweets for approval, and publishes them if he hasn’t heard back in an unspecified amount of time. That arrangement leaves open the possibility of Musk’s tweets being published without the required review.\n\nDenholm first joined Tesla’s board in 2014 and became its chair in 2018 when Musk agreed to step down from that position following SEC charges. She said in her testimony that she interviewed with Musk before joining the board of directors.\n\nGeorgiev said there’s not a lot of precedent for cases like this one because they are either dismissed or settled.\n\nGeorgiev also said this makes an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court more likely, so the case may stretch on. He pointed to a case the compensation of Michael Ovitz, a briefly-tenured Disney CEO, which stretched on for about a decade.\n\nThe Tesla board members who testified generally spoke of the huge pay package as necessary to keep Musk engaged at Tesla.\n\n“He’s got 100 company ideas in his mind. I promise you he’s only done very few of them,” Gracias testified. “And we wanted him focused. We needed him focused.”\n\nMurphy, Tesla’s expert witness, also pushed back Friday on the idea that Tesla shareholders are subsidizing Musk’s Mars mission.\n\n“I don’t think that’s any more true than USC is subsidizing my vacation. They pay me a reasonable wage for reasonable services,” Murphy said.\n\nHe said he didn’t feel that shareholders have a particular interest in how Musk spends his money.\n\n“The fact that Mr. Musk is potentially incentivized by this money is a good thing for Tesla shareholders,” he said.\n\nMusk is also the CEO of SpaceX and created a tunnel and transit venture, the Boring Company, as well as Neuralink, which is working toward putting computer chips in brains. Musk recently acquired Twitter for $44 billion, and has described himself as its “Chief Twit.”\n\nMusk’s brother Kimbal had a slightly different take in his deposition. At the time of the 2018 compensation package, Kimbal said it was “very unlikely” that Elon would walk away from his role of CEO at Tesla.\n\n“He’s responsible to the shareholders to the company. That’s just not how Elon operates,” Kimbal Musk said.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/21/trump-administration-cabinet-picks-wealthy/76433245007/", "title": "A billionaire presidential administration?

He continued to sell Microsoft stock until he left the company in 2007 and has made several lucrative business deals since, according to Forbes, but his exact net worth today is unlisted.\n\nIn an April appearance on Fox News, Burgum said billionaires should support Trump if they care about their shareholders and family.\n\nHoward Lutnick\n\nTrump named his new commerce secretary, tapping his transition team co-chair and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick for the role.\n\nLutnick's net worth is estimated to exceed $1.5 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is due in large part to his majority ownership of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm.\n\nLinda McMahon\n\nTrump plans to nominate former Small Business Administration head and former wrestling executive Linda McMahon to lead the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nShe shares an estimated $2.5 billion net worth with her husband Vincent McMahon, according to Forbes. Together, they founded World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE.\n\nElon Musk\n\nTrump said he intends to tap tech CEO Elon Musk to co-lead the new \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" or DOGE.\n\nForbes labels Musk the richest person in the world and estimates his net worth at $315.7 billion as of Nov. 21. Musk's constellation of multibillion-dollar businesses include SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, X, xAI, and The Boring Company.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nBiotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will join Musk to help lead DOGE, Trump announced in a statement the week after his victory.\n\nForbes reported Ramaswamy was worth more than $1 billion in early November. Other estimates place his net worth between $800 million and $1 billion. Ramaswamy made his fortune through investments and a stake in Roivant Sciences, a pharmaceutical company he founded in 2014.\n\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/tech/theranos-rise-and-fall", "title": "The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes: A timeline | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nFour years after the top two Theranos executives, Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, were first indicted together on a dozen federal fraud charges stemming from their time heading up the failed blood testing startup, both have been convicted by juries.\n\nHolmes, the founder and former CEO of Theranos, was found guilty on four out of 11 federal fraud and conspiracy charges in January after a months-long trial. Balwani, Theranos’ former president and COO who was also Holmes’ live-in boyfriend at the time, was found guilty on Thursday of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\nTheir trials marked the final chapter for Theranos, a startup once valued at $9 billion and lauded for its promise to upend the healthcare industry. Theranos claimed its technology could accurately and efficiently test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. With that promise, it attracted $945 million in financing, a board of well-known political figures and prominent retail partners.\n\nThen came a Wall Street Journal investigation into the company, which called into question the company’s testing methods and the capabilities of its technology. In 2018, Holmes and Balwani were each charged with a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nTheir trials were separated after Holmes indicated she would pursue a defense that included alleging she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani that impacted every part of her life. (Balwani’s legal team has strongly denied the allegations in court filings.)\n\nHere are the highlights of the rise and fall of Theranos.\n\nMarch 2004: Holmes drops out of Stanford to pursue Theranos\n\nHolmes, a Stanford University sophomore studying chemical engineering, drops out of school to pursue her startup, Theranos, which she founded in 2003 at age 19. The name is a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”\n\nSeptember 2009: Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani joins Theranos\n\nBalwani guarantees a $10 million loan to Theranos and soon after takes on a formal role at the startup. Balwani, roughly 20 years older than Holmes, first met her in 2002 through a program in Beijing to learn Mandarin. Balwani had enjoyed a successful career in the software industry, and following the sale of his e-commerce startup, was pursuing an MBA.\n\nThe two kept in touch and began living together in 2005, Holmes testified during her criminal trial. Their personal relationship was largely concealed from employees, investors and business partners. Balwani would ultimately become the company’s chief operating officer and president of the startup.\n\nSeptember 2013: Holmes opens up about Theranos; announces Walgreens partnership\n\nA decade after first starting the company, Holmes takes the lid off Theranos and courts media attention the same month that Theranos and Walgreens announce they’ve struck up a long-term partnership. The first Theranos Wellness Center location opens in a Walgreens in Palo Alto where consumers can access Theranos’ blood test.\n\nThe original plan had been to make Theranos’ testing available at Walgreens locations nationwide.\n\nSeptember 2014: Holmes named one of the richest women in America by Forbes\n\nHolmes is named to the magazine’s American billionaire list with the outlet reporting she owns a 50% stake in the startup, pinning her personal wealth at $4.5 billion.\n\nElizabeth Holmes speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California. Steve Jennings/Getty Images\n\nDecember 2014: Theranos has raised $400 million\n\nTheranos has raised more than $400 million, according to a profile of the company and Holmes by The New Yorker. It counts Oracle’s Larry Ellison among its investors.\n\nJuly 2015: Theranos gets FDA approval for Herpes test\n\nThe FDA clears Theranos to use of its proprietary tiny blood-collection vials to finger stick blood test for herpes simplex 1 virus – its first and only approval for a diagnostic test.\n\nOctober 2015: Theranos is the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation; Holmes hits back\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Theranos is using its proprietary technique on only a small number of the 240 tests it performs, and that the vast majority of its tests are done with traditional vials of blood drawn from the arm, not the “few drops” taken by a finger prick. In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid the criticism, Theranos reportedly shakes up its board of directors, eliminating Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as directors while moving them to a new board of counselors; the company also forms a separate medical board.\n\nNovember 2015: Theranos and Safeway partnership falls short\n\nSafeway, which invested $350 million into building out clinics in hundreds of its supermarkets to eventually offer Theranos blood tests, reportedly looks to dissolve its relationship with the company before it ever offered its services.\n\nJanuary 2016: Federal regulators take issue with Theranos’ California lab; Walgreens pulls back\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sends Theranos a letter saying its California lab has failed to comply with federal standards and that patients are in “immediate jeopardy.” It gives the company 10 days to address the issues.\n\nIn response, Walgreens says it will not send any lab tests to Theranos’ California lab for analysis and suspends Theranos services at its Palo Alto Walgreens location.\n\nMarch 2016: CMS threatens to ban Holmes, Balwani from lab business\n\nCMS threatens to ban Holmes and Balwani from the laboratory business for two years after the company allegedly failed to fix problems at its California lab. Theranos says that’s a “worst case scenario.”\n\nMay 2016: Balwani steps down; Theranos voids two years of blood tests\n\nBalwani departs. The company also adds three new board members as part of the restructuring: Fabrizio Bonanni, a former executive vice president of biotech firm Amgen, former CDC director William Foege, and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.\n\nTheranos voids two years of blood test results from its proprietary testing devices, correcting tens of thousands of blood-test reports, the Journal reports.\n\nJune 2016: Holmes net worth revised to $0; Theranos loses its largest retail partner\n\nForbes revises its estimate of Holmes’ net worth from $4.5 billion to $0. The magazine also lowers its valuation for the company from $9 billion to $800 million.\n\nWalgreens, once Theranos’ largest retail partner, ends its partnership with the company and says it will close all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers.\n\nJuly 2016: Holmes is banned from running labs for two years\n\nCMS revokes Theranos’ license to operate its California lab and bans Holmes from running a blood-testing lab for two years.\n\nAugust 2016: The company unveils ‘miniLab’ device\n\nHolmes tries to move past recent setbacks by unveiling a mini testing laboratory, called miniLab, at a conference for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. In selling the device, versus operating its own clinics, Theranos seeks to effectively side-step CMS sanctions, which don’t prohibit research and development.\n\nOctober 2016: Theranos investor sues the company; Theranos downsizes\n\nTheranos investor Partner Fund Management sues the company for $96.1 million, the amount it sunk into the company in February 2014, plus damages. It accuses the company of securities fraud. Theranos and Partner Fund Management settled in May, 2017, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe company also lays off 340 employees as it closes clinical labs and wellness centers as it attempts to pivot and focus on the miniLab.\n\nNovember 2016: Walgreens sues Theranos\n\nWalgreens sues the blood testing startup for breach of contract. Walgreens sought to recover the $140 million it poured into the company. The lawsuit was settled August, 2017.\n\nJanuary 2017: More layoffs, followed by a failed lab inspection\n\nTheranos downsizes its workforce yet again following the increased scrutiny into its operations, laying off approximately 155 employees or about 41% of staffers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Theranos failed a second regulatory lab inspection in September, and that the company was closing its last blood testing location as a result.\n\nApril 2017: Theranos settles with CMS, and Arizona AG\n\nTheranos settles with the CMS, agreeing to pay $30,000 and to not to own or operate any clinical labs for two years.\n\nTheranos also settles with the Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich over allegations that its advertisements misrepresented the method, accuracy, and reliability of its blood testing and that the company was out of compliance with federal regulations governing clinical lab testing. Theranos agrees to pay $4.65 million back to its Arizona customers as part of a settlement deal.\n\nMarch 2018: Holmes and Balwani charged with massive fraud\n\nThe SEC charges Holmes and Balwani with a “massive fraud” involving more than $700 million from investors through an “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”\n\nThe SEC alleges Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu.\n\nTheranos and Holmes agree to resolve the claims against them, and Holmes gives up control of the company and much of her stake in it. Balwani, however, is fighting the charges, with his attorney saying he “accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability.”\n\nMay 2018: “Bad Blood”\n\nReporter John Carreyrou, who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Wall Street Journal, publishes “Bad Blood,” a definitive look at what happened inside the disgraced company. Director Adam McKay (who directed “The Big Short”) secures the rights to make the film, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes, by the same name.\n\nJune 2018: Holmes and Balwani indicted on criminal fraud charges\n\nHolmes and Balwani are indicted on federal wire fraud charges over allegedly engaging in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMinutes before the charges were made public, Theranos announced that Holmes has stepped down as CEO. The company’s general counsel, David Taylor, takes over as CEO. Holmes remains chair of the company’s board.\n\nFormer Theranos COO Ramesh \"Sunny' Balwani leaves the Robert F. Peckham U.S. Federal Court on June 28, 2019 in San Jose, California.

Taylor said more than 80 potential buyers were not interested in a sale. “We are now out of time,” Taylor wrote.\n\nMarch 2019: Theranos gets the documentary treatment\n\nAlex Gibney, the prolific documentary filmmaker behind “Dirty Money,” “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,” and “The Armstrong Lie,” debuts “The Inventor” on HBO, following the rise and fall of Theranos.\n\nSeptember 2020: Holmes’ possible defense strategy comes to light\n\nA new court document reveals Holmes may seek a “mental disease” defense in her criminal fraud trial. Later, in August 2021, unsealed court documents reveal Holmes is likely to claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani. (Balwani’s legal team strongly denied the claims in court filings.) The allegations led to the severing of their trials. His trial is slated to begin in 2022.\n\nDecember 2020: Holmes’ criminal trial delayed til 2021\n\nInitially set to begin in July 2020, Holmes’ criminal trial is further delayed til July 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMarch 2021: Holmes’ pregnancy further delays trial\n\nNews surfaces that Holmes’ is expecting her first child, once more further delaying her criminal trial. Holmes’ counsel advised the US government that Holmes is due in July 2021, a court document revealed. She gave birth in July.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder and former chief executive officer of Theranos Inc.

Nina Riggio/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAugust 2021: Holmes’ criminal trial begins with jury selection\n\nMore than 80 potential jurors are brought into a San Jose courtroom for questioning over the course of two days to determine if they are fit to serve as impartial, fair jurors for the criminal trial of Holmes. A jury of seven men and five women is selected, with five alternatives.\n\nJanuary 2022: Holmes found guilty on four of 11 federal charges\n\nHolmes is found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud investors as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors. She is found not guilty on three additional charges concerning defrauding patients and one charge of conspiracy to defraud patients. The jury returns no verdict on three of the charges concerning defrauding investors. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.\n\nHolmes’s sentencing date is set for late September to allow for the completion of Balwani’s trial. In the meantime, Holmes remains free on a $500,000 bond secured by property.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos Inc., left center, departs from federal court with, from left, husband Billy Evans, parents Noel Holmes and Christian Holmes IV in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022.

(Apple (AAPL) did not respond to questions on Cook’s visit at the time.) It also follows a report by Politico that Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy has directly called multiple members of Congress to express opposition to the bill. In a statement, an Amazon (AMZN) spokesperson told CNN that Jassy “meets with policymakers on both sides of the aisle regarding policy issues that could affect our customers.”\n\nPichai is expected to meet with both Republicans and Democrats, one of the people said, and in addition to antitrust issues, the meetings may also cover a recent bipartisan push to develop digital privacy legislation. Pichai could also face questioning from Republican lawmakers who believe Google discriminates against conservatives, the people said.\n\n“We regularly engage with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on a range of issues including economic growth, small business support, immigration reform and cybersecurity,” said Jose Castañeda, a Google spokesperson. “We’ll continue to engage on issues relevant to people and businesses using our products.”\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai is expected to travel to Washington next week to meet with US lawmakers, according to two people familiar with the plans. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nThe CEOs’ hands-on engagement highlights the stakes of the next few months for the tech industry in Washington.\n\nCongress is considering multiple antitrust bills, beginning with legislation led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Grassley that could erect strict barriers between a tech giant’s various lines of business. The proposal represents a direct challenge to Big Tech’s business models that encourage consumers to use multiple interlocking services owned by the same company.\n\nUnder the bill, for example, Google could be prevented from ranking its own restaurant reviews or YouTube links above other sites in search results, and Amazon could be prevented from selling its own branded goods on the e-commerce marketplace it currently shares with third-party sellers.\n\nThe tech industry has said the bill would threaten many features and services that consumers have come to depend on and that make their lives easier.\n\nBackers of the bill — the American Innovation and Choice Online Act — have pushed for a Senate floor vote within the next few weeks, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is said to be open to bringing the bill to the floor provided it has sufficient support.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the tech industry and its allies have sought to peel support away from the bill with a lobbying effort. In the first quarter of 2022, Apple spent $2.5 million on lobbying, a quarterly record for the company. Over the same period, Google spent $3.5 million, Amazon $5.3 million and Meta $5.4 million. Industry groups have spent millions on ads opposing the antitrust legislation.\n\nHeightening the sense of urgency is the fact that Congress is running out of time to act this year. Surging consumer prices, the continuing war in Ukraine and the Jan. 6 hearings have dominated the congressional agenda. Once lawmakers break for August recess, few expect much progress in the fall, when the midterm elections are expected to take precedence. And a potential Republican takeover of Congress could also reshape the legislative landscape for Big Tech.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2021/02/09/austin-tax-breaks-sought-samsung-among-biggest-ever/4429296001/", "title": "Austin tax breaks sought by Samsung among biggest ever"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/11/nvidia-huang-survive-trump-semiconductor-tariffs/84536536007/", "title": "NVIDIA, the first $4 trillion company, isn't afraid of Trump tariffs", "text": "NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said President Trump was jubilant over the company's record $4 trillion valuation.\n\nHuang has met with Trump five times since the president took office in late January.\n\n\"I believe President Trump's vision, his bold vision to manufacture in the United States,” Huang told USA TODAY.\n\nNVIDIA's business is vulnerable to a planned Trump tariff on semiconductors imported from Taiwan.\n\nWASHINGTON − U.S. tech companies will survive President Donald Trump's tariffs, just like they have survived previous disruptions to the market, Jensen Huang, CEO of the world’s most valuable corporation, said in an interview, stressing the importance of ramping up American production of computer chips.\n\n\"Nobody likes disruptions and no one likes abrupt changes, but these settlements will − President Trump will settle these deals and countries will reorganize and resettle, and we'll work through it,” Huang told USA TODAY.\n\nHuang leads advanced chip-maker NVIDIA, which this week became the first company to reach a stock market value of $4 trillion, making it worth more than better-known tech rivals like Apple and Microsoft. He met with Trump at the White House on July 10 where, he said, the president was jubilant over NVIDIA’s milestone.\n\nAs Trump negotiates with China and other top trading partners, Huang’s business sits dead center at the intersection of potentially costly United States tariffs, a boom in artificial intelligence – and the computer chips that power it.\n\nThe California-based company makes advanced chips, which are then mass-produced by companies like the Taiwan-based TSMC that would be heavily affected by a possible Trump tariff on semiconductor imports.\n\nBut Huang showed no signs of panic. Tariffs, taxes and all kinds of rules and regulations were in place long before he founded NVIDIA, said Huang. And if Trump moves ahead with steep semiconductor tariffs, it will be no different.\n\n\"Every single year there were rules and taxes and tariffs and policies and regulations, and we survived,\" Huang said. \"I have every confidence that the world is going to survive this, companies will survive this and whatever it turns out to be, we'll make the best of it.\"\n\nNVIDIA became the first publicly-traded company to reach a $4 trillion market value this week. It has gained 22% in value this year alone during an artificial intelligence boom. Huang's own net worth, which Forbes estimates to be $143.6 billion, makes him one of the richest men in the world.\n\nHuang’s July 10 meeting with Trump was his fifth in almost as many months, and he sat down with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent the next day.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY on July 11, Huang said he \"absolutely\" believes America needs to produce more semiconductors.\n\n\"Absolutely. I believe President Trump's vision, his bold vision to manufacture in the United States, it's great for our industries, it's great for our society,\" he said.\n\nHuang, who was born in Taiwan and educated in the U.S., said that while manufacturing has economic and national security benefits − it also has health and social benefits.\n\n\"We've lost a lot of manufacturing capability and skills, which is really great for skilled craft and people that work with their hands and build things. We want to celebrate that. We want to bring that back to the United States. It's very important to national security, industrial security, supply chain resilience,\" he said.\n\nTrump referenced NVIDIA's record stock price on social media in a July 10 post promoting his tariffs ahead of his meeting with Huang.\n\nHuang told USA TODAY that Trump said in their meeting that he was proud of the valuation.\n\n\"He spent a lot of time congratulating me and telling everybody all around him what a great achievement it was,\" Huang said.\n\nThey also discussed ways to help American tech companies maintain their competitive edge in the transition to AI and ways to bring skilled manufacturing back to America.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/11/06/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-may-sell-10-company-stock-due-twitter-poll/6321598001/", "title": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk may sell 10% of company stock due to Twitter ...", "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is asking people on Twitter whether he should sell 10% of his shares in the electric-powered vehicle company's stock.\n\nThe eccentric billionaire is apparently responding to a Democratic plan for a possible billionaires' tax, which would be levied on about 700 of the richest Americans including Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe plan, introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would have billionaires pay taxes based on the unrealized gains from their assets such as stock, which they hold and can borrow against rather than cashing them in. But that proposal is apparently not going forward after opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., The New York Times reported.\n\n►'This deception must end now': Facebook gets letter from 500 health professionals demanding data on COVID misinformation\n\nThat proposal was just the latest in an ongoing debate about how the wealthy can avoid federal taxes. Musk, who doesn't take a salary but has a real-time net worth of more than $318 billion, according to Forbes, is now the richest person in history. He owns more than 190 million Tesla shares valued at just more than $250 billion, so if he sells 10% that would be more than $25 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe resulting tax bill would be at least 20% of the sale, but Musk has said some of his stock options would be taxed at an even higher rate, Forbes reported. Bloomberg estimated his potential stock sale at $21 billion.\n\nSo far, about 54% of the 1 million-plus who have voted in Musk's Twitter poll say he should sell the shares. Musk said he will abide by the result of the poll, which will end Sunday afternoon, \"whichever way it goes,\" in another tweet.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk responded to a tweet from noted researcher Dr. David Eli who said 2% of Musk's wealth ($6 billion) nearly matches that raised by the UN World Food Programme (WFP): $8.4 billion.

Key observations", "text": "Heading into Thursday’s draw for the French Open, there was only one huge storyline: Where would Iga Swiatek, the women’s champion four of the last five years, end up?\n\nDue to a recent dip in form, Swiatek shockingly fell to the No. 5 seed, meaning one of the top four seeds would have to face the most accomplished clay courter of their generation in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe loser of that random drawing? Jasmine Paolini, who lost to Swiatek in last year’s final and comes to Roland Garros in top form, having just won the Italian Open in her home country.\n\nThe big winner? Coco Gauff.\n\nGauff, the No. 2 seeded American still seeking a second Grand Slam title after winning the 2023 US Open, will begin this year’s French as a pretty solid favorite to make the final given how the draw shook out.\n\nNot only would Gauff dodge Swiatek until at least the final, pretty much all of the other prime contenders for the title ended up in the top half of the draw with No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nGauff, who recently lost in the finals of Rome (to Paolini) and Madrid (to Sabalenka), even avoided tricky opponents in the early rounds – at least on paper. Her potential third-round opponent, No. 30 Anna Kalinskaya, has never advanced beyond the second round in Paris. In the fourth round, she would be projected to face former Roland Garros winner Barbora Krejcikova, who is coming off a back injury and hasn’t played an official match this year.\n\nIn the quarterfinals, Gauff would potentially play No. 7 Madison Keys, who started the year hot with the Australian Open title but has cooled down considerably over the last couple months. And Gauff’s most likely semifinal opponents would be No. 6 Mirra Andreeva, whom she’s beaten twice in routine fashion on clay recently, or No. 3 seeded American Jessica Pegula, who is much more comfortable on hard court than the French surface.\n\nMeanwhile, if Sabalenka is going to make the final, she must deal with several stumbling blocks including potentially a quarterfinal against Zheng Qinwen, who won the Olympics last year at Roland Garros, and whoever emerges from the Paolini/Swiatek quarter. Of course, Swiatek may not even get there because she is potentially lined up for a round of 16 match with Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French champion, whom she has never beaten in six matches.\n\nHere are the four other key observations from the French Open draw.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/tennis/serena-williams-anett-kontaveit-us-open-spt-intl", "title": "'Just Serena': Williams' upset win at US Open keeps the legend ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter it was all over — after she’d won a thrilling second-round match, then did one of those iconic Serena twirls on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court before beaming as a tribute video from Oprah Winfrey played yet again – Serena Williams was asked if she was surprised at her level of play.\n\nA 40-year-old underdog in the final days of her storied career, Williams had just upset the world’s second-ranked player, a US Open outcome that seemed doubtful until it became inevitable.\n\nSo … Serena, were you surprised?\n\nWilliams chuckled as cheers washed over the court.\n\n“I mean, I’m just Serena,” she said.\n\nWilliams, playing what could be the last tournament of her career, won Wednesday evening, downing Anett Kontaveit 7-6 (4) 2-6 6-2 in New York.\n\nWilliams looked better than in previous matches this year, where she was still trying to shake the rust of a long layoff.\n\nIn Kontaveit, however, Williams faced a much sterner test and was undoubtedly the underdog on paper.\n\n“After I lost the second set, I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, I got to give my best effort because this could be it,’” Williams told ESPN in an on-court, post-match interview.\n\nA boisterous but behaved crowd cheered her every point.\n\nSerena Williams acknowledges the crowd after losing in the third round of the US Open on Friday, September 2.

I don’t have anything to win. And I have absolutely nothing to lose,” she said.\n\nWilliams will next face Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic in the third round. Tomljanovic, who was playing at the same time as Williams on Wednesday, defeated Russian Evgeniya Rodina 1-6, 6-2, 7-5.\n\nAnd Williams is not playing just singles; she will open doubles play with her sister Venus Williams on Thursday night.\n\n“I need more matches,” she told ESPN. “I love rising to the challenge. Yeah, I haven’t played many matches, but I’ve been practicing really well. In my last few matches, it just wasn’t coming together. I’m like, ‘This isn’t me.’”\n\nThings have changed since she started playing at the Open, she said.\n\nShe began singles play Monday with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Danka Kovinić of Montenegro. It was Williams’ third match since announcing in Vogue magazine she will “evolve away from tennis” after the US Open.\n\n“I have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people,” Williams said in the Vogue article published earlier this month.\n\n“Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me,” she said.\n\nAt her post-match news conference Monday, Williams was asked if this is definitely her last tournament.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve been pretty vague about it, right?” she said with a smile. “I’m going to stay vague because you never know.”\n\nThe opening-round win over Kovinić was the best Williams had looked since making her comeback from injury. She has managed to win just one match since returning to the circuit in June and was unable to get close to the form that helped her win her last grand slam title in 2017.\n\nBut Kontaveit, who had said she was excited to play against Williams, encountered a player who showed no signs of wanting to hasten her retirement.\n\n“I think she played really well,” said the Estonian during the post-match news conference. “I mean, I thought I didn’t play a bad match at all.”\n\nAfter the players split the first two sets, Williams stepped up her play for the decider, Kontaveit said.\n\n“She really switched it on from there,” she said. “There’s a few points here and there where I feel like I could have done better on my serve maybe. I mean, she was returning better. She was playing the rallies better. I felt like she did everything a little bit better in the third set.”\n\nThe passionate pro-Williams crowd was also a challenge, Kontveit added.\n\n“I mean, I think they were not rooting like against me. They just wanted Serena to win so bad,” she said. “So, I mean, I don’t think it’s a personal attack against me or anything. I mean, it’s fair. I mean, she deserves this, yeah.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See how Serena Williams became one of the all-time greats 03:06 - Source: CNN See how Serena Williams became one of the all-time greats 03:06\n\nWilliams burst on the scene by winning her first US Open in 1999\n\nOne of the greatest tennis players ever, Williams has won 23 grand slam singles titles and has won the US Open six times, most recently in 2014.

However, the Slam-less streak continues, with Roddick’s 2003 US Open victory remaining the last time an American hoisted one of tennis’ four major trophies.\n\nSinner, who broke through for his first Grand Slam title at the beginning of this year in Australia, left no doubt in this one. Sinner, a 23-year old Italian, lost just two sets in the entire tournament and was never in danger against Fritz in the final.\n\nThis was Sinner’s 16th ATP title overall and sixth this year including two Masters 1000-level tournaments in Miami and Cincinnati. He now has a massive lead over No. 2 Alexander Zverev in both the 52-week ranking and the season-long points race that will likely keep him at No. 1 well into next year at minimum.\n\nHowever, Sinner is still behind Carlos Alcaraz four to two in the head-to-head rivalry for Grand Slam titles that promises to define the rest of this decade in men's tennis.\n\nFritz, who had never been beyond a major quarterfinal before this tournament, will leave New York ranked No. 7.\n\nThat alone makes this a successful and satisfying tournament for Fritz, even though he was unable to make the final as competitive as he would have liked.\n\nIn the first set, Fritz made just 38% of his first serves and paid the price by being broken three times. Fritz served much better in the second set and cruised through a series of easy holds until he stepped to the line at 4-5 when Sinner upped the ante with power and consistency from the baseline to win the set with a commanding break of serve.\n\nFritz’s only real opening came in the third set when scrapped out a break to take the lead, but he couldn’t hold at 5-4 to force a fourth set.\n\nSinner entered the US Open surrounded by controversy when the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced that he had been cleared of wrongdoing during an investigation into two positive tests for a banned substance that occurred in March.\n\nThough Sinner had been subject to a provisional suspension that was never made public, he was allowed to keep playing during his appeal, drawing criticism from some current and former players about whether there was a double standard at play in how positive tests are adjudicated.\n\nSinner, however, was allowed to keep playing because he and his team were able to quickly come up with an explanation for the positive test: His physical trainer had used an over-the-counter spray to treat a finger wound that contains the steroid clostebol and then worked on Sinner's body with his bare hands.\n\nSinner was stripped of his points and prize money from a semifinal appearance at Indian Wells where the positive test took place, but the ITIA essentially accepted the evidence from Sinner’s team and determined that he was at no fault or negligence for the traces of clostebol in his system.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/01/26/jannik-sinner-vs-alexander-zverev-australian-open/77955253007/", "title": "Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev to win Australian Open title", "text": "Nobody in men's tennis has an answer for Jannik Sinner at the moment.\n\nThe 23-year old Italian cruised to his second straight Australian Open title on Sunday and third major overall, beating world No. 2 Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 in a disappointingly one-sided final.\n\nSinner, who went 73-6 last year with eight ATP trophies, picked up right where he left off in Australia and dropped just two sets en route to the title.\n\nThough Sunday’s final had the veneer of competitiveness at times, the reality is that Sinner does everything better than Zverev on a tennis court except serve – and even there, it’s a pretty even battle these days.\n\nBut that’s not just a Zverev issue. Sinner has spent the past year picking apart the top players one by one with his arsenal of ground strokes, which match supreme power with Novak Djokovic-like consistency, and elite movement around the court.\n\nAt the moment, Sinner doesn't really have a weakness for opponents to exploit. They kind of have to hope he has a bad day – and he wasn’t in that mood over the past two weeks in Australia.\n\nHow it happened\n\nThere really wasn't much drama in this one, nor were there a lot of spellbinding rallies. It was mostly meat-and-potatoes baseline tennis, and it generally didn't go well for Zverev on the handful of occasions he tried to force the issue by coming to net.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Sinner’s bigger, penetrating ball put him in position to control the forehand-to-forehand exchanges. But Zverev’s backhand, which is typically his best shot, also let him down too many times with 11 unforced errors in the second set when he needed to make his push.\n\nDespite earning no break point chances in the entire match, Zverev perhaps had an opportunity in the tiebreaker to even things up and test Sinner's fitness and nerve over a marathon match. But serving at 4-4 in the tiebreak, Zverev suffered a stroke of bad luck: Sinner’s inside-out forehand from the middle of the court clipped the top of the tape and dropped dead over the net, giving Zverev no chance to hit the ball. Sinner won his next two service points to close out the set and take command of the match.\n\nZverev’s energy dropped precipitously in the third set, and he was broken at 2-3 to essentially concede the title. It's unclear whether that was resignation or the effect of his type-1 diabetes, which he has had to manage throughout his career. Zverev was seen twice during changeovers injecting himself with medicine to regulate his blood sugar. Zverev also seemed to be upset at various points in the match with the tension in his racket strings.\n\nSinner finished the match with a plus-5 winner-to-error ratio, while Zverev was minus-20.\n\nWhat it means\n\nWith Sinner rolling like this, it seems at the moment that only Carlos Alcaraz can consistently push him head-to-head. Their rivalry stands at 6-4 in favor of Alcaraz, and Alcaraz has four Grand Slam titles to Sinner's three.\n\nHowever, there’s been a huge gulf between them over the last year when it comes to consistency over the course of the season. Alcaraz, who lost to Djokovic in the quarterfinals of this tournament, took several bad early-round losses over the last year while Sinner only lost to highly-ranked players (including three times to Alcaraz).\n\nTheir race for Grand Slam titles will be fascinating to watch over the coming years – but also alarming for the players in their late 20s like Zverev who have seen their generation underperform on the biggest stages.\n\nZverev, who has 23 ATP titles, is arguably the best player in the history of men's tennis without a major. This was his third loss in a final, and it’s unclear where he goes from here. Zverev had complete control of the 2020 U.S. Open final against Dominic Thiem before falling apart and losing in a fifth-set tiebreaker, and last year he was ahead two sets to one on Alcaraz at Roland Garros before losing.\n\nThis match won't leave Zverev with what-ifs, but where does he go from here knowing that the young guys are only getting better? The scar tissue seems to be accumulating.\n\nSinner, meanwhile, will have his biggest upcoming battle with WADA – the World Anti-Doping Agency. A little less than a year ago, he tested positive for traces of a steroid but was allowed to continue competing by the International Tennis Integrity Agency as an investigation took place.\n\nSinner and his team attributed the positive test to an over-the-counter spray available in Italy that contains the banned substance clostebol, which Sinner’s trainer had used to treat a cut on his hand. Sinner successfully argued to the ITIA that the substance entered his system by the trainer’s hand contact with lesions on his skin.\n\nWADA, however, has pushed for Sinner to receive at least a one-year ban as punishment. Sinner now faces an April hearing in front of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. That leaves open the possibility Sinner could miss Grand Slams this summer.\n\n(This story was updated to add a video.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/msu/2022/09/14/michigan-state-msu-tennis-us-open-juniors-doubles-ozan-baris-spartans-harry-jadun/69494736007/", "title": "Michigan State tennis freshman Ozan Baris says US Open title 'just ...", "text": "EAST LANSING – In the hours after Ozan Baris tasted victory in the U.S. Open junior boys doubles final Saturday, he posed for countless pictures with his championship trophy. Carried it everywhere — as one does after winning such a prestigious event. But Baris, adrenaline still pulsing through him, might have been too eager.\n\nSetting down the trophy, he didn't secure it well enough. The next thing he knew, he heard a cracking sound. The top of the vase-shaped trophy tumbled off its base.\n\nThough he's tried to glue it back together, his hope is that the United States Tennis Association, which ran the event, can ship him a replacement in the near future.\n\n\"You live and learn,\" he said.\n\nIt was one of the few mistakes Baris, an Okemos native and Michigan State freshman, made during his time in New York City. Along with doubles partner Nishesh Basavareddy, the pair dominated the championship match of the Grand Slam event, dispatching Dylan Dietrich and Juan Carlos Prado Angelo, 6-1, 6-1, in just 41 minutes.\n\nBaris was less focused on the score and more on the the victory, though.\n\n\"You always want to win the match 6-0, 6-0 right? \" he said. \"That's as best as you can do. You want to win every point, but I'm not really picky. I mean, you can win matches 7-6 in the third every time and you're still going to be the champion if you win it.\"\n\nBaris and Basavareddy dropped just one set over the course of five matches. They lost the opening set of their second-round match, 7-5, to Great Britain's Patrick Brady and William Jansen. Baris and Basavareddy then ripped off eight consecutive sets en route to the championship. The pair entered the tournament seeded eighth, but they upended higher-ranked teams along the way, including the third-seeded tandem of Martin Landaluce and Pedro Rodenas in the quarterfinals, then the second-seeded pair of Gonzalo Bueno and Ignacio Buse in the semis — winning the first set of that match 6-0.\n\nMORE: Michigan State men's tennis never has been a national power. So how did it land one of the country's best recruiting classes?\n\nRELATED: Michigan State hires East Lansing High, Spartan alum Harry Jadun as new tennis coach\n\nMOVING ON: Longtime Michigan State men's tennis coach Gene Orlando announces retirement after 31 seasons\n\n\"They're great players, (Baris) and his partner,\" said Michigan State tennis coach Harry Jadun, who was in the Big Apple with his star freshman early in the week until returning to East Lansing on Sept. 7. \"They played really well together and got really hot and they finished a long week in New York City really, really strong.\"\n\nSo strong, it's hard to believe Baris and Basavareddy hadn't played together before. The two had played against each other in singles, but this time, Basavareddy wanted to team up — which Baris happily agreed to, noting his partner routinely \"crushed me\" in singles play at junior tournaments. Baris estimated he only beat Basavareddy once in head-to-head meetings.\n\nHe's just thankful Basavareddy reached out about doubles at the Open, since Baris admitted he doesn't give as much thought to potential partners as he probably should.\n\n\"I was just focused on the singles, to be honest,\" he said. \"But then when he reached out, I was like, 'It's gonna be a good team.' \"\n\nIt ended up being the best.\n\nBaris acknowledged part of the reason for his success in doubles was frustration with his singles performance: He bowed out in the second round.\n\n\"I was thinking, 'Wow, that was just my last junior singles point,' because I'm not playing any more junior tournaments,\" Baris said. \"So I was like, 'Man, I want to end on a winning point, not losing a point.' So I kind of had that mentality for doubles, and we were able to win the whole thing, which was a nice way to go out.\"\n\nNow, he's shifted his attention to Michigan State. He'll make his college debut Friday, as he travels to Lexington, Kentucky, to compete in the Wildcat Invite. It's the next chapter for a career that holds great promise. Moving from the junior ranks to college was one recent change.\n\nAnother was his name.\n\nHe formerly went by Ozan Colak. Now, he goes by Ozan Baris — the latter being his middle name.\n\n\"I felt that my old name didn't resonate with me as well,\" he said, \"and wanted to create a new legacy.\"\n\nHe arrived back in East Lansing at 3:45 a.m. Monday with a sterling piece of his still-burgeoning resume in tow: his U.S. Open title. By Sunday morning, he said what he had accomplished the day before finally had begun to sink in.\n\nFor Jadun, in his first year as coach of MSU's program, it's still hard to wrap his mind around.\n\n\"I've never coached somebody at that level before,\" he said. \"It's fun. It's a different challenge. But when you're looking up at other teams and other players, you're always thinking that somebody has some type of recipe or some secret formula. But at the end of the day, you work harder than someone, you compete harder in the moment than someone, you're going to get victories. I think that's what Ozan does really well.\"\n\nBaris' Open triumph also could pay dividends on the recruiting trail for Jadun. For a program that never has been a powerhouse, Baris' Grand Slam success could make high-profile prospects give the Spartans a second look — the caliber of players who wouldn't have considered MSU in the past.\n\n\"You definitely can use this momentum,\" Jadun said. \"It makes the job a little bit easier in terms of getting people on a call. … It's invaluable, and we're lucky enough to have him, because there are not many other coaches who can talk to recruits and say, 'Hey, we have a US Open champion on our team.' \"\n\nYet for all of Baris' immense talent, Jadun said that's not even his best attribute.\n\n\"He's a great kid, first and foremost,\" Jadun said. \"He's always the last person to leave our kids clinics that we do with the community, just reaching out, whether it's (former) Coach (Gene) Orlando's wheelchair tennis program, or whatever it is, he's always involved with that stuff. So he understands the value of his platform and how he can impact others.\"\n\nAnd he has confidence to burn as he goes forward. Asked if the Open championship only would boost his self-belief, Baris said it merely was \"a pat on the back.\" He's eager to win more. To set his sights higher.\n\nHe said he won't stop until he gets there.\n\n\"It's great to have (the U.S. Open victory) under my belt, but I'm not really focused on the win at all,\" Baris said. \"I just want to keep working and keep going, because for me, this is just motivation. This isn't the end goal at all. This isn't where I stop. This is just the beginning.\"\n\nContact Ryan Black at rblack@lsj.com.

Sinner returned the favor in the second, giving Alcaraz his first loss in a set during his incredible US Open run, with an efficient service game as Alcaraz scrambled, with most of his returns hitting the net.\n\nAlcaraz, the 2022 US Open champion, then put his foot on the gas in a brilliant third set, winning the first five games and sealing the set with a beautiful forehand volley winner, which led to a standing ovation from the more than 24,000 people in attendance at the closed-roof Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nSinner, who had his 27-match Grand Slam hard court winning streak broken, also relinquished his 65-week hold as the world’s top player, as Alcaraz's third championship point chance, an ace, was true, sending him to a celebration where he imitated a golf swing, an ode to his friend, fellow Spaniard golfer Sergio Garcia.\n\nAt 22 years and 125 days old, Alcaraz is the second-youngest man in the Open Era to win six Grand Slam titles, denying Sinner the chance to become the first repeat men's champion at Flushing Meadows since Roger Federer won five championships from 2004-08.\n\nFourth set living up to the billing\n\nNeither player is giving an inch, each taking their service games and holding through the first four games. The first player who breaks might win the set, and if it's Alcaraz, he could be on his way to the championship.\n\nAlcaraz wins third set, one set from the title\n\nAlcaraz dominated the third set, winning 6-1, as Sinner needs to do some quick course correction if he wants to stay in the match. Sinner had one winner during the entire set.\n\nAlcaraz comes alive again, opens up lead\n\nJust like in the first set, Alcaraz takes the first two games and puts major pressure on Sinner, with a brilliant third game coming back from 0-30 to take the game, ending it with a beautiful forehand volley winner.\n\nSinner takes second set\n\nThe best two out of three is on tap as Sinner gets back into the match with a 6-3 second set win. Alcaraz dropped his first set in the tournament, as his service game, which had been dominant through his previous six matches, was nowhere to be found.\n\nSinner in control; poised to even match\n\nThe No. 1 player in the world has shown it during the second set, taking apart Alcaraz's serve with ease, and using his own powerful forehand to collect winners. Sinner is up 4-1, with both men starting to pile up the errors as well.\n\nSinner up early in the second set\n\nSinner is playing much better than the disaster of a first set he had. His service game has seemed to corrected itself. Could be a much different result and a closer game in this set, and they only have nine unforced errors between the two of them in the first hour of play.\n\nAlcaraz wins first set 6-2\n\nSinner lost a set for the third time all tournament as he was broken in the seventh game, and Alcaraz blitzed through his service game, winning the set in an efficient 38 minutes, and is two sets away from the championship.\n\nSinner fights back\n\nThe players have alternated holding their serves, and Sinner is back within striking range. Whatever issues he had with slipping earlier seem to be gone.\n\nAlcaraz takes early advantage\n\nSome high-level tennis is being played as expected, as Alcaraz converted his second break opportunity to get on the board first during the eight-minute game. Alcaraz held his serve and is up two games early, and Sinner is having difficulty with his footing as he has slipped several times.\n\nCelebrities attending\n\nMusicians Bruce Springsteen, Pink, and Shaggy are among those in attendance at the men's final, as well as Shonda Rhimes, Spike Lee, Michael J.

Despite playing scratchy tennis for much of the first set, Gauff managed to take it from Maria and then play more freely after that for a 6-4, 6-0 victory.\n\nBut things get a lot tougher starting now. In the third round, the third-ranked Gauff will face No. 27 seed Elina Svitolina, who has made a US Open semifinal and quarterfinal in her last three appearances here. Svitolina may not be quite as consistent these days as she was when she finished in the top five every year from 2017 to 2021, but her top level – and her ability to thrive in long rallies – has the potential to frustrate Gauff.\n\nThe two have only played twice, but their meeting in January ended with Gauff taking a 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 victory in a 2-hour, 23-minute Auckland final.\n\nHere’s everything else you missed from Day 3 at the US Open:\n\nMatch of the day\n\nAndrey Rublev, who often overheats emotionally, was calm this time. It was his body temperature that was the problem.\n\nOn the most brutal day of the US Open, with temperatures reaching 90 degrees, Rublev had tried everything from ice packs and cold air hoses to stay cool. By the time he was on the verge of winning the match – having fought from two sets down – he needed to see medical personnel and was complaining of stomach problems.\n\nBut after 4 hours, 6 minutes, Rublev had prevailed 4-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 over France’s Arthur Rinderknech, who seemingly spent all the energy he had trying to win the first two sets.\n\nRublev, the No. 6 seed, has made 10 Grand Slam quarterfinals – including four at the US Open – but never managed to reach a semifinal.\n\nUpset of the day\n\nThere’s no real pattern to Barbora Krejcikova’s results. She won the French Open in 2021 but lost in the first round the next three times she played it. She had never accomplished much at Wimbledon as a singles player before winning it out of nowhere this year. And though she’s been consistently good at the Australian Open on a hard court, her US Open record is poor.\n\nKrejcikova’s boom-or-bust year continued with a second-round loss to No. 122-ranked Elena-Gabriela Ruse of Romania, 6-4, 7-5. Though she came into the tournament carrying a thigh injury and hadn’t played since the French Open, Krejcikova was still expected to get through this match. But perhaps all the obligations she’s had since winning Wimbledon, something she talked about before the US Open, finally took their toll.\n\nNon-upset upset of the day\n\nPeyton Stearns, the 22-year-old former NCAA champion at Texas, feels like the kind of player who should and will be seeded at the Grand Slams but hasn’t made it there quite yet. Ranked No. 47 coming into the tournament, no seed wanted Stearns in their part of the draw and with good reason.\n\nDaria Kasatkina, the No. 12 seed, found out why as Stearns rolled to a 6-1, 7-6 win.\n\nSeven months ago, Kasatkina managed to eke out a three-set win over Stearns in the first round of the Australian Open. But since then, Stearns has started to find her footing on the WTA Tour, won a 250-level title in Morocco in May and recently made the quarterfinals of the WTA 1000 in Canada. She’ll face recent Olympic silver medalist Donna Vekic in the third round.\n\nBig American clash set\n\nWith their respective victories Wednesday, Ben Shelton and Frances Tiafoe advanced to face each other Friday in the third round. Shelton, the No. 13 seed, beat Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets, while 20th-seeded Tiafoe was dominating Alexander Shevchenko 6-4, 6-1, 1-0 when his opponent retired.\n\nThe two Americans played in last year’s US Open quarterfinals, with Shelton pulling the upset 6-2, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2.\n\n“I’m excited,” Shelton said. “These are the type of matches I love; that I live for. To do it a little bit earlier in this draw, it still feels the same. It feels like a huge match and one that I’m really excited for. I know that the people love him here, probably more than me. He’s electric here, and his crowds are electric here. We’re good friends, and it’ll be a battle. It’ll be a war like the last two times we’ve played, but I’m more than excited to be out there with him again.”\n\nLast year, Tiafoe was feeling the pressure of trying to repeat his semifinal run in 2022 and came out flat against Shelton. This year, the roles are reversed: Shelton is a year removed from his semifinal star turn in New York and will be considered the favorite. But Tiafoe, after playing below his standards for much of the year, has started to show signs of life in the past several weeks, starting with his close five-set loss to Carlos Alcaraz in the third round at Wimbledon.\n\n\"It's not easy waiting for this tournament all year,” Tiafoe said before the US Open began. “I'm so amped up. It's circled on the calendar every year. I love these two weeks and I love playing tennis after Wimbledon in the States. There's no better time for me.”\n\nServing up a statement\n\nWhen you talk about the best servers in men’s tennis, American Brandon Nakashima’s name doesn’t come up too often. But the statistics say that Nakashima’s serving, at least this season, is elite.\n\nAs Gill Gross of Tennis Channel pointed out on social media, Nakashima is ranked No. 8 among the top 50 players in how often he’s held serve this year. And though his serve isn’t necessarily the hardest, he’s been able to combine good placement with the ability to finish points on the next shot after the return.\n\nThat trend has held up through two matches in New York. In Tuesday’s 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Arthur Cazaux, Nakashima only faced two break points. He saved all six break points in his dominant first-round win over Holger Rune. For the tournament, Nakashima is making 67% of his first serves and has 23 aces.\n\nNakashima will face No. 18 seed Lorenzo Musetti in the third round, an opponent who has been in great form lately reaching the Wimbledon semifinals and winning bronze at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThursday's top matches", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2024/09/06/sinner-draper-us-open-semifinals/75107544007/", "title": "US Open: Jannik Sinner beats ill Jack Draper, seeks second major title", "text": "World No. 1 Jannik Sinner will have a chance to sweep the hard court majors in 2024.\n\nThe 23-year-old Italian, who broke through at this year's Australian Open for his first Grand Slam title, advanced to Sunday’s U.S. Open final with a 7-5, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 victory over No. 25 Jack Draper in Friday’s semifinals. Sinner will meet American Taylor Fritz for the title.\n\nOn a strange afternoon at Arthur Ashe Stadium where Sinner didn’t play his best and Draper struggled with the New York humidity — constantly having to wipe sweat puddles off the court and vomiting twice during the match — each of the first two sets were up for grabs toward the end.\n\nAnd it was Sinner using his big match experience to play solid under pressure while Draper struggled to execute when he had chances to grab the lead.\n\nSinner, however, wasn’t without issues. Toward the end of the second set he appeared to hurt his left wrist while trying to protect himself from a fall. Sinner was able to continue and play effectively, but frequently had to shake out his left hand.\n\nThat could potentially be a factor in Sunday's final, where Sinner will be favored against No. 12 Fritz, who knocked off fellow American Frances Tiafoe, the No. 20 seed, in five sets.\n\nThe semifinal stage was entirely new for Draper, a 22-year-old lefty from Great Britain who has been threatening to join the ranks of Grand Slam contenders but has struggled with the physicality of playing best-of-five matches — much like Sinner before this year.\n\nThough Draper has made strides in his fitness and endurance since joining the ATP Tour, the stress of playing in his first major semifinal brought some of those issues back to the surface. Despite reasonable temperatures in the mid-70s, Draper was sweating profusely almost from the beginning of the match. He struggled to maintain a dry grip on his racket and at one point even needed to change shoes in the middle of a game. In the second set, his stomach was so unsettled that he threw up on the court.\n\nStill, he managed to test Sinner and keep the score close for awhile even though Sinner pressured him in several service games. When Sinner finally broke to take a 4-2 lead in the third set, Draper was clearly out of gas and hunched over in the corner trying to recover for the final few games of the match.\n\nSinner, whose fitness was also a question mark until he won the Australian Open, will play in his second career major final. He is 5-0 overall in finals this year, including Masters 1000 titles in Miami and Cincinnati.\n\nA few days before the U.S. Open began, the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced the shocking revelation that Sinner had tested positive in March for traces of the banned substance clostebol but was allowed to continue playing during his provisional suspension and appeal.\n\nOn Aug. 20, the ITIA ruled that Sinner was not at fault for the positive test. Sinner claimed that the substance entered his system due to spray that his fitness trainer had used to treat a cut on his finger. The trainer then did work on Sinner without gloves, allegedly causing the positive test. In Italy, the spray that contains clostebol is widely available over the counter.\n\nA number of current and former players have raised concerns that Sinner received favorable treatment because he was allowed to continue playing, but Sinner has said that the difference in his case was that he and his team were quickly able to present evidence about his trainer using the banned spray.\n\nFollow Dan Wolken on social media @DanWolken", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/01/23/australian-open-madison-keys-sabalenka/77903886007/", "title": "Madison Keys in Australian Open 2025: Family, husband, coach ...", "text": "Madison Keys played a classic match, and now Florida has a finalist at the 2025 Australian Open.\n\nThe Orlando resident outlasted Iga Swiatek, the No. 2 player in the WTA rankings and a five-time Grand Slam champion, in a semifinal match that rolled into Thursday morning in the U.S. Keys lost the opening set and faced two match points, but she capitalized on Swiatek's mistakes to take her second shot at winning a major title.\n\n“Yeah, I’m in the finals,” the No. 19-ranked Keys said with relief. “That match was just such high level, and she played so well and I felt like I was just fighting to stay in it. I kind of really ran with the second and then the third was just a battle. To be able to be standing here and be in the finals is absolutely amazing, and I’m so excited that I get to be here on Saturday.\"\n\nIt's been a rough road for the 29-year-old Keys, who was seen as America's next big tennis star to succeed Serena Williams after bursting onto the scene as a teenager. The coach she brought on in 2023 has helped rejuvenate her — which is good, because he's also her new husband. Keys has one more big test ahead of her: No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, the two-time reigning champ at Melbourne.\n\nFlorida could gain another Aussie Open finalist if former UF star Ben Shelton wins his men's semifinal match in the pre-dawn hours Friday morning against No. 1 Jannik Sinner.\n\nHere's what to know about Keys, including her upbringing in Florida, her history at Grand Slams and how to watch her in the Australian Open women's final:\n\nDid Madison Keys win today in Australian Open semifinal?\n\nYes. Madison Keys won an instant classic against No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek — 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (8) — to make her second career Grand Slam final. Keys faced match point, but Swiatek hit a shot into the net, then had her serve broken on a double-fault, leading to a tiebreaker in the final set. Swiatek also led 8-7 in the final-set tiebreaker, but Keys won three straight points to win the match.\n\nMadison Keys interview\n\nThe on-court interviewer opened her conversation with Keys by saying it \"had to be one of the best women's semifinals matches I've seen in a very long time.\"\n\n\"At the end, I feel like we were both battling some nerves and really just pushing each other, and it just became who can get that final point and who can be just a little bit better than the other one. And I'm happy it was me,\" Keys said to laughter from the crowd.\n\nWho does Madison Keys play in Australian Open women's final? No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka\n\nAwaiting Keys in Saturday's final is Aryna Sabalenka, the No. 1 player in the WTA rankings and the champions of the past two Australian Opens. The 26-year-old from Belarus, who also won the 2024 U.S. Open, beat No. 11 Paula Badosa in straight sets to make her third straight final at Melbourne. She has dropped one set in the tournament.\n\nKeys is 1-4 in her career against Sabalenka. She has lost to Sabalenka in two Grand Slam events in 2023: the Wimbledon quarterfinals and the U.S. Open semifinals. Keys' lone victory came at Berlin in 2021.\n\nHas Madison Keys won a Grand Slam?\n\nMadison Keys has come close but has not yet won a major tournament. Her biggest success has come at the U.S. Open, where she made her only other Grand Slam final, losing to fellow Floridian Sloane Stephens in straight sets in 2017.\n\nShe has made five other major semifinals: the 2023 U.S. Open, 2022 Australian Open, 2018 U.S. Open and French Open, and 2015 Australian Open. Keys has made four other major quarterfinals: 2023 Wimbledon, 2019 French Open, 2018 Aussie Open and 2015 Wimbledon.\n\nWhere is Madison Keys from? When did she move to Florida?\n\nKeys was born Feb. 17, 1995, in Rock Island, Illinois, a city near the Iowa border. It's about 175 miles east of Des Moines and 170 miles west of Chicago.\n\nKeys moved to Florida at 10 years old, as her family moved to Boca Raton so she could pursue her tennis career at the prestigious Evert Tennis Academy. She made her WTA debut at 14, winning her first pro match at Ponte Vedra Beach. She currently lives with her husband in Orlando.\n\nMadison Keys' parents: Who are Rick and Christine Keys?\n\nMadison Keys' mother and father are both attorneys. Rick Keys still practices in Madison's home county in Illinois, while Christine Keys retired to live in Florida with Madison and her younger sisters, Montana and Hunter. Christine spent 10 years helping Madison grow into a tennis star before returning to work as an attorney in Illinois.\n\nMadison said she got into tennis by watching Venus Williams at Wimbledon and asked her dad for the white dress she wore. Rick said she could only if she started playing tennis, and so she did, Madison said after her first WTA match in 2009.\n\nWhile Christine has no athletic experience, Rick played basketball at Division III Augustana College.\n\nMadison Keys' husband and coach: Who is Bjorn Fratangelo?\n\nKeys married fellow pro tennis player Bjorn Fratangelo on Nov. 23, just two months ago, in Charleston, South Carolina. Several tennis stars were on hand, including Jessica Pegula and Sloane Stephens.\n\nThe two met while they were kids at Evert Tennis Academy and started dating in 2017. Fratangelo, 31, won the French Open junior championship in 2011 and topped out at No. 99 in the ATP rankings.\n\nWhile he was still playing in 2023, he became Keys' coach after she played through Europe without one. It was a move he was reluctant to take, but the move paid dividends for Keys as she won the Eastbourne event and made the Wimbledon quarterfinals and U.S. Open semifinals, so he retired to become her full-time coach.\n\n“The really great thing about Bjorn is that when he says that, he absolutely means that,” she said after a match earlier in the tournament, according to The Athletic. “‘OK, you went out, you tried to execute the game plan and you missed a few too many. It’s fine. We go back, we work on it, and it is what it is.’ He truly does not care if I win or lose. Obviously, he wants me to win, but it’s really, ‘How did you play? Have you been implementing the things we’ve been working on?’”\n\nHow many tournaments has Madison Keys won?\n\nKeys is a nine-time winner on the WTA Tour. Her first tournament win came in Eastbourne, UK, in 2014. She has won two events in a year only once: 2019, when she took home titles at Charleston and Cincinnati. Keys won the Adelaide Invitational on Jan. 11 in the lead-up to the 2025 Australian Open.\n\nKeys has been a part of four Billie Jean King Cups (2014, 2016, 2018, 2019) and represented the U.S. at the 2016 Olympics.\n\nAustralian Open prize money: How much can Madison Keys win?\n\nThe Aussie Open prize pool is $96.5 million, with the men's and women's champions taking home a tournament-record $3.5 million, according to The Sporting News. The runner-up wins $1.9 million.\n\nWhen is Australian Open women's final?\n\nMadison Keys plays Aryna Sabalenka in the women's final at 3:30 a.m. ET Saturday, Jan. 25.\n\nHow to watch Australian Open women's final\n\nMadison Keys vs. Aryna Sabalenka can be seen on ESPN and streamed live on ESPN+. The match will re-air at 9:30 a.m. on ESPN2 and can be watched on demand on ESPN+.\n\nContributing: Scooby Axson, USA TODAY\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

She's also a U.S. Open title away from a calendar-year Grand Slam. Her task at hand, though, is defending her title at the W&S Open, where last year she defeated Ana Ivanovic in straight sets. With as well as she is playing, can former champions Maria Sharapova or Victoria Azarenka derail her? Or will another player stun the field? The tour's top 35 players underscore the 56-player field in a battle to hoist the trophy. Here's how we see things unfolding.\n\nToughest draw: Caroline Wozniacki. This may be a tournament of particular significance for fifth-ranked Wozniacki, whose professional start was in the 2005 W&S Open as a wild card (just eight days after her 15th birthday). But she faces a wicked quarter this time, conceivably playing 2013 champion Victoria Azarenka, Wimbledon finalist Garbine Muguruza and World No. 3 Simona Halep just to reach the semifinals. It'll take a whale of a week for her to win her first title at the Lindner Family Tennis Center.\n\nBest first-round match: Sloane Stephens vs. Carla Suarez Navarro. World No. 29 Stephens recently won her career-first WTA title at the Citi Open in Washington, D.C. Tenth-ranked Suarez Navarro has been to three finals this year: Antwerp, Miami and Rome. This marks the duo's second career meeting, and it doesn't come long after Stephens polished off a straight sets win in June at Eastbourne. The caliber of play could make it one of the most intense showdowns in the early going. The winner moves on to play a qualifier.\n\nDark horse: Karolina Pliskova. You probably haven't heard of her, but she's playing pretty well. A Top 100 player in 2013, the 23-year-old Czech amassed a breakthrough campaign in 2014 and ascended to No. 24 in the rankings. Now she's No. 8. Pliskova lost to Angelique Kerber in her last two finals (Stanford, Birmingham) and has proven she's not to be taken lightly. Here, she has a bye before potentially facing Sam Stosur. Fun fact: Pliskova's twin sister, Krystina, is playing qualifying in the W&S Open and aiming for a main draw bid.\n\nMatch we'd like to see: Caroline Wozniacki vs. Victoria Azarenka. The two former No. 1s are great players from the same generation. What's more, they've played three times this year already, at the Australian Open, Rome and Doha. Counting the 2013 W&S Open, which Azarenka won, the Belarusian has defeated Wozniacki four straight times. Wozniacki's last win over her foe was at Indian Wells in 2013. Azarenka doesn't have a bye in this tourney, which perhaps gives Wozniacki an edge in the rest department.\n\nOur pick to win: Serena Williams. Far be it from us to doubt a player that has gone 62-3 and won seven titles (including all four Grand Slams) since this time last year. The one person who may take Williams off her game mentally is her sister, No. 22 Venus Williams. The duo could meet in the quarterfinals, although Venus Williams has a tough route that starts in the first round against Zarina Diyas and could continue against Ana Ivanovic. If Serena Williams plays like she has been, the title could be hers again.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/14"}]}
