It's about our freedoms | Opinion", "text": "Like many Americans on Thanksgiving, I'll sit down to a delicious feast, perhaps with turkey (or in Texas, often BBQ!). After a little prodding, the guests will say what they're thankful for. Kids will write on a paper craft consisting of turkey \"feathers\" the things they are grateful for, and it will seem like a sweet list − dog, no school, mom. We'll watch football and eat too much pumpkin pie.\n\nI think this is good and necessary. Daily gratitude has been scientifically shown to have health benefits.\n\nBut I also think it's important to remember the reason we are able to give thanks on a special day set aside for gratitude. Without the Pilgrims' brave quest for religious freedom, and their \"First Thanksgiving\" in 1621, we wouldn't have Thanksgiving as we know it or now, likely, even a country as incredible as America.\n\nReligious freedom, a noble quest\n\nThe first Thanksgiving centered around something we often gloss over here in America. \"Pilgrims,\" the term we now apply to all the Mayflower passengers and other settlers who came to America around the 1620s, came to a new land so they could worship God freely.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nWe know that 102 of these brave souls left the comfort of England, crossed an ocean − many of them vomiting and even dying on the way over − and landed here in the middle of a freezing East Coast winter. Just 52 people survived that first year. In 1621, at least 90 Wampanoag, a Native American tribe, joined the English to celebrate their harvest, a tribute to survival.\n\nThe realization makes my own Thanksgiving Day seem superficial compared with their humble, yet vital, purpose.\n\nAs a Christian, I cannot get over the earnestness of this venture and the simplicity − yet profundity − of this idea and the bounty that came from it. It really cannot, nor should it, be glossed over or ignored: America's origins are based on the desperate need to seek God freely.\n\nImagine risking your life, your family, your comfort and your home − all to find a new land to worship God? The sheer verve. This bold move, motivated by the Pilgrims' faith, set America on an incredible upward path to freedom and success later.\n\nFreedom is an incredible foundation\n\nA country marked by the ability to worship and speak freely and have a free press, among other things, is truly an extraordinary concept. It laid the foundation for American citizens to thrive.\n\nIt would still be more than 150 years until the Founding Fathers took the Pilgrims' quest for religious liberty and enshrined it into our founding documents, creating the Declaration of Independence and later the Bill of Rights.\n\nI know that most of us, including myself, are so used to the incredible foundation of freedoms that America was built on that they can seem almost ordinary − or that everyone around the world enjoys these, at least to some degree. But this is not the case. Other countries − even ones we admire or seem like our allies − are slowly stripping these natural, God-given rights from their own citizens, if they ever had them in the first place.\n\nFreedom of speech is under attack even in places like the United Kingdom. In September, Pete North, a British blogger, was arrested for posting a meme on social media that, in part, denigrated Hamas, a terrorist organization. The New York Post reported in August that the United Kingdom arrests up to 30 people a day for petty offenses such as posting memes or cartoons on social media.\n\nReligious freedom is not common everywhere, either. The Chinese government arrested 30 Christians in October. Christians have been persecuted in North Korea for practicing their faith in secret.\n\nEven freedom of the press is not exactly ubiquitous: A 2024 press freedom index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders, shows that journalism in many countries faces enormous political pressure.\n\nEven in America, we take religious liberty for granted.\n\nThese brave, hardworking people had no idea America would become America, let alone what it is now: an economic powerhouse and the freest, most prosperous nation in the world. It all started with a brave group of people seeking religious liberty, a core value we still hold.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, may we show gratitude for this day, but also for the brave men and women who went before us. Without the Pilgrims' faith, there might be no America.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY. She lives in Texas with her four kids.

Why do we celebrate it? What to ...", "text": "Grab your forks and spoons! The biggest food holiday of the year is almost here.\n\nThanksgiving, the day we give thanks while stuffing our faces, is Thursday, Nov. 23.\n\nThrough the years, Thanksgiving has become known for spending time with family and friends, watching football and the famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and, of course, eating good food.\n\nWhile the holiday's origins may not be as accurate as the tales that appear in children's stories or high school textbooks, many see the day as an opportunity to enjoy the company of loved ones and show gratitude.\n\nBut how did Thanksgiving begin? When was the first celebration, and what did they eat? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWhen is Thanksgiving 2023?\n\nThanksgiving is on Thursday, Nov. 23, 2023.\n\nOn what day does Thanksgiving fall?\n\nThe holiday falls on the fourth Thursday in November each year.\n\nWhen did Thanksgiving become a federal holiday?\n\nThanksgiving was celebrated independently by colonies and states for more than 200 years, The History Channel reports. Magazine editor and famed author Sarah Josepha Hale became known as the Mother of Thanksgiving for her campaign to establish it as a national holiday.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln answered her call during the Civil War in 1863 and proclaimed a national Thanksgiving would be celebrated on the last Thursday in November.\n\nBut, in 1939, department store mogul Fred Lazarus Jr., concerned that the late Thanksgiving that year would mean less shopping days before Christmas, persuaded President Franklin D. Roosevelt to move Thanksgiving back a week. For a couple years, the confused nation celebrated the holiday on two different days. To end the confusion, Congress passed a joint resolution, signed by Roosevelt on Dec. 26, 1941, that established Thanksgiving as a federal holiday held on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nWhen was the first Thanksgiving?\n\nAccording to the History Channel, the first Thanksgiving celebration is believed to have occurred in 1621.\n\nThe story, historically told from the pilgrim's perspective, is that Plymouth colonists from England shared a meal with the indigenous Wampanoag people to give thanks for a successful fall harvest.\n\nThis lore, however, may not be completely accurate. Most recounts of the event's significance are often overstated, journalist Eryn Dion noted in her reporting.\n\nMembers of the Wampanoag were not formally invited as a gesture of good grace, she says. Instead, the pilgrims became a bit rowdy at their feast and began shooting into the air. Fearing violence, Wampanoag warriors went to see what was occurring, prepared for war (if need be), but saw it was a celebration and eventually joined the feast.\n\nThe second Thanksgiving celebration was held in 1623 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to mark the end of a long drought that threatened the year's harvest. Days of fasting and feasting would soon become common practice in other New England settlements over the years.\n\nWhy do we celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nThe national holiday began as a celebration of the harvest and other blessings, per the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Thanksgiving, however, has since moved away from its Puritan roots and has become a day to \"symbolize intercultural peace, America's opportunity for newcomers, and the sanctity of home and family.\"\n\nHow is Thanksgiving celebrated?\n\nFor generations, Thanksgiving Day, fondly referred to as Turkey Day, has been celebrated with a large feast consisting of several dishes that vary by culture, ethnicity, state and region. But in most households, you will usually find stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, corn, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, candied yams, macaroni and cheese, pumpkin pie, and the quintessential main dish: turkey.\n\nThanksgiving Day is also often celebrated with football games, parades, and volunteering, BBC Good Food reports. The day after Thanksgiving has also become its own celebration known as Black Friday. During this day, stores nationwide offer extended hours, discounts and special promotions in preparation for the Christmas shopping season.\n\nWhat was eaten at the first Thanksgiving?\n\nThe History Channel reports that no record exists of the first Thanksgiving menu. Although turkey has become the official mascot of Thanksgiving Day, many historians believe it was likely not a part of the original feast. Here's a list of foods that might've appeared on the table instead:\n\nDeer, likely roasted over a smoldering fire or made into a stew.\n\nLocal vegetables such as onions, beans, lettuce, spinach, cabbage, carrots and peas.\n\nIndigenous fruits such as blueberries, plums, grapes, gooseberries, raspberries and cranberries.\n\nCorn, likely pounded into a thick corn mush or porridge.\n\nVarious types of seafood like mussels, lobster, bass, clams and oysters.\n\nPumpkin custard.\n\nRoot vegetables like turnips and groundnuts.\n\nWhat other countries celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nThe United States isn't the only country that has a designated holiday for giving thanks. Several other countries and territories also celebrate Thanksgiving. But the dates and reasons for celebrating may vary.\n\nThe countries and territories that celebrate their own versions of Thanksgiving include:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columns/mark-woods/2023/11/17/revisiting-history-of-indigenous-timucuan-thanksgiving-childhood/71598761007/", "title": "Revisiting history of indigenous, Timucuan, Thanksgiving, childhood", "text": "Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays.\n\nI remember in elementary school being told the story of the First Thanksgiving. It happened in the autumn of 1621, in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Mayflower Pilgrims sat down with the Indians for a harvest celebration. At the feast, everyone gave thanks for the food and fellowship.\n\nAnd so began the tradition we still celebrate 400 years later on the fourth Thursday in November.\n\nOr at least that’s what I was taught.\n\nI doubt I was told that the Wampanoag had been there for thousands of years, or that this wasn’t the indigenous people’s first contact with Europeans, or that they were wary of the new settlers but formed a tenuous alliance for strategic purposes, or that this peace was short-lived.\n\nI also didn’t learn that historians say similar gatherings already had happened earlier and elsewhere — including when Pedro Menendez de Aviles and Spanish settlers founded St. Augustine in 1565 and ate with the natives who lived there.\n\nNot that I was taught the Pilgrims or Pedro Menendez discovered America.\n\nThat, of course, was Christopher Columbus.\n\nWhen I learned about Columbus in elementary school, I don’t think I was told what seems like an elementary detail: He never set foot on land that became America. Or if that was included, perhaps with an explanation that he landed in part of the Americas (an island in the Bahamas), it was downplayed. Kind of like the idea of “discovering” a New World where people had been living for more than 12,000 years.\n\n'Beware of simple stories'\n\nIt brings to mind something Jennifer Grey, public services coordinator for Florida State College of Jacksonville’s libraries, said about history: “Beware of simple stories.”\n\nGrey says that’s one of the things she learned while working on “Bygone Jax: Our Unsung History,” a podcast created in partnership with WJCT Public Media.\n\nShe already knew that history rarely is simple, always is complicated and sometimes is flat-out wrong. But this project, delving into local history, has hammered that home. And the latest episodes of the podcast, released to coincide with National Native American Heritage Month, are devoted to debunking three myths and misconceptions about Jacksonville’s indigenous history.\n\nOne example: the timeline of the Timucuan — the name Europeans gave the indigenous people based on their language — ended when Juan Alonso Cabale died in Cuba on Nov. 14, 1767.\n\nI should say that I’m among those who has perpetuated this story. In 2017, I wrote that the 250th anniversary of the death of The Last Timucuan came and went with hardly anyone noticing. This is partly true. The anniversary did pass largely unnoticed. But as explained in the podcast, Cabale almost certainly wasn’t the last of his people — many scattered and merged with other tribes — and the Timucua timeline didn’t end in 1767. It’s alive today with the Seminole and Muscogee (Creek).\n\n“As we worked on this … it sort of ballooned into several different things where people kind of think they know what happens,” Grey said. “And it turns out that it's always more complicated than that — and frequently, so much more interesting.”\n\nBeyond the myths and misconceptions, there’s the matter of simply thinking about how much human history we overlook if we start a timeline in the 1560s and focus on what happened then and later.\n\nThis is something that the National Park Service has been thinking about as it tells the story of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, a park with the name of people who lived here much longer than the French and Spanish.\n\nIt’s something that two University of North Florida professors, Keith Ashley and Denise Bossy, have been thinking about, studying and writing about for decades. And as my colleague Matt Soergel wrote about recently, they won a grant to write a book that tells the story of the indigenous people who lived in the area for thousands of years — \"a story\" Bossy said, \"that's always been left out.\"\n\nThe term “revisionist history” often is dripping with negative connotations. It shouldn’t be.\n\nI recently dug up my notes from when I went to Yellowstone and met with a longtime historian there, Lee Whittlesey. For decades, the park service told a simple creation story, of pioneers gathered around a campfire deciding to create a national park. That story was a beloved narrative, retold again and again with great fanfare. When Whittlesey helped debunk the campfire story — the park service now calls it the Campfire Myth — it earned him scorn. But when we talked, he pointed to a quote he had handy from fellow historian Elliott West.\n\nIt said: “The use of revisionist has always struck me as odd. We historians are all in the revision business, aren't we? If we don't ask new questions and work towards a fresh understanding, what's the point? Treating past historians respectfully is our obligation. Revising and building on what they have done is our job.”\n\nThese days, particularly in Florida, we have politicians proclaiming that they will do everything possible to preserve and protect history. Often what they really want to do is preserve and protect the simple story that has been told again and again, the one that perpetuates myths and misconceptions.\n\nA gift from 'The People'\n\nEven before I started writing this, or listening to “Bygone Jax,” I had Native American heritage on my mind. Partly because I recently went to Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona, a unique national park because the land is owned and co-managed by the Navajo Nation. Partly because I’ve been binging TV shows “Reservation Dogs” and “Dark Winds.” And partly because all of this made me think back to when I was in elementary school.\n\nWhen I was 6 years old, we moved to Nevada.\n\nMy dad, a Baptist minister, took a job that involved working on the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony.\n\nThe Colony, established in the early 1900s, consists of more than 1,000 members from three tribes: the Paiute, the Shoshone and the Washoe. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dad was director of the Colony Christian Center, a social services agency that helped support tribal efforts with a housing construction project, park development, Head Start and the Neighborhood Youth Corps.\n\nOr at least that’s what an old newspaper clipping I found recently says.\n\nI wish Dad and Mom were still around so I could ask them more about the four years in Reno. We didn’t live on the Colony. I’m not sure why. I'm guessing that’s just what the missionaries who preceded Dad had done there. We weren’t a part of the Colony, but it was a part of our life.\n\nI vaguely recall going to church and other events. I certainly was around more Native Americans than most white kids. Because of that, I was at least somewhat aware of some native traditions and — something my parents embraced the rest of their lives — the intense connection to the land.\n\nBut mostly I was just busy being a kid, learning how to ride a banana seat bike, sticking baseball cards in the spokes.\n\nAt the elementary school a couple of blocks from our small ranch house — when I saw it a few years ago it was even smaller than I remembered — the kids in my class were mostly white. And I now realize that so much of the history I learned in school was incomplete and flawed. Sometimes in unintentional ways, sometimes in quite intentional ways.\n\nWhen I talked to Grey about “Bygone Jax,” she talked about how we typically teach history as a collection of facts, when it often should be viewed more as a collection of narratives. Stories told from distinct vantage points. That’s true even when it comes to family histories.\n\nI wish I could talk to some of the tribal members from the time my Dad was there. Most of them are gone, too. I now wonder what they thought of an outsider coming to the colony, a white man, an American Baptist missionary, trying to help \"The People\" (the meaning of each of the tribal names in their languages) who had been on the land now known as Nevada for thousands of years.\n\nMom told me later, after Dad died, that he was the last missionary there, that when he left, he wrapped up the program there. She said he was proud of that, and that tribal members appreciated what he did while there. I’m sure there’s some truth in that. But that’s the simple family story. I’m also sure it’s more complicated. I'd like to learn more.\n\nI do know that at some point members of the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony gave us some gifts. Handmade necklaces, moccasins, a drum with feathers attached to it.\n\nThe drum eventually cracked. I fear this might’ve been because a young boy couldn’t resist banging on it.\n\nI still have that drum.\n\nIt’s hanging on the wall near the table where we’ll have Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nIt’s still one of my favorite holidays. The idea that the story of Thanksgiving isn’t as simple as what I learned in school doesn’t spoil that. As Grey said of our local history, a story that is complicated isn't just more accurate, it often is more interesting.\n\nmwoods@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4212", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2025/11/25/what-day-is-thanksgiving-2025-when-is-thanksgiving-day-2025-macys-parade-time-when-is-christmas-2025/87461952007/", "title": "What day is Thanksgiving 2025?

By an act of Congress, Thanksgiving falls on the fourth Thursday of November every year.\n\nIs Thanksgiving a federal holiday?\n\nYes, Thanksgiving is a federal holiday listed on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. There is one more federal holiday left in 2025 — Christmas.\n\nWhen was the first Thanksgiving?\n\nThe early history of Thanksgiving can be traced back to the autumn of 1621 in Massachusetts. A romanticized version of the holiday paints a rosy narrative in which the Pilgrims graciously invite Native Americans to share a bountiful meal together.\n\nThat's not entirely true, say historians, and one of several myths about Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Pilgrims did celebrate a three-day harvest festival in 1621, but there's no record the Wampanoag tribe in Massachusetts received an official invitation to the party ahead of time, according to the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nInstead, they might've crashed it.\n\nWhat happened at the first Thanksgiving?\n\nHistorians believe 90 members of the Wampanoag tribe arrived at Plymouth Colony ready for battle after hearing the Pilgrims fire their guns into the air (don't do that, by the way). But it was all a misunderstanding. When the tribe, led by chief Massasoit, learned gunfire was part of the celebration, they decided to stay for the feast — later bringing the pilgrims five deer to put venison on the menu.\n\nWhatever peace they enjoyed, it didn't last.\n\nRelations between both sides deteriorated by the 1670s to the point of bloodshed. At one point, the severed head of Massasoit's son was mounted on a pike outside Plymouth Colony.

It was a gesture, say historians, meant to reconcile a deeply divided country in the midst of the Civil War.\n\nLincoln wasn't the first president to issue a Thanksgiving proclamation — George Washington did it in 1789. Lincoln's order, however, set a precedent for observing Thanksgiving on the last Thursday in November.\n\nThanksgiving and politics: The U.S. celebrated Thanksgiving twice for this weird reason\n\nIn 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved Thanksgiving up a week to spur retail sales during the Great Depression, according to the National Archives. Sixteen states refused to accept the change and Thanksgiving was celebrated for two years on two different dates.\n\nThe decision, called \"Franksgiving\" by Roosevelt's detractors, proved so unpopular Congress passed a law in 1941 making Thanksgiving the fourth Thursday in November.\n\nDid Pilgrims eat turkey at the first Thanksgiving?\n\nAccording to History.com, turkey was not on the menu during the Pilgrim's autumn feast. Instead, they would've likely eaten local seafood such as mussels, lobster and bass. The Wampanoag also brought deer and fruits, including pumpkin.\n\nHow long has pumpkin pie been a traditional part of Thanksgiving?\n\nPumpkin pie has been a staple on New England Thanksgiving tables as far back as the turn of the 18th century. Legend has it that the Connecticut town of Colchester postponed its Thanksgiving feast for a week in 1705 due to a molasses shortage, according to History.com.\n\nThanksgiving lore: What is a wishbone?\n\nOther than a drumstick, perhaps the most sought-after part of a Thanksgiving turkey is the furcula, or \"wishbone.\" The furcula, explains Delish, is the fusion of two clavicles, bones located near the bird's neck and breastbone, which helps it fly.\n\nA Thanksgiving tradition in some households involves two people who make a wish, then pull both sides of the furcula until it snaps. The person with the larger half is said to get their wish granted.\n\nHow did the wishbone tradition start?\n\nThe tradition of breaking the wishbone, say historians, goes back thousands of years, long before the first Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Etruscan civilization 2,400 years ago in ancient Italy, experts say, believed the future could be divined using chickens, which were said to embody magical qualities. According to Charles Panati's the \"Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things,\" Etruscans would save a chicken's furcula, setting the bones outside to dry in the sun.\n\nAt first, wishes were made on the unbroken bones of the furcula by gently stroking them. Hundreds of years later, writes Panati, the Romans adopted similar traditions from the Etruscans, who by then had begun snapping the wishbone, which some experts say may have started to preserve the finite resource of birds.\n\nLater, writes Reader's Digest, the ancient Romans brought the tradition with them as their armies went about occupying vast swaths of Europe, including ancient England. The tradition of breaking a wishbone eventually found its way to the New World, becoming associated not just with chickens but with turkeys as well.\n\nHow many turkeys are eaten on Thanksgiving?\n\nRoughly 46 million turkeys are consumed on Thanksgiving Day, according to a 2017 news release by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is roughly 21% of the total number of birds raised each year.\n\nWhere do most Turkeys in the U.S. come from? Indiana among the top of the pecking order\n\nRoughly 217 million birds were raised in the U.S. for turkey production in 2021, according to the National Turkey Federation, citing a USDA report, among them Indiana was a top turkey-producing state.\n\nIn 2024, according to the USDA, states that sold the most turkey, in order, included:\n\nMinnesota - 32 million birds. North Carolina - 27 million birds. Arkansas - 25 million birds. Indiana - 20 million birds. Missouri - 15.5 million birds. Virginia - 15.3 million birds. Iowa - 10.9 million birds. Pennsylvania - 7.7 million turkeys.\n\nThe ready-to-cook weight of U.S. turkey meat production equals to around 4.8 billion estimated pounds of turkey for Americans to consume in 2025, according to the USDA.\n\nWhen is the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade?\n\nThe 2025 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, Nov. 27.\n\nWhen is Christmas 2025?\n\nChristmas falls on Thursday, Dec. 25, this year.\n\nJohn Tufts covers trending news for IndyStar and Midwest Connect.

Indiana among the top of the pecking order\n\nRoughly 217 million birds were raised in the U.S. for turkey production in 2021, according to the National Turkey Federation, citing a USDA report, among them Indiana was a top turkey-producing state.\n\nIn 2024, according to the USDA, states that sold the most turkey, in order, included:\n\nMinnesota - 32 million birds. North Carolina - 27 million birds. Arkansas - 25 million birds. Indiana - 20 million birds. Missouri - 15.5 million birds. Virginia - 15.3 million birds. Iowa - 10.9 million birds. Pennsylvania - 7.7 million turkeys.\n\nThe ready-to-cook weight of U.S. turkey meat production equals to around 4.8 billion estimated pounds of turkey for Americans to consume in 2025, according to the USDA.\n\nJohn Tufts covers trending news for IndyStar and Midwest Connect.

According to historic accounts, however, Europeans had been visiting New England since at least the late 1400s. The Basques, English and French had a thriving fishing industry off the coast of Maine and New England. The first documented European to make contact with either the Narragansetts or the Wampanoags in Southern New England was Italian explorer Giovanni de Verrazano, who, in 1524, while sailing for the French, traveled up Narragansett Bay and traded with the Native people he found there.\n\nIn fact, several Native Americans in the area spoke English by the time the Pilgrims arrived in 1620, picked up either through trading encounters or by previously being taken into slavery by the English but either escaping or being returned to the area. Samoset, Tisquantum, or “Squanto,” and Epenow, all spoke English and played important roles in burgeoning relations between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoags, as detailed by historian and author David Silverman in his book, \"This Land Is Their Land: The Wampanoag Indians, Plymouth Colony, and the Troubled History of Thanksgiving.\"\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims came to the New World seeking religious freedom.\n\nThe group we most often associate with the Pilgrims — the Puritan congregation that separated from the Church of England — did, at least partially, come to America looking for a place where they could practice their religion without persecution. Puritans made up less than half of the more than 100 people who crossed the Atlantic on the Mayflower and settled what would eventually become Plymouth, as detailed in William Bradford's \"Of Plimouth Plantation.\"\n\nThe main reason they came to America was to maintain their English culture and to make money. After splitting off from the Church of England near the turn of the 17th century, the congregation fled to Holland, which allowed for more religious freedom. But they found it difficult to find jobs to support themselves,.......... and were worried their children were being too influenced by Dutch culture and morals.\n\nThey secured a charter from The London Company to start a colony in America — England’s second, after Jamestown in Virginia — and began gathering a group of people to travel with them, mainly servants, explorers and sailors. It’s also worth noting that, while the Pilgrims wanted the freedom to practice their religion, that freedom did not extend to anyone else. One of their main goals was to convert the Native people to Christianity.\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims intended to settle in Patuxet/Plymouth or, alternately, the Pilgrims meant to settle in Virginia but they were blown off course.\n\nWhile the story of the first Thanksgiving usually starts with the Pilgrims completing their oceanic crossing by stepping off the Mayflower onto Plymouth Rock (another myth!) the area then known as Patuxet and later christened Plymouth was actually the Pilgrims’ second landing. On Nov. 11, 1620, the voyagers dropped anchor on the tip of Cape Cod and came ashore at what is now Provincetown.\n\nThey were driven off about a month later, due to intimidation by Nauset tribesmen, who did not take kindly to the new European arrivals. The Pilgrims got back on the ship and sailed farther into Cape Cod Bay to settle at the site of the relatively abandoned Wampanoag village of Patuxet in December. Most of the Pilgrims spent the rest of the winter living on the Mayflower until enough buildings were built and they could settle the area in earnest in 1621.\n\nAlternatively, there is an idea that the Pilgrims were originally meant to settle in Virginia, near England’s first colony, Jamestown. While Virginia was considered by the Pilgrims as a destination, the charter granted to them by The London Company covered the area north of Virginia, named New England. As Bradford writes, their destination was meant to be the area around the mouth of the Hudson River, where Dutch traders had tapped into the lucrative fur trade. The Pilgrim's goal was to claim that area, and the fur trade, for England.\n\nWhen the Pilgrims sighted Cape Cod, they realized they’d been blown off course and tried to head south for the Hudson River, only to encounter dangerously rocky shoals causing them to turn back. Since Cape Cod technically was part of New England, they decided to stay there.\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims and Wampanoags came together in November 1621 for a Thanksgiving feast.\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack with this one, and not just because it forms the basis of our country’s Thanksgiving Day story.\n\nFirst, while the Puritans did have “days of Thanksgiving” they were literally the opposite of a big, fun, family feast. They were usually days of fasting and prayer that maybe would be broken with a larger meal.\n\nEdward Winslow, in his writing about the first few years in Plymouth titled “Mourt’s Relation: A Journal of the Pilgrims in Plymouth,” does mention a celebration marking the settlement’s first successful harvest, probably held around October 1621. Given the context, it certainly wasn’t a huge deal but it would later become one in modern America.\n\nAccording to Winslow, despite the fact that the Wampanoags had allowed the Pilgrims to live on their land, provided them with aid and taught them how to successfully grow native crops, the Wampanoags were not invited to this celebration. They arrived only after the Pilgrims started shooting their guns into the air. Believing themselves to be under attack, the Wampanoags head sachem, Massasoit, showed up at the settlement with about 90 warriors expecting war. Instead, they found a celebration and they decided to stay, with their hunters bringing in five deer as a contribution. Rather than a happy celebration of camaraderie and partnership, the feast that would serve as the basis of the traditional Thanksgiving myth was actually quite a tense affair, fraught with political implications.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/24/thanksgiving-tradition-change-column/76114666/", "title": "Thanksgiving can change with us: Column", "text": "Alcestis \"Cooky\" Oberg\n\nI always thought of Thanksgiving as a “forever” holiday, something that endured from the time of the pilgrims. But according to Rayna Green, a curator at the National Museum of American History, Thanksgiving started out as an impromptu gathering of pilgrims and natives, to eat and hang out. All cultures understood what a good thing feasting was, so the First Thanksgiving participants brought what they had — game, fish, squash, cranberries — and gorged in peace. The pilgrims could officially give thanks to God too, for not starving to death in the New World that year, thanks to the guidance of the American Indians who taught them to farm indigenous crops.\n\nWhile thanksgivings were celebrated after that, Thanksgiving wasn’t declared a national holiday until President Lincoln made it so in 1863. According to Green, the pilgrims' first Thanksgiving became part of American mythology in the decades that followed, taught in schools as a matter of history — part of our national identity and being. In the fullness of time, Thanksgiving shed its religious aspects and became an established secular celebration of gratitude with family and friends. Venison and fish gave way to turkey, traditions came and went, and Thanksgiving has been morphing ever since.\n\nVictory for Frankenfish and for Mother Earth: Column\n\nAnd it should. Even today, we should reassess the where, what and how of Thanksgiving, individually and nationally. While the mythology has made Thanksgiving a steadfast national holiday, we need to ask ourselves: Is it time for a change in our celebrations and traditions, even for the holiday that seems cast in historical granite?\n\nTwo years ago, there was a big change for our family — a generational one. It was not a reassessment of the worthiness or grateful spirit of the holiday, but a change of venue and some traditions. I had staged Thanksgiving for upward of 40 years. Everyone flew or drove to our house, and I set the beautiful table with my best china, recreated the time-honored recipes for pie and stuffing and found just the right turkey.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nBut during those 40 years, I got old, and so did Thanksgiving. The pies were the first to go. I easily gave up the time-consuming mess of rolling out my mother’s impossible dough and composing her elaborate pie fillings. The perfect table setting was next. It gave way to the more informal buffet, first with china, then with decorative plastic plates. After a bad back injury, guests brought some of the food. Thanksgiving had become a potluck buffet supper. But Thanksgiving still started with a prayer, and it still was about gratitude for everything we have.\n\nI was officially “retired” from Thanksgiving hostess two years ago when one daughter-in-law called me apologetically and suggested she stage the whole holiday at her house that year. She and my son were newlyweds, proud to have a home and a feast to invite their families to. Their time had come; mine was over.\n\nAmerica must welcome those seeking freedom: Ant�nio Guterres\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nI accepted my fate with some pensive resignation. Thanksgiving had always been my proud holiday. But I had begun to ask myself: Could I still do it anymore? I recalled how my mother and grandmother moved around so painfully during their last holidays too. I wondered how they felt when the end of Thanksgiving came for them: Did they have a sense of relief or of remorse, as they were forced to acknowledge the relentless passage of time?\n\nPerhaps they smiled, as I did. There it was again, the beautiful table and the great feast along with a busy hostess and helpers, energetically intent on getting everything just right. Some new relatives, babies and friends were added to that family circle. There were even some new holiday specialties added to the feast, reflecting the diversity of cuisine and people that had come to our table, as it had to the great American culture around us.\n\nThanksgiving has become a forever holiday in America, even if it didn’t start that way. It endures wherever we are, whatever stage of life we’re in. Once a year, no matter what, we stop and give thanks for what we have, what we are. It is a national holiday of gratitude — not for the crop that was just brought in, but for the good things we enjoy now, crops or not.\n\nImagine that: a holiday devoted to stopping and thinking about how lucky we are, wherever we are in our national history, during wars, recessions and tumultuous times along with those prosperous years of nice houses and growing bank accounts. At least once a year, Americans can stop in their tracks, embrace their families and think: This is good, and we are very lucky compared with the rest of the world.\n\nVery lucky.\n\nAlcestis \"Cooky\" Oberg, a freelance writer living in Houston, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

But was it really the first national Thanksgiving?\n\nHere are four things to know about Thanksgiving:\n\nWhy the Continental Congress issued the proclamation\n\nThe Continental Congress received word on Oct. 31 that British General John Burgoyne had surrendered at the Battle of Saratoga in upstate New York. Today, many historians look at that battle as a major -- or one of the turning points -- for the American side in the Revolution War, said Dan Roe, vice president of interpretation at the York County Heritage Trust.\n\nIn response to the victory, the Continental Congress formed a committee of some of the delegates, including Samuel Adams and Richard Henry Lee, to consider having a day of Thanksgiving. The Continental Congress issued a proclamation on Nov. 1, 1777, thanking God for the victory and encouraging colonists to observe a day of prayer and thankfulness while thinking about the cause. The day of Thanksgiving was set for Dec. 18, 1777.\n\nIt marked the first Thanksgiving for the colonies after declaring independence.\n\n\"To me, it started the tradition of sorts of what we now would consider the Thanksgiving holiday -- at least in spirit,\" Roe said.\n\n\"... I think the concept of taking an opportunity from the political standpoint, if you will, to take a day to encourage folks to have a moment of reflection and to give thanks, I think that's the continuing connection, at least for me, from the 1700s to today, even though the holiday itself may have changed slightly over the years,\" he said.\n\nLocal historian June Lloyd noted in her research that George Washington ordered his army to observe the day of Thanksgiving. The Continental Congress usually held two sessions a day -- one at 10 a.m. and one at 3 p.m. The congress only met in the afternoon on Dec. 18, 1777. Perhaps they attended a service at one of the churches in York earlier in the day, she said.\n\n\"It's another one of those things that we're proud of,\" she said.\n\nOther \"first\" Thanksgivings have been declared\n\nMost Americans think of the \"first\" Thanksgiving as the Pilgrims celebrating their harvest and first year of survival in New England in 1621. But others have given thanks over the years for their safe journey across the ocean or their arrival in America, said Nancy Egloff, a historian with the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation in Williamsburg, Va.\n\nSome believe Thanksgiving dates back to 1513 when Juan Ponce de Leon gave thanks for his safe arrival in Florida, where he claimed the land for Spain, Egloff wrote in \"Thanksgivings in America.\"\n\nOthers point to the first Thanksgiving at Berkeley Hundred in Virginia in 1619. Captain John Woodlief was given instructions before he left England to mark the day that he and his crew landed at the plantation as a holy day of thanksgiving. It was to be observed yearly, Egloff wrote. Berkeley Plantation, which still exists today, celebrated with its Thanksgiving Festival earlier this month.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln declared it the last Thursday in November\n\nThe Thanksgiving tradition that Americans know today dates to the Victorian Era. It was in the fall of 1863, just months after the Battle of Gettysburg, when President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. Roe said maybe Lincoln was trying to bolster the spirits of the country during the Civil War. Roe added that the tradition already was out there in some form.\n\nLincoln's Thanksgiving call of 1864 gained cold reception in York, Pa.\n\nThanksgiving used to be a religious observance, now it's more secular\n\nOriginally, Thanksgiving was a religious observance, said Kevin Gutzman, professor and chair of the Department of History at Western Connecticut State University. It has always been central to Christian practice.\n\n\"The Puritans regularly had days of 'prayer and thanksgiving' whenever something substantially good happened to them. These weren't regularly-scheduled events, but depended upon success in war, good harvests, peace with or victory over Indians or other enemies, etc.,\" Gutzman wrote.\n\nToday, Thanksgiving has become more secular, he wrote. It happens on a set date, not for particular positive developments.\n\n\"Millions of Americans associate the holiday (from holy + day) with turkey and football,\" he wrote. \"That's quite a change.\"\n\nWho owns the title of first Thanksgiving?\n\nRead more\n\nThanksgiving celebrations can be a time of \"firsts.\" Read about some other firsts:\n\nCelebrating first Thanksgiving as an American\n\nWar of the Roses football flashback\n\nFond \"first\" memories\n\nShops ready for first Black Friday", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/11/01/when-is-thanksgiving-2024/75914906007/", "title": "When is Thanksgiving 2024?", "text": "Stores are already full of Christmas everything, but don't forget to make room for Thanksgiving.\n\nThe time for turkey (or maybe something a bit different from the traditional Thanksgiving fare) and figuring out what you might be thankful for this last year has come once again.

Well, the story is a bit more complicated than that.\n\nIn a letter written by Edward Winslow, an early Pilgrim, he states that the Wampanoags' head sachem Massasoit \"with some 90 men\" joined the colonists for a three-day feast, but this was only after the Pilgrims began shooting their guns into the air. Believing themselves to be under attack, Massasoit showed up at the settlement with warriors expecting war. Instead, they found a celebration and decided to stay, with their hunters bringing in five deer as a contribution.\n\nWhich Southern state became the first to recognize Thanksgiving?\n\nIn 1855, Virginia became the nation’s first Southern state to adopt Thanksgiving.

Here are some options to go with the NFL games\n\nWhat is the history of Thanksgiving?\n\nThanksgiving folklore dates back to 1621 when the Pilgrims celebrated a harvest feast with the Wampanoag people in Plymouth, Massachusetts. According to History.com, the Pilgrims had a bountiful corn harvest and celebrated with their Native American allies. The celebration lasted three days.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the Continental Congress designated one or more days of Thanksgiving per year. In 1798, George Washington gave the first Thanksgiving proclamation by the national government of the United States; in it, he called upon Americans to express their gratitude for the happy conclusion to the country’s war of independence and the successful ratification of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHowever, there wasn't an official day of Thanksgiving in the United States until 1863. At the peak of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln set an official day of Thanksgiving on the final Thursday of November to ask God to heal the nation's wounds.\n\nIs Thanksgiving celebrated elsewhere in the world?\n\nAccording to calendardate.com, Thanksgiving is celebrated in the following countries:\n\nCanada – second Monday of October\n\nLiberia – first Thursday of November\n\nSaint Lucia – first Monday in October\n\nGrenada – October 25\n\nWhat is the travel forecast for Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Thanksgiving holiday is the busiest travel holiday, according to AAA.com.

Thanks to President Donald Trump, Gobble and Waddle will be no one's Thanksgiving meal.\n\nThe two turkeys, raised by Travis Pittman of North Carolina and under the direction of The National Turkey Federation Chairman and Butterball CEO Jay Jandrain, were pardoned Nov. 25.Trump continued the beloved, if not eccentric, tradition of ceremonially pardoning two turkeys at the White House, in a cheery event that brought dozens of reporters, staff and their families.Their names, Gobble and Waddle, were selected via an online poll posted to social media by the Office of the First Lady.\n\nThe pardons for turkeys came just days after Gov. Josh Stein did the same thing -- pardoning two turkeys, Krispy and Kreme, from the Thanksgiving table.\n\nNC turkeys bask in White House spotlight\n\nAt the White House, Trump found himself almost upstaged by Gobble and Waddle.\"Today we continue a time-honored American tradition,\" Trump said, before he was interrupted by a loud gobble of one of the turkeys. \"Well, that’s a well-trained turkey! See how happy he is?\" Trump joked to the crowd.\n\nThis year’s presentation marks the 78th year of the tradition, which has continued through 15 successive administrations.\n\nThe two birds with ties to North Carolina weighed more than 50 pounds, prompting Trump to joke he had never seen turkeys that big before.\n\n\"Despite their size, Secretary Kennedy has formally certified that these are the first ever MAHA turkeys,\" the president said.\n\nGobble and Waddle returning to North Carolina\n\nAfter spending the night before their Tuesday, Nov. 25 pardons at the Willard InterContinental Hotel near the White House, the two birds will head back home to North Carolina to live out the rest of their days.\n\nLike other turkeys before them, Gobble and Waddle were part of a special \"Presidential Flock\" hatched over the summer, according to The National Turkey Federation, and prepared in advance for the spotlight. A team trains the turkeys to be comfortable around crowds, bright lights and loud sounds, and being handled during the pardon ceremony.Since 2001, presidents have pardoned two turkeys at the annual ceremony: the primary bird and its alternate.\n\nThough the tradition's origins stretch back to 1947 when President Harry Truman received a live turkey from the National Turkey Federation, it wasn't until 1989 that the practice of saving the turkeys − not eating them − really started.That's the year President George H.W. Bush declared that the bird would be officially pardoned, sparking the annual event we see today.\n\nAlong with the president and first lady, several top administration officials were also in attendance, including Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt brought her son to the White House Briefing Room earlier in the day to meet Waddle for a photo opportunity.However, the tradition is not universally loved. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, has long condemned the practice. In a Nov. 18 statement, the advocacy group called it a \"commercial for the cruel meat industry.\"\n\nNC governor pardons turkeys as well\n\nBack in North Carolina, Stein's Nov. 21 pardon for Krispy and Kreme came during the annual Turkey Pardon Ceremony at the Governor’s Mansion. The Governor was joined by Tim Thomas, President of the North Carolina Poultry Federation, and partners from Butterball. During the event, Butterball announced it would donate 1,500 turkey breasts to the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina.\n\nKrispy and Kreme are 19-week-old hens that weigh roughly 45 pounds.

In 1863, his son, Tad, asked for clemency for a turkey intended to become Christmas dinner, according to WhiteHouseHistory.com.\n\nWhile some presidents have offered a \"reprieve\" for Thanksgiving turkeys presented to the White House, it was President George H.W.

See how happy he is?\" Trump joked to the crowd.\n\nYet, unlike tradition, the president swiftly switched gears to discuss political matters in his opening remarks, making several jokes that blurred the line between the light-hearted ceremony and the administration's leading, and in several cases controversial, policies. Trump began his speech by calling the previous administration's pardons \"hereby null and void,\" referring to former President Joe Biden's use of the autopen, which he has criticized.\n\nThe remarks drew scattered laughter.\n\nTrump said last year's pardoned turkeys, Peach and Blossom were \"on their way to be processed, in other words, to be killed.\"\n\n\"But I have stopped that journey and I am officially pardoning them and they will not be served for Thanksgiving dinner,\" Trump said, appearing to joke.\n\nThis year’s presentation marks the 78th year of the tradition, which has continued through 15 successive administrations.\n\nThe two birds were raised by Travis Pittman of North Carolina and under the direction of The National Turkey Federation Chairman and Butterball CEO Jay Jandrain. Their names, Gobble and Waddle, were selected via an online poll posted to social media by the Office of the First Lady.\n\nTrump said the two turkeys weighed over 50 pounds, joking he had never seen turkeys that big before.\n\n\"Despite their size, Secretary Kennedy has formally certified that these are the first ever MAHA turkeys,\" the president said.\n\nTrump also mentioned the newly renovated Rose Garden, where the ceremony was held.\n\n\"I hope you like our new beautiful patio,\" Trump said, referring to the Rose Garden’s makeover, which included paving over much of the lawn. \"If this were grass today you’d be sinking into the mud like they’ve done for many years.\"\n\nAfter spending the night before their Tuesday, Nov. 25 pardons at the Willard InterContinental Hotel near the White House, the two birds will head back home to North Carolina to live out the rest of their days.\n\nLike other turkeys before them, Gobble and Waddle were part of a special \"Presidential Flock\" hatched over the summer, according to The National Turkey Federation, and prepared in advance for the spotlight. A team trains the turkeys to be comfortable around crowds, bright lights and loud sounds, and being handled during the pardon ceremony.\n\nBeg your pardon? Why do Presidents pardon turkeys? We explain\n\nSince 2001, presidents have pardoned two turkeys at the annual ceremony: the primary bird and its alternate.\n\nThough the tradition's origins stretch back to 1947 when President Harry Truman received a live turkey from the National Turkey Federation, it wasn't until 1989 that the practice of saving the turkeys − not eating them − really started.\n\nThat's the year President George H.W. Bush declared that the bird would be officially pardoned, sparking the annual event we see today.\n\nAlong with the president and first lady, several top administration officials were also in attendance, including Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt brought her son to the White House Briefing Room earlier in the day to meet Waddle for a photo opportunity.\n\nHowever, the tradition is not universally loved. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, has long condemned the practice. In a Nov. 18 statement, the advocacy group called it a \"commercial for the cruel meat industry.\"\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

The options are: Sugar and Spice, Pumpkin and Pie, Gobble and Waddle or Acorn and Squash. But which president was first to pardon a turkey – and how the ceremony evolved – remains a combination of lore and historical documents. Before you start planning your holiday dinner, here’s a refresher on the unusual annual event.\n\nNational Thanksgiving Turkey origins\n\nThe tradition of a White House ceremony ahead of Thanksgiving began in 1947, when President Harry Truman received a live turkey from the National Turkey Federation, according to the National Archives. Contrary to reports that he pardoned the turkey, the Truman Library suggests the bird was probably served as dinner.\n\nIn recent years, the White House has selected which turkey should be presented as the National Thanksgiving Turkey and which should be the alternate, according to the organization. The president announces the final choice during the ceremony, but both are spared and sent to a petting zoo or an agricultural center for the remainder of their lives.\n\nWho was the first president to pardon a turkey? Well, that depends.\n\nIn 1863, President Abraham Lincoln was credited with saving a turkey from being served at Christmas dinner, according to then-White House reporter Noah Brooks and the White House Historical Association. According to the dispatch, a live turkey was brought home for Christmas dinner, but Lincoln’s son, Tad, pleaded to save the bird’s life, and his father agreed.\n\nOfficially, President John F. Kennedy is credited as the first to pardon a turkey. In 1963, a 55-pound bird wearing a sign around its neck reading \"Good eating, Mr. President\" was presented at the White House. \"We’ll just let this one grow,\" said the president, asking that it be returned to its California farm.\n\nFuture turkeys received similar treatment from Presidents Ronald Regan and Jimmy Carter, but the word \"pardon\" was not officially designated on the birds.\n\nThe tradition was cemented by President George H.W. Bush, who, at the 1989 presentation, declared that the year’s bird would be officially pardoned, sparking the annual presidential action we see today. Bush declared at the presentation that the turkey \"will not end up on anyone’s dinner table, not this guy – he’s presented a presidential pardon as of right now – and allow him to live out his days on a children’s farm not far from here.\"\n\nBut it was the pleas of President Barack Obama’s two young daughters, Sasha and Malia, in 2009, who requested that both birds receive a pardon. It's a tradition that continues to this day.\n\nSince 1989, 60 turkeys have been spared by U.S. presidents, including:\n\n2024 – Peach and Blossom\n\n2023 – Liberty and Bell\n\n2022 – Chocolate and Chip\n\n2021 – Peanut Butter and Jelly\n\n2020 – Corn and Cob\n\n2019 – Butter and Bread\n\n2018 – Peas and Carrots\n\n2017 – Drumstick and Wishbone\n\n2016 – Tot and Tater\n\n2015 – Abe and Honest\n\n2014 – Cheese and Mac\n\n2013 – Popcorn and Caramel\n\n2012 – Cobbler and Gobbler\n\n2011 – Liberty and Peace\n\n2010 – Apple and Cider\n\n2009 – Courage and Carolina\n\n2008 – Pecan and Pumpkin\n\n2007 – May and Flower\n\n2006 – Flyer and Fryer\n\n2005 – Marshmallow and Yam\n\n2004 – Biscuits and Gravy\n\n2003 – Stars and Stripes\n\n2002 – Katie and Zack\n\n2001 – Liberty and Freedom\n\n2000 – Pee Wee and his backup\n\n1999 – Ranger\n\n1998 – Harry and his backup\n\n1997 – Yosemite and his sidekick\n\n1996 – Ziggy\n\n1995 – Bucky and his alternate\n\n1994 – Swan and his backup\n\n1993 – Bartholomew\n\n1992 – Yukon and Gold\n\n1991 – Honky and Tonky\n\n1990 – Spike and Peanut\n\n1989 – Jerry\n\nContributors: USA TODAY’s Janet Loehrke\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/11/21/mamdani-trump-sedition-jobs-economy-dick-cheney-vaccine-autism-thanksgiving/87391445007/", "title": "Mamdani, Trump, sedition, economy, jobs, Dick Cheney ...", "text": "Happy Friday!🙋🏼‍♀️ I'm Nicole Fallert.

With President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 proclamation, Thanksgiving became regularly celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.\n\nAccording to the National Archives, the last Thursday in November fell on the last day of the month in 1939, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved that year's Thanksgiving to the second-to-last Thursday of November to extend the Christmas shopping season.

The Senate amended the resolution, making the holiday the fourth Thursday in November.

Roosevelt.\n\nIt was Lincoln who issued an 1863 proclamation calling on Americans to \"set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving,\" partly to celebrate victories in the then-raging Civil War.\n\n\"He's the father of the whole idea of a nation giving thanks for its advantages and privileges of living in a democracy like this,\" said Harold Holzer, historian and chairman of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation.\n\nDecades later, Roosevelt and Congress acted to establish Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November, in part to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.\n\nInformally, the United States government had recognized periodic days of thanksgiving from the moment of the nation's birth.\n\nIn 1777, a year after the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress declared a day of thanksgiving to celebrate a Revolutionary War victory over the British at Saratoga.\n\nThe first president, George Washington, declared a day of thanksgiving and prayer in 1789, partly to honor the new U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt took the trauma of the Civil War to make Thanksgiving a formal, annual holiday.\n\nLincoln issued his proclamation on Oct. 3, 1863, three months after Union Army victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, and at a time in which ultimate triumph appeared in sight. \"There was a lot to be thankful for in the fall of 1863,\" said Allen Guelzo, the Henry R. Luce Professor of the Civil War Era at Gettysburg College.\n\nWriting that the nation's many blessings \"should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged\" by the American people, Lincoln declared: \"I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens.\"\n\n(It should be noted that while Lincoln issued this proclamation, most historians believe it was actually written by his secretary of State, William Seward.)\n\nThe proclamation served a familiar purpose for Lincoln. \"He was always looking for ways to unify the nation in a terrible time of war,\" biographer Ronald C. White Jr. said.\n\nStill, the idea of a formal Thanksgiving holiday had been gestating for a long time before Lincoln.\n\nSarah Josepha Hale, editor of the popular magazine Godey's Lady's Book, pushed the idea for years, petitioning Lincoln and his predecessors. (Thanksgiving was only one of Hale's contributions to American culture; she also wrote the poem Mary Had a Little Lamb.)\n\nAfter Lincoln, presidents issued annual Thanksgiving proclamations. In last year's proclamation, President Obama said Thanksgiving Day is \"a time to take stock of the fortune we have known and the kindnesses we have shared, grateful for the God-given bounty that enriches our lives.\"\n\nFor decades after Lincoln, Americans traditionally celebrated Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of November, even if it fell on Nov. 30 -- as happened in 1939, the end of an economically troubled decade.\n\nSome merchants worried that a late Thanksgiving would cut down on Christmas sales and asked President Roosevelt to move the holiday up by a week – which he did, creating unanticipated havoc.\n\nSome state governors objected, issuing proclamations of their own to keep Thanksgiving on Nov. 30. Other states recognized the Nov. 23 date. This created scheduling issues for holiday traditions ranging from family reunions to football games.\n\n\"It was just chaos for a couple of years,\" said Bob Clark, supervisory archivist with the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library & Museum.\n\nCongress eventually stepped in. On Dec. 26, 1941, less than a month after the attack at Pearl Harbor plunged the United States into World War II, Congress passed a law declaring the fourth Thursday of November as Thanksgiving Day, where it remains to this day.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/history/2015/11/20/whats-yorks-first-thanksgiving-claim-fame/75554226/", "title": "What's York's first Thanksgiving claim to fame?", "text": "Teresa Boeckel\n\ntboeckel@ydr.com\n\nThanksgiving has been celebrated off and on in so many ways over the centuries, but some say the national holiday that Americans observe today is tied to a proclamation made while the Continental Congress was seated in York.\n\nA sign in downtown York highlights that historical connection. But was it really the first national Thanksgiving?\n\nHere are four things to know about Thanksgiving:\n\nWhy the Continental Congress issued the proclamation\n\nThe Continental Congress received word on Oct. 31 that British General John Burgoyne had surrendered at the Battle of Saratoga in upstate New York. Today, many historians look at that battle as a major -- or one of the turning points -- for the American side in the Revolution War, said Dan Roe, vice president of interpretation at the York County Heritage Trust.\n\nIn response to the victory, the Continental Congress formed a committee of some of the delegates, including Samuel Adams and Richard Henry Lee, to consider having a day of Thanksgiving. The Continental Congress issued a proclamation on Nov. 1, 1777, thanking God for the victory and encouraging colonists to observe a day of prayer and thankfulness while thinking about the cause. The day of Thanksgiving was set for Dec. 18, 1777.\n\nIt marked the first Thanksgiving for the colonies after declaring independence.\n\n\"To me, it started the tradition of sorts of what we now would consider the Thanksgiving holiday -- at least in spirit,\" Roe said.\n\n\"... I think the concept of taking an opportunity from the political standpoint, if you will, to take a day to encourage folks to have a moment of reflection and to give thanks, I think that's the continuing connection, at least for me, from the 1700s to today, even though the holiday itself may have changed slightly over the years,\" he said.\n\nLocal historian June Lloyd noted in her research that George Washington ordered his army to observe the day of Thanksgiving. The Continental Congress usually held two sessions a day -- one at 10 a.m. and one at 3 p.m. The congress only met in the afternoon on Dec. 18, 1777. Perhaps they attended a service at one of the churches in York earlier in the day, she said.\n\n\"It's another one of those things that we're proud of,\" she said.\n\nOther \"first\" Thanksgivings have been declared\n\nMost Americans think of the \"first\" Thanksgiving as the Pilgrims celebrating their harvest and first year of survival in New England in 1621. But others have given thanks over the years for their safe journey across the ocean or their arrival in America, said Nancy Egloff, a historian with the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation in Williamsburg, Va.\n\nSome believe Thanksgiving dates back to 1513 when Juan Ponce de Leon gave thanks for his safe arrival in Florida, where he claimed the land for Spain, Egloff wrote in \"Thanksgivings in America.\"\n\nOthers point to the first Thanksgiving at Berkeley Hundred in Virginia in 1619. Captain John Woodlief was given instructions before he left England to mark the day that he and his crew landed at the plantation as a holy day of thanksgiving. It was to be observed yearly, Egloff wrote. Berkeley Plantation, which still exists today, celebrated with its Thanksgiving Festival earlier this month.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln declared it the last Thursday in November\n\nThe Thanksgiving tradition that Americans know today dates to the Victorian Era. It was in the fall of 1863, just months after the Battle of Gettysburg, when President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. Roe said maybe Lincoln was trying to bolster the spirits of the country during the Civil War. Roe added that the tradition already was out there in some form.\n\nLincoln's Thanksgiving call of 1864 gained cold reception in York, Pa.\n\nThanksgiving used to be a religious observance, now it's more secular\n\nOriginally, Thanksgiving was a religious observance, said Kevin Gutzman, professor and chair of the Department of History at Western Connecticut State University. It has always been central to Christian practice.\n\n\"The Puritans regularly had days of 'prayer and thanksgiving' whenever something substantially good happened to them. These weren't regularly-scheduled events, but depended upon success in war, good harvests, peace with or victory over Indians or other enemies, etc.,\" Gutzman wrote.\n\nToday, Thanksgiving has become more secular, he wrote. It happens on a set date, not for particular positive developments.\n\n\"Millions of Americans associate the holiday (from holy + day) with turkey and football,\" he wrote. \"That's quite a change.\"\n\nWho owns the title of first Thanksgiving?\n\nRead more\n\nThanksgiving celebrations can be a time of \"firsts.\" Read about some other firsts:\n\nCelebrating first Thanksgiving as an American\n\nWar of the Roses football flashback\n\nFond \"first\" memories\n\nShops ready for first Black Friday", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/24/thanksgiving-fourth-thursday-november/87447741007/", "title": "When is Thanksgiving?

It was the first time Thanksgiving was celebrated under the country's new Constitution.\n\nPresidents after Washington also issued a Thanksgiving proclamation, but the months and days Thanksgiving was celebrated varied. With President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 proclamation, Thanksgiving became regularly celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.\n\nAccording to the National Archives, the last Thursday in November fell on the last day of the month in 1939, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved that year's Thanksgiving to the second-to-last Thursday of November to extend the Christmas shopping season. But not all states followed suit: 32 issued similar proclamations, of which 16 kept Thanksgiving as the last Thursday in November.\n\nBy 1941, the House of Representatives passed a joint resolution declaring Thanksgiving Day to be the last Thursday in November.

Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nWe give thanks for the grocery workers who have kept shelves stocked throughout the pandemic. For the truck drivers, mail carriers, package delivery teams and others who bring things to us so that we can remain safely in our homes. And for so many others who work tirelessly to bring some sense of normalcy and comfort to us amid a most unsettling time.\n\nI give a personal note of thanks for being blessed with a loving and supportive family. I'm also blessed to spend each day with colleagues in newsrooms across Ohio who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to bring you the news and information you need to navigate life in uncharted waters.\n\nAnd we all can give thanks for the beauty and bounty of nature.\n\nAfter more than six decades on this Earth, I remain in awe of the natural beauty of Ohio, especially at this time of year.\n\nI have said it before in this column, and it is worth repeating, that a drive through the countryside in fall gives a clear image of more of the many things for which we can be thankful: Fertile land, hardworking farmers and the abundant food produced on the 14 million acres of agricultural land between Ohio's many cities.\n\nThe patchwork of gray-brown soybean fields, golden cornstalk stubble and the still-green pastures stretch out for miles. Cows loaf near their barns, deer graze on the corn kernels dropped by pickers, an occasional hawk scans the naked fields for vermin, and we can count among our blessings that we live in a place as beautiful as this.\n\nWe also can give thanks for what those fields and farms represent – the land from which we receive our food for Thanksgiving, Christmas and every other day.\n\nTurkey, chicken, beef, pork, milk, eggs, wheat for flour, fruit and vegetables produced here, combined with the food processing and packaging businesses around all of that farming, make up Ohio's largest industry.\n\nSo in this challenging year of 2021, take a moment to thank a farmer, remember the true meaning of Thanksgiving and consider a little of the history of what has become a national holiday:\n\nPresident George Washington issued a proclamation in 1789 declaring the first national day of thanksgiving, asking people for gratitude to God \"for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country\" and \"the favorable interpositions of his Providence.\"\n\nIn following years, states set their own dates for the day of thanksgiving until President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November for all to give thanks on the same day – \"reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People.\"\n\nHe issued that proclamation on Oct. 3, 1863 – a year in which America was more divided than ever, one in which tens of thousands of American troops died in Civil War battles.\n\n\"In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union,\" Lincoln's proclamation said.\n\nAmid that time of unparalleled division, President Lincoln took time to remind people of the many reasons to be thankful, and he easily could have been talking about Ohio today:\n\n\"The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.\"\n\nAlan D.

States must certify their votes before the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14 -- many already have -- and resolve all challenges to the outcome by Dec. 8.\n\nTrump, who appeared as part of an annual holiday tradition of speaking to U.S. troops, said he did not want to say yet whether he would attend Biden’s inauguration.\n\nThe president also said he plans to get back on the campaign trail soon to help Republicans running in two critical runoff elections. Trump said he would likely get out to campaign for Georgia Sens.

The Bidens are celebrating in Rehoboth Beach, Del., with a smaller group of people rather than their usual family gathering in Nantucket.\n\n“These moments with our loved ones -- time that's lost -- can't be returned. Yet, we know it's the price of protecting each other and one we don't pay alone. Isolated in our own dining rooms and kitchens, scattered from coast to coast, we are healing together,” the Bidens said.\n\nThe pair thanked essential workers amid the coronavirus pandemic, including health care workers, teachers, grocery store employees and scientists working on treatments and a vaccine.\n\n“Most of all, we are grateful for the faith and trust we have been given to continue serving this beautiful, brave, complicated nation as your future President and first lady,” they said.\n\n— Jeanine Santucci\n\nPresident Trump expected to spend Thanksgiving at the White House\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump and the first lady will be spending Thanksgiving at the White House for the first time since he began his tenure as president instead of at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the change in scenery is attributable to the rising number of coronavirus cases, or the turbulence in his administration following the election loss.\n\nCoronavirus updates: Wyoming Gov.

The shooter is also dead, city officials said earlier this morning. Officers responded to the store less than an hour before closing around 10:12 p.m. and found the victims and evidence of a shooting, Chesapeake Police public information officer Leo Kosinski told CNN. Five patients were being treated at Sentara General Hospital in nearby Norfolk, Virginia, a spokesperson for Sentara Healthcare told CNN affiliate WTKR. An update on their conditions was not immediately available. “We’re just a couple hours past the initial incident, so everything is very fluid, very new right now,” Kosinski said earlier. A news conference is scheduled for 8 a.m. ET, the city of Chesapeake said on Twitter.\n\n2. Trump\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for the IRS to release former President Donald Trump’s tax returns to a Democratic-led House committee. The high court’s move is a major loss for Trump, who has sought to shield the release of his tax returns for years and is currently under multiple investigations. Trump’s legal team has continuously sought to keep his returns secret and turned to the Supreme Court – composed of three of Trump’s nominees – after he lost at the lower court level. Separately, a New York state judge set an October 2023 trial date for the New York attorney general’s $250 million lawsuit against Trump, his eldest children and the Trump Organization, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\n3. Student loans\n\nThe Biden administration is yet again extending the pause on federal student loan payments, a benefit that began in March 2020 to help people who were struggling financially due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This latest extension comes as the administration’s student loan forgiveness program remains tied up in the courts. Officials had told borrowers the program, which is worth up to $20,000 in debt relief per borrower, would be implemented before loan payments were set to resume in January 2023. The pause will last until 60 days after the litigation is resolved. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023, payments will resume 60 days after that, according to the Department of Education.\n\n4. Tech layoffs\n\nComputer maker HP said Tuesday that it will lay off up to 6,000 workers over the next three years, becoming the latest tech company to significantly reduce staffing amid fears of an economic downturn. The company disclosed the job cuts in a statement accompanying its lackluster quarterly earnings report, where it also said sales dropped more than 11% compared to the same period last year. The news makes HP the latest in a growing list of once-high-flying tech companies that are now announcing major job cuts. Facebook-parent Meta, Amazon and Twitter all announced large layoffs in recent weeks.\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nThe Biden administration has launched a critical, six-week push aimed at stepping up Americans’ Covid-19 booster vaccinations heading into the holiday season. Biden’s chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, kicked off the campaign on Tuesday during his final White House press briefing before he retires in December. The push comes as more than 35 million Americans have already received the updated, bivalent booster shot – including more than 16 million seniors – White House Covid-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said during the briefing. But that’s a fraction of the 267 million Americans who have received their primary Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the CDC. The campaign will focus on reaching seniors and the communities that were hardest hit by Covid-19 by expanding access, increasing awareness and more.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nWe now know what Budweiser will do with the beer it can’t sell at the World Cup\n\nBudweiser plans to ship all the unsold Buds to the country that wins the tournament – assuming that country does not prohibit alcohol consumption.\n\nA group of Indonesian islands is about to hit the auction block\n\nTo some billionaires, islands are like potato chips: you can’t buy just one.\n\nYou can thank ‘The Sims’ for the rise of luxury fashion in gaming\n\nLuxury labels like Balenciaga, Burberry and Louis Vuitton want your avatars to look their very best – for a price of course.\n\nHow to answer those dreaded personal questions at holiday gatherings\n\nHere’s what you should do before the dinner rolls start flying.\n\n‘Love Actually’ cast to reunite for 20th anniversary TV special\n\nAll I want for Christmas is … oh you know the rest.\n\nQUIZ TIME\n\nTurkey is typically the centerpiece of Thanksgiving dinner.

Here's what causes your food coma ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDo you believe in the holiday food coma?\n\nMany people do. A mainstay on the dinner table at this time of year, turkey contains tryptophan, which is widely believed to be responsible for the uncontrollable yawns and sudden snoozes common after huge family feasts.\n\n“Tryptophan is an essential amino acid needed to make serotonin, a hormone that has many functions in our body, including balancing mood and sleep,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine.\n\n“The byproduct of the tryptophan-to-serotonin process is melatonin, another hormone that regulates our sleep cycle,” he said. “Our bodies do not naturally produce tryptophan, so we have to get it through the foods we eat.”\n\nHowever, many foods besides turkey contain tryptophan, including cheese, chicken, egg whites, fish, milk, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soybeans and sunflower seeds, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nWhy we feel sleepy after a big Thanksgiving meal\n\nSerotonin is one of the “feel-good” hormones, which can calm and relax the body. However, we don’t consume nearly enough turkey during a holiday smorgasbord — even if we go back for seconds — to create the amount of serotonin needed to make us sleepy, said Steven Malin, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology and health at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n\nDon't blame the turkey for your post-meal sleepiness, experts say. Adobe Stock\n\nTo get the amount of tryptophan required to cause a food coma, he said, we’d have to eat about 8 pounds of turkey meat — about half of a typical bird meant to serve a crowd. The US Department of Agriculture recommends planning for 1 pound of turkey meat per person when preparing a holiday meal.\n\n“Tryptophan from turkey is unlikely to enter the brain and make enough serotonin to make us sleepy,” Malin said.\n\nSo you can’t blame the gobbler on your table alone for your sudden sleepiness, said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n“Turkey doesn’t really make us sleepy,” Knutson said. “If we feel sleepy after a big meal, it is likely due to not getting enough sleep in the days leading up to the big event and finally being able to relax after the dinner is over.”\n\nOvereating in general is also a major culprit for the fatigue one feels after eating, Dasgupta said.\n\n“Remember all the delicious side dishes surrounding the centerpiece of turkey, such as sweet potato pie, casseroles and yummy desserts,” he said. “These tasty dishes contain a high amount of carbohydrates, which also contribute to post-meal sleepiness.”\n\nAnother reason you feel sleepy after a meal is a change in blood flow from the head to the digestive system.\n\n“Eating a big holiday dinner causes increased blood flow to the stomach to help digest the meal, which results in less blood flow to the brain, making you tired and ready for bed,” Dasgupta said.\n\nAnd don’t forget the impact of holiday drinking either. Many meals served at this time of year are washed down with wine, cocktails and champagne. Then there’s the omnipresent beer (or two or three) that often accompany the afternoon ball games.\n\n“Let’s be honest. It’s the holidays, and there might be some family stress or travel fatigue, so maybe you drank more than your usual amount,” Dasgupta said. “Alcohol slows down your brain and relaxes your muscles, so after a few drinks you’ll likely feel sleepy.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2016/11/15/taste-cover-local-thanksgiving-locavore-turkey-red-wattle-pork-calabaza-squash-pine-island-botanicals-greens-collards/93490294/", "title": "In SWFL, a completely local Thanksgiving", "text": "ANNE REED\n\nAREED@NEWS-PRESS.COM\n\nThanksgiving is usually celebrated with a large feast, featuring the fruits of the fall harvest.\n\nA roasted turkey surrounded by homemade stuffing, root-vegetable casseroles, pumpkin and apple pies. It makes sense for those up north, where the growing season comes to an end as the leaves fall from the trees.\n\nBut in sunny, sub-tropical Southwest Florida, our growing season is just starting. We won't have green beans for several months and we don't grow pumpkins. This means a trip to a supermarket for canned pumpkin, veggies trucked in from other parts of the country and apples from northern harvests.\n\nA completely local Thanksgiving is possible, though.\n\nFrom Felda-raised turkeys to casseroles made from local squash, you needn't rely on outside harvests to fill your Thanksgiving table. Here's how:\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nTURKEY\n\nLast year, Nicole Kozak raised and harvested her first flock of turkeys at Circle C Farm in Felda. The test run was a success and this year Kozak has approximately 600 turkeys ready for Thanksgiving. All are raised in open pastures with no antibiotics, and supplemental feed that's not genetically modified.\n\n\"Because there was interest last year, we grew and cultivated that interest,\" she said. \"We have turkeys for the holidays and we are also going to keep turkey available and grow it year round like our chickens.\" The turkeys are available frozen or fresh and Kozak has been taking reservations for more than a month.\n\nIn LaBelle at Waymore Farms, Bryan Beer harvested, processed and froze his turkey last month. Storing them in the deep freeze until Thanksgiving was much easier than staying up each night, protecting the turkeys from coyotes.\n\nTurkeys go local this Thanksgiving\n\nThis was Beer's first year raising turkeys. He raised his turkeys on pasture using supplemental certified organic feed. He gave them no antibiotics.\n\n\"Most people don't know the difference between a store-bought turkey and one raised in the field,\" Beer said. \"There is a reason we do it naturally and we sell it the way we do. It's because it tastes really good and it's better for you.\"\n\nExtras: The price per pound of Circle C Farm's turkeys is $6, and price per pound at Waymore Farms is $7. Both farms sell other products, such as eggs, chickens and beef.\n\nTo order: Call either farm to reserve turkeys or reserve online. For Circle C Farm call 776-9054, visit circlecfarmfl.com or stop by the farm store at 9294 Strike Lane, Bonita Springs. To order turkeys from Waymore Farms, call 863-517-9559 or visit waymorefarms.com.\n\nHERITAGE PORK\n\nIt's not always about the turkey.\n\nAt Rosy Tomorrows Heritage Farm in North Fort Myers, the organically raised and pastured 100 percent Red Wattle pigs are in higher demand than previous seasons. Ham and other cuts of the humanely raised and harvested pork are available year-round. This holiday season, owner Rose O'Dell King and her staff are offering a few special items, starting with whole-roasted hogs.\n\n\"We are doing a lot of whole pigs,\" O'Dell King said. \"People seem to be wanting a memorable and special culinary event but are saying it doesn't need to be turkey.\"\n\nFor the love of lard, Rosy Tomorrows gives pig fat a good name\n\nThe hogs range from 25 to 45 pounds and can be taken home and roasted or, for those nervous about the process, O'Dell King and her staff will roast the hog for you. \"It just takes the guess work out,\" she said.\n\nThis is the first year O'Dell King has offered a crown roast of pork. \"Crown roast is a really spectacular centerpiece presentation,\" she explained. \"When you cook it and bring it out, it has that same wow factor as a turkey.\"\n\nExtras: Rosy Tomorrows Heritage Farm also offers two different seasonings for their pork: Hundred Acres citrus with Walker Farms saw palmetto honey, and a traditional mojo with garlic and lime. They are also selling rice and black-bean stuffing and a sausage-apple stuffing to accompany the pork.\n\nTo order: Whole hogs and half hogs can be ordered online at rosy-tomorrows.com. For Thanksgiving, orders must be placed by Monday. For all other cuts and more information, call 567-6000.\n\nCALABAZA SQUASH\n\nWe may not have piles of pumpkins and gourds growing in Southwest Florida, but we do have calabaza squash.\n\nMichael Wallace of Pine Island Botanicals grows a tropical variety of calabaza year-round. He sells the buttery yellow squash blossoms at local farmers markets and regular customers know to keep their eyes out for the large, long-necked green and yellow squash, which can weigh close to 10 pounds.\n\nA cousin of butternut squash, calabazas can be roasted, mashed, baked into casseroles, stir-fried or blended into a creamy soup.\n\nCaution: Handling the raw calabaza can cause allergic contact dermatitis for some. Once the thick skin is removed, touching the flesh with un-gloved hands can cause itching, peeling and blistered skin in those sensitive to it.\n\nExtras: Pine Island Botanicals shares booth space (and growing space) with The Sprout Queen. Sprouts, shoots and hydroponically-grown lettuces are available as well as tropical fruits such as star fruit.\n\nWhere to buy: Find Pine Island Botanicals at one of these local farmers markets: Surfside Sunset Farmers Market, Tuesdays 2-7 p.m., 2366 Surfside Blvd., Cape Coral; Fort Myers River District Farmers Market, Thursdays 7 a.m.-1 p.m., Centennial Park, 2000 W. First St., downtown Fort Myers; Sanibel Island Farmers Market, Sundays 8 a.m.-1 p.m., 800 Dunlop Road, Sanibel.\n\nCOLLARD GREENS\n\nStop by Brittain Produce stand at the State Farmers Market in Fort Myers and they've got a cooler full of mustard, turnip and collard greens. It's where Farmers Market Restaurant co-owner Betsy Barnwell shops for fresh greens each day.\n\nWhen she took over the restaurant two years ago, she made the switch from frozen greens to fresh. The recipe is simple, and one that cook Bertha Smith knows by heart: collard greens, salt and pepper, fat back and water.\n\n\"And a little bit of love,\" Smith added.\n\nBarnwell has a strong local focus when it comes to ingredients for the restaurant.\n\n\"You know what you're getting and where it's coming from,\" she explained. \"And you get to support the community. I like to buy from people around here and support small local businesses because I'm a small local business.\"\n\nExtras: If you don't plan to cook on Thanksgiving, you can still stop in for Thanksgiving dinner at Farmer's Market Restaurant at 2736 Edison Ave. next to the market, and have some of Smith's collard greens. Call 334-1637 for hours, details or to reserve some of their famous pies.\n\nWhere to buy: Brittain Produce, 2744 Edison Ave. suite 1, Fort Myers.\n\nPerfect time for pie: bakers ready for pie season\n\nEGGPLANT\n\nIf your guests are gluten-free, or you're just looking for a side dish that feels like comfort food, Chef Kristina San Filippo of Purple Spoon in Bonita Springs suggests roasting eggplant for an easy side dish.\n\nOn Wednesdays, she hosts a farmers market at her culinary hub, where she teaches classes, hosts events and sells pantry essentials. Inyoni Organic Farm is currently bringing eggplant to market and last week San Filippo created an easy and hearty side dish.\n\nFarm to Fork: Eggplant confit recipe\n\n\"It's very seasonal,\" she explained. Her instructions are to cut an eggplant into a small dice, toss with grape-seed oil and kosher salt and roast in a pan at 400 degrees for 6 to 7 minutes. \"The last thing you want to do is overcook eggplant.\" She then cooks a mixture of wild rice and brown basmati rice, places the rice in a bowl and mixes in the roasted eggplants with dried cranberries, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt.\n\nSan Filippo sells the rice at Purple Spoon.\n\nWhere to buy: A farmers market is held each Wednesday from 3-6 p.m. at Purple Spoon, 25151 Chamber of Commerce Drive, Bonita Springs. The market will be open the day before Thanksgiving; call 908-3842 for more information.\n\nGRAPEFRUIT\n\nThe first citrus fruits of the season are luring in locals and snowbirds at Sun Harvest Citrus in south Fort Myers.\n\nEasy-to-peel navel oranges and ruby red grapefruit are up first, and while grapefruit may not seem like a traditional Thanksgiving dessert, citrus pies and cakes can give your holiday table a Florida twist.\n\nFlavors of Paradise: Grapefruit cake from early 1980s\n\nGrapefruit halves can be topped with brown sugar and broiled quickly for an easy dessert, juiced and mixed with vodka for a cocktail, or mixed with strawberry gelatin for this chilled pie from floridacitrus.org.\n\nGrapefruit pie\n\nIngredients\n\n2 large or 3 medium Florida red grapefruit, peeled and sectioned\n\n1 6 ounce graham cracker crust\n\n1 cup sugar\n\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n\n1 1/2 cups water\n\n1 3 ounce package strawberry-flavored gelatin\n\n1 8 ounce container frozen non-dairy whipped topping, thawed\n\nSteps\n\nArrange grapefruit sections in the bottom of the graham cracker crust; set aside.

That’s why this idea for Thanksgiving place cards is so heartwarming.\n\nAlabama-based designer and marketing executive Jenny Dean Hester says she sent invitations to everyone invited to Thanksgiving dinner, along with the guest list. Next to each name was a space to write why they were thankful for that person. Once she received the completed lists, she created the place cards.\n\n“Thanksgiving Day arrived and each guest walked around the tables looking for their seat, pleasantly surprised to find a card at their place, their name at the top, followed by all the reasons people were thankful for them, left anonymous,” Hester, who lives in Alabama, says. “My father-in-law passed away a few years later, and we found his Thanksgiving place card in his Bible.”\n\nMORE: 20 terrific Thanksgiving & autumnal centerpieces\n\nPie Night\n\nSalt Lake City writer Dan Pearce, of the popular Single Dad Laughing blog, says his family has an amazing Thanksgiving tradition called “Pie Night.”\n\nThe Monday before Thanksgiving, he and his family get together and everyone brings a few pies. They sit them on the countertop and dig in. This tradition, which was started 15 years ago by his Aunt Glynis, came about because they were too full on Thanksgiving to truly enjoy their pies. Hence, Pie Night.\n\n“Pie Night is by far my favorite Thanksgiving tradition. It gets so many of us up and going in the kitchen since we don’t want to show up with a boring armful of store-bought pies,” Pearce says. “The entire countertop is loaded with everyone’s homemade creations, and you can always tell who was lazy this year and who wasn’t. The store-bought pies never receive as much love. Rightfully.”\n\nHis favorite pie? “My son and I make a killer strawberry chocolate pie most years, and we never come home with pie left in the tins,” he says.\n\nRECIPE:A practically perfect pecan pie\n\nRECIPE: Pumpkin pie with harvest-spiced cream & caramelized almonds\n\nOrder Thanksgiving takeout\n\nThis Thanksgiving tradition is one you will want to adopt immediately – or at least try out one year.\n\n“We order Thanksgiving takeout from high-end golf resort restaurants.

Then, we open the previous year’s card and each read it aloud. We’ve been doing this for about 10 years now. It’s a fun and nostalgic way to look back at what we were thankful for. Our pile of letters, like our family, is growing larger and larger.

They also put together their own food and essentials bags and hand them out to those in need.\n\n“Our temple does a lot for the homeless community, and I’ve always had an interest in it separately as well. We feel that it allows the kids to see outside of the bubble in which they live,” Heymann says, adding that this activity is not only a great family bonding activity, but it also fosters good conversation with her kids.\n\n“It shows them different ways of life and helps explain why we need to be thankful for what we have.

Kamala Harris. The presidential candidate needed a place to celebrate with her family between campaign stops.\n\nHeggen didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Where else but in Iowa do you have an opportunity like this?\" she said.\n\nMembers of Harris' campaign team toured the house soon after her real estate agent's call, focusing on the kitchen.

For the kitchen, where the stakes would not be so high, Heggen created her own arrangement.\n\nOn Wednesday night, while Harris and her family were out on the town, campaign staff gave Heggen the green light to sneak back into her house. She left her special strawberry pretzel Jell-O salad in the fridge for the senator.\n\n\"It's a great year to be involved in politics and the campaign,\" Heggen said. \"How can you not care about what's happening right now? I'll contribute in any small way that I can.\"\n\nAn untapped Iowa tradition\n\nWhile the history of the first-in-the-nation caucuses is filled with small-town, \"only in Iowa\" moments, Thanksgiving is a relatively untrodden territory. Candidates hold events the weekends before and after the holiday, but rarely do they carve their turkeys here.\n\nIn the last two decades, according to Register archives, the rare exceptions occurred in 2007, when Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Chris Dodd celebrated the holiday in Des Moines.\n\nBut this year, Harris and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota both brought their family here for the holiday, hosting dinners 1½ miles from each other. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, meanwhile, campaigned here Wednesday before flying home. (He made sure to point out that he would be eating the family's cornbread stuffing, a recipe passed down from his grandmother, who grew up in Des Moines.)\n\nHarris' and Klobuchar's families spent Wednesday night together at a Des Moines hotel lounge.\n\n\"We had fun,\" Klobuchar said. \"We got to know each other — Kamala, Cory and I got pretty close during the [Supreme Court Justice Brett] Kavanaugh hearing, being on the front line together.”\n\nKlobuchar, who campaigned throughout Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday, served and packaged meals at the South Des Moines Community Center on Thanksgiving morning. She then ate with about 45 staffers at the South of Grand home of Dr. Andy McGuire, her local campaign chair.\n\nKlobuchar brought a sweet potato casserole that has served as a Thanksgiving staple in her family for about 20 years. In McGuire's kitchen, she pulled out Tupperware with the dish's toppings: coconut, pecans and corn flakes.\n\n\"Of course, there is a lot of butter,\" she said. \"But I won't say how much.\"\n\nUsually, Klobuchar starts Thanksgivings at the United Way's Walk to End Hunger at Mall of America. She then attends a brunch at a neighbor's house before eating dinner with her in-laws.\n\nShe and her husband, John, called his parents on Thursday morning, apologizing for the missed holiday. They also compromised with them this year, offering to spend quality time on another important date.\n\n“They get it,\" she said. \"They’re excited about Christmas, so it’s all good. Those words were mentioned.”\n\nAll in on Iowa is all the time\n\nHarris' husband, Doug Emhoff, said the idea of celebrating Thanksgiving in Des Moines first came up at the end of September, when the senator's staff refocused efforts on Iowa. She asked him how he would feel about leaving California for the Midwest.\n\n\"If we're in, we're in,\" Emhoff said he told her. \"I'm totally behind you.\"\n\nHarris carried sweet potatoes and collard greens on her flight here from South Carolina on Monday night. She and Emhoff then bought arugula and seasoning salt at a local Whole Foods on Tuesday before touring the Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Families.\n\nLater, she called campaign staffers her office on Ingersoll Avenue.\n\n\"I know it's a great sacrifice,\" Harris told them. \"I know many of you will not be home for Thanksgiving. I know that Thanksgiving is one of those holidays where you really like to be around your family and the people you have grown up with. So many of you have longstanding traditions around Thanksgiving, but you're spending it here in Iowa.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris held a house party for teachers in Waukee, knocked on the doors of registered Democrats and conversed with reporters in her new kitchen.\n\n\"Bacon is a spice,\" she said, while explaining how she planned to make collards this year.\n\n\"Bacon is a spice,\" Emhoff repeated in the back, whispering to staffers. \"That could be our new campaign slogan. 'For the people. Bacon is a spice.'\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, Harris attended the Turkey Trot downtown while her brother-in-law, Tony West, ran the 5K. They then met with residents at Corinthian Gardens, the apartments off University Avenue where Harris campaigned for then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama before the 2008 caucuses.\n\nHer sister, Maya Harris, explained that she and Kamala traditionally split cooking duties. Kamala handles the turkey and gravy; Maya takes care of the stuffing and macaroni and cheese. The two typically split responsibility for greens and sweet potatoes.\n\nThis year, though, Maya is on crutches with a broken foot. She's leaving all the work to the senator.\n\n\"She's an excellent cook,\" Maya said. \"So I'm not unhappy.\"\n\nEmhoff said he doesn't feel guilty about putting so much Thanksgiving responsibility on his wife. Cooking is soothing for her, a trait passed down from her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan.\n\nKamala typically plans the big meal three or four weeks in advance. She scrolls through cooking apps, her mother's old recipes, \"The Art of Cooking,\" \"The Joy of Cooking\" and books by Alice Waters and Marcella Hazan.\n\nThis year's menu includes dry-brined turkey, Honey Baked ham, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, cornbread stuffing, greens with bacon, cranberry sauce, arugula salad, Hawaii rolls and dinner rolls. (She also received a cranberry pecan pie from Susan Gauthier, the mother of her campaign's digital content director and winner of the 2019 Minnesota State Fair pie contest in the \"creative apple\" category.)\n\n\"It was something that was passed on,\" Emhoff said of his wife's passion. \"It's creative. It makes people happy, and she likes to make people happy. It's planning. It's researching. It's a lot of the things she loves to do. And she can put music on. It's a whole process that she just enjoys. And she's good at it.\"\n\nMaya and Kamala usually cook through the afternoon. The family eats around 5 p.m. and ends the evening over games of cards. The Harrises, Emhoff and West have a running game of hearts. West keeps a sheet of paper on him, with the most up-to-date score.\n\nAsked who is currently in the lead Wednesday, he couldn't recall.\n\n\"They're keeping the game running because I won the last time we were playing,\" Maya said. \"It's a running game until someone else gets to win.\"\n\nThe tradition pre-dates Emhoff, who married Kamala in 2014.\n\n\"They're so ruthless and competitive that they didn't really teach me how to play,\" he said. \"And I still had to play and get in there. I learned how to play on my own just to learn how to compete with this very competitive family. There's no lead-in.\"\n\nStaff writer Katie Akin contributed to this report.\n\nTyler Jett covers jobs and the economy for the Register. Contact him at 515-284-8215 and tjett@registermedia.com.

How much less?\n\nWhich items are dropping in price? Are any rising?\n\nThe Farm Bureau said four of the items surveyed dropped in price this year — the turkey, stuffing, fresh cranberries and dinner rolls. Five items — sweet potatoes, frozen green peas, a vegetable tray of carrots and celery, whole milk and whipping cream — rose in price, but not enough to offset the decreases.\n\nWhy are prices falling?\n\nWhile the wholesale price for fresh turkey is up from 2024 as poultry producers fight highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu, prices for frozen turkeys continue to fall, with declining overall demand, the Farm Bureau said. Grocery stores are featuring Thanksgiving deals, attempting to draw consumer demand back to turkey, leading to lower retail prices for holiday birds, it said.\n\nThe Thanksgiving centerpiece — the 16-pound turkey — decreased 16% in price, which helped bring down the overall cost of dinner, the group said. The average price for the frozen turkey is $21.50, or a fraction more than $1.34 per pound, the group said.\n\n“It’s encouraging to see some relief in the price of turkeys, as it is typically the most expensive part of the meal,” Faith Parum, a Farm Bureau economist, said in a statement.\n\n“Farmers are still working to rebuild turkey flocks that were devastated by avian influenza, but overall demand has also fallen,\" she said, with the average American consuming only 13 pounds of turkey per year, nearly 3 pounds less than six years ago.\n\n\"The combination will help ensure turkey will remain an affordable option for families celebrating Thanksgiving,” she said.\n\nThis year, turkey only accounts for 39% of the cost of a meal, the lowest share since 2000, the group said. Over the span of the group’s Thanksgiving survey, turkey has accounted for an average of 43% of the total dinner cost.\n\nWhy are some prices rising?\n\nThough overall Thanksgiving meal costs are down this year, side dishes are up in terms of the share of the total basket, the group said. Price increases for fresh produce and key baking ingredients reflect higher costs throughout the supply chain.\n\nFor example, a veggie tray is up more than 61% and sweet potatoes are up 37%, the group said.\n\nFruit and vegetable producers rely heavily on manual labor for planting, harvesting, grading and packing, with labor expenses making up nearly half of total production expenses for these industries, the Farm Bureau said. Persistent labor shortages and higher wage requirements have increased production expenses for growers, and these higher on-farm costs eventually factor into grocery store prices.\n\nThe Trump administration's immigration crackdown, leading to “the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens,” is threatening “the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S. consumers,” according to a U.S. Department of Labor report the Washington Post cited in October.\n\nNatural disasters also contributed to higher costs. North Carolina, which produces more than half of the nation’s sweet potatoes, experienced hurricane damage that reduced yields and tightened supplies ahead of the holiday, the group said.\n\nThe Farm Bureau said it's important to note that items like fresh vegetables and potatoes typically start from a low price point, so even small increases in per-pound or per-unit costs can generate large year-to-year percentage changes.\n\nCosts are flat for families who like to add ham to traditional meal\n\nThe cost of the updated Thanksgiving dinner, which includes ham, Russet potatoes and frozen green beans, increased the overall meal cost by $21.91, to $77.09.\n\nThe cost of the expanded dinner is only 28 cents lower than 2024, with increases in all three additional ingredients. They were added to the survey in 2018 to reflect the wider variety of Thanksgiving favorites, the group said.\n\nWhat are the regional differences in costs?\n\nRegional price differences are notable, with the highest prices in America's West. The classic Thanksgiving dinner for a party of 10 there costs $61.75, the most for any region and about 12% more than the national average.\n\nFamilies in the Northeast will also pay more than the national average, with their classic meal coming in at $60.82. The South has the most affordable holiday meal at $50.01, followed by the Midwest at $54.38.\n\nA similar pattern emerges when looking at the expanded Thanksgiving basket: For the Northeast and the West it jumped in cost, at $82.97 and $84.97, respectively. The South once again has the lowest total at $71.20, followed by the Midwest at $76.33.\n\nHow does the Farm Bureau conduct the survey?\n\nFor one week leading up to Thanksgiving each year, volunteer shoppers from all 50 states and Puerto Rico visit their local grocery store — or local store’s website — to survey the prices of items used in a classic Thanksgiving feast.\n\nSince 1986, these volunteers have reported their local prices for turkey, cubed stuffing, sweet potatoes, dinner rolls, frozen peas, fresh cranberries, celery, carrots, pumpkin pie mix and crusts, whipping cream and whole milk.\n\n\"While many families put their own spin on this traditional dinner, the survey captures many key ingredients in American homes this holiday season,\" Farm Bureau said.\n\nWhat are the individual prices\n\n16-pound turkey: $21.50 or $1.34 per pound (down 16.3%).\n\n14-ounces of cubed stuffing mix: $3.71 (down 9%).\n\n2 frozen pie crusts: $3.37 (down 0.8%).\n\nHalf pint of whipping cream: $1.87 (up 3.2%).\n\n1 pound of frozen peas: $2.03 (up 17.2%).\n\n1 dozen dinner rolls: $3.56 (down 14.6%).\n\nMiscellaneous other ingredients to prepare the meal: $3.61 (down 4.7%).\n\n30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix: $4.16 (up 0.1%).\n\n1 gallon of whole milk: $3.73 (up 16.3%).\n\n3 pounds of sweet potatoes: $4 (up 37%).\n\n1-pound veggie tray (carrots & celery): $1.36 (up 61.3%).\n\n12-ounce bag of fresh cranberries: $2.28 (down 2.8%).\n\nWhat do other surveys say?\n\nThe Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute's annual report shows a meal for 10, with turkey, sides like vegetables, cranberries, stuffing and rolls, pumpkin pie and beverages from national name-brand providers will cost $95, while an all private-label or store-brand menu will cost $80. Depending on a shopper's strategy, the price is about 2% to 3% below that of a year ago, the company said.\n\nRetail giant Walmart said last month that customers could procure a Thanksgiving meal for 10 for less than $40, with about 20 national and private brand items, including a Butterball turkey at 97 cents per pound, its lowest price since 2019. The Arkansas-based company said this year's meal, with some different ingredients in than 2024, cost 25% less than last year's.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pointed to Walmart's lower-cost holiday meal as evidence that Republican efforts to lower food costs are working. But last year's holiday basket included more items, like a pecan pie, whipped cream, cornbread mix and ingredients to make dressing. This year's basket has twin packets of Stove Top stuffing and new products like baby carrots and boxed artisan macaroni and cheese.\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation released an analysis Monday showing the ag downturn will ripple through the state's economy, costing up to 11,400 jobs and reducing output by $1.5 billion.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation has provided data on the cost of the holiday meal since 1986, working with volunteer shoppers from all 50 states and Puerto Rico who visit their local grocery stores or the stores' websites to survey the prices of items in a classic Thanksgiving feast. This year’s survey was conducted Nov. 1-7.\n\nIn 2018, the farm bureau began also calculating the price of a meal that included the ham, russet potatoes and frozen green beans.\n\nWhat does Thanksgiving dinner cost in 2024?\n\nHere's a breakdown of Thanksgiving prices:\n\n16-pound turkey — $25.67 (down 6.1%).\n\n14-ounces of cubed stuffing mix — $4.08 (up 8.2%).\n\n2 frozen pie crusts — $3.40 (down 2.9%).\n\nHalf pint of whipping cream — $1.81 (up 4.7%).\n\n1 pound of frozen peas — $1.73 (down 8.1%).\n\n1 dozen dinner rolls — $4.16 (up 8.4%).\n\n30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix — $4.15 (down 6.5%).\n\n1 gallon of whole milk — $3.21 (down 14.3%).\n\n3 pounds of sweet potatoes — $2.93 (down 26.2%).\n\n1-pound veggie tray (carrots and celery) — 84 cents (down 6.4%).\n\n12-ounce bag of fresh cranberries — $2.35 (up 11.8%).\n\nMiscellaneous ingredients — $3.75 (down 5.1%).\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

Though not declared an official national holiday until 1941, Thanksgiving as we know it was born from the autumn harvest feast early colonists shared with Wampanoag Indians in 1621 in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\nThe customary Thanksgiving dinner of today is an adaptation of what was served in colonial Massachusetts nearly 400 years ago. Historians speculate the original meal included familiar items like beans, carrots, peas, onions, cranberries, and some form of fowl – turkey or otherwise. Unlike today, shellfish, venison, blueberries, and raspberries were also likely served, while potatoes, stuffing, and pumpkin pie were notably absent from the menu.\n\nThe bounty of food served at the first Thanksgiving represented a feat of survival: a triumph of hunting, farming, and cooperation over an unforgiving wilderness in an unfamiliar world.\n\nToday, the full feast can be secured with a short trip to the grocery store and less than $50.\n\nFor decades, the American Farm Bureau Federation has tracked the cost of a traditional Thanksgiving meal for a group of 10. The calculation includes the cost of a 16-pound turkey, stuffing, potatoes, dinner rolls, cranberries, and of course, pumpkin pie.\n\nLike everything else, the costs of these items are subject to the laws of supply and demand and do not remain constant. Accounting for inflation, the total cost of a Thanksgiving dinner has fluctuated by as much as 35% since 1947.\n\nThis year, the average cost of a traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10 is $48.90.\n\nThis is the cost of a Thanksgiving meal the year you were born.\n\nYear Total meal cost: Inflation adjusted cost: 1947 $5.68 $48.16 1948 $5.81 $46.59 1949 $5.62 $45.43 1950 $5.91 $47.25 1951 $6.48 $48.49 1952 $6.52 $47.82 1953 $6.31 $45.68 1954 $6.23 $44.69 1955 $6.13 $43.77 1956 $6.31 $44.24 1957 $6.46 $43.94 1958 $6.67 $44.32 1959 $6.52 $42.70 1960 $6.71 $43.24 1961 $6.61 $42.12 1962 $6.76 $42.56 1963 $6.82 $42.45 1964 $6.92 $42.49 1965 $7.09 $42.91 1966 $7.43 $43.84 1967 $7.39 $42.52 1968 $7.68 $42.55 1969 $8.15 $43.17 1970 $8.36 $42.31 1971 $8.63 $41.91 1972 $9.13 $42.90 1973 $11.09 $49.43 1974 $12.44 $50.21 1975 $13.30 $49.56 1976 $13.22 $46.69 1977 $14.27 $47.32 1978 $15.98 $49.53 1979 $17.45 $49.69 1980 $19.39 $49.83 1981 $20.04 $47.28 1982 $20.59 $46.01 1983 $20.82 $44.63 1984 $21.62 $44.66 1985 $21.93 $43.78 1986 $28.74 $56.15 1987 $24.51 $46.46 1988 $26.61 $48.54 1989 $24.70 $43.17 1990 $28.85 $48.30 1991 $25.95 $42.04 1992 $26.39 $41.64 1993 $27.49 $42.33 1994 $28.40 $42.83 1995 $29.64 $43.78 1996 $31.66 $45.79 1997 $31.75 $45.13 1998 $33.09 $46.67 1999 $33.83 $47.01 2000 $32.37 $43.89 2001 $35.04 $46.61 2002 $34.56 $45.38 2003 $36.28 $46.73 2004 $35.68 $44.84 2005 $36.78 $44.94 2006 $38.10 $45.32 2007 $42.26 $49.02 2008 $44.61 $50.24 2009 $42.91 $48.37 2010 $43.47 $48.18 2011 $49.20 $53.18 2012 $49.48 $52.48 2013 $49.04 $51.33 2014 $49.41 $50.95 2015 $50.11 $51.54 2016 $49.87 $50.75 2017 $49.12 $49.12 2018 $48.90 $48.90\n\nTo determine the cost of a Thanksgiving meal every year from 1947 to 2018, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed price data from the American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual Thanksgiving price survey. The survey collects data on the prices of items consumed in a traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10. The data is gathered by a team of volunteer shoppers around the country, and the survey first started in 1986.\n\nThe AFBF found every year that the change in the cost of the Thanksgiving meal tracks closely with the changing price of food at home as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For years prior to 1986, 24/7 Wall St. adjusted the cost of a Thanksgiving meal and its individual components using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index for food at home in November from 1947 to 1985.\n\nFor the purposes of this story, the components of a traditional Thanksgiving meal include a 16-pound turkey, 14 oz. of stuffing, 3 pounds of sweet potatoes, a dozen dinner rolls, 16 oz. of frozen peas, 12 oz. of cranberries, a half pound of both carrots and celery, ingredients for two pumpkin pies with whipped cream, and a gallon of milk.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

That’s 5% less than last year, the organization said.\n\nIt’s the third straight year of declines since the record-high cost of $64.05 in 2022, said the farmers and ranchers lobbying group.

The average price for a 16-pound frozen turkey is $21.50, down more than 16% from 2024. The wholesale price for fresh turkey is actually up from 2024, but grocery stores are using lower retail prices to lure customers.\n\nThe costs of some other items, such as fresh vegetables and sweet potatoes, increased due to higher costs of labor and worker shortages, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Sweet potatoes are up 37%. A veggie tray will cost 61% more this year than in 2024.\n\nNeed a news break?

Turkey wholesale prices are up at least 40% since last year, Hadachek said. Some estimates report prices have climbed as much as 75%. This dramatic increase is primarily due to this spring’s major bird flu epidemic, which lowered supply drastically and increased costs for poultry farmers. Bird flu continues to affect fowl production throughout the country, Hadachek said.\n\nIf the change seen in wholesale prices “ends up manifesting itself at the retail level, that will make a pretty big difference in prices because turkey is the big share of that Thanksgiving basket,” Hadachek said.\n\nSo, how do this year’s Thanksgiving dinner prices in Missouri compare to last year’s? Here’s what USA TODAY found.\n\nHow much could Thanksgiving dinner cost in Missouri in 2025?\n\nSpringfield News-Leader health and public policy reporter Susan Szuch visited four grocery stores in Springfield: Aldi (2847 E. Sunshine St.), Price Cutter (3260 E. Battlefield Road), Walmart (3520 W. Sunshine St.) and Hy-Vee (2150 E. Sunshine St.). At each store, she found the Thanksgiving dinner staples below and then averaged their prices across the four stores. Here are her results:\n\n16-pound turkey: $17.28\n\n$17.28 Cranberries (12 ounces): $2.10\n\n$2.10 Sweet potatoes (3 pounds): $2.96\n\n$2.96 Carrots and celery (0.5 pounds of each): $1.37\n\n$1.37 Green peas (16 ounces): $1.70\n\n$1.70 9” pie crusts (2): $2.75\n\n$2.75 Cube stuffing (14 ounces): $3.39\n\n$3.39 Dinner rolls (1 dozen): $2.03\n\n$2.03 Pumpkin pie mix (30 ounces): $4.23\n\n$4.23 Whole milk (1 gallon): $4.03\n\n$4.03 Whipping cream (0.5 pints): $1.91\n\n$1.91 TOTAL: $43.75\n\nHow much was Thanksgiving dinner in 2024?\n\nAccording to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s 2024 annual Thanksgiving dinner survey, a traditional Thanksgiving dinner in the Midwest cost $58.90. The Farm Bureau calculates its numbers by having at least five volunteers in each state go shopping for a prescribed list of non-organic items. Midwest-based Farm Bureau volunteers found the following prices for Thanksgiving staples last year:\n\n16-pound turkey: $24.86 (+$7.58 from Missouri this year)\n\n$24.86 (+$7.58 from Missouri this year) Cranberries (12 ounces): $2.44 (+$0.34)\n\n$2.44 (+$0.34) Sweet potatoes (3 pounds): $4.03 (+$1.07)\n\n$4.03 (+$1.07) Carrots and celery (0.5 pounds of each): $0.93 (-$0.44)\n\n$0.93 (-$0.44) Green peas (16 ounces): $1.83 (+$0.13)\n\n$1.83 (+$0.13) 9” pie crusts (2): $3.71 (+$0.96)\n\n$3.71 (+$0.96) Cube stuffing (14 ounces): $3.72 (+$0.33)\n\n$3.72 (+$0.33) Dinner rolls (1 dozen): $3.71 (+$1.68)\n\n$3.71 (+$1.68) Pumpkin pie mix (30 ounces): $4.18 (-$0.05)\n\n$4.18 (-$0.05) Whole milk (1 gallon): $3.72 (-$0.31)\n\n$3.72 (-$0.31) Whipping cream (0.5 pints): $2.02 (+$0.11)\n\n$2.02 (+$0.11) Miscellaneous ingredients: $3.75\n\n$3.75 TOTAL: $58.90 (+$15.16)\n\nWhat were the Farm Bureau’s numbers for 2025?\n\nThe Farm Bureau released its 2025 report on Wednesday, revealing a “moderate decline” in Thanksgiving staple prices since last year. Farm Bureau volunteers found that the average price of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S. was $55.18, down 5% from last year. In the Midwest, that number was $54.38.\n\nHere are the nationwide average prices found by this year’s Farm Bureau volunteers:\n\n16-pound turkey: $21.50 (down 16.3% from last year’s nationwide average)\n\n$21.50 (down 16.3% from last year’s nationwide average) Cranberries (12 ounces): $2.28 (down 2.8%)\n\n$2.28 (down 2.8%) Sweet potatoes (3 pounds): $4.00 (up 37%)\n\n$4.00 (up 37%) Carrots and celery (0.5 pounds of each): $1.36 (up 61.3%)\n\n$1.36 (up 61.3%) Green peas (16 ounces): $2.03 (up 17.2%)\n\n$2.03 (up 17.2%) 9” pie crusts (2): $3.37 (down 0.8%)\n\n$3.37 (down 0.8%) Cube stuffing (14 ounces): $3.71 (down 9%)\n\n$3.71 (down 9%) Dinner rolls (1 dozen): $3.56 (down 14.6%)\n\n$3.56 (down 14.6%) Pumpkin pie mix (30 ounces): $4.16 (up 0.1%)\n\n$4.16 (up 0.1%) Whole milk (1 gallon): $3.73 (up 16.3%)\n\n$3.73 (up 16.3%) Whipping cream (0.5 pints): $1.87 (up 3.2%)\n\n$1.87 (up 3.2%) Miscellaneous ingredients: $3.61 (down 4.7%)\n\n$3.61 (down 4.7%) TOTAL: $55.18\n\nWhy could Thanksgiving dinner be more expensive in 2025?\n\nAs Hadachek mentioned, bird flu is the biggest factor impacting turkey prices. “This is the lowest turkey supply anticipated in like 40 years, so less supply is going to mean higher prices,” he explained. “But beyond just that, because bird flu has been kind of a perennial issue now, poultry farms are incurring higher costs generally.”\n\n“Before (bird flu), biohazard and preventative measures may have been optional, but they’re not really optional anymore. It’s a regular cost of doing business that means farmers must raise prices in order to break even.”\n\nBut, while bird flu might be bad news for turkey shoppers, there’s good news surrounding the price of eggs — a staple ingredient in many Thanksgiving classics, said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. Hicks said egg prices are down since last Thanksgiving, when the bird flu epidemic was first ramping up. In September, USA TODAY reported that egg prices had plummeted 70% since March, when they reached their highest levels in 2025.\n\nTariffs are also likely to impact the price of some foods this Thanksgiving, Hicks said. “For example, if you are having a family favorite pasta imported from Italy, the price will have more than doubled because of tariffs. That will play out across a whole range of products from chestnuts and wine to cheese and fish.”\n\nThanksgiving 2025 money-saving tips", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/15/average-thanksgiving-dinner-costs-bit-less-than-last-year/2004155002/", "title": "Average Thanksgiving dinner costs a bit less than last year", "text": "The average Thanksgiving dinner won't gobble up as much money as last year.\n\nThe tally of classic Turkey Day foods – enough to feed 10 people, plus leftovers – is $48.90 on average, down 22 cents from last year’s average, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s 33rd annual survey.\n\nThe star of the Thanksgiving feast is the turkey, and the average cost this year for a 16-pounder is $21.71 or about $1.36 a pound, down from $22.38 in 2017. The Farm Bureau found that Thanksgiving retail turkey prices are the lowest since 2014.\n\n“Since 2015, the average cost of Thanksgiving dinner has declined steadily and is now at the lowest level since 2010,” said John Newton, the organization's chief economist. \"Thanks to an ample supply, turkey remains affordable for consumers, which helps keep the overall cost of the dinner reasonably priced as well.\"\n\nOther foods in the feast survey are:\n\nStuffing: 14-ounce package, $2.87 (up from $2.81 in 2017)\n\n14-ounce package, $2.87 (up from $2.81 in 2017) Sweet potatoes: 3-pound bag, $3.39 (down from $3.52)\n\n3-pound bag, $3.39 (down from $3.52) Rolls: A dozen, $2.25 (down from $2.26)\n\nA dozen, $2.25 (down from $2.26) Green peas: 1-pound bag, $1.47 (down from $1.53)\n\n1-pound bag, $1.47 (down from $1.53) Fresh cranberries: 12-ounce bag, $2.65 (up from $2.43)\n\n12-ounce bag, $2.65 (up from $2.43) Carrot-celery tray: 1-pound, 75 cents (up from 74 cents)\n\n1-pound, 75 cents (up from 74 cents) Pumpkin pie: 30-ounce can of mix, $3.33 (up from $3.21); two 9-inch pie shells, $2.47 (up from $2.45); whipped cream, $2.08 (unchanged)\n\nMilk: 1-gallon whole fat, $2.92 (down from $2.99)\n\n1-gallon whole fat, $2.92 (down from $2.99) Coffee and ingredients needed for recipes, such as butter, evaporated milk, onions, eggs, sugar and flour: $3.01 (up from $2.72)\n\n\"Thanksgiving continues to be an affordable meal for Americans across the country at less than $5 per person for that classic meal,\" Newton said. \"Food prices have been relatively flat in the U.S. for a number of years.\"\n\nHowever, ordering a traditional Thanksgiving spread from popular food delivery services drives the average total up about 60 percent, with a 16-pound turkey at close to 50 percent more, or about $2 per pound. This is the first time the Farm Bureau examined delivery services.\n\nAlso debuting this year is the organization's exploration of the costs of some other Thanksgiving foods. Adding in a 4-pound bone-in ham, 5 pounds of Russet potatoes and a pound of frozen green beans brings the average meal tab to $61.72.\n\nThe Farm Bureau conducted its survey with 166 volunteer shoppers at grocery stores in 37 states, who were charged with finding the best prices without using coupons or promotional deals.\n\n\"After adjusting for inflation, the cost of this year’s Thanksgiving dinner is $19.37, the most affordable in more than a decade,\" the organization said.\n\nKaren Koscher Jones said she plans to spend three days cooking and at least $300 for her Thanksgiving dinner. Her Alpharetta, Georgia, table will compriseher family of four, plus eight guests.\n\nWhat makes the 53-year-old bookkeeper's shopping bill so high is most of what she buys is organic and nothing is frozen. While Jones opts for a Whole Foods bird and homemade whipped cream, gravy and fruit cup appetizers, she said she appreciates that there are foods for all price levels.\n\n\"Thanksgiving is our favorite holiday of the year,\" she said. \"It's home-based. It’s food based. It’s comforting. It's a total family tradition.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/15"}]}

But one of the biggest factors is cost.\n\nTurkeys are cheaper this year compared with last November, but data shows overall food costs are still high, especially when it comes to popular holiday side dishes.\n\n\"While inflation is not as extreme as last year, it is still present and grocery store prices have still been somewhat variable,\" Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nBut before you go thinking that this Thanksgiving may be a good year to dine out, experts also warn that restaurant menu prices have risen even more drastically.\n\nHere are some things to consider when choosing to cook at home or go out this Thanksgiving.\n\nWhy is Thanksgiving so expensive? As turkey prices drop, cost of some Thanksgiving side dishes go up\n\nTurkey prices are down from last Thanksgiving\n\nRetail prices for turkeys, the holiday's main course for many Americans, have been on the decline after costs for the birds soared in 2022 amid rising inflation and a rapidly spreading avian influenza that limited production. What's more, economists predict that prices could fall even further as Thanksgiving approaches and businesses try to lure customers with special deals.\n\nPer-pound prices for turkey rose more than 20% in 2022 over the previous year, according to an annual Thanksgiving report from Wells Fargo.\n\nThe price increase was spurred in part by overall inflation, but experts say the main culprit was highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The outbreak that began in January 2022 infected 7 million turkeys and wiped out commercial livestock, depleting supplies for last year's Thanksgiving, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nOverall, average turkey prices reached as high as $1.72 a pound just as Thanksgiving approached, Nelson said. As a result, a Farm Bureau survey in 2022 found that a Thanksgiving feast for 10 cost $64.05, a 20% increase from the previous year’s average of $53.31.\n\nShare your shopping plans: How are you feeling about this holiday shopping season?\n\nTurkey production is up just in time for the holiday\n\nAs the avian flu has begun to wane this year, farmers have once again been able to ramp up production. And fortunately for shoppers, that means that turkeys will be ample, with prices falling just in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nTurkey production reached 432.3 million pounds in July − the month turkeys need to be placed on feed so they can be ready for Thanksgiving. That's a 9.7% increase over the previous year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture's September 2023 Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook.\n\nThe average retail cost of a frozen turkey hen at the end of last week was $1.35 a pound, about 8% lower than at the same time last year, according to a USDA report.\n\nBut prices could be even less closer to Nov. 23.\n\nSupermarkets are stocked with plenty of turkeys after last year's supply disruption, which means as Thanksgiving Day approaches, grocers often begin to offer promotions and discounts for the holiday staple. That includes selling turkeys at a cost lower than the wholesale price.\n\n\"Everyone who wants a turkey will be able to get one,\" a spokesperson for USDA told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nPumpkin pie or apple? A state-by-state guide to people's favorite Thanksgiving pies\n\nPrices for ingredients in classic side dishes are still up\n\nTurkeys may be available for a bargain this year, but don't expect any deals on your favorite sides. This year's Wells Fargo report found that the cost of ingredients in classic Thanksgiving side dishes have risen in the last year.\n\nThe cost of russet potatoes is at an all-time high ($1.17 a pound), with costs rising 14% from a year ago.\n\nSweet potatoes increased in price by 4% within the last year.\n\nCanned green beans are up almost 9%.\n\nCanned cranberries increased 60% and canned cranberry sauce is up 7% (though fresh cranberries will cost 20% less.)\n\nAlso rising in price are canned pumpkins, which are up 30%.\n\nAnd who can forget booze? Beer and wine are more expensive this year (up 5.3% and 1.2%, respectively).\n\nWhich grocery stores are open? What to know about Kroger, Publix, Aldi, more for Thanksgiving\n\nWhich restaurants are open? See Starbucks, McDonald's, Cracker Barrel hours for Thanksgiving\n\nDining out is more expensive this year compared with last year\n\nDespite those rising costs, the fact that Thanksgiving's main course is more affordable means that 2023 may be the year to cook at home. That's opposite of 2022, when many economists said consumers may actually have saved money by going to a restaurant.\n\nThe cost of food away from home has increased at a faster rate (about 6%) than food at home from a standard grocery trip (2.4%), Michael Swanson, agriculture economist with Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, told USA TODAY.\n\nMeanwhile, the higher wages restaurants have had to offer to get employees to return to work after the pandemic have led to increased menu prices for diners, Swanson said.\n\n\"That pampering or that convenience has gone up faster than your cost for doing it at home,\" Swanson said in a phone interview. \"It's a foot race and this year, restaurants ran a lot faster than the supermarkets.”\n\nYet because prices for common Thanksgiving side dishes increased in the last year, Swanson said consumers shouldn't expect tremendous savings if making homemade feasts.\n\n“It’s really hard to say to people, 'Hey it’s going to be cheaper to eat for Thanksgiving this year as compared to last year,” Swanson said. “The (cost of) turkey is a nice offset, but in general food is not cheaper than a year ago.”\n\nThe verdict: With turkey prices down and grocery stores pushing deals, 2023 may be the year to cook at home. But overall, food prices are still high, so those wanting to avoid the messy kitchen may opt to head out for their meal.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Here's why.", "text": "Thanksgiving turkey may be harder to find and more expensive this year thanks to the spread of the avian flu and inflation.\n\nAs food prices soar across the nation, the recent Consumer Price Index showed the cost of uncooked poultry, including turkey, rose 17% in September from the same month last year.\n\nThe average cost per pound of a whole frozen turkey this week sits at $1.46, compared to $1.15 last year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.\n\nInflation has caused turkey prices to jump as farmers are paying more for necessities such as feed, fertilizer and labor, making the cost of raising the birds higher.\n\nThe retail price for fresh boneless and skinless turkey breast reached a record high of $6.70 per pound in September, 112% higher than the same time last year, according to an American Farm Bureau Federation analysis.\n\nFree turkeys near me?: Here's how to save this Thanksgiving as prices rise\n\nHow much will Thanksgiving cost? What you can expect to pay for turkey and all the trimmings\n\nWhy is there a turkey shortage?\n\nThe impact of inflation is compounded by the avian flu, with poultry producers reporting more than 44.6 million affected birds in domestic flocks – mostly chicken and turkey– across 43 states.\n\nIowa alone, one of the top turkey-producing states, has lost more than 13 million birds to the avian flu. In Minnesota, more than 3 million birds have died.\n\n“All of us are feeling the pain of higher prices at the grocery store,” American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said in a statement. Avian flu “outbreaks in the spring and an uptick in cases in the fall are taking a toll, but farmers remain dedicated to ensuring America’s food supply remains strong.”\n\nThe number of birds affected by the avian flu this year is approaching the record set in 2015, when about 50 million birds died during the deadliest U.S. outbreak recorded, according to the USDA.\n\nBird flu and inflation: Will diners flock to plant-based meat alternatives?\n\nWorst outbreak in years: Bird flu drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans\n\n‘No concerns’ about availability\n\nWhat does this mean for your Thanksgiving table? While shoppers can expect to find higher prices, producers and analysts don’t think meat cases in grocery stores will be devoid of turkey meat.\n\n“It's been a difficult year for turkey farmers, but we do not have concerns about availability for the holiday,” said Beth Breeding, spokesperson for the National Turkey Federation.\n\nAnd it’s not just turkey. Many Thanksgiving staples, from butter to canned fruits to frozen vegetables, have seen some of the largest annual increases in prices ever.\n\nBreeding recommended home chefs shop early to secure their preferred brand or product.\n\n“Shoppers who are looking for their holiday bird will be able to most likely go to their local grocery store wherever they shop and find some sort of special discount deal,” Breeding said.\n\nFrozen food, deals and memberships: How to save money on groceries by shopping strategically", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/holiday/2022/12/08/louisville-restaurants-open-christmas-day/69683970007/", "title": "What Louisville restaurants are open Christmas Day? 16 spots to get ...", "text": "Christmas is just around the corner and while most restaurants will be closed, there are a few that will be open for those who want to dine out.

There was the Grinch (several of 'em actually), and an appearance from the big man himself, Santa Claus, who was accompanied by Mrs. Claus.\n\nUnlike the tragedy that was last year, when a red SUV driven by Darrell Brooks Jr. killed six people and injured dozens of others. Brooks faced 76 charges, including six for first-degree intentional homicide, and was found guilty of all of them at the end of October.\n\nBut an attack that devastating didn't stop groups — even the ones most severely impacted — from again taking part in this long-standing Waukesha tradition.\n\n'Entire community is not afraid'\n\nThe Catholic Community of Waukesha, candles in hand, and the Waukesha Blazers Baseball Club marched on. Both groups had multiple members among the injured, including baseball player Jackson Sparks, 8, who later died.\n\nThe beloved Milwaukee Dancing Grannies — who lost three dancers and the husband of a fourth — performed. So did the Xtreme Dance Team, whose members were among the most seriously injured.\n\nMirjam Haubert, who walked with Waukesha State Bank this year, recalled watching the 2021 parade unravel with her family. After the SUV plowed through and a young girl from the Xtreme Dance Team was laying in front of her, Haubert's motherly instincts took over.\n\n“She was seizing on the street, so I put her head in my lap,” Haubert said.\n\nHaubert sat with the girl and, with the help of a few others, kept her warm with jackets. When a police officer offered to drive the girl to the hospital, Haubert went along.\n\nAt the hospital, the girl fell into a coma. Around Thanksgiving last year, she woke up, surviving her injuries.\n\n“I don't know what I would have done if she would have not made it,” Haubert said.\n\nHaubert’s teenage daughter, who also attended last year's parade, still dislikes large crowds and decided to not attend this year's. But Haubert felt she had to come and walk with her coworkers.\n\n“I have to force myself to go through this and show that we are not afraid and the entire community is not afraid,” she said.\n\n'GRANNY STRONG!': A year after deadly parade tragedy, 'Dancing Grannies' will march again\n\nOnce again, the Dancing Grannies demonstrated their resilience\n\nA banner with the names of the members they lost, along with large individual portraits of them, led the Dancing Grannies through Sunday's parade route. Those members were Virginia \"Ginny\" Sorenson, Tamara Durand, and Leanna Owen, and the husband of a fourth, William Hospel.\n\nTime and time again over the past year, the treasured troupe — a fixture at Wisconsin parades for nearly 40 years — has demonstrated its resilience.\n\nNearly two weeks after the attack, the group marched in the Franklin Christmas Parade. They walked arm-in-arm, waving at the cheering crowds along the parade route. The names of the members who died were emblazoned on the back of their matching blue sweatshirts.\n\nTheir first performance back was in March for Milwaukee's St. Patrick's Day Parade.\n\nFor a while, member Betty Streng wasn't sure she'd be well enough to perform for St. Patrick's Day. She suffered a skull fracture and brain bleed in the attack and required emergency surgery. She has since fully recovered.\n\nIn November, Streng and her gals gave a special performance at St. Luke's in Milwaukee to honor the medical professionals who saved her life. To honor their fallen, members of the group have been wearing a No. 4 on their matching hats, including the white, fluffy ones they donned Sunday.\n\nWAUKESHA PARADE HEARING: 'I saw pure unrepentant evil': Waukesha parade attack victims share lasting pain at sentencing hearing\n\nA look at this year's parade\n\nNikki Petrie, who walked with Waukesha State Bank this year and last, said that seeing the chairs set up for the parade took her back to what she witnessed in 2021.\n\n“I remember walking back home and seeing all of the blankets, chairs, wagons — everyone just leaving everything behind,” Petrie said. Her decision to walk was made to honor those whose lives were lost.\n\n“I feel like I do, you know, owe it to the lives that were lost,” Petrie said. “I was lucky enough to walk away.”\n\nThe parade — themed \"Peace on Earth\" — began by remembering those who died in last year's tragedy and honoring first responders. A banner read: \"In remembrance of the 2021 parade victims, survivors, families and first responders.\" It was followed by a blue and white memorial float with snowflakes and the words \"In remembrance\" and \"Peace to all.\"\n\nNear the front of the parade, Waukesha Police Chief Daniel Thompson shook hands with parade watchers as Mayor Shawn Reilly waved to participants. The ReMax float, which again featured hot-air balloon flame-makers atop the bed of a pickup truck, was a welcome presence. “I wish they’d stop right here,” said one woman standing on the sidewalk as the warmth of the flames penetrated the crowd.\n\nAs the skies darkened, the parade route brightened with lights from the floats and watchers adorned with lights on the curbs. Parade-goer Kimberly Quartullo wore blue Christmas lights around her neck. Blue lights have become a symbol of strength and unity in the community.\n\nShe set up in front of Mama Ducky’s, just as she has for the past 15 years. Last year, that's where she witnessed members of the Xtreme Dance Team land in front of her. What played out before her was like “a silent movie,” she said.\n\n“Because I am deaf, I did not hear much except for a big boom,” Quartullo said. Her hearing aid helped her hear the SUV’s impact and the screams of the crowd.\n\nShe's attended every Waukesha parade since.\n\n“I came back to this one because, why not keep the community strong?” Quartullo said.\n\nMORE: Darrell Brooks sentenced to life in prison in Wisconsin Christmas parade attack that left 6 dead\n\nChanges to the parade\n\nThe first parade Waukesha held following the tragedy was for Memorial Day.\n\nFor the parade, the city debuted new MVB3X barriers, portable devices capable of disabling vehicles as large as semitrailers from sudden and unauthorized access to key points along the parade route. Public safety vehicles were also used as guards for access points necessary for parade vehicles.\n\nPolice now routinely create a perimeter that is cleared of vehicles ahead of any event. The parade also had a new route.\n\nThis year's Christmas parade was held two weeks later than it had been for nearly 60 years. That way, police and other critical staff were not fighting holiday schedules that could have made an emergency response more difficult.\n\nReflecting on the past, moving forward\n\nLast year, Znidorka, a mentor for Lad Lake, a Wisconsin youth residential care center, brought a 12-year-old boy he mentors to enjoy the parade and help him feel more comfortable in crowds.\n\n“At first, it was really fun,” Znidorka said. “It was a joyous day.”\n\nWhen the SUV came barreling through, he was in shock at first and unable to comprehend what had just happened.\n\n“Right away, the boy I was with, ran to the doors (of Burlap and Lace) and said, ‘Jerry, get in here,’” Znidorka said. “And then we were locked down in the store for 45 minutes to an hour.”\n\nThis year, Znidorka again stood in front of Burlap and Lace. This time, he was by himself. “As you can see, the boy is not with me this year,” he said. “He wanted to hold back this year.”\n\nOver the past year, Znidorka confided in mental health professionals that have helped him prepare for facing the scene of the tragedy again.\n\n“I wanted to not just get past it, but I also want to realize that sort of thing shouldn't stop us,” Znidorka said.\n\nWaukesha Girl Scouts leader Bonnie Stojadinovic had been helping out at United Church of Christ when the troupe was marching in the 2021 parade. After the attack, police sought her help, given her background as a health care provider in the ICU of Children’s Wisconsin.\n\n“They asked me to help triage patients at the scene,” Stojadinovic recalled. “After it was all said and done, I came back, but we were in lockdown in our church. So I received a police escort so that I could go home and change and go into work at the ICU to help care for the kids who were being triaged from the scene that I had taken care of here.”\n\nThis year, she set up a table outside United Church of Christ with one purpose: to call attention to canine officers who were “unsung heroes” in last year’s parade attack.\n\n“(The Girl Scouts) recognized there were so many people who were praising the nurses, paramedics, firefighters and police officers, but nobody mentioned the canine heroes who were at the parade the day of (the attack) and in the days that followed, supporting the community and supporting the kids who had been traumatized,” Stojadinovic said. “So they decided their Silver Award was going to be dedicated to these unsung heroes.”\n\nContributing: Sarah Volpenhein and Sophie Carson, Journal Sentinel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2016/11/25/make-plans-for-holiday-fun/94245928/", "title": "Make holiday plans with parades, music, lights", "text": "Donna Isbell Walker, diwalker@greenvillenews.com\n\nNow that Thanksgiving is upon us, the holiday season is sure to fly by faster than Santa’s reindeer.

What? You thought it was about family, sharing, and being thankful for the life you have? Incorrect. The truth of the matter is that football was the only reason those pilgrims and Native Americans shared that feast. They knew that nothing was more important than letting their ancestors watch Derrick Henry stiff arm Earl Thomas into oblivion.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions have kept that tradition alive by offering to play on Thanksgiving every year until the end of time. The tradition started in 1934 when the Lions played the world champion Chicago Bears in an instant classic that ended with the Bears winning 19-16. Since 1945, the Lions have not missed a single holiday (no Thanksgiving games were played from 1941-1944).\n\nThe Cowboys joined the Lions later, in 1966. They have since missed two Thanksgivings, in 1975 and 1977. While the Lions may have started this tradition, their consistently disappointing performances and failure to win a Super Bowl has forced many fans to lean in favor of the Cowboys every Turkey Day. So, who actually owns Thanksgiving? The Detroit Lions or the Dallas Cowboys?\n\nRecords on Thanksgiving\n\nWhile the Lions have played the most Thanksgiving Day games of any NFL team (89), they haven't been immune to controversy in that time. Most notably, many NFL fans wanted the Lions removed from Thanksgiving primetime in 2008. The Lions were 0-11 at the time, and were trounced by the Tennessee Titans that year 47-10. Obviously, the NFL decided to let Detroit keep their Turkey Day tradition.\n\nThe Lions have a record of 37-44-2 on Thanksgiving. Since 2000 though, the Lions are an abysmal 6-17 on Thanksgiving. Currently, the Lions have lost six straight, most recently a 28-25 loss to the Buffalo Bills in 2022.\n\nThe Cowboys on the other hand, have a record of 32-22-1 on Thanksgiving. While they have lost three of their last four Thanksgiving Day contests, they've proven much more capable of living up to the Turkey Day privilege than Detroit in recent years.\n\nDallas Cowboys Thanksgiving Record: 32-22-1\n\n32-22-1 Cowboys Record in Last 5 Thanksgivings: 2-3\n\n2-3 Detroit Lions Thanksgiving Record: 37-44-2\n\n37-44-2 Lions Record in Last 5 Thanksgivings: 0-5\n\nThat could change this season though. The Lions currently hold the second-best record in the NFL and their matchup is against the Green Bay Packers, a team they've already beaten this year. The Cowboys get a matchup against divisional adversary, the Washington Commanders. The Commanders dominated the Cowboys on Thanksgiving in 2020 to the tune of a 41-16 beatdown led by halfback Antonio Gibson. That said, things have changed since then. The Cowboys are much improved, while the Commanders just lost to the woeful New York Giants.\n\nWhich team gets more viewers:\n\nThanksgiving Day games are often some of the most-watched NFL games every season. Last year was no different. In fact, the 2022 game between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants set an NFL regular season viewership record with 42.1 million viewers tuning in, beating out the previous NFL record-holder, a 1990 matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants. It goes without saying that it was also the most viewed Thanksgiving Day game of all-time, beating out the Cowboys 2021 game against the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nFor comparison, the 2022 Lions-Bills Thanksgiving Day game earned 31.78 million viewers. That's still a lot. In fact, it was the most-watched early Thanksgiving Day game of all-time.\n\nWith that in mind, there's an argument to be made that the Lions would have earned more viewers if they were given the afternoon or evening time slot. At the same time though, the NFL knows which games will garner the most viewers and tend to flex the best in the best time slots. If the Lions would draw more viewers, they likely would have been given the afternoon slot.\n\nWith all that said, it's pretty easy to tell which team gets more viewers. The Cowboys are \"America's Team\" after all, while the Lions had many fans begging the NFL to remove them from the Thanksgiving slot because of how bad they had been for most of the 2000's.\n\nThanksgiving Day Odds:\n\nThe Lions and Cowboys are favorites to defeat the Packers and Commanders, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

The Lions have already beaten the Packers handedly this season, 38-20. Now get to face them at home. The Packers will likely be without both star running back Aaron Jones and star cornerback Jaire Alexander as well.\n\nAs bad as the Lions have been on Thanksgiving, the Packers haven't been much better, boasting just a 14-20-2 record all-time. Give me the Lions (-7.5) all day.\n\nPrediction: Lions 29, Packers 16\n\nWashington Commanders @ Dallas Cowboys:\n\nThe Commanders are one of the toughest teams to predict in all of football. Their 4-7 record would have you thinking they're a middle-of-the-road, maybe even low-tier team. However, they were also very close to defeating the Philadelphia Eagles, forcing the reigning NFC champs to overtime in Week 4. Washington always seems to play to their level of competition, and while that doesn't mean they will beat the Cowboys, they will probably keep it close.\n\nThe Commanders are a dreadful 4-8 all-time on Thanksgiving. That's the second-worst record of any team with at least ten Thanksgiving Day games played. Only the Arizona Cardinals (6-15-2) are worse. That said, I like the Commanders to keep this one a one-possession game. Divisional games are always tougher than the rest because each team knows the other so well.\n\nPrediction: Cowboys 31, Commanders 24\n\nNFL Week 12 schedule: What to know about betting odds, early lines, byes\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Unfortunately for some NFL players, it's anything but.\n\nThe NFL on Thanksgiving is a tradition that dates back to the 1930s, when the Detroit Lions hosted the first Thanksgiving football game against the Chicago Bears. Since then, the Lions have been champions of Thanksgiving – well, at least in appearances.\n\nThe Lions have remained a staple of Turkey Day pigskin for all to see since their first game, though their record shows they still have some work to do to earn a turkey leg. Later joined by the Dallas Cowboys, the Cowboys and Lions are as much engrained into the festivities of Turkey Day as much as cranberry sauce, naps and political arguments at the dinner table.\n\nHere's what to know about Thanksgiving Day records, appearances and more.\n\nWhat NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving Day games?\n\nThe Lions have played 84 Thanksgiving games, the most of any team. They are 37-45-2 in those games. Considering they won't be relinquishing control of the NFL's tradition anytime soon, it's safe to say that they will continue to be Turkey Day's most featured team.\n\nWhich team has the most wins on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Lions have won 37 games on Thanksgiving, giving them the most on the NFL's biggest holiday. It's fitting considering they've played 84 games on the day, but it hasn't translated to a ton of success in the franchise's history.

In 2024, things are a little different, as the Lions are legitimate Super Bowl contenders – a label that's rarely been bestowed upon the team in years past.\n\nAnd, in what seems to be a bizarre turn of events, the Cowboys are almost entirely out of the playoff race by the time a turkey leg hits the fine china. With an injury to Dak Prescott and a season stuffed full of disappointment, the Cowboys won't have have opportunity to play for a Lombardi Trophy in 2024.\n\nThat is, barring an early Christmas miracle.\n\nHere's what to know about the two squads that are Thanksgiving Day mainstays:\n\nWhat NFL teams always play on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Lions and Cowboys are the two mainstays on Thanksgiving, with Detroit playing their first game in 1934 and Dallas joining the tradition in 1966.\n\nBoth teams have been permanent fixtures ever since, with four other teams being selected each year to round out the holiday schedule.\n\nNFL ON THANKSGIVING: Why Detroit and Dallas always play on the holiday\n\nLions' Thanksgiving record\n\nDetroit has played 84 total games on Thanksgiving, by far the most in the NFL, and they're 37-45-2 on the holiday.

For the NFL on Thanksgiving, we'll have to fast forward a little bit.\n\nThe NFL was born in the 1920s, but a famous tradition wasn't born until the league's teenage years. Here's everything you need to know about the NFL's Thanksgiving traditions, who has the most wins and how each team has fared on the holiday.\n\nWhen was the first NFL Thanksgiving game?\n\nPicture it: Detroit 1934. Bing Crosby is at the top of music world, the Great Depression is ravaging the country, Franklin D. Roosevelt is President and Babe Ruth is in the midst of his final season as a New York Yankee.\n\nMeanwhile in the Motor City, the Lions are looking to gain some traction in a town dominated by baseball's Tigers. Enter George A. Richards, who bought the Portsmouth Spartans and moved them to Detroit in 1934. The team would then become known as the Lions, but needed something to get the fans' attention.\n\nSo Richards went and scheduled a game on Thanksgiving against the defending champion Chicago Bears. Just like that, a tradition was born.\n\nThe Lions would play the Bears in the first ever Thanksgiving Day NFL game in 1934. The site would be the University of Detroit Stadium with 26,000 people in attendance, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It's believed that more people would've attended if the stadium capacity was larger.\n\nDetroit won the first Turkey Day contest by a score of 19-10, beginning a tradition that has withstood the test of time. While fads like the \"Harlem Shake\" and \"Tebowing\" came and went, the Lions have managed to weave themselves into Thanksgiving just as much as your mother's stuffing recipe.\n\nThe team's fans don't often feel in the holiday spirit on the holiday, however. In fact, the Lions experience on Thanksgiving typically resembles the feeling you get when the annoying family member arrives.\n\nWhile they've gotten better in recent years, Detroit still has some work to do to get above .500 on Turkey Day.\n\nWhat NFL teams always play on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Lions and Cowboys are the two mainstays on Thanksgiving, with Detroit playing their first game in 1934 and Dallas joining the tradition in 1966. Both teams have been permanent fixtures ever since, with four other teams being selected each year to round out the holiday schedule.\n\nWhat NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving Day games?\n\nThe Lions have played 84 Thanksgiving games, the most of any team. They are 37-45-2 in those games. Considering they won't be relinquishing control of the NFL's tradition anytime soon, it's safe to say that they will continue to be Turkey Day's most featured team.\n\nWhich team has the most wins on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Lions have won 37 games on Thanksgiving, giving them the most on the NFL's biggest holiday. It's fitting considering they've played 84 games on the day, but it hasn't translated to a ton of success in the franchise's history. Detroit also has 45 losses on Thanksgiving, but recent history suggests that Dan Campbell's team will be improving that record in the coming years.\n\nNFL Thanksgiving records by team", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/11/26/nfl-team-most-thanksgiving-games/87364561007/", "title": "What NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving games?", "text": "NFL football has been played on Thanksgiving Day for more than a century, but only one team can hold the mantle as the holiday's most decorated.\n\nNaturally, most of the Thanksgiving records belong to its two perennial hosts – the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys. It was Detroit that began the franchise's yearly tradition of hosting a Thanksgiving game as the brainchild of George A. Richards in 1934 while Dallas played copycat starting in 1966.\n\nWhile those two franchises have remained Turkey Day staples and have often grappled with one another for the holiday's glory, the NFL has, in recent seasons, added a third game to Thanksgiving slate. That has given more NFL teams an opportunity to test their mettle on the holiday and spread the wealth around somewhat more evenly.\n\nBut which team has played and won the most on Thanksgiving Day? Here's what to know about the all-time records of all 32 NFL teams during the league's marquee holiday.\n\nWhat NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving Day games?\n\nThe Lions have played an NFL-high 85 Thanksgiving games over the course of their team's existence. Detroit has posted a record of 38-45-2 in those games.\n\nDetroit began its tradition of playing regularly on Thanksgiving Day in 1934. The franchise has hosted games on the holiday uninterrupted since 1945, with the only break since its first Thanksgiving game coming from 1939-44 during World War II.\n\nThe NFL doesn't seem interested in breaking the Lions' Thanksgiving tradition any time soon, so they should remain Turkey Day's most featured team in perpetuity.\n\nWhich team has the most wins on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Lions have won an NFL-best 38 games on Thanksgiving, four better than the second-place Dallas Cowboys. However, the Lions also have a league-worst 45 losses on the holiday, more than double the total of any other team entering the holiday in 2025 (the Cowboys have 22 losses).\n\nThe Lions snapped a six-game losing streak on Thanksgiving in 2024 with a 23-20 win over the Chicago Bears. Dan Campbell's squad will be looking to build a multi-year winning streak in 2025 for the first time since the team won four straight from 2013-16.\n\nNFL Thanksgiving records by team\n\nAll but one of the NFL's current teams has suited up on Thanksgiving Day.

According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the professional football league played its first Thanksgiving game in 1920, the same year it was founded.\n\nIn the more than a century since, there have been hundreds of NFL games on Thanksgiving. Three more will get underway this year, marking the 20th straight season the league has played three games on the federal holiday.\n\nHere's what to know about the NFL's history on Thanksgiving:\n\nWhen was the first NFL Thanksgiving game?\n\nThe NFL's tradition of playing on Thanksgiving dates back to the league's founding.\n\nThe first year of the American Professional Football Association – the league that would become the NFL – was 1920, and six games were played on Thanksgiving that year, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At the time, the league featured teams like the Canton Bulldogs and Decatur Staleys, the latter of which became the Chicago Bears two years later.\n\nThe league's commitment to playing games on Turkey Day began in earnest in 1934, when the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans moved to Detroit, became the Lions and laid claim to an annual game on Thanksgiving. That decision, made by Lions owner and radio executive George A. Richards, was made seven years before Congress made the date of Thanksgiving – the fourth Thursday of November – a federal law.\n\nIt has stuck ever since. Except for 1941-1944, when the league paused Thanksgiving games during World War II, there has been a Lions game on Thanksgiving every year.\n\nWhat NFL teams always play on Thanksgiving?\n\nRichards and the Lions were the first to claim an annual Thanksgiving game back in 1934, and they still do to this day.\n\nIn 1966, then-Dallas Cowboys team president Tex Schramm offered his team up to the NFL as a second site for an annual Thanksgiving game. Ever since then – with the exception of 1975 and 1977, when the St. Louis Cardinals hosted a Thanksgiving game instead – the Cowboys have played a game on Thanksgiving.\n\nWhat NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving Day games?\n\nThe Lions have played 85 games on Thanksgiving – their meeting with the Packers on Nov. 27 will be their 86th.\n\nWhich team has the most wins on Thanksgiving?\n\nDetroit, having played the most games by a wide margin, also has the most wins on Turkey Day, although that margin is much slimmer.\n\nThe Lions have won 38 games on Thanksgiving, but the Cowboys – the team that has played the second-most games on the federal holiday – are not far behind them with 34 Thanksgiving wins.\n\nNFL Thanksgiving records by team", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/11/28/detroit-lions-dallas-cowboys-thanksgiving-nfl-history/76598292007/", "title": "Lions, Cowboys and Thanksgiving: Why Detroit and Dallas always ...", "text": "Americans have been playing football on Thanksgiving Day for more than a century. In 1891, Yale beat Princeton 19-0 in the first college football game played on the holiday. Professional football started playing official games on Thanksgiving in 1920, starting with six American Professional Football Association (APFA) matchups.\n\nThose six games marked the first Thursday games in professional football history, per the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Here's how the day's slate of games ended:\n\nAkron Pros 7-0 Canton Bulldogs\n\nCanton Bulldogs Decatur Staleys 6-0 Chicago Tigers\n\nChicago Tigers Elyria Athletics 0-0 Columbus Panhandles\n\nColumbus Panhandles Dayton Triangles 28-0 Detroit Heralds\n\nDetroit Heralds Chicago Boosters 27-0 Hammond Pros\n\nHammond Pros All-Tonawanda 14-3 Rochester Jeffersons\n\nIn the 104 years since, professional football has become a fixture on Thanksgiving, save for a break from 1941 to 1944 due to World War II. Two teams have played more games on the holiday than any other: the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys.\n\nBoth will be in action again this Thursday and hosting division rivals. The Lions kick the day off against the Chicago Bears before the Cowboys face off against the New York Giants in the second game of the day.\n\nHere's why they're always playing on Thanksgiving.\n\nWhy do the Lions always play on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Lions played their first Thanksgiving game in 1934, their first season in Detroit. Then-owner George A. Richards, a local radio executive, wanted the team to play on the holiday to bring more fans to the stadium. The city's MLB team, the Detroit Tigers, were the most popular sports team at the time and Richards thought this could get more fans to watch the Lions.\n\nA sold-out crowd at University of Detroit Stadium saw a close game between the Lions and the Bears. The Bears won 19-16 and Richards ensured the game was broadcast across 94 radio stations, per the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThat game was so popular it became a permanent part of the schedule through 1938. The Lions didn't play on the holiday from 1939 through 1944 but came back when the NFL reinstated Thanksgiving games in 1945 after World War II. They've played on the holiday every year since.\n\nLions' Thanksgiving record\n\nDetroit has played 84 total games on Thanksgiving, by far the most in the NFL, and they're 37-45-2 on the holiday. Here are the most common matchups they've had:\n\nLions-Packers (22 games): Lions lead 12-9-1\n\nLions lead 12-9-1 Lions-Bears (19 games): Bears lead 11-8\n\nBears lead 11-8 Lions-Vikings (5 games): Vikings lead 3-2\n\nWhy do the Cowboys always play on Thanksgiving?\n\nDallas is second to the Lions for the most games on the holiday in NFL history. In the 1960s, NFL viewership was growing rapidly, and the league added a second Thanksgiving game in 1966. Then-Dallas Cowboys president Tex Schramm volunteered the Cowboys to play on the second game, so long as the the team could host the game each year.\n\nThe Cowboys won their Thanksgiving debut 26-14 over the Cleveland Browns the tradition continued the following season. The St. Louis (now Arizona) Cardinals took over as a host team for the Cowboys in 1975 and 1977 but Dallas was reinstated in 1978 and have had a permanent place on the holiday ever since.\n\nCowboys' Thanksgiving record\n\nDallas has played 56 total games on Thanksgiving with a 33-22-1 record on the holiday entering 2024. Unlike the Lions, they've don't have popular rivalries for the game; Dallas has played 24 different teams on the holiday. Here are their most common opponents:\n\nCowboys-Commanders (11 games): Cowboys lead 9-2\n\nCowboys lead 9-2 Cowboys-Dolphins (5 games) : Dolphins lead 3-2\n\n: Dolphins lead 3-2 Cowboys-Cardinals (4 games): Cowboys lead 4-0\n\nHave any NFL teams never played on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars are the only active franchise to have never played on Thanksgiving. Three teams have had one game on the holiday: the Carolina Panthers (2015), Cincinnati Bengals (2010), and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2006).\n\nNFL team Thanksgiving records", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/11/23/thanksgiving-nfl-games-2025-schedule-matchups-teams/87337549007/", "title": "Thanksgiving NFL games 2025: Schedule, matchups and teams", "text": "For the 20th year in a row, the NFL will play three games on Thanksgiving.

The Lions have played on Thanksgiving every year for nearly eight decades and will be looking to snap a seven-game losing streak on the holiday.\n\nThe Lions have been winless on Thanksgiving since 2016 and have yet to capture the holiday win under the Brad Holmes/Dan Campbell regime. Last year, the Lions fell to the Green Bay Packers 29-22 after fumbling three times and having four failed fourth-down tries in the attempted comeback.\n\nBut this year, the odds are in Detroit's favor to snap that streak. The Lions are in first place in the NFL at 10-1 after cruising through a tough middle stretch of the schedule unbeaten. They are welcoming the Chicago Bears, a division rival down on their luck as the losers of five in a row.\n\nIt will be the 20th time the Lions and Bears have played on Thanksgiving, with Chicago holding an 11-8 advantage in the holiday matchups. The Bears have a three-game winning streak (2018, 2019, 2021) with Detroit's last win over Chicago on Thanksgiving coming in 2014.\n\nTo get you ready for Thursday's action, here is a look back at the full history of the Lions playing on Thanksgiving.\n\nLions Thanksgiving history\n\nLions football has been a Thanksgiving Day tradition ever since the team moved to the Motor City in 1934.\n\nTHE OTHER '34 CONNECTION: Lions have won 8 straight games for first time since 1934 — their first year in Detroit\n\nThe Lions have played 84 total times on Turkey Day and the tradition has happened every year since 1945. Then-team owner G.A. Richards started the tradition to try to gain traction with Detroit's fanbase in the team's first season in the city. The next closest team is the Dallas Cowboys, who play annually in the mid-afternoon time slot after Detroit, with 56 Thanksgiving games.\n\nThe Lions lost the first-ever Thanksgiving game to the Chicago Bears, 16-13, in front of a sold-out, 26,000-person crowd at the University of Detroit Stadium, located on 6 Mile. It was the first nationally broadcast Thanksgiving game, carried by over 90 radio stations. The Lions played the Bears in the first five Thanksgiving matchups until 1938 before pausing play on the holiday until 1945. The next game against the Bears took place in 1947.\n\nAll-time Thanksgiving record\n\nSince the tradition started, the Lions have an all-time 37-45-2 record on Thanksgiving Day games. The Lions were above .500 for most of the 20th century before falling off thanks to two hefty losing streaks. The Lions are 6-18 on Thanksgiving this century, dragged down by a nine-game skid in 2004-12 and an active seven-game losing streak dating back to 2016.\n\nThat 2016 win came against the Minnesota Vikings when Jim Caldwell was the head coach and Matthew Stafford was under center. The Lions won, 16-13, as Stafford began the game with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin. Matt Prater added three field goals and the defense held former No. 1 overall pick Sam Bradford and the Minnesota offense in check all afternoon.\n\nThanksgiving winning and losing streaks\n\nThat nine-game losing streak from 2004-12 was the worst Turkey Day run in franchise history. It spanned four head coaches — Steve Mariucci, Dick Jauron (as interim), Rod Marinelli and Jim Schwartz — before it finally came to an end with a 40-10 win over the Packers in 2013 in Schwartz's final season. The worst loss during the streak was a 47-10 thumping by the Tennessee Titans during the winless 2008 season.\n\nThe best stretch of Thanksgiving performances came in the first half of the 1950s when the Lions were one of the best teams in the NFL. The Lions won six straight on Thanksgiving from 1950-55, including five straight over the Packers. Hall of Fame quarterback Bobby Layne, who was part of three NFL-champion Lions squads, was under center for the streak. The biggest win was 34-15 win over Green Bay in 1953, a year the Lions won it all.\n\nMemorable Thanksgiving moments in Detroit\n\nLawrence Taylor's winning pick-six: The 1982 Thanksgiving battle between the New York Giants and the Lions was a defensive battle defined by a memorable highlight for one of the best defensive players of all-time. With the score tied 6-6 in the fourth quarter, Lawrence Taylor dropped into coverage on the goal line and jumped in front of a Gary Danielson pass to the flat. Taylor returned the interception 97 yards for a pick-six, the only touchdown of the game, to give New York a 13-6 win.\n\nThe Jerome Bettis coin flip fiasco: Detroit native Jerome Bettis is responsible for the most infamous moment of the Lions’ Thanksgiving tradition. Bettis’ Steelers tied the 1998 game on a Norm Johnson field goal with 4 seconds left in regulation. When the Hall of Fame running back went to midfield to call the overtime coin toss, he appeared to call tails, but referee Phil Luckett heard heads. The coin flip landed on tails, and the Lions got the ball to start overtime and went on to win on a Jason Hanson field goal, 19-16.\n\nJim Schwartz vs. the red challenge flag: The Lions' miserable nine-game skid can be best defined by the 34-31 overtime loss to the Houston Texans in 2012. Justin Forsett scored on an 81-yard run in the third quarter, though the touchdown never should have counted. Forsett’s elbow and knee hit the ground short of a first down, but Lions coach Jim Schwartz threw a challenge flag on the play. Unfortunately, because the play was set to be reviewed automatically, Schwartz's challenge drew a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty AND wiped out the official booth review that would have called back the score. The Texans completed their comeback after Hanson missed a field goal in overtime.\n\nNdamukong Suh's stomp: Another defining moment in the Lions' losing streak happened in the 2011 loss to the Packers. Suh cemented his reputation as one of the NFL’s dirtiest players on Nov. 24, 2011, when he was ejected from the 27-15 loss after he stomped on the right arm of Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith. Suh was suspended two games for the first-quarter incident.\n\nBarry Sanders' national show: Barry Sanders had a lot of memorable performances during his 2,053-yard 1997 season, but his dazzling Thanksgiving game against the Bears ranks near the top. He ran for 167 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Lions to a 55-20 win. Sanders scored on runs of 40, 25 and 15 yards as the Lions scored 45 straight points to rally from a two-possession deficit.\n\nJared Ramsey is a sports reporter for the Detroit Free Press.
