Is the US next?", "text": "Dec. 9, 2025 Updated Dec. 10, 2025, 8:27 a.m. ET\n\nStarting Dec. 10, Australia is the first country to ban social media for kids under 16.\n\nAustralia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrote about the move in an opinion essay posted Dec. 7, saying the ban \"will be one of the biggest social and cultural changes our nation has faced.\" He's confident it will be a positive change, protecting Australian children from the dangers of engaging with strangers online and the mental health impacts of cyberbullying.\n\nIt's up to social media companies − including TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, YouTube and others − to ensure children under 16 aren't using their platforms, and companies who fail to block kids form their sites will face substantial fines. There are no penalties for kids who gain access to these platforms, or their parents or caregivers.\n\nWhile the ban is controversial in some circles, many parents and mental health advocates are celebrating − and wondering if something similar could ever be enforced in the United States. Nearly half of teens said they spend too much time on social media, according to 2024 data from the Pew Research Center. And 48% of teens ages 13 to 17 said social media has a negative effect on kids their age, with teen girls expressing more social media-related distress including poorer mental health, confidence and sleep.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nRahm Emanuel, who is considering a presidential run, said in an interview on Dec. 9 that he wants the United States to follow Australia's lead.\n\nWhitney Raglin Bignall, pediatric psychologist and associate clinical director at The Kids Mental Health Foundation, said she hasn't seen movement toward a nationwide social media ban in the United States. But she has seen efforts to make social media safer for kids, with companies creating teen accounts with restricted access and organizations helping parents understand the risks of social media use.\n\nAlbanese said he's met with Australian parents \"who have seen their child’s wellbeing crushed by the worst of social media, many living with the devastating pain of losing a child.\"\n\n\"Our social media ban is about providing greater peace of mind for Australian parents,\" he wrote. \"It’s also about making sure that Australian children have a childhood.\"\n\nHow social media impacts young people's ability to concentrate\n\nThe mental health impacts of social media is alarming, Raglin Bignall said. One of the biggest risks is having kids compare themselves to other people online, or feeling a fear of missing out on something it seems everyone else has or is doing. She's also noticed teens are less comfortable with in-person interactions.\n\n\"We don't want social media to get in the way of kids being able to develop normal, good communication and interactions and connection with people outside of their screens,\" Raglin Bignall said.\n\nIt’s something Jonathan Haidt has been talking about for years. He outlined children’s social media use extensively in his book “The Anxious Generation,” where he advocates for curtailing smartphone use before age 14 and social media before 16. He helped influence the social media ban for teens under 16 in Australia after the wife of a lawmaker read the book and told her husband to take action.\n\nRecent research has also found social media use is causing kids to develop shorter attention spans.\n\nDigital literacy expert Kaitlyn Regehr, who is the author of “Smartphone Nation,” previously told USA TODAY that addiction spans devices and platforms and is most heavily tied to algorithms that feed curated content to users. A combination of factors – the refresh screen, the device’s color saturation, notifications and prompt system – impact how a social media addiction functions.\n\n\"The natural state of adolescence that is prone to feeling left out, prone to maybe feeling blue, sometimes prone to social anxiety; it is not caused by social media, but it is aggravated by social media,\" Regehr said.\n\nChild psychiatrist and Yale School of Medicine professor Yann Poncin previously told USA TODAY that technology addiction rewires the brain to expect higher dopamine, depleting the brain’s cognitive patience and threshold for tolerating frustration in the process.\n\n\"If we overexpose ourselves to these sort of easy dopamine hits, cheap dopamine hits when we're younger, then we're resetting our homeostasis where we can only feel good by having access to these items,\" Poncin said.\n\nA December study from ​​researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Oregon Health & Science University that followed more than 8,000 U.S. children from around age 10 through age 14 found a link between social media use and inattention symptoms.\n\nWill America ever have a social media ban?\n\nJulie Scelfo, founder and executive director of Mothers Against Media Addiction, agrees with Raglin Bignall that a social media ban doesn't seem to be the focus for American youth mental health advocates. There are obstacles, she said, most notably the tech firms that have the ear of lawmakers in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"That doesn't mean it can't or won't happen here,\" Scelfo said. \"Overall, we're hopeful that this move by Australia will further encourage our elected officials here to take action.\"\n\nIn the meantime, it's mostly falling on parents to try to keep their kids off social media. As a mom herself, Scelfo said that's not a good backup solution.\n\n\"No parent could possibly monitor everything their children sees and effectively manage all of their social media channels. Especially because kids are so good at workarounds\" and social media sites' parental controls don't always work, Scelfo said.\n\nStill, there has been some movement to create change. In 2024, Former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in a New York Times op-ed called to add warning labels to to social media platforms, similar to warnings on cigarettes and alcohol. The Kids Online Safety Act bill wouldn't ban social media, but it would provide better guardrails for kids, Scelfo said. In an effort to curb social media use, Scelfo's organization has had success banning smartphones from schools. Some parents are reverting to times of old by installing landlines in their homes, and Gen Z luddites have resorted to using flip phones.\n\nBut without government intervention, it's hard for parents to totally protect their kids from social media on their own. So it's important to have lots of conversations about social media with kids, Raglin Bignall said, and set clear boundaries and expectations about social media use, including when to take breaks.\n\n\"We don't want kids hiding what they're doing,\" she said.\n\nMadeline Mitchell's role covering women and the caregiving economy and Rachel Hale's role covering youth mental health at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal and Journalism Funding Partners.

A trial of methods to enforce it will start in January with the ban to take effect in a year.\n\nThe Social Media Minimum Age bill sets Australia up as a test case for a growing number of governments which have legislated or said they plan to legislate an age restriction on social media amid concern about its mental health impact on young people.\n\nCountries including France and some U.S. states have passed laws to restrict access for minors without a parent's permission, but the Australian ban is absolute. A full under-14s ban in Florida is being challenged in court on free speech grounds.\n\nGetting the law passed after a marathon last day of Australia's parliamentary year marks a political win for centre-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who goes to an election in 2025 amid sagging opinion polls. The ban faced opposition from privacy advocates and some child rights groups, but 77% of the population wanted it, according to latest polls.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a parliamentary inquiry through 2024 which heard evidence from parents of children who had self-harmed due to social media bullying, domestic media backed the ban led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, the country's biggest newspaper publisher, with a campaign called \"Let Them Be Kids.\"\n\nThe ban could however strain Australia's relationship with key ally the United States, where X owner Elon Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a \"backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians\".\n\nIt also builds on an existing mood of antagonism between Australia and mostly US-domiciled tech giants. Australia was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content and now plans to threaten them with fines for failing to stamp out scams.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said the Facebook owner respected Australian law, but it was \"concerned\" about the process, which \"rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.\"\n\n\"The task now turns to ensuring there is productive consultation on all rules associated with the Bill to ensure a technically feasible outcome that does not place an onerous burden on parents and teens and a commitment that rules will be consistently applied across all social apps used by teens,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nRepresentatives of TikTok and X, which the government has said would be affected by the ban, were not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe companies – including Alphabet's Google, whose subsidiary YouTube is exempt because it is widely used in schools – had argued the legislation should be postponed until after the age verification trial.\n\n\"It's cart before horse,\" said Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group, which has most social media companies as members.\n\n\"We have the bill but we don't have guidance from the Australian government around what are the right methods that a whole host of services subject to this law will need to employ,\" Bose added, speaking to Reuters.\n\nNation Divided\n\nSome youth advocacy groups and academics had warned the ban could shut off the most vulnerable young people, including LGBTQIA and migrant teenagers, from support networks. The Australian Human Rights Commission said the law may infringe human rights of young people by interfering with their ability to participate in society.\n\nPrivacy advocates meanwhile warned the law could lead to heightened collection of personal data, clearing the path for digital identification-based state surveillance. A last-minute change to the bill specified that platforms must offer an alternative to making users upload identification documents.\n\n\"This is boomers trying to tell young people how the internet should work to make themselves feel better,\" said Sarah Hanson-Young, a senator for the left-leaning Greens, in a late Senate sitting just before the bill was passed 34 votes to 19.\n\nBut parent groups pushed for intervention, seizing on comments from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy who in 2023 said social media was worsening a youth mental health crisis to the point where it should carry a health warning.\n\n\"Putting an age limit and giving the control back to the parents, I think it's a starting point,\" said Australian anti-bullying advocate Ali Halkic, whose 17-year-old son Allem took his life in 2009 following social media bullying.\n\nEnie Lam, a Sydney school student who recently turned 16, said social media contributed to body image problems and cyber bullying but a total ban may drive young people to less visible, more dangerous parts of the internet.\n\n\"It will only create a generation of young people who will be more technologically literate in bypassing these walls,\" she told Reuters. \"It won't achieve the desired effects.\"\n\n\"We all know social media isn't good for us but the social media ban generally sees a lot of young people who are strongly against it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/state/2025/03/14/social-media-companies-fail-to-convince-judge-to-block-florida-ban/82413561007/", "title": "Social media companies fail to convince judge to block Florida ban", "text": "Lee Ann Anderson\n\nFRESH TAKE FLORIDA\n\nMarch 14, 2025, 2:49 p.m. ET\n\nThe law applies narrowly only to social media platforms with addictive features.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear when the DeSantis administration would begin enforcing the bans.\n\nThe broader fight by the technology companies against the law continues.\n\nIn a big courtroom victory for Gov. Ron DeSantis, a federal judge in Tallahassee on Friday denied a request to block Florida’s ban on social media for young teens.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Walker rejected a request by a consortium of technology companies for a preliminary injunction that would have at least further temporarily blocked the state’s ban from taking effect.\n\nIn his 13-page ruling, Walker said the groups representing trade associations failed to prove which social media platforms — such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, X and others — would be affected under Florida’s ban.\n\n“Plaintiffs have not provided evidence showing that at least one of their members meets the injury-in-fact requirement,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe technology companies had argued in court that at least one of the social media platforms would likely be covered by Florida’s law and would have to spend money and resources to comply with it. Walker said that wasn’t enough of a convincing argument.\n\nThe law applies narrowly only to social media platforms with addictive features, like push notifications, with 10% or more of daily active users who are younger than 16 and who spend on average two hours or more on the app. If all those conditions aren’t met, the law doesn’t apply to the platform.\n\nThe social media law, which was supposed to take effect Jan. 1, would block anyone under 16 from using some social media but would allow 14 and 15 year olds to use the online services with a parent’s permission. Companies that violate the law could be fined up to $50,000 per violation.\n\nThe attorney general’s office had agreed not to enforce the new law until Walker ruled on the request for the preliminary injunction. It wasn’t immediately clear when the DeSantis administration would begin enforcing the bans. The governor had championed passage of the law through the Legislature last year.\n\nThe broader fight by the technology companies against the law continues in federal court in Tallahassee. Walker’s decision Friday was an interim ruling that focused narrowly on whether he would issue a preliminary injunction in the case.\n\n“I am grateful that the courts have once again ruled in favor of Florida, and I am grateful also for the lives and the influence that social media will now not have on our children, said Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, one of the sponsors of the law. “ I'm excited that Florida is entering a new chapter and being able to have freedom for our kids.”\n\nDuring courtroom arguments Feb. 28 over the injunction, Walker — who was appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2012 — had signaled Florida would have a “hard hoe to row” to prove that the ban doesn’t infringe on the rights of young teens in Florida.\n\n“I just think that there's clear precedent across the country why these social media bans are against the First Amendment, and I have no doubt that the final outcome will reflect that,” Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, said. “There's going to be a lot of confusion and chaos for all our families. It's really important that everyone stays informed, understands what their options are, and do what they can to follow the law.”\n\nThe law would also require adults in Florida who use social media accounts to prove their age using third-party verification systems. There are few generally agreed-upon methods for age verification on the internet.\n\nThis story was produced by Fresh Take Florida, a news service of the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications.

That hasn’t stopped Congress, state legislatures, and the U.S. surgeon general from moving ahead with age bans and warning labels for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.\n\nBut the emphasis on fears about social media may cause policymakers to miss the mental health benefits it provides teenagers, say researchers, pediatricians, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n\nIn June, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the nation’s top doctor, called for warning labels on social media platforms. The Senate approved the bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act and a companion bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, on July 30. And at least 30 states have pending legislation relating to children and social media – from age bans and parental consent requirements to new digital and media literacy courses for K-12 students.\n\nMost research suggests that some features of social media can be harmful: Algorithmically driven content can distort reality and spread misinformation; incessant notifications distract attention and disrupt sleep; and the anonymity that sites offer can embolden cyberbullies.\n\nBut social media can also be helpful for some young people, said Linda Charmaraman, a research scientist and director of the Youth, Media & Wellbeing Research Lab at Wellesley Centers for Women.\n\nFor children of color and LGBTQ+ young people – and others who may not see themselves represented broadly in society – social media can reduce isolation, according to Charmaraman’s research, which was published in the Handbook of Adolescent Digital Media Use and Mental Health. Age bans, she said, could disproportionately affect these marginalized groups, who also spend more time on the platforms.\n\n“You think at first, ‘That’s terrible. We need to get them off it,’” she said. “But when you find out why they’re doing it, it’s because it helps bring them a sense of identity affirmation when there’s something lacking in real life.”\n\nArianne McCullough, 17, said she uses Instagram to connect with Black students like herself at Willamette University, where about 2% of students are Black.\n\n“I know how isolating it can be feeling like you’re the only Black person, or any minority, in one space,” said McCullough, a freshman from Sacramento, California. “So, having someone I can text real quick and just say, ‘Let’s go hang out,’ is important.”\n\nAfter about a month at Willamette, which is in Salem, Oregon, McCullough assembled a social network with other Black students. “We’re all in a little group chat,” she said. “We talk and make plans.”\n\nSocial media hasn’t always been this useful for McCullough. After California schools closed during the pandemic, McCullough said, she stopped competing in soccer and track. She gained weight, she said, and her social media feed was constantly promoting at-home workouts and fasting diets.\n\n“That’s where the body comparisons came in,” McCullough said, noting that she felt more irritable, distracted, and sad. “I was comparing myself to other people and things that I wasn’t self-conscious of before.”\n\nWhen her mother tried to take away the smartphone, McCullough responded with an emotional outburst. “It was definitely addictive,” said her mother, Rayvn McCullough, 38, of Sacramento.\n\nArianne said she eventually felt happier and more like herself once she cut back on her use of social media.\n\nBut the fear of missing out eventually crept back in, Arianne said. “I missed seeing what my friends were doing and having easy, fast communication with them.”\n\nFor a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic triggered what the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups declared “a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health,” greater numbers of young people had been struggling with their mental health.\n\nMore young people were reporting feelings of hopelessness and sadness, as well as suicidal thoughts and behavior, according to behavioral surveys of students in ninth grade through 12th grade conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe greater use of immersive social media – like the never-ending scroll of videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram – has been blamed for contributing to the crisis. But a committee of the national academies found that the relationship between social media and youth mental health is complex, with potential benefits as well as harms. Evidence of social media’s effect on child well-being remains limited, the committee reported this year, while calling on the National Institutes of Health and other research groups to prioritize funding such studies.\n\nIn its report, the committee cited legislation in Utah last year that places age and time limits on young people’s use of social media and warned that the policy could backfire.\n\n“The legislators’ intent to protect time for sleep and schoolwork and to prevent at least some compulsive use could just as easily have unintended consequences, perhaps isolating young people from their support systems when they need them,” the report said.\n\nSome states have considered policies that echo the national academies’ recommendations. For instance, Virginia and Maryland have adopted legislation that prohibits social media companies from selling or disclosing children’s personal data and requires platforms to default to privacy settings. Other states, including Colorado, Georgia, and West Virginia, have created curricula about the mental health effects of using social media for students in public schools, which the national academies also recommended.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act, which is now before the House of Representatives, would require parental consent for social media users younger than 13 and impose on companies a “duty of care” to protect users younger than 17 from harm, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal behavior. The second bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, would ban platforms from targeting ads toward minors and collecting personal data on young people.\n\nAttorneys general in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and dozens of other states have filed lawsuits in federal and state courts alleging that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, misled the public about the dangers of social media for young people and ignored the potential damage to their mental health.\n\nMost social media companies require users to be at least 13, and the sites often include safety features, like blocking adults from messaging minors and defaulting minors’ accounts to privacy settings.\n\nLawsuit filed: TikTok sued by Justice Department over alleged child privacy violations impacting millions\n\nDespite existing policies, the Department of Justice says some social media companies don't follow their own rules. On Friday, the DOJ sued the parent company of TikTok for allegedly violating child privacy laws, saying that the company knowingly let children younger than 13 on the platform, and collected data on their use.\n\nSurveys show that age restrictions and parental consent requirements have popular support among adults.\n\nNetChoice, an industry group whose members include Meta and Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, has filed lawsuits against at least eight states, seeking to stop or overturn laws that impose age limits, verification requirements, and other policies aimed at protecting children.\n\nMuch of social media’s effect can depend on the content children consume and the features that keep them engaged with a platform, said Jenny Radesky, a physician and a co-director of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health.\n\nAge bans, parental consent requirements, and other proposals may be well-meaning, she said, but they do not address what she considers to be “the real mechanism of harm”: business models that aim to keep young people posting, scrolling, and purchasing.\n\n“We’ve kind of created this system that’s not well designed to promote youth mental health,” Radesky said. “It’s designed to make lots of money for these platforms.”\n\nContributing: Chaseedaw Giles, KFF Health News’ digital strategy & audience engagement editor.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs atKFF – an independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/11/07/australia-social-media-ban-proposal-for-children/76109029007/", "title": "Australia proposes ban on social media for children under 16", "text": "Alasdair Pal and Byron Kaye\n\nReuters\n\nNov. 7, 2024, 10:31 a.m. ET\n\nSYDNEY, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The Australian government will legislate for a ban on social media for children under 16, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday, in what it calls a world-leading package of measures that could become law late next year.\n\nAustralia is trialing an age-verification system to assist in blocking children from accessing social media platforms, as part of a range of measures that include some of the toughest controls imposed by any country to date.\n\n\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese told a news conference.\n\nAlbanese cited the risks to physical and mental health of children from excessive social media use, in particular the risks to girls from harmful depictions of body image, and misogynist content aimed at boys.\n\n\"If you're a 14-year-old kid getting this stuff, at a time where you're going through life's changes and maturing, it can be a really difficult time and what we're doing is listening and then acting,\" he said.\n\nA number of countries have already vowed to curb social media use by children through legislation, though Australia's policy is one of the most stringent.\n\nNo jurisdiction so far has tried using age verification methods like biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off, two of the methods being trialed.\n\nAustralia's other world-first proposals are the highest age limit set by any country, no exemption for parental consent and no exemption for pre-existing accounts.\n\nLegislation will be introduced into the Australian parliament this year, with the laws coming into effect 12 months after being ratified by lawmakers, Albanese said.\n\nThe opposition Liberal Party has expressed support for a ban.\n\nThere will be no exemptions for children who have parental consent, or who already have accounts.\n\n\"The onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access,\" Albanese said. \"The onus won't be on parents or young people.\"\n\n\"What we are announcing here and what we will legislate will be truly world leading,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said.\n\nRowland said platforms impacted would include Meta Platforms' META.O Instagram and Facebook, as well as Bytedance's TikTok and Elon Musk's X.

The law has been criticized by major technology companies and free speech campaigners, but praised by parents and child advocates.\n\nThe ban is being closely watched by other countries considering similar age-based measures as concerns mount over the effects of social media on children's health and safety.\n\n\"While Australia is the first to adopt such restrictions, it is unlikely to be the last,\" Tama Leaver, a professor of internet studies at Curtin University, said.\n\n\"Governments around the world are watching how the power of Big Tech was successfully taken on.

Lawmakers backing the legislation also say they want to safeguard privacy, arguing there are plenty of instances where “the state takes over parental rights” to keep kids safe.\n\n“We don’t give you a parental right for your kid to buy alcohol or tobacco under the legal age, or to drive a car,’ McFarland said in an interview with USA TODAY. “We are putting social media, as a product, on the same level as all of these other harms that are inappropriate for children.”\n\nOpponents, however, consider the bill a wolf in sheep's clothing, aimed solely at preventing kids and teens from online content considered too woke.\n\nThe vote to ban young people under 16 from having social media accounts even with parental consent shows that the claim of parents rights is “just a cover for censorship,” Howard Simon, interim executive director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said in a statement.\n\nWhat is Florida’s bill?\n\nWhen Marley goes to class in South Florida, she abides by her school’s strict no phones policy.\n\nBut when she returns home, she checks the comments on her posts and sees who may have slid in her DMs. Surely, that’s par for the course for any content creator. But it’s also a normal after-school activity for tweens and teens.\n\nMany of Marley’s posts are her mixing hip hop artists like Lil Nas X and Nicki Minaj. Interspersed are posts about her and her brother watching basketball games, her friends celebrating the start of summer vacation and even advocacy about teen suicide prevention.\n\nLike many other young people, Marley also uses social media to connect with friends. She follows and messages other teenage girls interested in music production across the country.\n\n“We really just empower each other and support each other,” Marley said. “Without social media, I wouldn’t have even found out about them and they help me a lot.”\n\nWhile people of all age groups use social media, it has an outsize role in the lives of young people. A Pew Research Center 2023 survey found that a third of U.S. teenagers use at least one of the five dominant social media platforms almost constantly. And 54% of teens say it would be difficult to give up social media.\n\nUsing social media is not inherently beneficial or harmful to young people, according to a health advisory from the American Psychological Association.\n\nBut, like Marley, Florida kids could soon lose access to presumably millions of accounts.\n\nIf the bill passes, social media companies could be fined up to $10,000 per minor account they fail to terminate.\n\nDavid Greene, civil liberties director of Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit based in San Francisco, said book banning informs how these efforts should be looked at.\n\nLaws that seek to protect kids from pornographic, obscene and harmful content are being used to restrict a far wider range of materials, the attorney said.\n\n“It’s really important to push back on equating information, which is what minors get over the internet, with a drug, a physiological harmful substance,” said Greene.\n\nThere are also growing concerns about how the age verification process would work, likely requiring the use of facial recognition software or third-party data brokers. Greene argues both present privacy concerns.\n\n\"If enacted, it will jeopardize the privacy and security of Floridians who use the internet,\" Carl Szabo, NetChoice's vice president and general counsel, previously told reporters. “The Free State of Florida deserves better than a massive, unconstitutional internet surveillance program.”\n\nIn response, bill sponsors Michele K. Rayner D-St. Petersburg and Tyler Sirois R-Merritt Island said those privacy concerns should be alleviated by the bill’s language mandating age verifying information is not used for any other purpose.\n\nParental rights and social media\n\nMarley's parents used to fully manage her social media accounts and now continue to monitor her use. Marley's dad, Rodney Desinord sees the sweeping legislation in Florida as actually stripping their rights as parents by completely banning minors from social media even if they have their parents’ permission.\n\n“She understands how to be responsible,” he said.\n\nDesinord, 43, a fourth grade teacher in Pompano Beach, finds the bill hypocritical, considering the state’s support for book bans.\n\n“The argument for the book ban is that parents should have the right to choose, but on the social media ban, they’re not being given the right to choose,” Desinord said.\n\nFor Sirois, the ban is directly responding to parents’ concerns about social media companies.\n\n“We’re dealing with a problem here that I think every parent, every family has encountered,” Sirois said. “The bill, I think, most importantly empowers parents to sue a social media company that has unlawfully registered a minor.”\n\nLast October, 33 states sued Meta, the umbrella company for Facebook and Instagram, alleging the platforms are knowingly harming children’s mental health.\n\nCongressional hearings and state regulation attempts nationwide have added to building widespread pressure to hold social media platforms accountable.\n\nIt’s the reason Rayner, a Democrat, supports the initiative despite pushback from progressive Democrats who view social media as an important space for marginalized youth.\n\n“This is less about parental rights and more about sending a message to these social media companies that you are not going to continue to do nefarious things,” Rayner said.\n\nDoes Florida's ban violate the First Amendment?\n\nFlorida’s bill goes further than similar social media bills in Montana, Ohio, and Utah.\n\nThe bill is similar to an Arkansas law banning those under 18 from using social media. That measure was blocked by a federal judge in August who said it violated the First Amendment stopping it from taking effect in January.\n\nAs a result, DeSantis said he has concerns about the bill’s reach. He and his wife do not allow their children on social media but acknowledged other states’ legal challenges when trying to implement similar bans.\n\n“Not to say courts are always right about this, but anything I do, I want a pathway for this to actually stick,” DeSantis told reporters at a press conference. “To say that someone that is 15 just cannot have it no matter what, even if the parent consents, that may create some legal issues.”\n\nIn the past when DeSantis and Florida have taken on culture war issues the impact has poured into other states.\n\nFlorida led the country in book bans during the 2022-23 school year, accounting for over 40% nationwide, according to a report by PEN America. The report recorded 1,406 book ban cases in Florida, followed by 625 in Texas, 333 in Missouri, 281 in Utah, and 186 in Pennsylvania.\n\nFlorida’s series of anti-LGBTQ youth laws has had widespread impact. In 2023, the ACLU tracked 510 anti-LGBTQ bills in the U.S.\n\nDemocratic political organizer Elijah Manley was one of those who expressed disappointment over Florida House Democrats’ support for the bill online.\n\nManley questioned Florida politicians' sincerity in wanting to protect children and instead alleged the bill may be in response to the amount of progressive political views shared and organized by Gen Z users on social media platforms.\n\nA 2022 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center found that 93% of Gen Z get news from social media weekly.\n\nManley said young people’s growing support for a cease-fire in Gaza, for example, is informed largely by information they see on apps like TikTok and Instagram.\n\n“Biden can’t win without Gen Z,” Manley said referencing the November general election.\n\nMitchell Kaplan is a board member of the National Coalition Against Censorship, founder of Florida-based bookstore Books & Books, and a former high school English teacher.\n\nKaplan sees the bans as a “cynical” attempt by politicians to hold onto power. He said politicians can shore up a base of voters by limiting what people read and denying access to a variety of voices.\n\n“It’s a very multi-faceted attack on democracy” under the guise of parental choice, Kaplan said. “If it was true parental choice, then the law would not permit one parent to make a decision for millions of parents.”\n\nThe bill remains in Florida’s legislature and is expected to be taken up for a vote as early as this month.\n\nMeanwhile, Marley is determined to keep making content for as long as her account is active.\n\nHer latest Instagram videos shows her DJ setup at a Miami Heat game she performed at last week. But she's also making fun of herself being a young teen.\n\nRight before that same game, she took a free-throw shot and missed the hoop altogether.\n\n\"It was at this point I knew I missed up,\" Marley wrote with weary emoji. \"Wise man once said, 'You can't be great at everything Marley.'\"\n\nRachel Barber is a 2024 election fellow at USA TODAY focusing on politics and education.

It stands out among similar bills introduced around the country as it does not allow for exemptions with parental permission. It passed the House with bipartisan support in January.\n\nA slightly modified HB 1 passed the Senate with a 23-14 vote Thursday morning, with five Republicans breaking from the majority to oppose the bill and two Democrats voting in favor.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said the modifications, which sought to clarify how the law would define social media and make age verification process more private, were not quite enough. The House voted again in favor to approve the revisions later that day anyways, sending it to the Governor's deck.\n\n\"Parents need to have a role in this,\" DeSantis said at a press conference Thursday afternoon. \"I do think parents are concerned about social media and what goes on there, and I do think they think it's a problem. But I also think that for people that are in high school, it's not as simple.\"\n\nDeSantis has seven days to sign or veto it. He has previously said he wouldn't support the bill if it couldn't withstand \"legal muster.\" With many of the other bills around the country stuck in legal battles, this bill may be put to the test too if it becomes law.\n\nWhat is HB 1, Florida's social media ban for minors?\n\nHere's what HB 1, Online Protection for Minors, does:\n\nRequires social media platforms to prohibit kids 15 and younger from creating new accounts, terminate existing accounts probably held by kids 15 and younger, and allow parents and children to request termination of accounts.\n\nRequires social media platforms to use reasonable age verification methods to verify the ages of account holders and disclose specified policies and provide specified resources, measures and disclaimers.\n\nAuthorizes the Department of Legal Affairs (DLA) to bring actions for violations under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.\n\nProvides penalties.\n\nDeclares that any social media platform accessible in Florida is subject to the jurisdiction of state courts.\n\nSupporters of the bill have said the point wasn't to keep children off the platforms but to force platforms to change their addictive ways.\n\nSenate revised age verification process and social media definition\n\nThe revisions made to the bill aimed to clarify what social media features would trigger the ban and address privacy concerns around the age verification process. However, the bill remained mostly intact as it moved through the legislature.\n\nSenators tweaked the definition of social media platform, so that affected ones must in part have \"addictive features,\" including infinite scrolling, push notifications and auto-play videos.\n\nAnother change to the legislation, OK'd Wednesday, requires social media and pornographic platforms to offer an anonymous age-verification option to users by third-party services, which aren't allowed to retain personal identifying information.\n\n95% of teens between 13 and 17 use social media\n\nSocial media has become nearly ubiquitous among youth. The 2023 U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory on Social Media and Youth Mental Health found that nearly 95% of youth aged 13 to 17 use a social media platform, with more than a third saying they use it \"almost constantly.\"\n\nThe advisory concluded that more research is needed to fully understand the impacts of social media. But current research shows there are some benefits and \"ample indicators that social media can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.\"\n\nPotential benefits identified in the advisory were community, connection and self expression. It also stated that social media can support mental health of LGBTQ youth to help develop their identities. Additionally, seven out of 10 girls of color reported encountering identity-affirming content related to race on social media, the advisory stated.\n\nPotential harms of using social media included greater risk of suffering from depression and anxiety. Some studies also showed greater risk of negative health outcomes for adolescents girls including disordered eating and poor sleep.\n\nOhio, Utah measures restricting minor's social media use stalled by lawsuits\n\nFlorida isn't the first state to attempt to limit social media access for youth. Here are some other states' bills and how they got held up:\n\nOhio - The Social Media Parental Notification Act would have prohibited social media use for teens under 16 without parental consent. It was blocked by a federal judge after NetChoice, a trade organization with several social media companies as members, challenged the constitutionality of the law.\n\n- The Social Media Parental Notification Act would have prohibited social media use for teens under 16 without parental consent. It was blocked by a federal judge after NetChoice, a trade organization with several social media companies as members, challenged the constitutionality of the law. Arkansas - Similar to Ohio, this law would have required parental consent for minors to sign up for social media accounts. NetChoice sued the state for violating the First Amendment, and it has not gone into law.\n\n- Similar to Ohio, this law would have required parental consent for minors to sign up for social media accounts. NetChoice sued the state for violating the First Amendment, and it has not gone into law. Utah - In addition to requiring parental consent for minors to use social media, the Utah law also aims to keep teens offline between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. It was slated to go into effect in March, but that was pushed back to Oct. 1 as it faces lawsuits from NetChoice and digital rights group The Electronic Frontier Foundation. Lawmakers have introduced additional bills trying to limit social media for teens in the 2024 legislative session.\n\nCalifornia is also in a legal battle with NetChoice on a multifaceted law intended to safeguard children online.\n\nMeta opposes HB1 and NetChoice calls it 'unconstitutional'\n\nStill, Facebook's parent company Meta has been opposed to the legislation. In a letter to the House's Judiciary Committee for the original bill, the company argued it undercut parents' ability to make their own decisions about their kid's social media use and raises data privacy concerns.\n\n\"While our company recognizes the goals of House Bill 1, we believe this bill, as currently drafted, not only fails to empower parents to make the decision regarding whether their teen may use a social media platform but also fails to create robust, industry-wide standards that help parents and teens manage their online activity,\" the letter penned by Meta's Southeast public policy manager Caulder Harvill-Childs states.\n\nMeta spokesperson Rachel Holland said in an emailed statement Friday that HB 1 needs to provide clear rules for parents.\n\n\"Teens move fluidly across online services and youth online safety bills that hold different services to different standards in different states will subject teens to inconsistent protections online,\" said Holland.\n\nNetChoice's vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo previously called the bill \"unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"If enacted, it will jeopardize the privacy and security of Floridians who use the internet,\" Szabo said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY in January. \"The Free State of Florida deserves better than a massive, unconstitutional internet surveillance program.”\n\nTheir stance hasn't changed with the amendments to the bill as it heads to the governor's desk. \"We appreciate the changes to HB 1, but while the bill is less unconstitutional, it is still unconstitutional,\" Szabo wrote Thursday.\n\nContributing: Brandon Girod, Emilee Coblentz; USA TODAY Network", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/02/23/florida-social-media-ban-children-twitter-tiktok-facebook-instagram/72703860007/", "title": "Florida Legislature bans social media for kids.

Ron DeSantis, and without expressly laying out which platforms are prohibited. TikTok? Facebook? X (Twitter)? Instagram? YouTube?\n\nFlorida Legislature has been working on restricting minors' access to social media for some time, citing fears of bullying, sex trafficking, depression and suicide among the youth. A similar measure fell through in 2023, but it remained a top priority of House Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast.\n\nThis year, the Florida House's bill needed some reworking in the Senate to assuage some of DeSantis' concerns about privacy, but it was passed Thursday in the Senate and then, hours after the governor said he didn't think it was there yet, passed unchanged in the House. It now goes to DeSantis' desk.\n\nWhat does Florida HB 1 social media bill do?\n\nHere's what HB 1, Online Protection for Minors, does:\n\nRequires social media platforms to prohibit kids 15 and younger from creating new accounts, terminate existing accounts probably held by kids 15 and younger, and allow parents and children to request termination of accounts.\n\nRequires social media platforms to use reasonable age verification methods to verify the ages of account holders and disclose specified policies and provide specified resources, measures and disclaimers.\n\nAuthorizes the Department of Legal Affairs (DLA) to bring actions for violations under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.\n\nProvides penalties.\n\nDeclares that any social media platform accessible in Florida is subject to the jurisdiction of state courts.\n\nSupporters of the bill have said the point wasn't to keep children off the platforms but to force platforms to change their addictive ways.\n\nHB 1 also requires people visiting sites with adult material to verify their age through anonymous third-party services.\n\nWhat social media sites does HB 1 target?\n\nGood question, and one the legislators have avoided answering.\n\nInstead, the bill seeks to define qualities and practices the social media platform must have to be affected by the bill. The bill seeks to control online forums, websites or applications that do any of the following:\n\nUse algorithms that select and present content based on user information\n\nUse \"addictive features\" such as infinite scrolling push notifications or alerts visible markers of clicks, likes or reposts Video that plays without the user clicking on a play button Live-streaming functionality\n\nHas 10% or more users 15 years of age or younger who spend, on average, at least 2 hours a day on the platform\n\nThe bill excludes sites and services designed for email or direct messaging.\n\nWhat are the penalties for social media platforms?\n\nThe bill declares any knowing violation by the social media platform to be an \"unfair and deceptive trade practice\" subject to civil penalties up to $50,000 per violation, plus attorney and court costs. Persistent violations may incur punitive damages.\n\nIf the social media platform fails to terminate an account after a request from a minor account holder or their parent or guardian is liable for up to $10,000 in damages, plus attorney fees and court costs.\n\nIt also allows penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for third-party age verification services that violate the bill.\n\nSites or services with \"material harmful to minors\" can be hit with civil penalties from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation for every person under 18 allowed into their platform.\n\nWhat can someone do if their account is mistakenly deleted under the bill?\n\nUnder the bill, there is a minimum of 90 days for an account holder to dispute it and verify their age.\n\nWhen would the social media ban for minors go into effect?\n\nIf the bill is signed by the governor, the new law would go into effect July 1, 2024.\n\nWhat did Ron DeSantis think of the bill? Will he veto it?\n\nIn the hours between the Florida Senate and Florida House passing the bill, Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was hesitant about the bill due to the lack of parental override options.\n\n\"Parents need to have a role in this,\" DeSantis said at a press conference. \"I do think parents are concerned about social media and what goes on there, and I do think they think it's a problem. But I also think that for people that are in high school, it's not as simple.\"\n\nPreviously, DeSantis said he wouldn't support the bill if he didn't think it would pass \"legal muster.\" Similar bills in other states that were not as restrictive have been challenged in court.\n\n\"To say that someone that is 15 just cannot have it no matter what, even if the parent consents, that may create some legal issues,\" DeSantis said in response to a question at a news conference in Kissimmee on semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n\"I am concerned about the breadth of it, and I want to empower parents, I want to give parents tools to be able to do this, so I just think you have to be smart with how you do it,\" he added.\n\nDeSantis has not said whether he would sign HB 1 into law.

Social media platforms will be required to terminate existing accounts suspected to belong to children under 14, with a 90-day window for appeals.\n\nWhile the law goes into effect on the first of January, it has already been challenged on First Amendment grounds. Attorney General Ashley Moody’s office announced last month that the state would not be enforcing the law on major social media platforms until the court rules on a motion for preliminary injunction. A hearing will be held in late February.\n\nThe part of the law requiring websites with \"materials harmful to minors\" visible to Floridians to use age verification systems will still go into effect.\n\nWhile there's no way to know how this will shake out, here's what will happen if the law is allowed to stay in place.\n\nWhat does Florida's HB 3 social media ban do?\n\nHB 3, Online Protections for Minors, would:\n\nProhibit any child under 14 years of age from creating or possessing an account on a social media platform, as defined in the law\n\nRequire social media platforms to terminate any accounts held by someone under 14 years old, with a 90-day appeal period\n\nRequire parental permission for social media accounts for minors 14 or 15 years of age\n\nRequire social media platforms to terminate any accounts held by someone 14 or 15 years old unless a parent or guardian has provided consent, with a 90 appeal period\n\nRequire social media platforms to use third-party age verification methods on new accounts\n\nAllow minors younger than 14 or their parent or guardian to request account termination, to be performed within 10 business days\n\nThe bill also specifies that personal information used in age verification may not be stored, and allows actions to be brought against social media platforms that violate the bill which may also include civil penalties up to $50,000 per violation.\n\nIn a separate section, the bill requires any website with \"materials harmful to minors\" such as sexual content that is visible in Florida to age verification to prevent access by anyone under 18 years old.\n\nIs Pornhub blocked in Florida? Adult site shuts down in states that require age verification\n\nWill the Florida social media ban for children affect Facebook? X? Instagram? Threads? TikTok?\n\nThe legislators refused to list specific sites during discussions of the bill.\n\nPractically every online site or service requires users to create an account, and most of them have some sort of social aspect to them. According to the bill, social media platforms affected by this bill would be any online forum where:\n\nUsers can upload content or view the content or activity of other users\n\n10% or more of the daily active users who are younger than 16 spend an average of two hours a day or longer\n\nThe site uses algorithms to analyze user data or user information and select what users will see\n\nAny of the following \"addictive features\" are used: Infinite scrolling (content that continuously loads without the need to move to refresh or move to a new page Push notifications or alerts about specific activities or events related to the user Displays of user likes, shared or reposted metrics Video that plays without users clicking on it Livestreaming\n\n\n\nThat description would seem to include sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter).\n\nSites that are used exclusively for email or direct messaging limited to sender and recipients are not considered social media for the purposes of the bill.\n\nWill the Florida social media ban for children affect Bluesky?\n\nIt's up to interpretation if it would include newer X replacements such as Bluesky, as Bluesky does not currently include algorithms or livestreaming, although it possesses some of the other stated requirements such as infinite scrolling.

A similar promise made in his first administration to deport people at a large scale didn't happen because of legal obstacles. Experts say this time could be different.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party in its platform said as president this time he would usher in the \"largest deportation program in American history.\"\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump and his surrogates amplified examples of undocumented immigrants accused of committing violent crimes, and promoted widely debunked claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating pets.\n\n\"We're going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country and we're going to start with Springfield and Aurora,\" Trump said at a news conference earlier this year. Many immigrants in Springfield have temporary legal status, but Trump has promised to revoke their permission to stay in the country.\n\nHere's what we know about the president-elect's deportation plans:\n\nWhat has Trump said about mass deportation?\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump did not release detailed plans on how he would deport the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. But he offered a glimpse into what he might do in campaign speeches and in comments made by his advisers.\n\n“President Trump will restore his effective immigration policies, implement brand new crackdowns that will send shockwaves to all the world’s criminal smugglers, and marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history,” Trump's national campaign press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said.\n\nFormer administration officials have told USA TODAY that a mass deportation effort would need to include the help of the U.S. military, local governments and private companies that contract with the government.\n\nA USA TODAY review last month found options available to Trump may include emergency and executive powers to bypass existing protections for immigrants; activation of provisions once used to detain people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War II; the use of local and state police agencies to find and arrest undocumented immigrants; deployment of military and National Guard members; and the redirection of federal employees and resources.\n\n“If I thought things were getting out of control, I would have no problem using the military,” he said in an interview with TIME earlier this year.\n\nTrump's campaign website also said he would \"deport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again.\"\n\nThough a scale-up of deportation actions would surely meet resistance in the courts from immigration and civil rights advocacy groups, Trump could face fewer legal obstacles than he did in his first term. He appointed hundreds of judges to courts that previously hindered his attempts.\n\nHow much could it cost?\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance has estimated Trump's actions could result in 1 million people being removed from the country each year, a pace the nonpartisan American Immigration Council estimated would cost about $88 billion annually. To deport all the people in the U.S. without authorization would take about a decade and cost nearly a trillion dollars, the council said.\n\nIt could be big business for private companies that contract with the government to help detain migrants. Private contracts already exist for nearly every step of the deportation process, including facilities housing people in detention, transportation – including private flights to deport someone to their home country – and security.\n\nCongress currently funds Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold 41,500 people in detention each day, a number that peaked at about 55,000 during Trump's first term. The American Immigration Council estimates that deporting 1 million people per year would require that capacity to increase by a factor of 24.\n\nBIG BUCKS IN DEPORTATION PLAN: A cost to taxpayers, billions for big business from Trump's deportation promises\n\nContributing: Nick Penzenstadler, Lauren Villagran, Bart Jansen and Aysha Bagchi, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/11/13/how-would-trumps-deportation-daca-plans-affect-wisconsin-immigrants/76114317007/", "title": "How would Trump's deportation, DACA plans affect Wisconsin ...", "text": "Updated Nov. 13, 2024, 12:01 p.m. ET\n\nSince Donald Trump was elected to a second term, Melissa Soberalski's West Allis immigration law firm has fielded hundreds of calls and emails from clients concerned about their future in the U.S.\n\nShe wants to make sure people are prepared for the worst-case scenario, but she also wants to be realistic and not scare her clients unnecessarily. It's a difficult balance to strike.\n\nTrump's immigration plans are becoming more defined as he builds his administration. And it's clear that undocumented people across Wisconsin could face deportation, even those not convicted of crimes.\n\nThis week, Trump named Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner, as deputy chief of staff for policy. And Tom Homan, who led U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement when families were separated during Trump's first term, will oversee the northern and southern borders as the \"border czar.\"\n\nSoberalski is concerned about what Miller's stated plans to \"turbocharge\" a program to strip citizenship from certain immigrants says about the administration's determination to carry out many of their policies.\n\n\"If they're going to start targeting that group, to me, that says it's like no-holds-barred,\" she said. \"They're going to go after everyone.\"\n\nErin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School, believes the second Trump administration is more prepared this time and will follow through on its policy promises. That means organizations like the legal clinic are readying themselves and their clients for what's ahead.\n\n\"It is very terrifying, I think, for everybody involved in immigration and especially for some of the most vulnerable people in our country,\" Barbato said. \"It seems monumental right now, what we are preparing for.\"\n\nWhat would mass deportation look like in Wisconsin?\n\nMass deportation was a hallmark proposal of Trump's presidential campaign. But it's unclear to what extent widespread deportations will be possible in the next four years.\n\nThe financial and logistical challenges of carrying out a mass deportation effort are likely to be enormous, experts say. The estimated cost of a one-time mass deportation aimed at the country's over 13 million undocumented individuals would be at least $315 billion, according to the American Immigration Council. Plus, federal immigration agencies do not currently have the detention space nor the manpower for such an operation and would have to expand substantially.\n\nTrump has said his plan has \"no price tag.\"\n\nMuch is still unknown about how the policy would be implemented — even Sen. Ron Johnson said a nationwide dragnet is unrealistic — but reports indicate migrants considered threats and those convicted of crimes will be the first priority for deportation, and that workplace raids are likely.\n\nEarlier this year, Homan said: “No one’s off the table. If you’re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”\n\nTrump and advisers have suggested deploying the National Guard and local police departments friendly to Trump to make arrests and run detention camps, even sending them into states that do not cooperate.\n\nAfter the election, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, cast doubt on that likelihood, saying, \"I think most governors of either party don't want to see\" National Guard troops from one state going into another.\n\nThe Biden administration has generally deported people convicted of serious crimes, but has not prioritized large workplace raids and people without criminal records, Soberalski said.\n\nDeportations were high during the first Trump administration, at times sweeping up people who were never charged with or convicted of any crimes, Soberalski said. Workplace raids are expected to be a priority of the new administration.\n\n\"Sometimes those raids would be at restaurants, local diners, car washes, and those had a crippling effect to some of those local businesses,\" Soberalski said of previous deportation sweeps. \"All of a sudden their whole workforce was gone.\"\n\nEven if Wisconsin's Democratic governor and attorney general oppose the mobilization of the state's National Guard troops and police officers for a mass deportation effort, undocumented Wisconsin residents are not immune from being deported.\n\nBoth Immigrations and Customs Enforcement — known as ICE — and Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, are able to make deportation arrests in southeast Wisconsin, even if local law enforcement declines to help. One reason: CBP is allowed by law to board vehicles and vessels without warrants to search for undocumented people within 100 miles of a border, which includes Great Lakes coastlines.\n\nPlus, in about seven Wisconsin counties, including Waukesha, ICE agreements give local enforcement the authority to detain people or even act as immigration officers.\n\nCan undocumented immigrants be quickly deported without a hearing?\n\nIn general, people who are picked up for deportation are owed due process by law. They may stay in the U.S. while waiting for immigration judges to hear their cases, which may take years because the courts are heavily backlogged.\n\nTrump's advisers have indicated they could try to expand the use of a process called \"expedited removal,\" which would seek to quickly deport people en masse by circumventing the court system.\n\nExpedited removal has generally been used for people close to the border and for people in the U.S. under two years. But Trump's goal of extending its use to the interior of the U.S. is likely to face legal challenges, Barbato said.\n\nWhat is the future of DACA, asylum, refugee resettlement?\n\nTrump's first administration unsuccessfully tried to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which allows young adults who came to the U.S. as children to stay and work here. His team has indicated it will try again to end the program, and a lawsuit against DACA is likely to make it to the Supreme Court during his next term.\n\nSoberalski and Barbato are urging DACA recipients — also known as Dreamers — to renew their status right away if it expires any time in 2025. That way, they will have a work authorization card for the next two years.\n\nDACA recipients should speak with their attorneys about other pathways they may be able to take, Barbato said.\n\nTrump and his advisers have also touted a number of other immigration policies, including:\n\nRestarting a program to require migrants to await their asylum hearings in Mexico;\n\nUsing Title 42, a public health rule in place during the pandemic, to turn migrants away at the border on the grounds they would bring contagious diseases;\n\nSuspending refugee resettlement, which was sharply curtailed during Trump's first administration;\n\nPausing or adding roadblocks to certain legal immigration pathways, such as family and work visa categories that are especially backlogged, like green card applications for highly skilled Indian workers;\n\nReviving a ban on travel to the U.S. from certain Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThere is also continued uncertainty whether Afghans and Ukrainians who came to the U.S. under special humanitarian programs in the last three years will be given a pathway to permanent residency.\n\nLegal challenges to several of these proposals are likely, as well as pushback from businesses and tech firms that rely on immigrant workers.\n\nThe mass deportation of undocumented workers would have a huge economic impact, argues the American Immigration Council, including a reduction in tax revenues, Social Security contributions and the gross domestic product.\n\n\"Mass deportations would cause significant labor shocks across multiple key industries, with especially acute impacts on construction, agriculture, and the hospitality sector. We estimate that nearly 14 percent of people employed in the construction industry are undocumented,\" reads a report on the costs mass deportation from the American Immigration Council, which is a pro-immigration think tank. \"Removing that labor would disrupt all forms of construction across the nation, from homes to businesses to basic infrastructure.\"\n\nWhat should one do to prepare?\n\nSoberalski recommended a few steps immigrants concerned about their future can do:\n\nFind trusted legal advice and learn what your options are;\n\nMake a preparedness plan in the event someone in your family must leave, sorting out issues like child care, finances and power of attorney;\n\nKnow the rights you have if you are stopped. Carry any legal immigration documents with you, but do not carry false identity documents.\n\n(This story was updated to add a video.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/immigration/2025/11/20/president-trump-has-driven-migration-back-into-the-shadows/86817959007/", "title": "President Trump has driven migration back into the shadows", "text": "Nov. 20, 2025, 3:16 p.m. ET\n\nIt was still dark as hundreds of migrants walked along a road in Tapachula, Mexico, headed north to the United States as police emergency lights flashed.\n\nAmerica's influence colors the mass of migrants.\n\nOne wears Dak Prescott's Dallas Cowboys uniform. Another sports a New York Yankees baseball cap. Yet others wear a Nike t-shirt and a Tommy Hilfiger hoodie, iconic brands coveted by U.S. teens.\n\nThe group of migrants — young men and women, and parents with their children — made up one of the last caravans in January 2025 to be quickly dispersed by Mexican immigration officials as they attempted to head toward the U.S.\n\nThe migrants were motivated by frustrations with the glacial pace of Mexican immigration officials processing their documents and well-founded concerns over the pending inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nLike previous caravans, the hundreds of migrants walking together further visualize the U.S, Mexico's and Latin America's immigration crisis. In a unified effort, many of those countries have cracked down on what was once a lifeline of mass migration in seven years.\n\nOver 67 caravans left Central America and Southern Mexico between 2018 and 2025, according to an estimate by Eduardo Torre Cantalapiedra, a researcher at the Mexican El Colegio de la Frontera Norte. The caravans brought together over 100,000 migrants who hoped to reach the U.S.\n\nMass migration has occurred for decades, but it has remained largely unseen. The crisis of the arrival of unaccompanied minors at the border and the formation of these massive caravans made migration visible to the American public.\n\nBecause of the caravans, the migrants found protection and did not have to pay migrant smugglers to escort them through Mexico, but this had a contradictory effect.\n\nThe caravans became a dog whistle for Trump and MAGA supporters who painted them as an invasion of America. The dozens of caravans since 2018 became a significant point of contention in the U.S., driving political debates over border security, asylum policy and bringing about a crisis across the southern border, especially in El Paso.\n\n\"We've just gone full circle,\" Yael Schacher, an immigration historian and director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International, said. \"The caravans, this idea of safety in numbers, has basically been flipped on its head, because the Trump administration drums up a threat of invasion.\"\n\nThe massive movement of migrants — where caravans started with a few hundred people, but grew to upwards of 5,000 people — led to Trump's shut down of the border earlier this year.\n\nIn desperation, President Joe Biden launched the CBP One application to create an orderly means of requesting asylum at the border and ease the pressure created by the migrant caravans at the border. Mexico and Central America joined in the crackdown.\n\nGone was the practice that provided safety for migrants who regularly faced kidnappings, disappearances and extortions from Mexican law enforcement and immigration officials, cartels and other criminal groups.\n\n\"The caravans were a lifeline,\" Bartolo Fuentes, a Honduran congressional representative and radio journalist who accompanied the caravan in 2018, said. \"Instead of going secretly — where in any mountain you can be assaulted or killed, or falling off the train — to go in a caravan, to support each other, and to seek the protection of authorities was to prevent these people from taking risks by going clandestinely.\"\n\nMaking migration 'visible'\n\nEarly in the morning in October 2018, hundreds of migrants set out from the bus station in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, en route towards the border with Guatemala — and ultimately the United States.\n\nPeople began to gather at the bus terminal days prior. They were drawn by social media posts and group chats that promised security in the caravans for those who wanted to leave the country.\n\nThe caravan would grow as it set out north. They were looking to escape the country following the illegal re-election of Juan Orlando Hernández and subsequent violent crackdowns on the opposition and protests.\n\nBy the time the caravan reached the Guatemalan border with Mexico, it was estimated by reporters at the scene and international aid organizations that as many as 5,000 people were traveling north, including migrants from El Salvador and Guatemala who had joined en route.\n\nOther caravans set out in the months and years that followed, drawing widespread news coverage in the United States and the international media.\n\n\"Honduran migrants played a very important role,\" Manuel Flores, a researcher with FLASCO Honduras, said, \"they made (migration) visible.\"\n\nEventually, tens of thousands of migrants set out from Honduras north over the next couple of years as part of the caravans. They faced intense government-led pressures to stop them, the rain and cold, hunger and thirst, and intense exposure to the sun as they pushed forward north.\n\nThe caravans became an option for the poorest, as there were no migrant smugglers to pay.\n\nThe October caravans were inspired by a previous caravan that had caught attention in the United States. Hundreds of migrants set out from the southern Mexican city of Tapachula towards Tijuana, Mexico, at the end of March 2018.\n\nThe caravan was organized by the group Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which advocates for migrants rights. It caught the attention of Trump, who took to Twitter in April to rage against the perceived threats of hundreds of migrants setting out north.\n\nIn a post, Trump tweeted: \"Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!\"\n\nMonths later, the Trump administration pressured the governments of Guatemala and Mexico to stop the caravans. Guatemalan National Civilian Police and Mexican federal police looked to block the migrants from crossing the ports of entry, but to no success.\n\nOfficials quickly sought to identify who the organizers of the caravans were as they advanced. Fuentes was one of the first accused of being an organizer.\n\nFuentes accompanied the first caravan that left in October 2018, reporting on their progress for a local radio station. He walked with them to the border with Guatemala, but he was detained by the Guatemala authorities and returned to Honduras because of accusations of being the organizer of the caravans.\n\nHe was forced into exile for several years to avoid threats and possible prosecution brought against him by the Orlando Hernández administration.\n\nWhat made the Honduran caravans different?\n\nTraveling in a caravan is not new in Central America or Mexico.\n\nWhat made the migrant caravans new was their socially organized nature. The group of migrants stuck together to find security and made group decisions about where and when to stop.\n\n\"Caravans are socially organized structure way of people moving,\" Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said. \"I think a lot of people that end up coming to Mexico are not necessarily always traveled in that organized fashion.\"\n\nCaravans have long been used in Central America and Mexico for religious purposes and as a form of protest. There were previous caravans organized by migrants as far back as 2016, when Cuban migrants organized caravans to draw attention to the lack of opportunities in their home country and to protest the lack of options for them in Mexico and Central America, Ruiz Soto said.\n\nBut the organizers in Honduras found a direct inspiration in the caravans of the mothers from Central America who would travel to Mexico to search for their missing loved ones who had disappeared while migrating north, Fuentes said. Each year, these mothers were joined by religious leaders as they traveled through Mexico to raise awareness of the dangers of migrating through Mexico.\n\nA shift in migrant caravans\n\nMultiple caravans followed — all seeking to reach the United States.\n\nAt first, most caravans headed for Tijuana, Mexico, but soon enough, they began traveling to other parts of the border, including El Paso. The Trump administration pressured the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to stop the caravans, which initially granted humanitarian visas to migrants.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic would close the border, but that didn't stop people from seeking to reach the border and request asylum. The numbers grew as Venezuelans, Cubans, Haitians and Ecuadorians followed the route north following the post-pandemic economic crisis in Latin America.\n\nThey cut new routes through remote communities in the Darién Gap in Panama as they headed north. While they were not traveling in organized groups through Central America, they quickly formed caravans once they reached Mexico, in protest of policies meant to deter them from heading north towards the border.\n\nBut the caravans began to find less support from Mexicans.\n\n\"Among the Mexican public, the caravans became a representation of the lack of respect for the law,\" Ruiz Soto said.\n\nThe shift in public opinion came as the United States was beginning to pressure Mexico to further crackdown on the caravans.\n\nThe first crackdowns\n\nThe caravans began to find fleeting successes following the expanding crackdowns in Mexico and Central America\n\nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador ordered immigration officials in coordination with the National Guard in Mexico to stop migrants from crossing the country in 2020.\n\nBy 2023, the Mexican government maintained a policy of containing migrants in southern Mexico.\n\nGuatemala too began to block the Honduran caravans from crossing the national territory in 2021. In January of that year the Guatemalan police and military blocked a caravan of hundreds of Hondurans in the rural village of Vado Hondo, Guatemala, over 30 miles from the border. Everyone was rounded up and returned to the border.\n\nFuture caravans from Honduras and El Salvador would be stopped by Guatemalan officials at the border. But the wave of Cubans, Haitians and Venezuelans migrants found little resistance as they passed through the Central America, as they were not joining caravans until they reached Mexico.\n\nThe numbers of people traveling in caravans began to further decline in June 2023 after President Joe Biden announced the blocking of accessing asylum between points of entry. Biden launched the CBP One application earlier in the year, which limited appointments for migrants to request asylum between points of entry.\n\nAs Mexico expanded its crackdown on migration, the various caravans that formed in southern Mexico or in Central America were contained or disbanded soon after setting out. The organizers of the caravans in Mexico have been arrested over accusations of human trafficking, but to date not one has been convicted.\n\nMigrants waiting to see what happens next\n\nThe inauguration of Trump earlier this year and the launching of his crackdown on immigration across the country brought uncertainty for migrants across the hemisphere.\n\nThe abrupt closure of CBP One app on Jan. 20, the expanding deportations and the militarization of the U.S. border with Mexico led many across the region to think twice about seeking to migrate to the United States. Many migrants who were left stranded by the closure of the app began returning south towards their home countries.\n\nBut the flow of migrants heading north has not completely stopped.\n\n\"Statements that there is no longer migration are lies, there is (migration occurring),\" Juan José Hurtado, the director of the Guatemalan immigrant rights advocacy group Pop No'j, said. \"The only thing is that this represents more costs and more risks.\"\n\nBorder Patrol agent encounters with migrants drastically declined throughout fiscal year 2025, with just over 443,000 migrants arriving at the southern border with Mexico, according to data from the CBP. There were over 47,000 encounters in the El Paso sector, which includes El Paso and Hudspeth counties and extends to the New Mexico border with Arizona.\n\nThe encounters in fiscal year 2025 represent a massive drop when compared to the previous years. They reached their peak at 3.2 million encounters in fiscal year 2023. Of those encounters, 427,471 encounters occurred in the El Paso Sector in 2023.\n\nBut the Trump administration's crackdown on irregular migration has had repercussions for those who look to pay a migrant smuggler, commonly known as a coyote in Guatemala or a pollero in Mexico. It has made the trip more dangerous as well, as migrants now face kidnappings, extortion and the threat of deportations.\n\nThe cost for a migrant guide or smuggler are currently between $16,000 to nearly $20,000, Hurtado and other advocates in Guatemala said. Schacher too has also heard of migrants paying smugglers as much as $20,000 for transit from Costa Rica.\n\nThe rising cost and uncertainty in the U.S. have potential migrants waiting to see what happens in the north before making the decision to seek to risk their lives in route to the border, Hurtado, who works in the department of Huehuetenango in the western highlands of Guatemala, said.\n\nThe region has a long history of sending migrants north, where they have found opportunities not available at home, and now they are waiting to see what the outcome of the 2026 midterms are before setting out.\n\n\"Their eyes are always set on the north,\" Hurtado said.\n\nChanging migratory routes\n\nThe most recent caravans involved migrants seeking help to escape the limbo they find themselves in after the shut down of CBP One and the lack of access to asylum at the U.S. border.\n\nSome migrants are looking else where to seek the immigration relief and economic opportunities.\n\nGuatemalans, Hondurans and Ecuadorians, among others, are increasingly looking towards Spain as their destination. Others have looked to Germany too as an option.\n\n\"Spain became the second destination for Hondurans,\" Flores said. \"and it's impressive because it's had an exaggerated growth.\"\n\nFlores has marked a sharp increase in the last decade of Hondurans leaving for Spain. The majority have been women, according to his data.\n\nBut this is an option for those with financial resources. Those without money are left to languish along the route or to make their way home slowly.\n\n\"If they have the money, then Spain is an option for them,\" Schacher said. \"But the stranded people are really the ones that really just don't have that kind of resources. Whatever resources they had to try the first time, and now they're stuck, or they only have enough money to get back to where they came from. So, that's an option for the wealthy only.\"\n\nJeff Abbott covers the border for the El Paso Times and can be reached at:jdabbott@gannett.com; @palabrasdeabajo on Twitter or @palabrasdeabajo.bsky.social on Bluesky.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/02/12/biggest-news-you-missed-weekend/97821920/", "title": "Biggest news you missed this weekend", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nUpdated Feb. 12, 2017, 6:22 p.m. ET\n\nTrump assesses options on immigration ban\n\nPresident Trump is assessing all of his legal options on a proposed travel ban from seven predominantly Muslim countries, with options ranging from appealing to the Supreme Court to revising the executive order that has triggered massive protests, a senior adviser said Sunday. \"The bottom line is that we are pursuing every single possible action to keep our country safe from terrorism,\" policy adviser Stephen Miller told NBC's Meet The Press, in one of a series of appearances on Sunday show interviews.

What the latest polls say?", "text": "April 4, 2025 Updated April 7, 2025, 2:06 p.m. ET\n\nPresidential approval ratings are an indicator of how Americans feel about how the president is doing his job. But events of the day or issues at hand...such as the exploding trade war and worst U.S. stock market drop in years, can cause dramatic swings from week to week.\n\nLaunching a historic global trade war, President Donald Trump announced at least 10% tariffs for 'all' countries with much higher rates for some countries or trading blocs on Wednesday. China was among the hardest hit with a 54% total tariff, to which they have since responded with retaliatory 34% tariffs on US goods.\n\nTrump's presidential approval ratings remained steady over the first two months despite the adminstration's chaotic start, even reached his all time highest rating in either of his terms. But a dip, a drop or a plunge is now showing the temperature of the American public's opinion has soured.\n\nThe most recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found 49% of registered voters approved of Trump’s job performance, compared to 52% last month in same poll. Although the drop, he is still polling higher favorability over the 46% that disapprove.\n\nThis poll also found that 54% of voters think Trump is doing a better job than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, noting that this figure is also lower than his 58% job approval last month over Biden.\n\nAccording to the most current Reuters/Ipsos poll, 42% of approve of Trump's job performance compared to 45% just a couple weeks prior. His overall rating remains higher than his first term and higher than what Biden polled during most of his administration.\n\nWhen asked about the general direction of the country, only 22% of those polled felt things were heading in the right direction while 61% felt they are off on the wrong track, although on the direction of the national economy and politics scene the polls showed a more wait and see attitude — 30% right direction, 53% wrong track and 17% said they didn't know. Employment and jobs and inflation teetered in similar percentages.\n\nTrump is still getting higher marks on the direction of his immigration policy with 48% approval versus 44% that disapprove. On the topic of how Trump was handling Russia 48% disapproved and on Ukraine, 46% disapproved, with many still not sure yet.\n\nOn the topic of tariffs, the poll asked \"In general, when the U.S. charges tariffs on imported goods, American workers come out ahead\" and the response was that 45% disagreed, while 31% agreed and 14% were unsure.\n\nAs for Vice President JD Vance, he has a 41% favorable view versus 49% unfavorable and special government agent Elon Musk showed a 39% favorable versus 57% unfavorable.\n\nHere's what the most current polls show about Trump's presidential ratings right now.\n\nWhat is Trump's current presidential approval rating?\n\nIn the Economist/YouGov poll, Trump's favorability stood at 48% versus 49% unfavorable. Meanwhile Vice President JD Vance's favorability polled at 43% versus 46% unfavorable and House Speaker Mike Johnson had a 30% favorability versus 37% unfavourability.\n\nThis poll included approval ratings on some high profile Democrats as well, such as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer with a 24% favorability compared to a whopping 50% unfavourability.\n\nOf those polled, an overwhelming majority prioritized inflation and prices, followed by jobs and the economy and then healthcare above other issues.\n\nThe national NBC News poll shows Trump's approval rating at 47% with more registered voters seeing the US as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004. However, the majority of Americans still say the country is on the wrong track and he holds a higher rate of 51% that disapprove of his performance as president right now, according to the report.\n\nThe poll shows that despite the slightly higher disapproval numbers over Trump's overall presidential job performance, the margin is closer than at any other point during his first term. Other noteworthy results of the poll include an increased number of Republicans identifying with MAGA, more Americans \"have come around\" on his deportation-focused immigration policies and they like the general concept behind the Department of Government Efficiency and Trump's efforts to cut government jobs and spending.\n\nOne poll result in particular showed that voters are evenly split on the 2026 midterm elections as a divided Democratic party, facing record-low popularity, is trying to figure how to respond to Trump. That record low shows just 27% of registered voters viewing the Democratic party positively, among a total that included 59% of self identified Democrats.\n\nRealClear Polling which encompasses 13 different pollsters, including those mentioned above, shows Trump's overall favorability dropping to 47.6% versus 49.8% that disapprove, as of today.\n\nNote: Polls are constantly changing and different pollsters ask different varieties of the population.

The impact is intensifying on both the government employees who missed a payday Friday — some of them forced to work anyway, some of them furloughed — and on other Americans who want to take an airline flight, visit a national park or eat FDA-inspected food.\n\nWith the political heat rising, this would be the moment during previous shutdowns when the White House and Congress would agree to some face-saving compromises to fund the government, at least for the short term.\n\nThis time, though, there are few signs that President Trump and newly empowered House Democrats are about to budge. Here are five likeliest scenarios to end the shutdown —and why none of them are likely to happen.\n\nStart the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\n#1 President Trump caves\n\nFacing polls that show him getting most of the blame, the president agrees to the Democrats’ proposal to fund most government agencies and pass a short-term bill for the Department of Homeland Security to continue the battle over building a wall along the southern border, his signature campaign promise and current non-negotiable demand.\n\nWhy it won’t happen: The last time Trump agreed to this very deal, in December, he was savaged by conservative talk-show hosts Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter. Since then, the president has promised his base that he isn't giving an inch.\n\n#2 Speaker Pelosi caves\n\nWith the shutdown hurting Americans and blocking the agenda Democrats had hoped to pursue in the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi agrees to a deal that includes some funding for the wall, perhaps splitting the difference between $1 (the number she jokingly agreed to) and $5.7 billion (Trump's demand).\n\nWhy it won’t happen: Just as the Republican base views building the wall as a matter of principle, the Democratic base views not building the wall as a matter of principle. What's more, this standoff is the first test of Pelosi's leadership since Democrats regained control of the House. She wants to show her troops that she can be as tough as Trump.\n\n#3 Senate Republicans bolt\n\nThe House already has passed the funding bill that the GOP-controlled Senate approved last month. Republican senators, especially those who are up for re-election next year, have grown increasingly anxious about the potential political costs for them back home from the extended shutdown. They could approve the measure and send it to the White House.\n\nWhy it won’t happen: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (who happens to be one of those GOP incumbents up in 2020) has made it clear that he’s not challenging the president. He says he won’t allow a bill to be brought up on the Senate floor that Trump won’t sign.\n\nIt's also unlikely that Congress could override a Trump veto. Ironically, the Republican-controlled Senate conceivably could muster the two-thirds support needed. But in the Democratic-controlled House, where most Republicans represent districts dominated by GOP voters, those representatives aren’t likely to allow to join with Democrats to support an override.\n\n#4 They go big\n\nThe White House and congressional Democrats agree on the sort of ambitious compromise on immigration that has eluded Washington for years. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is close to Trump, has suggested a trade-off that would provide money for Trump’s wall and codify protection for the so-called DREAMers, young undocumented people brought to this country when they were children who now face an uncertain future. This deal might also include thousands of other immigrants who came to the United States with temporary visas because of crises in their home countries.\n\nWhy it won’t happen: Trump has given no sign that he’s interested in doing this, and neither have congressional Democrats. What’s more, neither side, and especially congressional Democrats, trusts the other to live up to a deal. It's similar to one that was being negotiated a year ago, only to have Trump publicly disavow it.\n\n#5 Declare an emergency\n\nThe president declares a national state of emergency at the border and moves to divert funds from the Pentagon to begin building the wall, pre-empting Congress' role in allocating money. Trump has publicly suggested this option, although he has been reluctant so far to move ahead. He and Congress would still need to take separate action to fund the government agencies now affected by the shutdown.\n\nWhy it won't happen: It would surely spark court challenges, and wall construction would likely be blocked by the courts until the legal issues are considered. While the president says he \"absolutely, 100 percent\" has the authority to act, even some of his own advisers have told him that he doesn't. He's also being cautioned by some Republicans who warn he would be setting a precedent for a similar exercise of extraordinary presidential power by a future Democratic president.\n\nThat said, some analysts see Option #5 as the mostly likely way out of the current cul-de-sac.\n\nWhen the president delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 29, will the shutdown be over? In normal times, the answer would be yes. In today's world, don't hold your breath.\n\nNational Weather Service: No shutdown for agency 'tirelessly' forecasting snowstorm", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/25/trump-first-week-presidential-power-executive-orders/77928113007/", "title": "Trump's first week: New president moved with lightning speed to ...", "text": "Jan. 25, 2025 Updated Jan. 27, 2025, 11:43 a.m. ET\n\nDeportations. Firings. Pardons. A blizzard of executive orders.\n\nAnd the Gulf of Mexico became the Gulf of America.\n\nPresident Donald Trump moved with dizzying speed during his first week back in power as he began the process of enacting his agenda.\n\nTrump’s aggressive use of presidential power out of the starting gate left some observers stunned and his supporters cheering as he wasted little time delivering on a slew of campaign promises, sometimes in provocative and boundary-testing ways.\n\nHealth agencies went quiet after a pause was ordered on external communications. Employees overseeing diversity efforts in the federal workforce were put on leave, with plans to fire them. At least one plane was loaded with undocumented immigrants to whisk them out of the country. Pardons were handed out to nearly every person convicted for storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe moves sent shock waves from Washington to the nation's southern border as Trump’s disruptive agenda came into clearer focus.\n\nMuch of the transformation was foretold by the president's hard-charging campaign, where he railed against former President Joe Biden’s policies and promised a radically different approach, and by a transition period that saw him stock his administration with people viewed as eager to dramatically remake government.\n\nYet the breadth and the tempo of the changes were remarkable.\n\n“The Trump team is moving much more swiftly and aggressively than it did eight years ago,” GOP consultant Mike DuHaime said of the president’s efforts to overhaul federal agencies.\n\nTrump showed in his first week that he plans to test the limits of presidential power. Among his first actions after taking office Monday were the Jan. 6 pardons – which concerned even some GOP leaders because they included many people who assaulted police – and an executive order doing away with birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nA judge appointed by former Republican President Ronald Reagan quickly shot the order down, calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional,\" after 22 Democratic-led states challenged it in court. The ruling indicated there are still some checks on Trump's power, but he vowed to appeal and seems determined to keep testing the Democratic system of checks and balances.\n\nTrump's victory in November also brought unified GOP control of Congress. And with the Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority, the stage is set for a big spree of conservative policymaking.\n\nMajor legislation is in the works tackling immigration, taxes and other issues. That could take months, though. Trump's opening salvo shows there are plenty of levers he can pull to start overhauling federal policies and agencies.\n\nHarrison Fields, Trump's principal deputy press secretary, said the president wasted no time delivering on his campaign promises of “securing the border, restoring common sense, driving down inflation, and unleashing American energy.”\n\n'Testing bounds'\n\nTrump's busy and consequential first week shouldn't be surprising, said Marc Short, who was chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence during Trump's first administration.\n\nWhen he first took office in 2017, Trump was still struggling to consolidate support within his own party and learning how the federal government works. He squeaked into office with narrow victories in a few swing states, and his team wasn't as prepared.\n\nThe past week is a product of everything Trump and his allies experienced over the past eight years. They learned to wield power during the first administration and, after he lost in 2020, plotted how to wield it again if he returned.\n\nTrump is now surrounding himself with people he views as more loyal and trusted, according to allies, who are true believers in his agenda. And he has consolidated support within the GOP, which has empowered him.\n\n“I think he’s more comfortable,\" Short said. \"I think people forget that eight years ago he was in a position of still unifying the Republican Party, and that’s not the position he's in today.\"\n\nTrump has a lot more leeway now from his party and corporate America and is \"testing bounds,\" Short added.\n\nThat's reflected in his choice of unconventional Cabinet members and in executive orders like one keeping the social media company TikTok operating, despite a law passed by Congress ordering its Chinese parent company to sell it to American buyers or close down, he said.\n\nTrump isn't just pushing legal boundaries, Short added, noting that the pardons of people who assaulted police officers on Jan. 6 test the \"the bounds of traditional Republican coalitions,” which have long supported law and order. Biden's pardons for his family members and others on his last day in office make it easier for Trump and his supporters to shrug off any criticism, though.\n\n\"Biden gave him enormous cover,\" Short said.\n\nRemaking the federal government\n\nWhile the Jan. 6 pardons were controversial even among some Republicans, other Trump first-week actions have broader support.\n\nCombating the \"deep state\" has long been a central focus for Trump, and Republicans for generations have campaigned on reigning in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe president accused bureaucrats of undermining his first administration, and he wants a more compliant workforce this time.\n\nSo Trump's first week included a barrage of actions targeted at federal workers and agencies.\n\nTrump sought to end work-from-home for many federal workers and ordered diversity, equity and inclusion offices to close, their employees put on leave and plans drawn up to fire them. About 160 National Security Council employees were told to stay home while their positions were evaluated, The Associated Press reported. Meanwhile, at least 15 senior Justice Department officials were reassigned as the agency realigns to focus on immigration.\n\nHealth agencies were told not to communicate with the public, temporarily pausing everything from advisories to scientific reports, website updates and social media posts until Feb. 1. While there are exceptions for emergencies, some health experts are concerned.\n\nPublic health requires \"incredible coordination\" between officials from the local up to the federal level, said Dr. Marissa Levine, a retired professor of public health practice and the former state health commissioner for Virginia. Levine was health commissioner during the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and worked closely with federal officials.\n\nBeyond the short-term implications for public health, the pause in communications raises long-term questions about the politics surrounding health agencies. If these agencies are viewed as too political, they could lose public trust, Levine said.\n\n“The message that seems to be coming across is that this is going to be controlled under our political perspective,\" Levine said. \"Can I trust that? I don’t know. I worry about it.\"\n\nOverall, conservatives are eager to see the federal bureaucracy tamed, Short said, arguing it has \"grown way too large.\"\n\n'America is back and open for business': Trump speaks to leaders at World Economic Forum in Davos\n\nCulture wars\n\nThe overhaul of federal agencies is a prime target for Trump’s culture war promises on issues such as DEI, but Trump’s first week was a culture shift in many other ways.\n\nHe thrilled anti-abortion activists with a memorandum reinstating a policy preventing federal funding for organizations in other countries that support abortions.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order promoting cryptocurrencies, which he embraced during a campaign that heavily targeted young men who often are crypto enthusiasts. Trump has his own crypto venture that has soared in value lately.\n\nThe blitz of aggressive policymaking also plays into the swaggering, macho approach he has long cultivated and is infused throughout his MAGA movement.\n\nRetribution\n\nTrump also took aim at people with whom he has clashed.\n\nHe revoked security clearances for 51 former intelligence officials he has criticized for signing a 2020 letter saying the disclosure of information from Hunter Biden's laptop \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"\n\nHe also revoked the security clearance and protective detail for John Bolton, a former Trump administration official turned critic, and the security detail for former federal health official Dr. Anthony Fauci, another person who served under him but has since been critical.\n\nTrump also fired the head of the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and as many as 17 inspectors general at various federal agencies.\n\nImmigration raids\n\nWhile health agencies were quiet, Trump officials were making plenty of noise about immigration enforcement, Trump's signature campaign promise and a major preoccupation of the new administration.\n\nTrump had campaigned on the promise of mass deportations, and border czar Tom Homan said before the inauguration to expect \"shock and awe\" on the immigration issue.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Friday that \"deportation flights have begun\" and shared pictures on X of people loading into a military plane.\n\n\"President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences,\" Leavitt added.\n\n(In reality, deportation flights had never stopped. Tom Cartwright, who tracks flights for advocacy group Witness at the Border, reported the Biden administration averaged six deportation flights per weekday over the six months through December.)\n\nUnlike the blitz of other Trump actions, though, ramping up deportations will take longer to unfold. The Department of Homeland Security this week deputized thousands of additional federal law enforcement officers to arrest immigrants, including U.S. Marshals and DEA agents.\n\nTrump also ordered more U.S. troops to the border this week to help support immigration enforcement, even as illegal crossings remain at a five-year low.\n\nTrump promised to remove millions of immigrants in the country illegally. He fell short of that promise during his first administration, removing roughly 935,000 people over four years.\n\nHow extensive Trump's deportation push and other actions will be remains unclear. What's certain is there is more to come from the new administration.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/01/22/trump-executive-order-refugee-admissions-program-immigration/77846744007/", "title": "Trump halts refugee admissions to US. We won't be deterred | Opinion", "text": "Bob Elston\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nJan. 22, 2025, 5:15 a.m. ET\n\nI have worked in refugee resettlement for the Ethiopian Community Development Council for much of the past four years, helping mostly Afghan and Ukrainian refugees find housing in communities in the Washington, D.C., metro area.\n\nIt is a tough sell to persuade a landlord to sign a $2,000-per-month lease with a family that has only been in the country for a few days and does not yet have any income, driver’s licenses or Social Security numbers. One day I walked into an apartment complex in Northern Virginia where I approached a woman at the front desk. I reassured this leasing agent that my resettlement agency can help pay rent for a short time until the family takes over payments. She said, “Who is going to help us?”\n\nI immediately knew what she meant by “us.” She questioned my choice to help newcomers from foreign lands at a time when many Americans like her need help, too. She politely told me they did not have any apartments. I thanked her and left.\n\nThe next day, my phone rang. That same leasing agent said she persuaded her manager to make units available for my refugee families.\n\nTrump executive order suspends refugee resettlement, leaving 2,000 Afghans in limbo\n\nPresident Donald Trump's victory in November was owed to a substantial portion of the electorate who want America to enact tougher rules on immigration and close its borders. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order that indefinitely suspended the resettlement of refugees in the United States. Among those affected are about 2,000 Afghan refugees whose entry into the United States could now be blocked.\n\nYet, as Trump's second administration begins, I have placed my faith in Americans like that reluctant leasing agent who has the dexterity to simultaneously extend a helping hand to others while also looking for someone to do the same for her.\n\nAfter all, most of the refugees I resettle have helped America and now look to us to return the favor. Many of them stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States during the two-decade war in Afghanistan or, in the case of Ukrainian refugees, fled advancing Russian invaders. They had worked as local staff in U.S. embassies, the United Nations or with the U.S. military.\n\nFor many, coming to the United States was not their Plan A. They enjoyed good lives, held good jobs and lived in nice homes until the Taliban began going door-to-door in the fall of 2021 looking for them by name. I’ve heard many stories of Afghans tossing the evidence of their ties to the United States on the fire (only later to be asked to produce it to qualify for a visa), flipping their house keys to a relative and heading for the nearest border crossing or international airport.\n\nI also have helped dozens of Afghans navigate the labyrinthian U.S. immigration system, which requires several years of filling out forms and undergoing extensive background checks, medical clearances and months in refugee camps before arriving on American soil. A friend whom I had last seen when I was working in Kabul called me out of the blue and said, “Bob, I’m in Virginia. Now what do I do?” I totally forgot that helping people flee persecution and violence is not the end of the story, only the beginning.\n\nIn recent years, I have picked up dozens of refugee families at Washington Dulles International Airport and reminded them in the car that there is no time to watch Netflix or sleep off jetlag. They must urgently begin to look for an apartment, register their kids in school, open a bank account and find jobs. Once the bills start coming in America, I say, they will never stop.\n\nEvery refugee struggles out of the gate, and I sometimes worry they will never make it. But I am usually proven wrong, as many find stability and get comfortable navigating American society more quickly than I thought possible.\n\nI once lay on the floor with a pregnant Afghan woman as we took turns with a screwdriver trying to disassemble a used sofa that we had gotten wedged while carrying it through her front door. A year and a half later, that mother invited me to watch her son graduate from a Virginia middle school with honors. Today, she and her husband are saving for a house with a backyard for her kids to play.\n\nSome of the refugees I once helped are now my colleagues at the resettlement agency, assisting newcomers going through the same struggle.\n\nIn addition to helping immigrants discover the promise of America, the most gratifying aspect of my work in resettlement is witnessing the spontaneous generosity of ordinary Americans.\n\nI once took six Afghan children to a halal market and the person behind me in the checkout line insisted on splitting a $250 grocery bill when she heard that it was the kids’ first day in America.\n\nLast month, a retired scientist in Maryland fished a prayer mat out of his basement for me to give to any Muslim refugee who might need one. He also handed me a generous check to support an emergency fund I created to help pay for unexpected crises − such as an overnight stay for an Afghan mother and four kids stranded at the airport or an elderly Ukrainian man found sleeping in his car.\n\nEach morning, I check the fund’s balance and see new small dollar contributions from ordinary people trying to make a difference in the lives of others.\n\nRefugees' immigration status often is uncertain\n\nThough my Ukrainian and Afghan clients and colleagues are all here legally, their immigration status can still be precarious.\n\nUkrainians are panicking because their temporary protected status – extended on Jan. 10 by the Biden administration to some but excluding those who arrived after August 2023 – expires next year. It then will be up to the Trump administration to decide their fate.\n\nAs for the Afghans, they entered the country legally but with temporary humanitarian parole status, and most now have pending applications for asylum in hopes of staying permanently. Their asylum applications may face heightened scrutiny, and their efforts to bring close family members such as parents to the United States from Afghanistan might find a difficult and time-consuming process even more so.\n\nAs Trump carries out his policies, I worry that the immigration status of my friends and colleagues will soon be up to his administration.\n\nEven so, I remain optimistic that nothing he does will shrink the big hearts of the many Americans like the leasing agent who went out of her way to help people who came here in search of the hope and freedom that America has always stood for.\n\nBob Elston is a grant writer for the Ethiopian Community Development Council, which was launched in 1983 to help Ethiopians displaced by conflict.

But to his frustration, he has begun running smack into constraints mandated by the Constitution and imposed by political reality.\n\nWithout acknowledging he's being forced to trim his sails, the president is moving to delay some campaign promises and downsize others, steps that sometimes have been overshadowed by a continued stream of the defiant tweets that marked his political rise.\n\nA moratorium on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations? While insisting the administration will prevail over a federal judge's decision blocking implementation of the executive order he signed, the White House is drafting a narrower version designed to avoid some of the judicial objections. Confront China? In a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping late Thursday — and in a wake of a diplomatic firestorm over Trump's post-election conversation with Taiwan's leader — Trump explicitly endorsed the \"one China\" policy. Immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act? Now he says crafting a replacement, an issue that divides congressional Republicans, may extend into 2018.\n\nTo be sure, Trump has taken steps that have had immediate consequences, from pulling out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal (though it hadn't taken effect yet) to clearing the way for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.\n\nBut he's discovering how the Constitution's structure, federal laws and rival power centers — from state governments to federal bureaucrats to foreign capitals and the news media — make leadership in the Oval Office a more complicated calculation than in the corporate suite.\n\n\"He lived in a world where, by and large, he got his way, and when he didn't get his way, he would sue people or they would sue him,\" says Tom Cronin, a Colorado College political scientist and co-author of The Paradoxes of the American Presidency. Trump seems \"annoyed\" by the steep learning curve, Cronin said, and is discovering \"He can't quite sue the Senate.\"\n\nOn CBS' Face the Nation Sunday, White House policy adviser Stephen Miller said the president was assessing his options on the immigration ban. \"For one thing, we can take the case to the Supreme Court on the emergency stay; we can go back to the district court and we can have a hearing on the merits,\" he said. \"Additionally, we're considering new and further executive actions that will enhance the security posture of the United States.\"\n\nTrump is the first president in history never to have served in the government or the military before moving into the White House. That was a potential vulnerability he turned into an asset during the campaign, portraying himself as a no-nonsense business leader with the strength and skills to negotiate deals and manage the economy in ways that had eluded his presidential predecessors. \"I alone can fix it,\" he declared in his speech to the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nAnd he is hardly the first president who has been frustrated by the limits of his authority and the power of others. Last year, federal courts blocked an executive order signed by President Obama offering some protection to an estimated 4.3 million illegal immigrants who were parents of U.S. citizens or lawful residents. In 1998, the House of Representatives impeached President Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice, though he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nBut Trump's impatience, his combative persona and his preference for unilateral action — characteristics that may have served him well in the real estate business — have brought more confrontations with a sharper edge than other modern presidents in the early days of their tenure. He hasn't shown the traditional public deference for the co-equal branches of government, deriding a \"so-called judge\" who ruled against him in the immigration case and labeling Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer as \"head clown.\"\n\nIt's just possible that memories of that moniker may not be helpful when Trump needs to lobby Schumer for support on legislation.\n\n\"Being head of a family business is just about the worst preparation imaginable for the institutional constraints of Washington,\" says William Galston, a veteran of the Clinton White House staff. \"Donald Trump is in for a set of experiences that will be entirely novel to him.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThe first 100 days of the Trump presidency\n\nAide Stephen Miller takes vigorous Trump defense to TV Sunday shows\n\nTrump team assesses legal options on travel ban\n\nSo far, Trump hasn't moderated his rhetoric or tempered his tweets. On Saturday night, he bashed the news media. \"I am so proud of my daughter Ivanka. To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful!\" On Sunday morning, he turned his fire on billionaire Mark Cuban, a critic who endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president last year. \"I know Mark Cuban well,\" Trump wrote. \"He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls. He's not smart enough to run for president!\"\n\nHowever, he has moderated some of his policy positions, from the timetable for repealing Obamacare to the specifics of the immigration ban. Trump told reporters he continues to believe that waterboarding was effective in interrogating terror suspects, but he said he would defer to Defense Secretary James Mattis, who opposes them. After meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week, European Union leaders said they had been assured the United States would uphold the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump denounced during the campaign.\n\nThe president's meeting Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will test Trump's new, more skeptical stance toward expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank.\n\nCharlie Black, a Republican consultant who has known Trump for years, predicts that some of the skills the president honed negotiating real-estate deals will end up working in the Oval Office as well. \"He had a lot of wins and losses,\" including some that demanded patience in negotiations with banks. His strengths as a salesman could be used to persuade members of Congress, Black says: \"He ran into barriers before. He'll have to adapt to them.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/12"}]}

An estimated total of 4 to 7.6 million people participated in September's Global Climate Strike, which took place before the 2019 UN Summit. At the congregation, the 16-year-old Swede berated world leaders for not doing enough to stop climate change.\n\n\"We are in the beginning of mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?” she said.\n\nHer first address to the UN took place in Poland at the United Nations COP24 Climate Summit last year, where talks culminated to nearly 200 nations agreeing to rules that will govern the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nLast month, Thunberg won the Right Livelihood award, often referred to as the \"Alternative Nobel,\" for \"inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.\"\n\nJacinda Ardern\n\nNew Zealand's 40th prime minister Jacinda Ardern was catapulted into the international spotlight after a mass shooter terrorized two Christchurch mosques, killing 50 people and injuring dozens more in March.\n\nIn weeks after the attack, she led lawmakers to vote 119 to one to ban most automatic and semi-automatic weapons. She simultaneously promised her nation's parliament that she wouldn't promote the shooter's notoriety and refused to repeat his name.\n\nArdern is New Zealand's youngest leader in decades and was the second elected leader to give birth while still in office.\n\nAbiy Ahmed\n\nThe Ethiopian prime minister clinched a peace deal last year that ended 20 years of military stalemate between his country and their northern neighbor Eritrea. According to TIME, at least 70,000 people were killed since the border disputes began in 1998, five years after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia.\n\nAlthough thousands of political prisoners have been freed since Ahmed took office in April 2018, Ethiopia's internal issues still divide the country.\n\nReporters without Borders\n\nReporters without Borders (RSF) is the largest non-government organization that specializes in defending media freedom. They were at the forefront of voices who spoke out against Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year.\n\nRSF has organized a petition that calls on the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to release the 28 journalists and bloggers that are currently detained. According to their website, the number of imprisoned journalists has doubled in Saudi Arabia since the crown prince was appointed in 2017.\n\nRaoni Metuktire\n\nRaoni Metuktire, an indigenous chief from the Kayapó tribe in Brazil, was nominated by a number of environmental activists for his work protecting the Amazon rainforest, according to Reuters.\n\nThe 89-year-old, first introduced to the world in the late 1980s by British musician Sting, resurfaced to the limelight this year as the Amazon rainforest was on fire. The Brazilian chief met twice with French president Emmanuel Macron, Reuters reported, who stemmed the international campaign to bring awareness to the burning rainforest.\n\nAlexis Tsipras and Zoran Zaev\n\nThe Nobel committee could also choose to acknowledge the joint leadership of Greece's Alexis Tsipras and North Macedonia's Zoran Zaev. The two prime ministers put 30 years of acrimony between their neighboring countries behind them when they agreed that the former Yugoslav republic should officially be renamed from Macedonia to North Macedonia and Greece should drop its objections to its neighbor joining NATO.\n\nContributing: Associated Press.

The group opposes the use of drone strikes, and the attempt to extradite National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nThe peace prize is awarded annually to an individual who has worked for \"fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"\n\nPetitions have no bearing on the selection of a recipient for the $1 million prize, though they are often submitted on behalf of a candidate, according to the Nobel prize committee.\n\nManning, an Army private first class who who faces up to 90 years in prison, was nominated by Mairead Maguire, who won the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize along with Betty Williams for trying to resolve hostilities between the Irish Republican Army and the British government.\n\nMaguire is an anti-war activist and has championed the cause of the Palestinians, having taken part in an attempt to bust a naval blockade that Israel imposes against the designated terrorist group Hamas to prevent weapons from entering Gaza.\n\nIn her nomination of Manning, Maguire said his leaks of classified information helped end the war in Iraq by hastening foreign troop withdrawals and also helped prevent further U.S. intervention in the Middle East.\n\nMonday's petition was given to the Nobel committee by Norman Solomon, co-founder of RootsAction, who told Reuters that giving the prize to Manning would help repair the Nobel panel's reputation following its choice of Obama for the 2009 peace prize.\n\n\"There's a cloud hanging over the Nobel Peace Committee,\" Solomon said.\n\n\"In a sense, the Nobel Peace Prize at this point needs Bradley Manning more than Bradley Manning needs the Nobel Peace Prize,\" he said. \"There has now grown a question about the Nobel committee's commitment to human rights and peace in an even-handed, independent way.\"\n\nManning, 25, was convicted earlier this month of espionage and theft for releasing more than 700,000 battlefield videos, diplomatic cables and other secret documents to the website WikiLeaks, whose founder Julian Assange is holed up in the Ecuador Embassy in London to avoid a court-ordered extradition to Sweden on suspicion of rape.\n\nA representative of the Nobel committee said the petition would not influence its decision.\n\n\"The Nobel Peace Prize is not a popularity contest and a large number of signatures will neither help nor hinder (Manning's) candidacy,\" said Asle Toje, the Norwegian Nobel Committee's research director.\n\nThe winner of the 2013 Peace Prize will be announced Oct. 11.

You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”\n\nIf selected, the teen would be the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate since Malala Yousafzai.\n\nHere are some of the things to know about the teen climate change activist:\n\nShe founded 'Fridays For Future'\n\nThunberg first came to global attention with #FridaysForFuture, an international movement that began in 2018 when Thunberg, then age 15, started taking weeks off school to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament to protest against inaction on climate change.\n\nShe posted her protests on social media, and her postings went viral, inspiring thousands all over the world to protest their respective governments.\n\nShe has encouraged other students to skip school to join protests demanding faster action on climate change.\n\n\"We are facing a disaster of unspoken suffering for enormous amounts of people,\" Thunberg said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. \"Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that homo sapiens have ever faced.\"\n\nShe has addressed two United Nations' summits by the age of 16\n\nThunberg garnered international attention at the United Nations COP24 Climate Summit in Poland last year, when she told assembled world leaders that they “have ignored us in the past, and you will ignore us again,” she said. “You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.”\n\nThe climate talks that culminated at the summit resulted in nearly 200 nations agreeing to rules that will govern the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nThis year, she spoke through to tears to hundreds of world leaders in New York, pleading that \"People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of the mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?”\n\nThe speech once again went viral.\n\nShe recently led potentially the largest climate rally ever\n\nBefore the 2019 UN Summit, millions of people around the world took part in September's Global Climate Strike, and estimates of total crowd sizes reached between an estimated 4 million to 7.6 million people.\n\nOn Sept. 20, and during the weeks following, millions marched through cities around the globe.\n\nThunberg marched in New York City, where she addressed thousands of strikers, exclaiming to the crowd, \"This is an emergency. Our house is on fire.\"\n\nShe has given President Trump the glare\n\nAfter Thunberg delivered her emotional speech to world leaders at the UN in September, news cameras captured her staring at President Donald Trump when he arrived in the same lobby she was in.\n\nTrump tweeted after her speech that, \"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\" the President wrote over Thunberg's quote. \"'So nice to see!\"\n\nThunberg responded by changing her Twitter bio to replicate his tweet.\n\nTrump had been at odds with world leaders specifically on climate after he announced in 2017 that the U.S. would formally withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. He made an unexpected appearance at the UN climate summit in September, for a total of 14 minutes.\n\nShe's testified before Congress\n\nThunberg was one of the witnesses to testify in September before a joint hearing of two House committees on the “global climate crisis.”\n\nDuring the hearing, she had a simple message for American lawmakers: Do something.\n\nInstead of planning a lengthy opening statement to start the hearing, Thunberg simply offered a copy of the 2018 global warming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that emphasizes the dire threat that human-caused global warming poses, along with the climate and economic impacts.\n\n\"I am submitting this report as my testimony because I don’t want you to listen to me,\" Thunberg told lawmakers. \"I want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take real action.\"\n\n'I want you to take action': Greta Thunberg testifies before Congress\n\nShe's been recognized by Time Magazine\n\nIn Time Magazine, Thunberg was featured as a \"next generation\" leader and was on the magazine's 2019 \"100 list\" of the world’s most influential people.\n\nIn May of 2019, the teen activist was featured on the magazine's cover.\n\n“The world is listening. Organizers estimate that on March 15, a remarkable 1.6 million people in 133 countries participated in a climate strike inspired by Thunberg’s solo action,” the magazine's passage about her reads.\n\nShe sailed across the Atlantic, rather than fly\n\nIn August, Thunberg again captured global attention when she set off from Plymouth, United Kingdom, on a two-week zero-emissions boat voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City.\n\nThunberg popularized the movement of flygskam, or flight shaming, which asks Swedes to travel according to their beliefs.\n\nThunberg wouldn't fly to the U.S. ahead of the United Nations meeting on climate because of emissions from air travel. So, she and a crew traveled on a zero-emissions racing yacht.\n\n\"It is insane that a 16-year-old would have to cross the Atlantic Ocean to make a stand,\" she said. \"The climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis, the biggest crisis that humanity has ever faced, and if we don't manage to work together and to cooperate and to work together despite our differences, then we will fail.\"\n\nShe has been praised, and criticized, by world leaders and celebrities\n\nAs Thunberg's name earned global recognition, world leaders and celebrities offered their praise, and criticism.\n\nThunberg met with former President Barack Obama during her visit to Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to lobby lawmakers on environmental issues and protest outside the White House.\n\nIn a tweet, Obama called Thunberg one of the “planet's greatest advocates.\"\n\nCalling the outspoken teen one of her favorite \"gutsy women,\" Hillary Clinton, former secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, encouraged her Twitter followers to join in the Global Climate Strike in September.\n\nHowever, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Thunberg's most recent UN speech, calling her “a kind and very sincere girl” who doesn’t understand the complexities of “the modern world.”\n\nThunberg hit back similarly to Trump's criticism of her, once again simply changing her twitter bio.\n\nShe is on the autism spectrum — and she calls being 'different' a 'superpower'\n\nIn a post about haters who use her Asperger's diagnosis to try to diminish her activism, Thunberg called her autism a \"superpower.\"\n\n\"When haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you’re winning!\" Thunberg wrote. \"I have Asperger’s syndrome and that means I’m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And — given the right circumstances — being different is a superpower.\"\n\nShe told the New Yorker: “I see the world a bit different, from another perspective. I have a special interest. It’s very common that people on the autism spectrum have a special interest.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/05/24/what-is-the-nobel-peace-prize/73619359007/", "title": "What is the Nobel Peace Prize? Most famous past winners.", "text": "May 24, 2024 Updated Sept. 23, 2024, 7:38 a.m. ET\n\nThe coveted Nobel Prizes are announced annually, and last year's lineup featured several American winners.\n\nA Harvard economics professor won, as well as University of Pennsylvania researchers for their work in developing mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and a scientist and emeritus professor at The Ohio State University. Three U.S.-based scientists won for their work in chemistry.\n\nWith over 400 winners, the United States has the most Nobel Prize winners of any country.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Prize?\n\nThe Nobel Prize is a set of awards given each year to those who “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,” founder Alfred Nobel said.\n\nNobel was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist, businessman and writer, according to the Nobel Prize organization. When he died, he left most of his fortune to establish these prizes.\n\nThe categories are physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. There is also the Prize in Economic Sciences, created in 1968 with a donation from Swedish central bank Sveriges Riksbank.\n\nThe nomination process for Nobel Prizes begins in September each year, with thousands of academics, scientists, past winners and parliamentary members submitting candidates. According to the Nobel Prize organization, the nominators are chosen to represent as many countries and universities over the years as possible.\n\nNobel specified in his will that Swedish institutions would be responsible for selecting the winners of the Nobel Prizes. The Norwegian Parliament was to select the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. He also asked that the ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize be held in Norway. Today, Nobel Day is celebrated by presenting the prizes on December 10, the day Nobel died. The other Nobel Prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, as requested in Nobel’s will.\n\nThere are a few exceptions. Many prizes were not awarded during World War I and II. If a noteworthy work is not identified, the Foundation does not have to honor that category that year. For example, the Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded in 1966, 1967 or 1972.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nPerhaps the most well-known of the awards, Nobel wrote in his will that the Peace Prize would go to those \"who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congrundefined\n\nIn the past, the awards have prioritized politicians who promote international peace through diplomacy, though they also honor humanitarian work. The work of a Peace Prize winner typically falls into one of these areas:\n\nArms control and disarmament\n\nPeace negotiations\n\nDemocracy\n\nHuman rights\n\nImprisoned Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi won the Peace Prize in 2023. Mohammadi has been in and out of prison for the last decade and is currently serving a 10-year jail sentence on false charges of \"spreading propaganda.\" Mohammadi has been described as the \"undisputed leader\" of a mass protest movement against Iranian authorities after they cracked down on how women are allowed to behave and dress. She is the vice president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran.\n\nWho won the Nobel Prize 2023?\n\nAll categories were honored last year and announced in October 2023. Up to three people or institutions can split the award. Here's who won:\n\nHow much is a Nobel Prize worth?\n\nNobel Prize money comes from Nobel, who wanted his wealth to be invested into a fund for the prizes. The interest on that money is used for the prizes today. Last year’s prize money was worth 11 million Swedish krona, or almost $993,000.\n\nWho is the most famous Nobel Prize winner?\n\nWhile some of the Nobel Prize’s archived winners are known more for their contributions than their fame, there are some household names that have received the award.\n\nFour U.S. Presidents and one Vice President have won the Nobel Peace Prize:\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt in 1906\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson in 1920\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter in 2002\n\nVice President Al Gore in 2007\n\nPresident Barack Obama in 2009\n\nOther notable laureates, according to the Nobel Prize archives, include:\n\nMarie Curie won the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics along with her husband Pierre. Curie also won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.\n\nIvan Pavlov won the 1905 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine\n\nAlbert Einstein won the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics\n\nErnest Hemingway won the 1954 Nobel Prize in literature\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. won the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nMother Teresa won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nDesmond Tutu won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nElie Wiesel won the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nToni Morrison won the 1993 Nobel Prize in literature\n\nMalala Yousafzai was one of two recipients of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nBob Dylan won the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature\n\nOnly two Nobel Prize laureates have ever declined the prize. French playwright Jean-Paul Sartre had a reputation for declining all official honors and continued that tradition with the 1964 Nobel Prize in literature. Le Duc Tho was responsible for negotiating a cease-fire agreement with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger during the Vietnam War. The pair were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, but Tho declined, saying he was not in a position to accept it.\n\nAdolf Hitler forbade three German Nobel Prize laureates from accepting the Nobel Prize, and Boris Pasternak, awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in literature, was coerced by Soviet Union authorities to decline.\n\nPast Nobel Prize winners: Only 64 women have won.

It's World Mental Health Day — and the U.S. still has 40,000 suicides each year\n\nEvery 13 minutes, someone in the U.S. commits suicide. The nearly 40,000 American lives lost each year make suicide the nation's 10th-leading cause of death, and the second-leading killer for those ages 15-34. On Friday, the World Health Organization sponsors World Mental Health Day to raise awareness about mental health issues around the world and focus efforts on supporting those afflicted. It is held every year on Oct. 10, and this year's theme focuses on living with schizophrenia.\n\n2. Committee on Homeland Security holds hearing in Dallas airport to discuss Ebola response\n\nThe committee, led by Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, will hold a hearing in Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Friday to work out an appropriate response on federal, state and local levels. Following the death of Thomas Eric Duncan — the first person killed by the Ebola virus in the United States — officials throughout the country have been taking steps to ensure the disease does not spread nationwide. Five airports, not including Dallas/Fort Worth, have committed to enhancing screenings for Ebola.\n\n3. Nobel Peace Prize awarded\n\nMalala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi won the 95th Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for their work promoting education rights for children in a year that has been anything but peaceful. The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited the two \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.\"\n\n4. IMF and World Bank hold Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will come together for their yearly Annual Meeting starting Friday to discuss \"issues of global concern\" in the economic sector. The weekend-long series of meetings brings leaders from both organizations and a number of leaders from around the world.\n\n5. Landon Donovan kicks professional soccer career as he plays his final game\n\nOne of Los Angeles Galaxy's stars is about to dim, as Landon Donovan prepares for his last game on Friday as a professional player. It will be an appropriately grand occasion, complete with banners and tributes and videos and speeches and, in all likelihood, a few trickles of tears from arguably America's best soccer player ever.

President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory despite widespread belief that he lost in a landslide. Machado spoke out forcefully at the time, saying she could prove Maduro was routed 67% to 30% by challenger Edmundo González.\n\nNobel winner counting on Trump, US to help in Venezuela\n\nWill Freeman, fellow for Latin American studies at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, said Machado is \"very courageous\" and lauded her selection for the award.\n\n\"She reunited, helped reunite, and mobilized the Venezuelan opposition at a time in which it was very fragmented and it wasn't necessarily clear it would have what it took to mobilize millions of people to vote in a rigged election,\" he said.\n\nThe fact that the military sided with Maduro, keeping him in power, Freeman added, did not detract from her bravery that in the aftermath, her efforts \"kept open a certain amount of space for dissent and opposition in Venezuela.\"\n\nWhile there are other Venezuelans who have also been outspoken in defense of human rights and democracy for their country, Freeman believes Machado stands out.\n\n\"That fact that she was actually there on the ground in Venezuela, organizing in the midst of this really repressive environment, and we believe is still there, now in hiding, is very courageous,\" he said.\n\nThe Nobel committee said they chose Machado for “promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela.”\n\nTrump had not, as of midday Oct. 10, commented on the Nobel prize decision on his social media platform. But he reposted a statement from Machado saying Venezuelans are on the \"threshold of victory\" and \"more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve Freedom and democracy.\"\n\nTrump has ordered U.S. armed forces to conduct deadly strikes on what are nonmilitary boats speeding through the southern Caribbean Sea from Venezuela. The Palm Beach resident and members of his administration insist the vessels and their Venezuelan crews are trafficking in illegal narcotics.\n\nThe United Nations has denounced the deadly strikes that have reportedly killed dozens, saying international law does not allow governments to \"murder alleged drug traffickers.” The global body said criminal activity must be \"disrupted, investigated and prosecuted\" under the rule of law.\n\nAnd Colombian government officials are saying those killed in a recent strike on a boat were Colombians.\n\nMore than 600,000 Venezuelans in US face loss of legal status\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration is pursuing the deporation of more than 600,000 of Venezuelans who have found safe harbor in from the Maduro dictatorship under U.S. Temporary Protected Status.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump bombastically claimed Maduro had emptied Venezuela's prisons by sending Venezuelans to the U.S. and that as a result, Caracas was virtually crime-free.\n\nMachado was not a name that had been frequently mentioned as a potential winner. She was not, for example, among the 25 leading candidates one odds-making site, BetOnline.ag, released Oct. 9.\n\nThat list included nature defender David Attenborough, world hunger advocate Jose Andres and climate change activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

Categories, most decorated ...", "text": "Oct. 16, 2023 Updated Dec. 2, 2024, 9:19 a.m. ET\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are awarded each year on Dec. 10, the anniversary of founder Alfred Nobel’s death. The announcement of the prestigious prizes comes much earlier, however, and this year’s installment is here.\n\nImprisoned Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi won the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize. Mohammadi, who is currently serving a 10-year jail sentence on false charges of “spreading propaganda” is the fourth Nobel Prize winner jailed at the time of their awarding.\n\nHere are other notable facts about the highly coveted honors.\n\nHow many Nobel Prizes are there?\n\nThere are six Nobel Prize categories up for grabs. Alfred Nobel, an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist, businessman and writer, outlined the original five prizes in his will in 1895. In 1968, Sweden’s central bank created a sixth prize, The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel Prize in physics\n\nNobel Prize in chemistry\n\nNobel Prize in physiology or medicine\n\nNobel Prize in literature\n\nNobel Peace Prize\n\nThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel\n\nWho won the 2023 Nobel Prize?\n\nAll categories were honored this year and announced in October 2023. Up to three people or institutions can split the award. Here's who won:\n\nHow many Nobel Prize winners are there in the world?\n\nThe Nobel Prizes, including the prize for Economic Sciences, have been awarded 621 times – 117 physics awards, 115 chemistry awards, 114 for medicine, 116 for literature, 104 for peace and 55 economic sciences awards.\n\nThere have been 965 individual Nobel Prize winners and 27 winning organizations in the history of the awards.\n\nHas anyone won 2 Nobel Prizes?\n\nYes, though only one person has been awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes. Linus Pauling, an American chemist and anti-nuclear advocate, won the chemistry award in 1954 for his research on the nature of the chemical bond and the Peace Prize in 1962 “for his fight against the nuclear arms race between East and West.”\n\nFour other individuals and two organizations are multi-prize winners. American physicist John Bardeen, who discovered the “transistor effect,” is the only person to have won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice in 1956 and 1972.\n\nScientist Marie Curie, whose work with radioactive elements led to cancer treatments and X-rays, is the only person to have won two different science categories. She was also the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She won the physics prize in 1903 and the chemistry prize in 1911.\n\nFrederick Sanger is another double Prize winner, having won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1958 and 1980. Sanger’s methods helped determine the complete amino acid sequence of insulin and the ordered sequence of DNA molecules. His work “laid the foundations of humanity’s ability to read and understand the genetic code,” Scientific American reported.\n\nK. Barry Sharpless won the chemistry award twice, once in 2001 and again in 2022. The American chemist’s awards recognized his work on \"chirally catalysed oxidation reactions\" and, most recently, the development of click chemistry.\n\nTwo organizations have won multiple Nobel Prizes, both for the Nobel Peace Prize. The International Committee of the Red Cross has three – one from 1917 for care of wounded soldiers during World War I, in 1944 for its work in World War II and in 1963 for “promoting the principles of the Geneva Convention and cooperation with the UN.”\n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees won the Peace Prize once in 1954 and again in 1981.\n\nJust Curious for more?

The nonprofit's chief operating officer, Mashal Husain, is assuming the title of president.\n\nVilsack — whose four years as ag secretary under President Joe Biden and eight years under President Barack Obama made him the longest-tenured holder of that office in modern U.S. history — will take the reins at the hunger-fighting nonprofit on March 1.\n\nBranstad — who holds the record as longest-serving Iowa governor and was U.S. ambassador to China during President Donald Trump's first term — announced in November he would retire as World Food Prize president Jan. 31. He held the position for nearly two years and presided in 2023 when the award was doubled from its previous $250,000.\n\nPaul Schickler, the foundation's board president, said Vilsack has deep knowledge of complex food, hunger and farm issues and the diplomatic skills needed to find solutions. Vilsack's experience \"uniquely positions him to engage global stakeholders and foster meaningful collaborations,\" said Schickler, former president of DuPont Pioneer, the seed giant that's now Corteva Agriscience, with large operations in Johnston.\n\nVilsack, 74, told the Des Moines Register that his new job will enable him to focus on farmers’ roles in reducing global food insecurity, which powers world “strife and instability.\"\n\n\"Eighty-five percent of the areas in conflict are also suffering from food insecurity,” which encompasses about \"1 of every 11 people on this earth,\" said Vilsack, who previously has served on the foundation's board.\n\nThe group, he said, “lifts up that issue and recognizes the role of agriculture — farming, ranching and innovation — in solving problems.”\n\nThe World Food Prize brings hundreds of people — a mix of world political leaders, scientists, corporate executives, policymakers, activists and smallholder farmers — to Iowa’s capital each fall to discuss ways to battle global hunger.\n\nThe group's weeklong symposium culminates in a ceremony at the state Capitol to award the prize, which last year went to Geoffrey Hawtin and Cary Fowler, the duo who established the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, an underground facility in Norway that preserves genetic diversity in the world's seed stock.\n\nThe foundation “is an honest broker when it comes to convening dialog,” bringing people together without “a particular ideology or particular philosophy,\" Vilsack said. “It comes in with a problem: We need to feed the world. How do we do that?”\n\nHere’s what to know about Vilsack’s new job, his old job and Iowa’s role in the global fight against hunger.\n\nVilsack says World Food Prize strives to inspire next generation\n\nVilsack said the foundation works to inspire people who follow in the footsteps of Norman Borlaug, the native Iowan and 1970 Nobel Peace Prize recipient who was credited with saving a billion people from hunger with research that led to the creation of drought-resistant, high-yielding wheat varieties.\n\nBorlaug, remembered as the “father of the Green Revolution,” founded the World Food Prize in 1986 with help from John Ruan Sr., the late founder of Des Moines-based Ruan Transportation.\n\nIn addition to awarding its annual prize, the foundation oversees a Global Youth Institute that works in 20 states, including Iowa, and around the world to spark students’ interest in using science, technology, engineering and math to address the planet's challenges.\n\nThe foundation wants to “encourage and inspire the next generation of kids to become the next Norman Borlaug, the George Washington Carver, the Henry Wallace — folks who start companies, who make scientific advancements,” Vilsack says.\n\nLike Borlaug, Carver and Wallace are Iowa icons. Carver, born into slavery, earned bachelor's and master's degrees at what’s now Iowa State University and taught there before joining the Tuskegee Institution in Alabama, where he achieved international fame helping Southern farmers shift from cotton to peanuts and rejuvenate depleted soil.\n\nWallace, the son of an early ISU agriculture professor who met Carver when he was young, drew on Carver’s lessons in plant genetics and was a leader in U.S. farmers' adoption of hybrid corn seed.\n\nAmid a career that included serving as agriculture secretary, commerce secretary and vice president under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wallace formed what became Pioneer Hi-Bred Seed Co., which later merged with Dupont and now is part of Corteva Agriscience.\n\nHow does Iowa fit into the global effort to fight hunger?\n\nVilsack said Iowa, with decades of public and private investment in improving farming, plays an important role in helping to feed the world, exporting billions of dollars in grain, meat and renewable fuel globally.\n\nEven so, Iowans may not fully appreciate the World Food Prize Foundation, despite its year-round work and annual event, said Vilsack. Iowans are proud of their state fair, but there are 49 other state fairs, he said.\n\n“The World Food Prize event doesn’t happen anywhere else,” he said.\n\nHe said he wants the foundation to \"deepen and broaden the awareness of what we do” and sees its mission resonating with Iowans, who have an “incredibly soft spot in their heart for kids.” Many who most lack food security in the U.S. and the world are children.\n\nIowa children's futures are “directly connected to the stability of the world, and the stability of the world is directly connected to whether people are getting adequate food, so that they can recognize their potential, and so that they can create middle classes, and that they can create a functioning agricultural economy,” said Vilsack.\n\nWhat is Tom Vilsack most proud of during his time at USDA?\n\nSome “people think of USDA, and they immediately think of farmers. As they should,” Vilsack said.\n\nBut the department's mission also encompasses food and nutrition, rural development, food safety, research, forestry services, marketing and regulatory activities and animal health. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has about 100,000 employees and a nearly $200 billion budget.\n\n“I got like 12 children here, and to say which one I love the most is just really hard,” Vilsack said.\n\nStill, he is particularly proud of USDA achievements that include creating “new and better market opportunities for small-and mid-sized farming operations,\" an investment that's led to increased rural population after decades of decline; improved school lunch and summer food programs; a framework to reduce salmonella outbreaks; and addressing past racial discrimination in agriculture through lending and other farm programs.\n\nHe also said that while California is battling devastating wildfires, “the risk of catastrophic fires has been reduced\" as the USDA has used preventive practices such as prescribed burns, mechanical tree thinning and increased logging.\n\nOnly Iowan James \"Tama Jim\" Wilson served more than Vilsack's 12 years as agriculture secretary. Wilson's 16-year tenure from 1897 to 1913 under Presidents William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft made him the longest-serving of any Cabinet secretary in history.\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

The motto of the protests has been \"Woman, life, liberty,\" a phrase the committee mentioned in its announcement.\n\n\"She fights for women against systematic discrimination and oppression,\" Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the committee, said. She described Mohammadi as the \"undisputed leader\" of a \"whole movement.\"\n\nIn recent days, human rights groups have urged Iranian authorities to explain how a 16-year-old girl named Armita Geravand fell into a coma after an alleged encounter on a train with Iran's so-called morality police − evoking comparisons with Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old women who died in police custody last year after being accused of violating Iran’s hijab rules, which require women to cover their hair. After Amini's death, Iran passed a new \"hijab and chastity\" law that comes with fines and lengthy prison terms for breaking it.\n\nIranian state news agency Fars dismissed the significance of the peace prize, saying that Mohammadi had \"received the prize from Westerners\" and that she was jailed because of her \"acts against national security.\"\n\nWho is Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi?\n\nMohammadi has been imprisoned almost continuously since 2010, though she has managed despite those circumstances to continue her work highlighting rights abuses in Iran.\n\nHer husband and children live in exile in France.\n\nShe is the vice president of Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran, a banned organization in Iran that was co-founded by Shirin Ebadi, another peace prize recipient − Iran's first, and the first female laureate from the Islamic world − in 2003. Ebadi is a human rights lawyer and Mohammadi's mentor.\n\nMohammadi is being held at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison, known for overcrowding and other abusive conditions and whose inmates include political prisoners and those with Western ties, including several Americans who were recently freed as part of a prisoner exchange with Iran.\n\nAmericans freed from Iran: Here are their stories\n\nShe has been a target of Iranian authorities for more than 25 years. Reiss-Andersen said she has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five times. In total, she has been sentenced to 31 years in prison.\n\nHer most recent incarceration began when she was detained in 2021 after attending a memorial for a person killed in nationwide 2019 protests in Iran that were initially sparked by an increase in gasoline prices.\n\nThey have different causes and aims: But mass protests from Iran to Hong Kong accelerate\n\nIn 2022 Mohammadi published a book, White Torture, whose title is a reference to types of psychological torture such as sleep deprivation and solitary confinement that Iranian prisoners face.\n\nThe book collects the testimonies of women prisoners in Iran, none of whom she says appear to have committed crimes, who experience harassment, beatings by guards, blindfolding and denial of medical treatment.\n\n\"They will put me in jail again,\" she wrote in the book.\n\n\"But I will not stop campaigning until human rights and justice prevail in my country.\"\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize: 'a tribute to her courage'\n\nThe last two years saw the peace prize established by the Swedish inventor, chemist, businessman and philanthropist Alfred Nobel in 1901, who made his fortune inventing dynamite and other explosives, go to human rights activists in Belarus, the Philippines, Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\"We live in a very interconnected world.

They shattered a window using an angle grinder, broke two display cases and escaped on motorbikes, French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said on France Inter radio.\n\nThe robbery took less than 10 minutes, France’s Culture Minister Rachida Dati told a local news outlet on Oct. 19.\n\n\"We saw some footage: they don't target people, they enter calmly in four minutes, smash display cases, take their loot, and leave. No violence, very professional,\" she said. Investigators believe three to four experienced thieves were involved in the heist.\n\nThe burglars allegedly attempted to take nine pieces from the collection but dropped one piece as they escaped. A diamond and emerald-covered gold crown owned by Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, was found on the ground outside the museum. The crown sustained damage, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said.\n\nThe eight other pieces taken from the gallery include a tiara, as well as earrings and a necklace from a sapphire jewelry set owned by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, the stepdaughter of Napoleon I. An emerald necklace and pair of earrings from the Marie-Louise set, along with the reliquary brooch, and a tiara and brooch of Empress Eugénie were also stolen.\n\nThe thieves did not take the Regent diamond from the gallery, a piece that Sotheby's estimates is worth more than $60 million.\n\nThe Paris Prosecutors' office and the Ministry of Culture did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for additional details.\n\nThe Louvre, the world’s most-visited museum, said on its website that it will close its doors for the rest of the day for \"exceptional reasons.\"\n\nNuñez said a specialized police unit had begun investigating the crime and compiling a detailed list of the stolen items.\n\n\"Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value,\" the Louvre said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this year, officials at the Louvre requested urgent help from the French government to restore and renovate the museum's ageing exhibition halls and better protect its countless works of art. French President Emmanuel Macron in January unveiled a 10-year plan to fix the cultural institution's outdated infrastructure and ease congestion for visitors.\n\nThis isn’t the first heist at the museum. In 1911, a former museum employee made off with Leonardo Davinci's Mona Lisa in one of the most brazen art heists in history. The thief was later caught, and the painting was returned to the museum years later.\n\nIn 1976, masked burglars climbed metal scaffolding, broke a second-story museum window and stole the diamond studded sword of King Charles X.\n\nThe Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors in 2024. The museum houses some of the world’s most prized pieces of art from Ancient Egypt to the Renaissance and the modern day.\n\nWhat to know about the stolen Louvre jewelry\n\nTwo of the stolen pieces and the crown found on the ground outside the Louvre belonged to Empress Eugénie, who married Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, an heir of the famous French ruler, in 1853. She was empress until the French Empire fell.

Willis and Brian Michael Jenkins\n\nUpdated May 20, 2016, 9:00 a.m. ET\n\nVacationers considering trips to Belgium, France, London or other destinations in Europe may find themselves asking: Is it safe to travel there?\n\nThis anxiety is understandable, given deadly terrorist attacks in Brussels and Paris and, more recently, possible terrorist involvement in the crash of an EgyptAir plane out of Paris. In some cases the anxiety is reinforced by official travel warnings and security advisories reminding people to exercise vigilance. But an examination of the historical record of terrorism in the United States and Europe from 1970 to 2013 suggests that the threat of terrorism need not affect individuals’ behavior and travel decisions — not even in the wake of significant attacks like those in Brussels and Paris.\n\nInherent in the concern expressed by travelers is the presumption that such attacks come in clusters, that a major terrorist attack somehow increases the likelihood that another one will soon occur. But is that really true?\n\nWhy you should still go to Europe: Column\n\nOur analysis found that the distribution of small but fatal terrorism events (those killing at least one but less than three people) appears not to have been random in Europe and the United States between 1970 and 2002, but it does appear random between 2003 and 2013. In the earlier period, events were more inclined to occur in clusters, but not so for the most recent years.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nWe also found that larger events that kill three or more people, like those in Brussels and Paris, were not necessarily followed by additional attacks within the month that follows. From 1970 to 1993, trigger events did produce statistically significant clustering in their wake. But between 1994 and 2002, occurrences of small events did not significantly relate to trigger events. Again, in the most recent years, there was no statistical clustering of the kind that might indicate a surge in terrorist activity or the occurrence of deadly copycat attacks.\n\nThere may be a historical explanation. Terrorism in the United States and Europe from the 1970s to the 1990s was statistically dominated by groups engaged in continuing domestic campaigns of violence. During this period, the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Spain’s Basque separatists accounted for a large share of the total recorded activity. Attacks often came in offensive surges or what we would identify as statistical clusters. With the gradual suppression of the separatist terrorist campaign in Spain and resolution of the conflict in Northern Ireland, the clusters disappeared. The abatement of activity associated with just these two campaigns also explains the overall decline in the volume of terrorism in Europe.\n\nWhy the relative “tranquility” during the years since 9/11? The more turbulent 1970s saw more groups in the field with definable constituencies, and they were better organized than today’s terrorist groups. In addition, modern counterterrorism efforts involving law enforcement and intelligence have made it more difficult to carry on continuing terrorist campaigns.\n\nThese findings about the absence of clustering for terrorist events around trigger events since 1994 and the general decline in the volume of terrorism in the West — putting aside, of course, the 9/11 attacks — suggest these events should not affect travel plans. When a terrorist event happens in a major city, there is no evidence that another event will happen in that city (or even elsewhere in the West) in the month afterward.\n\nIf your child is a budding terrorist: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nIncreasing security immediately after major attacks is not unwarranted. Taking such measures may prevent follow-on or copycat attacks and enable authorities to deal with surges in reports of suspicious behavior and malicious hoaxes that may follow terrorism events. Similarly, calls for people to exercise vigilance are well placed. But in light of historical trends, much of the personal anxiety about increased dangers seems unwarranted.\n\nWe cannot be certain if these trends will continue. Europe has certainly seen an increase in terrorist attacks by jihadist extremists in recent years, and an examination of terrorism events before and after 9/11 omits this single catastrophic event. While the historical record suggests travelers have not faced an increased danger in the days and weeks following major terrorist attacks in recent years, current assessments are driven by what terrorists might do in the future. And that, as the world learned on 9/11, cannot be predicted.\n\nHenry H.

An edited version appears below.\n\nLeaning down to make eye contact, the doctor urged, demanded, that I take a month off, get away, out of phone contact, far away from my office and job environment so I can relearn how to eat and more importantly — live.\n\nI was the field representative for U.S. Sen. George McGovern in Aberdeen, South Dakota. A small, flat, northern town of strip clubs, livestock yards, railroads and one overpass. It was October 1978, just before a consequential November election. I was 24.\n\nWhile McGovern was not up for election that year, his position supporting a particular rural water issue was threatening his ability to be reelected in 1980. This issue was supported by the large monied contractors and opposed by the small family farmers that would lose land to the project, with minimal payback. I was working to mediate between the family farmers that elected McGovern to the Senate for years and were considering voting against him in 1980 due to his support of the water project.\n\nMy dream as a young person was to work in the U.S. Senate. Now I was — and it was just about to kill me.\n\nI could not influence the senator to change his support for the project and I couldn’t influence his supporters not to abandon their longstanding support for him due to that. I would drag myself from meeting to meeting realizing I had no control over anything that was affecting me.\n\nAs a young woman I was always conscious of my weight. Seems the societal pressure to be the thinnest girl in town had seeped into my consciousness. In the midst of this ongoing and increasing pressure to get McGovern’s supporters back on board, I found less and less time to eat. Before I knew it I was living on coffee and saltines, and losing weight, a lot of weight.\n\nI was an anorexic before the term was part of common vernacular. When I did try to eat something of substance I would throw it up not long after eating it. After a few weeks of that I felt as though I would literally fade away as someone was looking at me. There was so little of me left, both physically, emotionally and practically.\n\nThat’s when I went to see my doctor, who put me in the hospital right away. After a long week of liquid diets and IVs of saline, I had developed a trust for this doctor, a true source of support and perspective. His admonition to physically get away from my demanding job and to relearn how to eat was not a suggestion as much as a demand to ensure my ability to live and thrive.\n\nAt this time I had just gotten word that a dear friend from previous college days had gotten a job teaching in Paris, as in Paris, France, and he invited me to visit. I decided I had to advocate for myself and get to Paris and follow my doctor’s orders.\n\nI drove from Aberdeen to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to get a charter flight to Frankfurt, Germany, and then take a train from Frankfurt to Paris. Now this was pre cell phones, no internet, and the only way to tell my friend, Steve, when I would arrive in Paris was by telegraph from the Frankfurt airport. As I got off the plane in Frankfurt, one thing that screamed American was the unwieldy and ugly mustard color vinyl suitcase I was hauling behind me.\n\nThe Frankfurt airport was the biggest place I had ever been in — it even had a train station in it! I had to find the trains to Paris in the station. I lugged my mustard vinyl suitcase along and I quickly saw that the next train to Paris left in 15 minutes. Not enough time to telegraph Steve but the next train after that was in four or five hours. And I did not want to sit in that train station/airport for that time. So I quickly, and fatefully, decided to take the next train, and skip the telegraph to Steve.\n\nOnce I got on the train, I lugged my vinyl monster down the narrow aisle of the train car and saw an empty glassed compartment with mahogany paneling and green velvet seating for six to eight people. With great relief I threw myself onto a seat and dumped my mustard buddy on the floor. Just as I was doing that an obsequious, lecherous looking cigarette dangling man with a snack cart was making his way behind me into the compartment. Thick cigarette smoke did not obscure his intent and just as I was working up my gumption to defend myself a crew of young French sailors came down the aisle and quickly moved past him and dispatched his cart out of sight. With one of them knowing English, I had delightful companions on the way to Paris.\n\nUpon disembarking at the Gare du Nord train station I had to figure out how to find Steve in the middle of Paris, with only an address, and no French, no phone number. But first I had to see how to change my dollars to French francs. Then I had to see how one got a ticket to ride the Metro. Then I had to figure out how to find this address.\n\nLuckily it was on one of the huge streets in Paris — the Rue de Rivoli — so it was represented on all the Metro subway train maps. A true god send.\n\nI decided to get on a subway line that would take me to a stop near that street, without having to change subways to get there. Now through all this I was living on coffee and saltines again, with no sleep since leaving Aberdeen the day before. I could almost feel my doctor telling me to eat and not walk by one boulangerie without getting several pieces of pastry. I resolutely told myself I would do just that as soon as I found Steve, as I suffered my infinite number of French coffees hangover. As I rode on the Metro I felt like a porcupine since all my nerves were working on overdrive — not much real food and not a clue what comes next as I come up from the underground Metro.\n\nAs I topped the stairs from the Metro station I noted architecture I’ve only seen in the movies or in photos set amongst leafy green trees on brick laid narrow streets. Six- to eight-story buildings from the l800s with the legendary sidewalk cafes with people lounging, drinking coffee, wine and laughing as the world goes by.\n\nI realized I needed to find a cab, near collapse from exhaustion and hunger I cross a plaza to step off the curb to get a cab. I am still moving my behemoth yellow mustard monster suitcase, and no, the cabbie does not help me put it in the trunk. I get in the back of the cab and lean forward showing him the address on a scrap of paper. He nods, almost laughing with near disgust at the American. Now I am worried that Steve may not be home since I had not gotten the telegraph off to him. I am dropped off at the address.\n\nIt’s a busy piece of Paris. The address is a building from about 1820 with seven or eight floors, a dark foyer with mailboxes that have names and numbers ... but not one with Steve’s name. Just as I sink into total defeat a young boy comes from nowhere and says \"bonjour,\" and I quickly lean down and point to Steve’s name on the piece of paper with the address and ask if he knows him. The young boy says \"oui oui\" and then motions for me to follow up six floors.\n\nAs I turn to say thank you, he is gone. But I turn to find Steve opening the door.\n\nAs I open myself up to Paris, Steve is my guide to all the different aspects of Parisian life — one being the all important and doctor directive patronage of boulangeries and bakery shops. The near constant smell of the bakery wafting through our neighborhood was intoxicating and did its job of enticing me to get several flakey croissants and chocolate eclairs daily.\n\nOn a road trip to the Normandy coast we stopped for dinner and had stewed rabbit. A very simple but extravagant meal for me. The taste was enhanced by the recognition of my need to change my life with a joy of eating. It was up to me to relearn this vital part of life and it helped me heal myself of anorexia.\n\nSelf advocacy was my guiding light.\n\nOn one of our Louvre museum visits I suddenly could feel how large the world truly is. Looking at the \"Mona Lisa\" and work by Van Gogh and other famous artists gave me a perspective that showed me how to be a part of the bigger world. The world that was bigger than my small Senate job. It showed me the benefit of widening the scope of my world, and how to picture myself in it.\n\nThat’s what led me to different jobs that were not part of the original plan. They led me to great satisfaction, but it came at a price. About four years after Paris I awoke to a buzzing in my foot and two days later I’m back in the hospital with my whole body limp and buzzing.\n\nI had developed multiple sclerosis, but it was not diagnosed until four years later with the advent of the MRI technology. I continued to work different jobs leading to my ultimate lobbying job, but then one day I collapsed at the Iowa State Capitol and never went back to work. That was over 25 years ago. Upon the worsening of the MS I advocated for a power wheelchair to allow me to do more with the limited energy that MS allows.\n\nOne lesson from the anorexia nervosa was I am the only one that was going to take care of me. The doctor that guided me through this time was invaluable to my recovery and ultimate release from anorexia. His lessons in self worth were definitive and left deep impressions.\n\nI learned how to see the world and understand my place in it, and know, that while I’m not as mobile, I am still a part of my world and am thankful for all of it, past and present.\n\nAfter all, adversity, challenges, and bumps in the road are often the first signs that a great healing has begun.\n\nABOUT THE STORYTELLER: Diane Kolmer lives in West Des Moines with her husband of 41 years and their dog, Nellie.

No visit to the nation's capital is complete without exploring the Smithsonian or its National Zoo, home to some 2,000 animals (including the cuddly, world-famous giant pandas).\n\nMusee D'Art Moderne\n\nParis\n\nWhen you think of famous museums in Paris, your mind may jump to the Louvre or the Musee d'Orsay. And while those institutions are worth a visit or two, they're generally not free. The Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, however, is free to everyone all the time -- and it has plenty to offer, from rotating exhibits by major modern artists to a permanent collection featuring 22 pieces by Matisse, among thousands of other important works of the 20th century.\n\nThe British Museum\n\nLondon\n\nHousing an enormous collection of art and artifacts from the world over, The British Museum is a must-do on any visit to London. Its works number in the millions and include such controversial objects as the Elgin Marbles, the Rosetta Stone and the Benin Bronzes. Free family-friendly activities, lectures and special exhibits take place daily. The massive museum takes several days to walk through, too, so repeat visits are a great way to take advantage of The British Museum's complimentary offerings.\n\nNationalmuseet\n\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n\nDenmark's largest museum is also one of its most beautiful, housed in a sprawling 18th-century manse near the center of town. Inside, follow Danish history from the age of prehistoric humans to the modern day. Let the little ones run wild through the Children's Museum, where they can try on historical Danish clothing and clamber aboard a replica Viking ship, or visit during NatNight, when your free cultural experience comes with a nightcap.\n\nMuseu Da Electricidade\n\nLisbon, Portugal\n\nOverlooking the Tagus River in Lisbon, the Museu da Electricidade is housed in an old power plant that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of its contents. Discover the history of electricity, sciences and industrial archaeology through especially kid-friendly interactive exhibits. Rotating photography and contemporary-art installations add to the museum's surprising offerings. TripAdvisor visitors call it \"a secret hidden delight of Lisbon\" (and a welcome break from the heat).\n\nDaimler Contemporary\n\nBerlin\n\nEntrance is always free at Daimler Contemporary, a hip museum devoted to global contemporary art. This is a good thing, considering that the collection changes focus four times per year, as new art acquisitions and rotating exhibits make every visit different from the last. See paintings, photography, conceptual art, fashion and several sculptures located outside on Potsdamer Platz.\n\nMuseu Afro Brasil\n\nSao Paulo, Brazil\n\nStill spinning from the World Cup and pining to experience more Brazilian culture? The Museu Afro Brasil exhibits some 6,000 works of art, documents, jewelry, photographs and textiles that highlight the importance of African influence on Brazilian culture. This moving museum was founded in 2004 by the artist/curator Emanoel Araujo and remains free on Thursdays and Saturdays (with a small 50 cents entrance fee otherwise).\n\nNational Museum of China\n\nBeijing\n\nEstablished in 2003 to help locals and tourists alike explore China's vast legacy, the massive National Museum of China has 2.2 million square feet of gallery space. Visitors can see artifacts dating back 1.7 million years as well as items from the modern era, the Cultural Revolution, and the last imperial dynasty within its dozens of exhibition halls. The museum is an excellent way to discover cultures that Western history classes often overlook.\n\nNicholson Museum\n\nSydney\n\nThe Nicholson Museum is home to the largest collection of antiquities in the Southern Hemisphere, and fortunately for visitors Down Under, it's free. With thousands of objects (including mummies) spanning the globe from the Middle East to Europe, the small but unique museum is an excellent break from beach days. Its location -- the Sydney University campus -- also offers plenty of other educational diversions, including an art gallery and a natural history museum.\n\nTe Papa Tongarewa\n\nWellington, New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand's dedication to cultural history is exceptional, and there are few better places to discover the country than at Te Papa Tongarewa (the Museum of New Zealand). With five collection areas (art, history, Pacific, Maori and environment), the museum's exhibits and programs seek to explore the country's uniquely bicultural character as well as the natural world in which it thrives.

No camera meant no pictures – no snaps of white sand beaches, coffee plantations or black lava outcrops – which meant no sharing on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nInstead, I practiced what I’d learned a few years ago at a “Digital Detox” retreat, putting aside the lens to look at the world through my own eyes (and to save it in my own memory, not the camera’s).\n\nAt that retreat, on a hike through Northern California’s redwood forests, I reflexively itched to photograph and share nature’s beauty thinking, “no picture meant no experience, no memory.” Levi Felix, the program’s late co-founder, suggested we take “Inner-grams” instead – capturing full scenes, including sight, sound and scents, that we’d store in our brains. (To do this, frame a scene with your thumbs and index fingers, focus, and then blink twice to “record” it.)\n\nI vividly remember the one Inner-gram I took on that hike: Looking up to the sky, I captured an image of the fluffy clouds dancing with the majestic redwoods high above me, with all my senses engaged. I could smell the piney forest and feel the warm light, a memory that was mine and mine alone. I don’t think I’ll ever forget it.\n\nPhoto-taking is positively ubiquitous these days, now that more than three-quarters of Americans own smartphones (a percentage that’s growing). Look around – on a hike, at a museum or even a family get-together – and cameras are everywhere. The emphasis is not on the view, the art or the conversation, but on the photo and taking loads of them. These shutterbugs seem more focused on getting the picture than having the experience.\n\nDuring my family vacation, at Rainbow Falls on Hawaii's Big Island, tourists lined up along the guardrail to be photographed, and I watched as many immediately shared their photos on social media, tripping over exposed tree roots in the process. Then our family of eight dutifully assumed the same pose. It’s a nice photo (although the people are kind of small), but it says very clearly: “Hey world, we were here!”\n\nThat experience has become typical. A friend told me in a text that he “went to see the Liberty Bell. Room completely full of tourists. Not one person was looking at the bell. All looking at cameras pointing at them, with the bell behind.” Another had the same experience at Yosemite and described it as sad. As she explained, “you store fewer memories of your overall experience.”\n\nFred Silverman, a docent at San Francisco’s Museum of Modern Art, agreed. In more than two years of leading tours, he has observed “people are taking photos of the art work and labels and pictures of themselves in front of the art. That, sadly, seems to be their sole interaction with the art.” A photographer himself, Silverman cautions that “taking pictures becomes a substitute for really experiencing what’s important.” Not to mention it provides proof – or a boast – to our online friends that we had an experience, even as we hold that experience at arm’s length. As the kids say, “pix or it didn’t happen.”\n\nCuriously, new research indicates that pictures actually impair our memory of a vacation, rather than solidifying it. Researchers call it “cognitive offloading,” or a reliance on tools to do what our brains once did. Turns out we are better at remembering an object if we don’t have a photo of it – taking a picture allows us to offload that memory onto the camera so our brains don’t have to work hard to retrieve it. We will work harder to remember something if we know there’s no photo to help us. I’m fairly certain that’s why my “Inner-gram” is still so vivid for me.\n\nI’m not against all picture-taking, by any means, and I have many photos I treasure. Margaret Sartor, a renowned photographer and scholar at Duke University, describes photographs as affirmations: “I went here. I love this person. They are part of our memory as well as our identities.”\n\nClay Farr, a black-and-white photographer with a big Instagram presence, thinks a lot about these issues.\n\n“The best photographs happen when I’m living in the moment,” he said, because the camera helps him be more aware of his surroundings “and myself in those surroundings. It keeps me in the moment.”\n\nWhen I was in Hawaii, I found I had to take one special photo. Our family had traveled to the top of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that overlooks the entire island. To the west, the fiery sun had just set. To the east, I could see the rising full moon. And to the south, the blistering eruption of Kilauea. I felt the magic of that moment in time, and I wanted to record it for myself and to share this unique experience. Among the many Facebook responses: “Looks like Chapter One of Genesis!”\n\nThe takeaway ...\n\n• Take photos of people and places that matter to you, but pay more attention to the world around you. Ask yourself: Why am I taking this picture?\n\n• Find other ways to remember, such as those “Inner-grams.” That may mean keeping a journal or sketchbook, or making a scrapbook of artifacts from a trip.\n\n• Think again about what should be public. Not every photograph must be shared on social media. These are two separate actions.\n\n• Finally, be safe. Getting the perfect shot has led some people to step off cliffs and plunge to their deaths – the opposite of mindfulness. Live in the moment and experience it. Don’t die for it.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Steven Petrow offers advice about living in the digital age. Submit your question at stevenpetrow@gmail.com.

Helicopters and drones did not whirl overhead only because there was no place to whirl. The airspace was closed.\n\nAt every turn, police asked for a QR code and official ID as proof of identity. Then they asked for it again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nThe Paris Olympics' opening ceremony Friday was only the first − albeit major − security hurdle organizers of the Games faced. The world's biggest sporting event has several weeks to run across an ancient and in places maze-like city, in a country where extremists' plots, terrorism and large-scale civil unrest are not uncommon.\n\nBut despite a soggy backdrop of rain and dull gray skies they appeared to clear it, and then some, as many of the world's best athletes excitedly floated down the Seine as part of an elaborate four-hour spectacle that saw a Summer Olympics opening ceremony take place outside a main athletics stadium for the first time.\n\n\"An absolutely massive, massive deployment of security forces,\" is how Mathieu Zagrodzki, a security expert and criminal justice researcher at the University of Versailles, who watched the ceremony unfold from Paris' city hall, described it in a WhatsApp message. \"Very well organized. Nothing really negative to say.\"\n\nTim Ayers, deputy director of major events coordination for the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service, which is helping to protect American athletes in Paris, said that after four years of \"intense preparation\" the French executed their security plan for the opening ceremony without any major security hiccups.\n\n\"They blocked off the streets, deployed thousands of police and erected security barriers around some of the most famous cultural sites in the world,\" he said.\n\nYet it was a daring endeavor and even French President Emmanuel Macron at first thought it was “a crazy and not very serious idea\" to hold the ceremony along the river, a very public and dynamic setting open to every kind of risk, threat and variable known to emergency planners, when it was first proposed. (Speaking this week, Macron said, confidently: \"We decided it was the right moment to deliver this crazy idea.\")\n\nIn the end, the \"crazy idea\" allowed more than 300,000 people to watch the opening ceremony from bridges and riverbanks as dancers, pop stars, tightrope walkers and others told stories in different ways about French culture and history; about global friendship and solidarity and everything in between. Céline Dion, diagnosed in 2022 with stiff person syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that causes stiffness and muscle spasms, performed \"L’Hymne à L’Amour\" by Edith Piaf while perched on the Eiffel Tower in a silver gown.\n\nCéline Dion dazzles: Olympics performance renders Kelly Clarkson speechless\n\nFootbridges were turned into catwalks. A metal horse galloped down the river, its rider wearing a cape emblazoned with the Olympic rings. An opera singer delivered a spine-tingling song from atop the dizzying heights of the Grand Palais. A 100-foot tall hot-air balloon, ringed by flames, lit the sky and capped the lavish affair that took place in and around some of Paris' most famous landmarks, though it did not obscure the scale of the security challenge.\n\n\"It's complicated,\" said one police officer as he gestured toward the huge security perimeter that was erected along both banks of the Seine to enable 85 boats carrying thousands of athletes from 205 delegations down the river. Watching closely, in and out of public sight, were frogmen, snipers and powerful AI-assisted cameras.\n\nThe officer reminded a reporter that there's another 2½ weeks to go.\n\nAhead of the ceremony, there were a few scares and some jitters.\n\nFrench authorities had been on alert for potential acts of sabotage targeting the Games.\n\nThe country has no shortage of adversaries. They had warned there could be cyberattacks from Russia over France's backing for Ukraine in that war, or Iran. Possibly both. Israel's authorities had cautioned that its athletes and officials were targets. They often are, but this year perhaps more than most because of Israel's nearly 10-month-old war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' murderous attacks and kidnappings there Oct. 7.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Russian man who has lived in France for more than a decade was arrested on suspicion of plotting with a foreign power to stage “large scale” acts of \"destabilization” during the Olympics, which runs until Aug. 11.\n\nFrench police said this week that they foiled a planned attack in May near Marseille, in the south, apparently timed for the arrival of the Olympic flame in that city. The plot involved a possible incendiary device − a bomb.\n\nFor days there has been a steady drip of bomb alerts at Paris train stations.\n\nHardly 30 minutes goes by before fleets of police vans can be seen or heard racing down one street or another.\n\nAnd early Friday, saboteurs vandalized several signal boxes and electricity pylons on France's high-speed train network. The incident, described by authorities as a \"massive attack,\" took place far from Paris but it caused disruptions to hundreds of thousands of travelers on the day of the Olympics' showpiece.\n\nTony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 organizing committee, told reporters in a briefing on Saturday that the incidents on France's train network did not impact the opening ceremony. He further added that there wasn't a \"single security\" event \"before, during or after\" the ceremony that impacted its staging.\n\n\"Even the rain didn't stop us,\" he said.\n\nBut the train assaults did set something of a sour tone to the first part of the day for some as French media covered it non-stop and raised questions about what it might mean for the Seine event and beyond.\n\n\"I was really anxious leading up to it. I didn't want to take the subway, I wanted to try to walk here,\" said Katrina Palanca, a tourist from San Antonio, Texas, who was watching the ceremony from Pont du Carrousel, a bridge that spans the Seine, connecting the Quai des Tuileries near the Louvre museum and Quai Voltaire on Paris' Left Bank.\n\n\"But after going through that pat-down I feel really safe,\" she said.\n\nMany of those observing the ceremony from Pont du Carrousel had on rain ponchos or were clasping umbrellas. Not Palanca or her husband, David Robbins. They were dressed in matching \"Statue of Liberty\" costumes.\n\nThe colossal copper-clad statue with its torch-bearing arm was donated by France to the U.S. in the 19th century. As a national symbol, for many it is an emblem of equality, democracy and those seeking new opportunities.\n\n\"There's a ton of cops out there,\" said Robbins, reflecting on Paris' security transformation.\n\n\"They're everywhere.\"\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

On Thursday, after Trump announced the United States had destroyed an Iranian drone, he called on \"all nations to condemn Iran's attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce.\"\n\n“I also call on other nations to protect their ships as they go through the Strait, and to work with us in the future,” he added.\n\nOn Friday, after Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps seized a British tanker, the Pentagon put out a statement saying the multi-national marine operation was still in development.\n\n“While the United States has committed to supporting this initiative, contributions and leadership from regional and international partners will be required to succeed,” U.S. Central Command said.\n\n“U.S. officials continue to coordinate with allies and partners in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East on the details and capabilities required for Operation Sentinel to enable freedom of navigation in the region and protect vital shipping lanes.”\n\nThe British government, meanwhile, has warned Iran of “serious consequences” if it does not release the tanker, though Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt ruled out military action. Iran on Saturday cast the seizure as a \"reciprocal action\" for the UK's impounding of an Iranian tanker earlier this month suspected of violating sanctions and carrying oil to Syria.\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that \"This only goes to show what I’m saying about Iran: trouble.”\n\n\"Nothing but trouble,\" he said.\n\n'Mistake and miscalculation'\n\nThe situation has the potential to escalate quickly. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said earlier this week that he had seen a map of military assets in the region and worried that \"there are so many opportunities for mistake and miscalculation on both sides.\"\n\nEsper, the defense secretary nominee, told King he believed the multi-national patrolling effort will work. He cited an incident earlier this month when British officials said Iran's Revolutionary Guard tried to block a British oil tanker but backed off after receiving warnings from a British navy vessel that was accompanying the tanker.\n\nEsper said the presence of the navy ship \"was enough to deter something that could have escalated out of control.\"\n\n\"That’s the type of concept we're trying to envision, DOD, throughout the Strait so we don’t get into a military fight,\" he said. \"We push it into a diplomatic realm.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nWhat we know: Iran's seizure of a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/17/how-did-tensions-between-united-states-and-iran-reach-point/2340811001/", "title": "How did tensions between the United States and Iran reach this point?", "text": "Updated Sept. 17, 2019, 10:02 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – Tensions between the U.S. and Iran accelerated sharply following the Trump administration’s accusations that Tehran was behind a weekend attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe attack, which disrupted more than 5% of the world daily oil supply, reignited fears of a military confrontation in the Middle East and comes amid months of growing hostilities between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced on Tuesday that \"there will be no talks with the U.S. at any level\" — remarks apparently meant to end all speculation about a possible U.S.-Iran meeting between the two countries' presidents at the U.N. later this month.\n\nHere’s a closer look at Saturday’s attacks and other recent events that inflamed hostilities in the Middle East:\n\nIran denies responsibility\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran but offered no specific proof that it was behind the drone strikes on the world's largest oil processing facility and a major oil field Saturday. The installations, operated by state-owned Saudi Aramco, produce more than half of the country's crude oil.\n\nIran has denied any involvement in the strikes, but Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility. Saudi investigators said their initial findings suggest the weapons used \"came from Iran” but did not speculate on where the weapons were launched.\n\nThe U.S. government released satellite images showing the extent of the destruction and suggested the assault originated in Iran or Iraq rather than Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is fighting the Houthi rebels.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that it looks as if Iran was responsible – but he doesn't want war.\n\n\"Well, it’s looking that way,” Trump said when asked whether Iran is responsible for the missile and drone strikes. “As soon as we find out definitively, we'll let you know. But it does look that way.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump questioned Iran’s denials of involvement, referencing an incident earlier this summer when Iran shot down a U.S. drone by claiming it was in Iranian “airspace.”\n\n“They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We’ll see?”\n\nOn Sunday, Trump suggested on Twitter that the U.S. is prepared to retaliate.\n\n“There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!” he wrote.\n\nIran and U.S. ‘spies’\n\nThe attacks on the Saudi oil facilities come less than two months after tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalated over Iran’s claim that it had arrested 17 spies recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIran’s semi-official Fars news agency claimed in July that 17 spies had been taken into custody and said some of them already had been sentenced to death. The arrests reportedly occurred over several months, and those taken into custody worked on “sensitive sites” in the country’s military and nuclear facilities, an Iranian intelligence official told a press conference in Iran.\n\nTrump called Iran’s claim “totally false. Zero truth.” Pompeo, a former CIA director, also dismissed the report, saying Iran has a long history of lying.\n\nIran seizes tanker\n\nJust days before Iran claimed it had arrested spies for the CIA, Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, ratcheting up hostilities in the Middle East.\n\nThe Revolutionary Guard said its naval forces had seized the Stena Impero tanker July 19 for allegedly violating maritime rules and regulations in the Persian Gulf. A dramatic audio recording released days later provided the tense moments leading up to the raid, which included the Guard's forces rappelling from helicopters to the ship's deck.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Iran released seven of the tanker’s 23 crew members.\n\nDrone drama\n\nThe day before the British ship was seized, Trump announced that the USS Boxer destroyed an Iranian drone that came within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down.\n\nNeither Trump nor the Pentagon spelled out how the Boxer destroyed the drone or provided any video or other evidence from the incident. Several U.S. officials said the ship used electronic jamming to bring it down rather than hitting it with a missile.\n\nIran, however, said that all of its drones in the Persian Gulf had safely returned to their bases and suggested the U.S. had destroyed its own drone by mistake.\n\nTrump, however, insisted there is “no doubt\" that a U.S. warship destroyed an Iranian drone.\n\nMore drone drama\n\nThe USS Boxer incident was not the first drone drama in the region this summer.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in June, a bold strike that drew a stern warning from Trump and prompted top Pentagon officials to formulate military response options.\n\nIran said the drone was destroyed over its coast and said the incident sent a \"clear message\" that the Persian Gulf nation was ready to defend itself from what it views as Western aggression. The Pentagon, however, said the incident played out in international waters over the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nRegardless, the U.S. prepared to make a retaliatory strike on Iran, but Trump canceled the attack at the last minute.\n\nTrump said U.S. forces had been “cocked and loaded,” but that he called off the attack just 10 minutes before it was to take place after learning that 150 Iranians would die in the strike.\n\nOther tensions\n\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran have been building for months after the Trump administration pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by President Barack Obama’s administration and other world powers.\n\nThose tensions escalated in June, when two tankers reported they had been attacked about 25 miles off the southern coast of Iran.\n\nThe Front Altair, loaded with the flammable hydrocarbon mixture naphtha from the United Arab Emirates, radioed for help as it caught fire. A short time later, the Kokuka Courageous, loaded with methanol from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, also called for help.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet said it received two distress calls and sent the guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge to the scene.\n\nNo nation or group claimed responsibility, and Iran denied it was involved in the attack.\n\nBut Pompeo told reporters the attack was the work of Iran. Pompeo said the assessment was based in part on U.S. intelligence, the expertise needed for the operation and other recent incidents in the region, which the U.S. also has blamed on Iran.\n\nSanctions\n\nWith tensions mounting, the Trump administration announced July 19 it is imposing new sanctions on a senior member of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah.\n\nThe administration also announced a $7 million reward for information leading to the capture of 25-year fugitive Salman Raouf Salman and described the actions as part of its \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran.\n\nThe administration announced its actions on the 25th anniversary of an attack Salman is accused of ordering on a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The attack killed 85 people and wounded hundreds of others.\n\nSince then, the U.S. and other nations have accused Salman of plotting other attacks from a base in Lebanon. Officials believe he is still in the Middle East, but do not know exactly where.\n\nContributing: Associated Press, John Bacon, David Jackson, Kim Hjelmgaard", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/23/iran-strike-donald-trump-reluctant-despite-history-threats/1798453001/", "title": "Iran strike? Donald Trump is reluctant despite history of threats", "text": "Updated July 23, 2019, 10:58 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has threatened Iran for years, and often says he is willing to use force – but allies and aides say it would take an exceptional provocation for him to act, given his equally long criticism of \"endless wars\" in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\"We are ready for the absolute worst and we are ready for sense, too,\" Trump said Monday, adding that he is also open to the idea of new talks with the Iranians over their nuclear program.\n\n\"I am just going to sit back and wait,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump aides said Iran's latest actions – the seizure of a British oil tanker, the arrest of alleged pro-American spies – are unlikely to provoke a military response.\n\nYet there are circumstances under which Trump could decide to use force, said current and former aides.\n\n'Alter your course': Dramatic audio released of Iran seizing British ship\n\nMore aggressive Iranian actions – an attack that kills Americans, a mass casualty attack on an ally, a closure of the Strait of Hormuz to international shipping traffic would lead to an equally aggressive response by Trump.\n\n\"His position is he doesn't want to get us into new wars,\" said Fred Fleitz, former chief of staff to Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton. \"But he's prepared to use force if necessary.\"\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump frequently hit predecessor George W. Bush over costly military action in Afghanistan and Iraq. During a foreign policy speech in September of 2016, Trump talked about \"how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now.\"\n\nTrump also hammered Iran during that campaign, and during his tenure in the White House. He has attacked predecessor Barack Obama for signing an agreement in which the U.S. and allies reduced economic sanctions on Iran as it gave up the means to make nuclear weapons.\n\nWhen Iran detained a U.S. ship in January of 2016 – and released pictures of American sailors on their knees, hands behind their head – Trump tweeted that it \"humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!\"\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement – and impose new sanctions on Tehran – triggered many of the new tensions. In recent weeks, Trump has held out the possibility of talks on a new nuclear agreement with new terms.\n\nThese kinds of competing impulses – threats on Iran, caution over military action – played out last month when Iran shot down an unmanned U.S. drone.\n\nAt one point, Trump authorized military action – then changed his mind, saying a strike against Iranian radar installations would probably cause deaths, and would not be proportional to shooting down a drone.\n\nSouth Korea: South Korea fired warning shots after Russian planes entered airspace\n\nTrump has authorized two missile strikes in Syria over its use of chemical weapons, but those were limited strikes that targeted aircraft facilities.\n\nAmid renewed tensions with Iran, U.S. military assets have stepped up patrols in the region of the Strait of Hormuz, but are not acting as if military action is imminent.\n\nU.S. Navy ships, patrol planes and drones have been keeping watch over critical shipping lanes in the Middle East and providing information on Iranian activities to captains of American and allied vessels.\n\nU.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces from the Middle East to Afghanistan, has dubbed the initiative “Operation Sentinel.” It includes warships operating in the Persian Gulf and those on station in the Gulf of Oman that provide information to commercial ships on the action of Iranian military and paramilitary forces.\n\n“We have patrol aircraft operating in international airspace monitoring the situation within the Strait of Hormuz,” said Army Lt. Col. Earl Brown, a spokesman. “U.S. Naval Forces Central command has been in contact with U.S. ships in the area to ensure their safety.”\n\nBritish officials, while demanding Iran release its tanker, are stressing a diplomatic solution, and downplaying the use of force.\n\nThe British government said Monday that UK officials have been in touch with the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Spain and Denmark in recent days. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said they are planning to put together a “European-led maritime protection mission to support safe passage of both crew and cargo in this vital region.”\n\n“The new force will be focused on free navigation, bearing in mind that one fifth of the world’s oil, a quarter of its liquefied natural gas – and trade worth half a trillion dollars –passes through the Strait of Hormuz every year,” Hunt told members of Parliament.\n\nHe added that the new effort would not be part of the U.S. \"maximum pressure policy,\" which relies on increased economic sanctions the Trump administration imposed after pulling out of the Iranian nuclear agreement.\n\nThe United Kingdom and other European nations still support and want to preserve the nuclear agreement.\n\nThe Pentagon has said its “Operation Sentinel” would involve a multi-national build-up of navy forces, with partner nations escorting their own ships through the straight with coordination and surveillance help from the United States.\n\nJohn Rood, under secretary of defense for policy, said on Saturday that he believed other nations were willing to participate, though reports had suggested some countries were reluctant to commit more military assets to the region for fear it would inflame tensions with Iran further.\n\nThe United States already has sent a carrier battle group, B-52 airplanes and air and missile defense systems to the area. Last month, the administration announced it was deploying 1,000 to the region. On Friday, the Pentagon said some of those are heading to Saudi Arabia. Defense officials declined to say how many.\n\n“It would be a grave mistake on their part to miscalculate,” Rood said of Iran, according to a defense report.\n\nAs for the United States, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump will be cautious about military action for a simple reason: His criticism of Iraq and Afghanistan. \"He's going to be very careful about doing something that would create the very circumstances he campaigned against,\" Spicer said.\n\nFor Trump, it is still a wait-and-see situation.\n\n\"It's getting harder for me to want to make a deal with Iran because they behave very badly,\" he said Monday. \"They are saying bad things and I will tell you it could go either way.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/04/13/israel-war-updates-iran-ship/73311944007/", "title": "Israel war updates: Iran launches drones at Israel in revenge strike", "text": "Updated April 14, 2024, 7:21 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Saturday, April 13. For the latest news on the conflict in the Middle East, view our story for Sunday, April 14.\n\nWASHINGTON — For the first time ever, Iran launched an attack Saturday against Israel directly from its territory.\n\nIran sent a wave of drones toward Israel, a U.S. official told USA TODAY Saturday, as the country ramped up preparations for an Iranian strike amid soaring Mideast tensions. The official was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Iranians had been observed preparing drones to attack Israel, according to a second U.S. official briefed on the intelligence but not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe attacks were retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy in Damascus, Syria last of Apr. 1. that killed seven Revolutionary Guards officers including two senior commanders. The move by Iran marks the most recent escalation in an inflamed Middle East that has been building for half a year − ever since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel detonated a retaliatory war against the militant group in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Our defensive systems are deployed; we are ready for any scenario, both defensively and offensively,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address. \"The State of Israel is strong.\"\n\nIsrael's military said fighter jets and navy vessels are \"on a defense mission in Israeli airspace.\"\n\nThe attack is \"likely to unfold over a number of hours,\" U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. President Joe Biden is set to meet with his national security team at the White House on Saturday afternoon and is being updated on the situation, Watson said.\n\n\"President Biden has been clear: Our support for Israel’s security is ironclad. The United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran,\" Watson said in a statement.\n\nAfter the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, the small Mideast country maintained relations with Iran − an outlier from other Muslim majority countries in the region. After Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, the two nations turned into fierce rivals.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Iran said it will not hesitate to take further \"defensive measures\" to protect its interests against any military aggression, the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday.\n\n∎ Israel's national emergency service reported a 10-year-old boy in the Arad region had been injured. No casualties have been reported as a result of the attack.\n\n∎ Biden returned to the White House to meet with national security advisers about events in the Mideast on Saturday afternoon, cutting short a weekend trip to Delaware, the White House said in a statement.\n\n∎ Iraq and Jordan temporarily closed their airspace as Iran launched drones toward Israel Saturday. Jordan has helped Israel respond to the attack by shooting down dozens of Iranian drones, Reuters reported.\n\nIsraeli Ambassador to U.N. calls for emergency meeting of Security Council\n\nIsrael’s top diplomat to the U.N. called for the Security Council to meet immediately to condemn Iran’s attacks and to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization.\n\nIn a letter released Saturday night, Israeli Ambassador Gilad Erdan wrote to U.N. Security Council President Vanessa Frazier said Iran’s drone and missile attacks at Israel was a “clear violation” of the U.N. Charter and international law, calling it a “severe and dangerous escalation.”\n\nHe pointed to Saturday’s attacks, as well as weapons transfers to Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah, among other Iranian-backed proxies, as evidence of violations that he said threaten international peace. He also cited Revolutionary Guards seizing a Portuguese civilian cargo ship earlier on Saturday.\n\n“The time has come for the Security Council to take concrete action against the Iranian threat,” he said.\n\nThe 15-member Security Council includes the U.S. as a permanent member. Neither Israel nor Iran are current members.\n\nIDF: Most Iranian missiles intercepted outside Israel’s borders, IDF base hit with ‘minor damage’\n\nIsrael said most missile launches from Iran were intercepted before crossing into Israel. On social media, Israel Defense Forces said its Aerial Defense Array and its “strategic allies” intercepted most launches before they hit Israeli territory. Still, IDF did identify “a small number of hits,” including at an IDF base in southern Israel. The base had minor damage to infrastructure, IDF said.\n\n“Over the past few hours, many dozens of hostile aircraft, as well as dozens of cruise missiles, from Iran were identified approaching Israeli territory and intercepted,” IDF said. “Dozens of (Israeli Air Force) fighter jets are currently operating to intercept all aerial threats approaching Israeli territory.”\n\nWhat is Israel’s Iron Dome?\n\nThe Iron Dome is Israel’s mobile missile defense system that is designed to find and shoot down short-range rockets fired at Israel. An all-weather system, the Iron Dome can also take down artillery and drones, and it can detect and engage rockets up to 40 miles away.\n\nAfter becoming operational in 2011, it’s been upgraded over the years and has a high success rate. It’s part of Israel’s three-tiered air defense system that protects against short-range ballistic missiles, large-caliber rockets and cruise missiles, via David’s Sling, and also through Arrow-3, which provides defense against medium-range ballistic missiles.\n\nIran won’t hesitate to take more ‘defensive measures’ to protect ‘legitimate interests’\n\nIran’s foreign ministry said it would not hesitate to take further “defensive measures,” against any military aggression, Reuters reported.\n\n“Iran, if necessary, will not hesitate to take further defensive measures to safeguard its legitimate interests against any military aggressions and unlawful use of force,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement, according to state TV.\n\nIran would do so, the statement reportedly said, while reaffirming its commitment to the principles of the U.N. Charter and international law.\n\nU.N. secretary-general ‘deeply alarmed’ by region-wide escalation\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he strongly condemned Iran’s “large-scale attack” on Israel. In a statement, he called for an immediate stop to the fighting.\n\n“I am deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation,” he said. “I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East. I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford another war.”\n\nTrump praises Israel, attacks Biden's leadership during Pennsylvania rally\n\nFormer President Donald Trump paid tribute to Israel and blamed President Joe Biden for Iran's attack during a campaign rally Saturday night in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"God Bless the people of Israel,\" Trump said at the start of a rally at a fairground in Schnecksville, Pa., near Allentown.\n\nTrump, who attacked Biden in a series of Truth Social posts earlier in the day, did not cite the president by name when discussing Israel, but did blame what he called weak U.S. leadership for the attack by Iran.\n\nEchoing a Truth Social post earlier in the day, Trump said the attack \"would not have happened\" if \"we were in office.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nBiden says commitment to Israel’s security 'ironclad'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said that he met with his national security team for an update on Iran’s attacks against Israel.\n\n“Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad,” he said on social media.\n\nSirens, booms across Israel as 10-year-old critically injured\n\nSirens sounded off across Israel amid Iranian drone attacks, according to Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe IDF issued a flurry of alerts on Telegram for sirens sounding from southern Israel to northern Israel. This also included Jerusalem, the Negev and Dead Sea regions, among others.\n\nMagen David Adom, Israel’s national emergency service, said there were no casualties reported, but a 10-year-old boy in the Bedouin area in the Arad region is in critical condition. On social media, MDA said first responders were treating the boy.\n\nIt was unclear whether he was injured by missile fragments or an interceptor, Times of Israel reported.\n\nEarlier, MDA said sirens sounded across the country but there were no reports of casualties aside from calls of “stress symptoms” and people injured running for cover.\n\nTrump attacks Biden over Iran attack; claims it wouldn't have happened under him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump reacted to the attack by referring to himself.\n\n\"ISRAEL IS UNDER ATTACK! This should never have been allowed to happen - This would NEVER have happened if I were President!\" the presumptive Republican presidential candidate said in one of a string of Truth Social posts.\n\nIn other posts, Trump taunted Biden for not giving a live speech on the attack, and said the U.S. would always stand behind Israel.\n\nTrump may address the situation during a campaign rally near Allentown, Pa.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nJordan shoots down dozens of Iranian drones to help Israel\n\nJordan shot down dozens of Iranian drones above northern and central Jordan en route to Israel, Reuters reported citing two security sources.\n\nThe news outlet reported Iran said it had been watching if Jordan made any moves seen as supporting Israel, warning that Jordan could be the next target, Reuters reported.\n\nIranian drone attack makes Israel attack on embassy ‘concluded,’ Iran U.N. mission says\n\nIran’s mission to the UN. said its drone attack against Israel marks the end of its response to Israel suspected bombing Iran's embassy in Syria in early April.\n\n“The matter can be deemed concluded,” Iran’s mission said in a social media post Saturday evening. “However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!”\n\nLawmakers respond to Iran attack on Israel\n\nReactions from lawmakers were largely divided among partisan lines, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La, stating the \"Biden Administration's undermining of Israel and appeasement of Iran have contributed to these terrible developments,\" and GOP Rep. Mike Crenshaw, R-Texas, arguing that \"Biden signaled waning support for Israel. Now a potential war is erupting.\"\n\nOther GOP lawmakers such as Sen. Roger Wicker, the top-ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called on the U.S. to stand with Israel.\n\n“Our shared enemies, including Iran and their proxies, need to know our commitment is unwavering. We must join with Israel to ensure that Iran’s aggression is met with resolute action and resounding strength,\" Wicker, R-Miss., said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada also said, \"The United States stands firmly with Israel and its right to defend itself against attacks from Iran and its terrorist proxies.\"\n\nThe senator said she would keep working to get legislation passed that provides additional military aid to Israel.\n\n\"What is happening now in the Middle East is why the house should have voted for the Senate passed security bill that supports Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan in their fight for sovereignty and democratic principles,\" Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said in a X post, calling the U.S. the \"backbone of the free world.\"\n\nDrones key to Iran and its militias against U.S., Israel, researchers say\n\nDrones have been key to Iran and militant groups it supports to attack U.S. forces and allies, according to the Iran Primer, a consortium of scholars who study the country.\n\nIran first developed rudimentary drones during its war with Iraq in the 1980s, Iran Primer's article said Friday. Today, Iranian drones are used for combat as suicide drones that explode on impact, or by traveling long distances to launch munitions at targets. They are also used for surveillance to identify targets using photo and video.\n\nIran began sending drones to Hezbollah, the militant group it backs in Lebanon, in the 2000s. In 2006, Hezbollah used drones against Israel in its 34-day war. They’ve reportedly since been used against ISIS militants, as well as in attacks in Saudi oilfields and in Iraq against U.S. military and diplomatic targets. Since 2022, Iran has supplied Russia with drones starting to use against civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Iran’s use of drones has increased in Syria, Iraq and Jordan after the war began between Hamas and Israel. In January, an Iranian-made drone killed three American soldiers in Jordan, while Houthi militants, backed by Iran, used Iranian-designed drones to attack ships in the Red Sea.\n\nWhile some Iranian drones are small, carrying as little as 7 pounds of explosives, others can have payloads of up to 1,240 pounds. Many are modeled on captured American drones, Iran Primer said.\n\nPlans in place ahead of drones, defense not ‘hermetic,’ IDF says\n\nIsrael plans to cut GPS services in certain areas as part of its plan to counter Iran launching drones at the country, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Saturday evening.\n\n“The IDF and the Israeli Air Force are implementing the plan we prepared in advance,” Hagari said in remarks. “As part of the preparations, GPS services will not be available in certain areas - the disruption is deliberate and according to plan. If we detect additional threats with a shorter arrival time, we will update you immediately.”\n\nHagari reminded Israelis of Home Front Command, which helps prepare civilians for conflicts or disasters. With sirens activated, IDF said people must enter shelters and remain there for no less than 10 minutes, though he said it could be longer. He encouraged Israelis to act responsibly and calmly. The IDF remains cooperating with the U.S. and partners in the region to counter launches and intercept them, he added. Protection includes the Israeli Air Force and Navy personnel, as well as the Aerial Defense Array, which includes the Iron Dome Aerial Defense System.\n\nThe defense is not “hermetic,” he said, adding it’s crucial to follow the country's Home Front Command.\n\nU.S. promises to support Israel in face of Iran attack\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke Saturday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and “made clear that Israel could count on full U.S. support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies,” according to a readout of their call provided by Pentagon press secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan also affirmed the U.S.' \"ironclad commitment to the security of Israel\" in a call with his counterpart in Israel, Tzachi Hanegbi, Sullivan said Saturday.\n\nNetanyahu said in an address he appreciates the U.S. and other allies' support.\n\nHow long until the Iranian drones reach Israel?\n\nThe dozens of drones that were launched could take hours to arrive, according to Israel's top-rated Channel 12 TV news. Retired general Amos Yadlin told the channel the drones were equipped with 20 kg of explosives. Israel's military said sirens will sound in any threatened areas. Iran has threatened to retaliate for an April 1 attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed seven of its military commanders. Iran blames Israel for the attack, but Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement.\n\nIran readies missiles for potential attack, US official says\n\nIran has been observed preparing cruise missiles for use in a potential attack on Israel, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, national security officials remained focused Saturday on Iran’s next steps, a second official said. Both officials were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nBiden confirmed Friday that U.S. intelligence showed that an Iranian attack on Israel could happen soon. Iran has vowed revenge for the April 1 airstrike. Iran blames Israel for the airstrike; Israel has not publicly acknowledged its role in the attack.\n\nIran’s anticipated retaliation comes as tensions have spiked in the Middle East as Israel’s war against Hamas continues. The Pentagon has bolstered defenses for the tens of thousands of U.S. troops in the region in advance of the prospect of an imminent attack on Israel and Western interests.\n\nIranian forces seize ship with ties to Israel in Strait of Hormuz\n\nMembers of Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized an Israel-linked cargo ship in the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday.\n\nIranian state media reported that the MSC Aries ship, which carries a Portuguese flag, was taken into Iranian waters. The ship's operator, MSC, confirmed the seizure by Iran and said it was working with authorities to ensure its return and the safety of the crew.\n\nThe crew includes Indian, Filipino, Pakistani, Russian and Estonian, according to White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson. Watson said the seizing of a \"civilian vessel without provocation is a blatant violation of international law\" and an act of piracy.\n\n\"We strongly condemn the Iranian seizure of the Portuguese flagged, British-owned MSC AIRES in international waters,\" Watson said on X.\n\nShip incident comes amid Houthi attacks in Red Sea\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen has been attacking ships in the Red Sea for months, saying it aims for Israel-linked ships.\n\nThe ship seized on Saturday is owned by Gortal Shipping, an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime. Zodiac is partly owned by an Israeli businessman. Zodiac said in a statement that MSC leases the Aries and is responsible for its activities.\n\n\"Iran will bear consequences for choosing to escalate this situation any further,\" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nHasan Alhasan, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Reuters that if the seizure of the ship is in retaliation for the April 1 attack, it may indicate Iran's desire to save face without causing a wider escalation of the regional conflict. \"Iran may be trying to play on fears that it could obstruct shipping through the strait, a passageway of greater significance to global oil and gas supplies than the Red Sea,\" Alhasan said.\n\nBody found of missing Israeli teen\n\nIsraeli officials said the body of a 14-year-old boy who went missing near the Malachei Shalom outpost on Friday morning was found Saturday in the West Bank.\n\nBinyamin Achimair's death was a \"terrorist attack,\" the Israeli military said, while Netanyahu vowed the perpetrators would be found.\n\nIsraeli forces were searching \"from the air and on the ground\" Friday, while groups of Israeli settlers stormed a nearby Palestinian village and set fire to houses and cars overnight. One person was killed and several injured in the conflict, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law by most of the world, which Israel contests. The settlements house Israeli citizens in the occupied land.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/23/unified-korea-possible-if-its-peaceful-chinese-ambassador-cui-tiankai/1059209001/", "title": "Unified Korea possible if peaceful: Chinese ambassador says", "text": "Jan. 23, 2018 Updated Jan. 25, 2018, 4:27 p.m. ET\n\nChina is open to a reunified Korean Peninsula — even if it is aligned with the West — as long as it is peaceful and does not threaten national security, China’s ambassador to Washington told USA TODAY's editorial board Tuesday.\n\nAmbassador Cui Tiankai commented as North and South Korea this month began talking to each other, reducing tensions inflamed by an increased tempo of the North's nuclear and missile tests, and by President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's trading threats and insults.\n\nCui said China would support reunification if it is the will of the Korean people. “As long as it's peaceful, it’s independent (and) by the Korean people, China will support it,” he said.\n\nEven a Western-aligned Korean Peninsula?\n\n“I think it’s up to the Korean people, whether they are divided or unified, to adopt an independent foreign policy of their own,” Cui replied. “They know where their best interests lie.”\n\nCui described China’s principles for resolving the conflict on the Korean Peninsula, which has been divided since the end of World War II and where Chinese and U.S. troops fought on opposite sides during the Korean War that ended in 1953.\n\nChina wants a denuclearization of the entire Korean Peninsula, no armed conflict or chaos on its borders, and for any reunification to happen through diplomacy, Cui said.\n\nOn Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. would back such an outcome.\n\n“We support – if it arrives at that peacefully – we support reunification of the Korean peninsula,” Nauert told USA TODAY.\n\nNorth Korea, which agreed this month to send a delegation of athletes, performers and officials to the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, has said it is developing a nuclear weapon that can reach Washington, D.C., in order to deter an American threat. China, which handles 80% to 90% of the North’s trade, has signed on to numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions intended to limit the flow of goods and funds to the nation’s illicit weapons programs.\n\n“Whenever we find any company or individual violating these sanctions, we will take legal action against them,” Cui said.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies during the Korean War are considering increasing maritime interdiction of ships going to and from North Korea after the U.S. in December, sought unsuccessfully to blacklist 10 ships it said were involved in transferring oil and coal to the North on the high seas, in violation of U.N. sanctions.\n\nThe Treasury Department published photographs of ships apparently transferring oil to North Korean tankers in the Yellow Sea between China and South Korea. One of the ships, Lighthouse Winmore, which South Korean authorities seized in November, had a Chinese crew, was owned by a company based in Hong Kong whose director lives in Guangzhou, China, was leased by someone in Taiwan, and was registered in the Marshall Islands, a U.S. protectorate, according to The New York Times.\n\nCui denied China has anything to do with those ships.\n\n“We have done our own investigation. I don’t think that these ships carry the Chinese flag,\" Cui said. \"In other words, these ships do not belong to China. But as long as such activities are taking place in the areas under our jurisdictions we’ll take action against them.”\n\nThe Trump administration listed China and Russia as global rivals in its national security strategy last month, but Cui disagreed.\n\n“China has no interest in seeking world domination,” he said. “I don’t think any country can really dominate the world.

Madison Cawthorn.\n\nThe North Carolina Republican infuriated members of his own party this week for calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “thug” and the Ukrainian government “incredibly evil” – comments that surfaced just days before Zelensky made a passionate plea to Congress on Wednesday for more help in defending Ukraine against Russia’s bloody assault on the country.\n\n“It was the talk of baseball practice today,” Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican who coaches the GOP baseball team, told CNN. “It’s not the time to toss accusations around like that … What I would just say is, I wish he hadn’t said it. That was the general sentiment (at practice.)”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video: Madison Cawthorn calls Ukrainian president 'thug' 01:47 • Source: CNN Video: Madison Cawthorn calls Ukrainian president 'thug' 01:47\n\nRep. Tom Rice of South Carolina, who has not been shy about calling out his colleagues after voting to impeach former President Donald Trump last year, was even more pointed in his criticism.\n\n“Madison Cawthorn has said he is here for PR and not legislating. I don’t think he’s a serious legislator,” Rice told CNN. “I think he’s more interested in throwing bombs than he is in actually trying to help the country.”\n\n“I don’t think he has very much respect for the Republican conference or anywhere else,” he added. “He’s living in a dream land.”\n\nCawthorn’s latest comments have put GOP leaders in an awkward spot – just as they’re trying to show a unified front against Russia and paint President Joe Biden as weak against Russian President Vladimir Putin. The remarks from a freshman firebrand with the ear of former President Donald Trump risks undermining their anti-Russia position, and critics have seized on Cawthorn’s most recent behavior to accuse the GOP of echoing Kremlin talking points and acting sympathetic toward Putin.\n\nNow, lawmakers from across the conference – including members of Republican leadership – are dumping criticism on Cawthorn and racing to distance themselves from his remarks.\n\n“Madison is wrong, if there’s any thug in this world it’s Putin,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at his weekly news conference on Friday, though he said he’s still supporting Cawthorn’s reelection bid. “You just watched Putin directing Russia bomb a maternity ward. We watched yesterday in a theater that’s identified in the front and the back from the air that you’re housing children – bombed. This is atrocious, this is wrong, this is the aggressor, this is the one that needs to end this war. This is the one that everybody should unite against.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the House GOP’s campaign committee, called Cawthorn’s remarks “unfortunate.”\n\nAsked if Cawthorn is a productive member of the conference, Emmer didn’t answer directly.\n\n“I’m not gonna comment on this,” Emmer added. “I’m focused on one thing and that is winning back the majority and making sure that we stay focused on the issues that matter.”\n\nBut Cawthorn hasn’t always been easy for his colleagues to ignore. Since arriving in Congress last year, the 26-year-old has drawn unwanted attention to his party for his controversial antics, from leading the charge to overturn the 2020 election results to more recently cleaning his gun during a virtual hearing on veterans’ health. On the campaign trail, he found himself in hot water for an Instagram post from 2017 showing him visiting Adolf Hitler’s vacation house in Germany and describing it as a “bucket list” item. And now a federal appeals court is expected to decide soon whether to revive a longshot challenge against his congressional candidacy, which revolves around whether the Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding office should apply to him.\n\nCawthorn’s office has sought to tamp down the backlash over his Zelensky “thug” comments, explaining in a statement that the congressman was just trying to warn the US against getting drawn into another overseas conflict.\n\n“The Congressman was expressing his displeasure at how foreign leaders, including Zelensky, had recently used false propaganda to entice America into becoming involved in an overseas conflict,” Cawthorn’s spokesman said. “He supports Ukraine and the Ukrainian President’s efforts to defend their country against Russian aggression, but does not want America drawn into another conflict through emotional manipulation.”\n\nCawthorn isn’t the only Republican creating Russia-related headaches for the GOP. Cawthorn was one of 15 Republicans who voted against a bill to ban Russian oil imports last week, while eight Republicans opposed legislation this week to revoke normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. Meanwhile, freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who voted against a massive spending bill that contained $13.6 billion in Ukraine aid, recently accused the Biden administration of funding “NATO Nazis.” And last month, Trump described Putin as a “genius” and “savvy” for his invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“I think that there are people in the Republican Party who seem to be enamored with autocrats like Putin. I think it’s disgraceful,” said Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican on the outs with her conference over her vocal criticism of Trump. “I think that when you have people like Madison Cawthorn, Marjorie Taylor Greene, others like the former President, who have complimented Putin, particularly at this moment, when we’re seeing that he’s a war criminal, we’re seeing the brutality – there’s no excuse for people being confused about which side we should be on.”\n\nWhile Cheney often finds herself on an island in the GOP when it comes to condemning the Trump-wing of the party, there were plenty of other Republicans who expressed displeasure with Cawthorn’s “thug” remarks on Friday.\n\nRep. Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican, said it was “not a defensible comment” and wouldn’t say whether he viewed Cawthorn as a productive member of the conference.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, rolled his eyes and laughed when asked about Cawthorn’s remarks, before comparing Zelensky to a modern-day Winston Churchill.\n\nAnd Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who represents a Biden-won district, said Cawthorn’s views do not reflect the majority of the GOP conference.\n\n“I disagree,” Bacon said. “Zelensky has been a tremendous leader. … Ukraine is the victim.”\n\nAcross the Capitol, Cawthorn’s home state Sen. Thom Tillis took a jab at Cawthorn by highlighting reports that Russian TV has been playing Cawthorn’s comments on repeat.\n\n“If your comments are being replayed over and over by Russian state propaganda outlets …” Tillis tweeted from his official account.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican House candidate Michele Woodhouse, who’s running against Cawthorn after supporting him in 2020, told CNN on Friday that people in the district were “really upset” about Cawthorn’s “deplorable comments.”\n\nWoodhouse claims that if Cawthorn wins the primary, he could put the seat at risk despite the Republican advantage in the district. She noted that Cawthorn’s anti-Ukraine comments came as the Congressman was charged with driving with a revoked license and dealing with other traffic citations.\n\n“What I hear on the ground is they just don’t feel proud of who’s there representing them,” Woodhouse said.\n\nSome Republican members, however, avoided criticizing Cawthorn on Friday.\n\n“You’d have to talk to him about it,” Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the hardline Freedom Caucus, said of his colleague’s remarks. “I don’t keep up with everything every one of my colleagues says. But, look, I just think we ought to be very clear about the atrocities, what Putin is doing and we ought to try to help (Ukraine).”\n\nFreshman Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenge, said when asked about the “thug” remarks: “These are serious times and it calls for serious leadership and that’s where my focus is.”\n\nAnd Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, said “yes” Cawthorn was a productive member.\n\n“Look, everybody’s allowed their opinion here to believe what they want to believe about you or me, or Pelosi or Biden or Trump or anybody else, and Zelensky included. Madison’s entitled to his opinion,” Mast said.\n\nBut Mast added of Zelensky: “I don’t think he’s a thug. I think he’s been a great leader.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/europe/brittney-griner-testifies-russia-hearing", "title": "Brittney Griner testifies she signed documents without ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS basketball star Brittney Griner testified in a Russian courtroom Wednesday as part of her ongoing trial on drug charges, telling the court she had no intention of smuggling drugs into the country.\n\n“I still don’t understand to this day how they ended up in my bags,” said Griner, who has been detained in Russia since February, when authorities said they found cannabis oil in her luggage at a Moscow airport and accused her of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance. She faces up to 10 years in prison.\n\nGriner – who plays in Russia during the WNBA’s offseason – pleaded guilty earlier this month, a decision the defense hopes will be taken into account by the court and perhaps lead to a less severe sentence. But the US State Department has classified Griner as wrongfully detained, and her supporters have called for her release, fearing she might be used as a political pawn amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGriner’s testimony Wednesday concluded just before CNN reported the Biden administration has offered to exchange a convicted Russian arms trafficker as part of a potential deal to secure Griner’s release, as well as Paul Whelan’s, another American detained in Russia, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\nThese sources told CNN the plan to trade Griner and Whelan for Viktor Bout – who is serving a 25-year US prison sentence – received the backing of President Joe Biden after being under discussion since earlier this year. Biden’s support for the swap overrides opposition from the Department of Justice, which is generally against prisoner trades.\n\nGriner, who arrived at the Khimki regional court near Moscow on Wednesday in handcuffs, testified that when she was stopped at the Sheremetyevo airport on February 17, she was made to sign different documents without fully understanding what they included.\n\nInitially, Griner said, she signed some documents but was using Google translate on her phone and barely knew what was in them. She was later taken to another room, she said, where her phone was taken away and she was made to sign more documents without an explanation.\n\nNo attorney was present, Griner testified, and she said her rights were not explained to her, which, according to Russian law, should have occurred within three hours. Those rights would include her right to know what she was suspected of and to have access to a defense attorney from the moment she was detained – including the ability to have a private meeting before her first interrogation by authorities.\n\nGriner’s detention, search and arrest were “improper,” her attorney, Alexander Boykov, told journalists Wednesday, adding he would elaborate during the trial’s closing arguments, which are expected in “a couple of weeks.”\n\nIn her testimony, Griner “explained to the court that she knows and respects Russian laws and never intended to break them,” Griner’s other lawyer, Maria Blagovolina, said after Wednesday’s hearing.\n\n“She emphasized that she never planned to bring it to Russia and use it. She also told the court that Ekaterinburg became her second home, and she has always enjoyed her time in Russia,” Blagovolina added, referring to the Russian city where Griner played.\n\nWednesday’s hearing – the trial’s sixth – was, like earlier ones, attended by US Embassy chargé d’affaires Elizabeth Rood.\n\nThe trial is expected to end early next month, Griner’s lawyers have said.\n\nBrittney Griner arrives at court hearing. Emin Dzhafarov/Sipa USA/AP\n\nGriner testifies she used medical marijuana to treat knee injury\n\nThe decision to plead guilty was Griner’s alone, a source close to her said. For weeks, Griner, her family, lawyers and experts had discussed the decision extensively, and given the 99% reported conviction rate in Russian criminal cases, Griner was urged to weigh all the factors, including a plea which could ultimately result in a shorter sentence.\n\nAt the start of her trial, a prosecutor accused Griner of intentionally smuggling drugs into Russia, but Griner later told the court she had not meant to commit a crime, according to state media agency RIA Novosti. The cannabis oil was in her luggage, she said, as a result of her packing in a hurry.\n\nGriner reiterated that statement in her testimony Wednesday, telling the court she was aware of Russia’s drug laws and had not meant to break them, adding that she was in a rush and “stress packing.”\n\nGriner’s attorneys have told Russian judges their client was prescribed medical cannabis for “severe chronic pain.” And when asked Wednesday how she received cartridges with cannabis oil in the United States, Griner said she used a medical permit document issued in Arizona to buy marijuana from a pharmacy for medical purposes.\n\nGriner had a bad knee injury, she said, that put her in a wheelchair for four months, and she used medical marijuana when her knee and ankle joint were inflamed. But she never used it prior to tournaments, she testified, because of the risk it would lead to disqualification.\n\n“No, I would never risk that,” she said. “I never wanted to hurt my team.”\n\nIn a hearing Tuesday, Griner’s attorneys called a narcologist as an expert witness, who testified “medical cannabis is a popular treatment specifically among athletes” outside of Russia, according to Blagovolina.\n\nBoykov stressed the defense’s position is not that Griner was “allowed to import” banned substances into Russia, but they hoped to show the court “even in the United States, where it is allowed, she used these substances occasionally as prescribed by a doctor, strictly for medical purposes to relieve pain.”\n\n“We continue to insist that, by indiscretion, in a hurry, she packed her suitcase and did not pay attention to the fact that substances allowed for use in the United States ended up in this suitcase and arrived in the Russian Federation,” Boykov said.\n\nGriner awaits court hearing. Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool/AP\n\n‘She’s one of us’\n\nBefore Wednesday’s news that the Biden administration has offered to exchange Griner and Whelan for Bout, there had been speculation she could be released in a prisoner swap, similar to Trevor Reed, an American veteran who was detained in Russia for three years before his release in April.\n\nBut before any potential prisoner swap, it was expected Griner would have to be convicted and also admit fault, a senior US official previously told CNN.\n\nGriner’s detention has become a focal point for high-profile American athletes, including USWNT soccer star Megan Rapinoe and four-time NBA champion Steph Curry who called on those listening to stay focused on achieving her release at last week’s ESPY Awards.\n\n“As we hope for the best, we urge the entire global sports community to continue to stay energized on her behalf,” Curry said, when joined by WNBA stars Nneka Ogwumike and Skylar Diggins-Smith to address the issue.\n\n“She’s one of us, the team of athletes in this room tonight and all over the world. A team that has nothing to do with politics or global conflict.”\n\nGriner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, spoke with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month after publicly criticizing the administration’s response to her wife’s detention.\n\nCherelle Griner said she was “grateful” for the call, but added she would “remain concerned and outspoken” until her wife was home.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Anna Chernova", "Dakin Andone", "Anna Chernova"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/desert-magazine/2019/08/20/california-desert-artists-offer-poetry-prose-essays-beauty/1842913001/", "title": "California desert artists offer poetry, prose, essays on beauty", "text": "Aug. 20, 2019 Updated Aug. 21, 2019, 4:52 p.m. ET\n\nThere’s beauty to be found in the California desert.\n\nI’ve learned to predict the best sunsets by the number of clouds in the sky. The fewer there are, the less sorbet streaks across the horizon.\n\nSo, when dusk settles in amid myriad white puffs, I jump in my car with my camera to race the sun to the West.\n\nJagged peaks line the distance as I wind around bends and turn down the static that blares from the radio. Boulders stand stoic in spite of their imperfections. Sometimes, I pull over to capture the beams of light illuminating their crooked edges. And still the sun sets.\n\nHere’s the thing about this journey – there is no destination. When the golden moment comes, I pull into a ditch on the side of the road and venture out to find Joshua trees forming black silhouettes against the watercolors seeping upwards into the sky. My shutter flits to preserve the instant before it’s gone, but more often than not, I find myself kneeling down in the dirt to take in the sight without the lens. There’s something wild about reveling in the nip of wayward winds as the sun melts into the horizon.\n\nPoet Arthur Chapman once wrote, “Out where the world is in the making, where fewer hearts in despair are aching, that’s where the West begins.”\n\nWherever you are in the desert, you can watch dusk fade into dust.\n\nFor centuries, locals and visitors alike have searched these peaks and valleys. Those of us who come face to face with the elements emerge with a tale.\n\nThree years ago, I asked our community to share those stories. Since September 2016, DESERT magazine has published responses submitted by artists from Palm Springs to Joshua Tree and beyond.\n\nThese are “the ways in which we seek – and find – beauty in the desert.”\n\nHere’s to simply showing up.\n\nKristin Scharkey, Editor\n\nkscharkey@gannett.com\n\nIt’s 1980 and I’m 9 years old, walking down Palm Canyon at dusk with my grandfather. He’ll only live another five years. A heart attack will kill him – his fourth, or maybe his third, since I’m not sure if the story of him having a heart attack while catching a marlin is actually true – so this is borrowed time, which is probably why he’s smoking a cigar. “Don’t tell your nana,” he says, lighting up.\n\nIt’s fall and everything is reddish-gold: gaudy baubles in their jewelry store display cases. Brake lights from cruising Cadillacs refracting out from store windows, painting the sidewalk brilliant. Even Morrie Geyer – proprietor of Morrie Geyer Menswear, standing outside his shop in a scalloped shirt opened halfway to his belly-button, his tan chest exposed – seems to glow. Or maybe that’s the life-sized mannequin of Morrie. It’s hard to remember the difference all these years later. You ever saw a person standing next to a mannequin of themselves, well, it distorts reality.\n\n“Have you heard from your dad?” my grandfather asks. I tell him I haven’t. He takes a puff from his cigar, let’s it go from his mouth. “When was the last time?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I say. “My birthday?”\n\nWe linger in front of See’s Candies, across the street from Bullock’s. The sweet smell of chocolate and confection rises around us, but then it’s been like that the entire time we’ve been walking, Palm Canyon seemingly filled with candy stores, men in the front windows spreading out fudge, their aprons smeared. Teenage girls stepping out to give you a sample, and it’s like magic, candy from nowhere, and free.\n\n“Well,” my grandfather says, “I’m right here. If you want to talk about something, just talk about it with me.” He gazes down, forces a smile, which makes him look like my mom. They have the same lips. This morning they got into a screaming fight, she stormed out of the condo, spent the day by the pool, smoking, my grandfather’s last words hanging between them: If I gave you a dime, you’d spend a dollar. “You understand? Man-to-man, Man.” A pause, the street moving fast around us now, lights, snippets of conversations, the roar of a muscle car, a breeze that feels like winter ... or maybe none of these things, just a boy and an old man on the street. “We should get some lollipops,” he says, and we go into the store. “Get whatever you want and whatever your sister would want. Buy the whole store if you want.”\n\nHere’s the thing about beauty: It doesn’t need to be physical. It doesn’t even need to be emotional. It can be a moment of simple kindness that you forget about entirely, until one day you’re stopped on Palm Canyon, a street you hardly drive down anymore, because you live across town.\n\nYou know how that goes.\n\nYou hardly get west of Bob Hope during season.\n\nYou look at the people crowding the sidewalk, something to watch while you wait for the light to change. To get on with your life. Get off this street. All this traffic. All these tourists. But then you see a boy in front of See’s and you remember yourself, standing right there, so long ago that you’re closer in age today to your grandfather than your childhood self. And it’s all you can do not to run out into the street to find your grandfather, too. To tell him you heard him, that you still hear him, on beautiful fall days, at dusk, in the smoke of a stranger’s cigar, always when you least expect it, like driving through the city of your past or waiting for some distant golden future.\n\nTod Goldberg is the New York Times best-selling author of more than a dozen books, including the novels “The House of Secrets,” which he co-authored with New York Times best-selling author Brad Meltzer and “Gangsterland,” a Hammett Prize finalist.

Not the chosen solitude where it’s 78 degrees at the start of summer, the air is perfect, the sun a soft lemon. It’s the kind of solitude that leaves you stranded. The air is heavy and the rain hasn’t lifted for days. The streets, which in a different light run silver, today are rivers of mud and all is a murk of gray. A lingering rain has soaked the fire logs. They burn smoke. There are four cartons of eggs in the refrigerator, half expired, along with a bag of old apples.\n\nOn days like this I would drive. But I’ve been without my pickup truck, a winter heartbreak. The drive would lift the solitude, the unchosen kind. It’s a freedom unmeasured. And one unmeasured freedom I’ll share with you. There’s a lookout on the 15, high in the San Bernardino Forest. In the valley below, a freight train comes through, diverting and romantic. The first time I saw it I pulled over. The train was long and winding and rolled cautiously downward. I watched and thought of its countless journeys, each a tale. The moon shone bright on the valley and I, a speck in those mountains all around me, wanted to throw my hands up and be lifted like a child. The train vanished into cottoned layers of fog. It was time to go home. I took the backroads to Highway 247 and then through Johnson Valley.\n\nEach time I’d drive to the outlook to see the train in the valley, it would somehow be there faithfully, a familiar anticipation, the kind that fulfills a seeking heart. It made my heart remember an anticipation of a different kind. A time I put on a dress and a faux fur stole and went out to a concert hall to hear the strings, at the hopes a companion might be there, and he was, on the other side of the crowd waiting for me.\n\nAnd what else is beauty but an anticipation, a symphony in our hearts.\n\nOn this morning, the morning of expired apples and mud rivers, sometime around three o’clock in a dream, a train appeared at my door hovering in its own steam. I heard the gardenia branches thrashing against my window and saw the train waiting there. It was a lustrous black metal, with passenger benches of shining leather.\n\nI was tired and disoriented. I got out of bed, my feet cold on the winter floor. Putting on my hooded robe draped over the bedpost, I walked through the door and stepped onto the train. We glided past the creosote bushes through the desert down through Morongo Valley and up to Tahquitz Peak where I stepped off, and walked through the pines, kindling under my bare feet. I turned to see if the train was still there. And perhaps I awoke.\n\nRecovering from illness at her mother’s farmhouse in Pennsylvania in 2012, Mercy read the Hemingway letters.

With its kinks and curves it reaches out with divine secrets. It summons us with whisper and warning.\n\nIt makes us feel foolish and weak as it stands solid and reliable. It humbles us with its simplicity and complexity, with its beauty and Draconian texture.\n\nThe Joshua tree, it will outlive us all and never have to check its Instagram account…\n\nSerene to some, but others could not take the quiet, the calm, the dead air that the desert delivers. Can your ego survive the silent treatment? Because the desert has questions. Who are you? What is your purpose?\n\nSolitude and silence beckon and insist that you face the man in the mirror and peel back the layers.\n\nIf you do find yourself looking for some chatter, there is no shortage of prismatic personalities.\n\nThe cast of characters one has the propensity to stumble upon out here could turn Wonderbread into pumpernickel, enriching your soul or scaring you away with peculiar peril.\n\nWe’ve got shamans and shaman wanna-be’s, cowboys and cowboy wanna-be’s, hippies, hipsters, yuppies and tricksters.\n\nWe’ve got stoners, prophets, tourists and hermits, ex-movie stars, new movie stars, rock stars and rock climbers. Filmmakers, drug takers, Marines, witches, bikers and city slickers looking to invest in the latest desert trend; selling spirituality to the lost, the hungry, and the full.\n\nAnd then, there’s the hawk. Can we talk about the hawk with its wings majestic and wide, soaring over our petty chaos and inflamed importance? Its only worry but to find its next meal, it flies freely over sacred land, taking in miles of beauty each day. The coyote, the rattler, the scorpion, the rabbit, just to name a few others that inhabit this arid sand-land with us.\n\nAs creepy crawly as some of these creatures may be, I’ve learned to honor, respect and enjoy them in their natural environment.\n\nYou can’t talk about the desert without commenting on the cosmos… The vast and unexplainable speckled sky. Constellations so clear and the moon like a floating mystic kite. Its power surges and permeates your soul on a starry night. The swirly sunsets of port-wine cheese melt into the western hemisphere as we all grab our phones to capture and behold. The murky and moody shades of blue that don’t even exist in a box of Crayola display themselves in a sorrowful soliloquy. What better place to contemplate the universe and the meaning of life than under the Mojave moon?\n\nThere is one question I have consistently been asked by out-of-towners over the years with much bewilderment: “What do you do here?” And it’s funny because I have never been at a loss for something to do. It’s quality not quantity out here in these parts.\n\nWherever you are, there you are; and where is that exactly? In the middle of nowhere or the middle of somewhere?\n\nHome on the range or outer space? The land of the lost or lost in place?\n\nThe streets may have no name but that just leaves more for our imaginations to conjure, and conjure, we will…\n\nCowboys and aliens travel through time\n\nThe wild wild West, magic saucer ride\n\nRound up, lasso, beam or probe\n\nThe eye-less leader is wearing a robe\n\nHome on the range, or outer space\n\nEveryone’s breeding for the master race\n\nLickety banana splits, giddy up\n\nPrehistoric land of the UFO\n\nSgt.

It took 25 years of living in the Coachella Valley for me to be drawn into the mystic, spiritual beauty of the desert landscape.\n\nThe awakening was more than what my eyes could see. It was an out of body experience, a feeling that hit an emotional nerve, like a familiar song on the radio that brings back good childhood memories. I felt sensitive and emotional, and I silently cried.\n\nIt began in the summer of 2017, assigned to an investigative story in Joshua Tree. Missing hikers. The twists and turns, like a Law & Order episode, were constant. I was in the high desert for secret meetings and interviews, early mornings, and weekends. My seasoned reporter instincts kept me coming back for more. Or, was it the need to see the high desert sunrise? The calm across the desert? The individual Joshua trees backlit by the perfect light of the rising sun? Breathtaking, leaving a gulp in my throat every time. For me, the beauty of the desert includes the people. Their stories, their seemingly self-confidence to be themselves and find a home and life where others only see sand.\n\nThe hikers were found dead. A murder/suicide. An emotional ride for me as I got to know the father of the male hiker and the group of people who showed up every week to help him find his son. We now share a bond, brought together by tragedy.\n\nTragedy with a backdrop of truly amazing beauty, so heavenly, something more than who we are. My eyes have been open all along the way, but I only began to see the true beauty of the desert in the summer of 2017.\n\nKaren Devine is an award-winning television journalist and investigative reporter for KESQ News Channel 3, the ABC affiliate and Fox in the Coachella Valley.

I would spin the globe as fast as I could and stop it with my finger. Wherever my finger would land, I declared that I would travel there one day. My little game was the precursor to the bucket list concept. Since my finger mostly stopped in the middle of an ocean, I had to spin and spin until I hit some land. One time, I spun the globe so hard that it orbited out of its contraption onto the floor. I retrieved the globe like a basketball player readying to take a foul shot — one hand on the North Pole and the other on Antarctica. Antarctica subsequently went onto my bucket list.\n\nAfter becoming an adult, I no longer left my travel inspirations to chance. I informed myself the old-school way — by reading. I read adventure stories and pondered over travel magazines and maps.\n\nIn 1966, Francine, my best friend and I, were standing in front of Whisky A Go Go in Hollywood. Two guys drove up in a convertible. One of the guys asked if we wanted to go to Palm Springs for the weekend. I eagerly responded with a yes! There were no mothers around to tell us otherwise. I had never heard of Palm Springs, but I did wonder if it was some place magical since these guys were leaving the excitement of Hollywood even if just for a weekend. I presumed that this Palm Springs must be the place to be. Well, Francine put a damper on this notion. “We-are-not-going-anywhere-with-these-guys,” she said in a motherly tone. I recovered after a fleeting moment of disappointment when I soon realized that I could just add Palm Springs to my travel list.\n\nI finally made it to Palm Springs — the first time in 1974 just to see if it was really real, and the second time in 1992 when I came to stay. I have made a continent-full of scratch offs on my travel list. The desert surroundings mirror and even surpass some of the exotic destinations that I have traveled. If I want a little bit of the outback, I take to the Lykken Trail. If I want the Aegean Sea, I go to — you guessed it — the Salton Sea.\n\nThe desert provides a dramatic backdrop for which artists practicing all art forms can create and curate their craft.

Strong enough to hold my weight and the weight of another, their grayish-white trunks and branches lay barren of leaves all winter. Despite the harsh desert climate, they seem to still grow with little water.\n\nIt was last summer that it started. Laying in my hammock, I would feel water drop from the clear blue sky onto my warm skin.\n\nTiny droplets sprinkled my face and arms.\n\n“Do you feel it raining?” I’d ask a reclining hammock friend.\n\n“No. There are no clouds in the sky,” they’d reply.\n\nEvery time I felt a water droplet on my skin, I would rush to find it.\n\nBut it would cease to be there.\n\nAs the mysterious disappearing act continued in this way, I started to feel I was going mad.\n\nWeeks into spring this year, I went out to revisit the trees to discover they were bare. Despite having one of the wettest winters the desert has had in decades, the trees were not part of the super bloom. I hurried to water them immediately. Two days later, they sprouted their first leaves. Ecstatic, I lay in my hammock for the first time in a while.\n\nSoon, I felt a drop of water on my skin again. I gazed up at the sky, embraced by its radiating sunshine. Then, turning to look down at my arm, I saw it – a clear, tiny water droplet!\n\nI digested for just a moment that I had seen it with my own eyes. Admiring these two trees in wonderment, I asked myself how many lives have they lived before?\n\nThese magical raining trees – are they crying? If they are crying … is it from joy or sadness?\n\n“Which is it, oh magical trees?” I asked aloud.\n\n“What has happened to your spirits that have resulted you to communicate this way? As the wind rustles your branches and you sprout new leaves, is it growing pains? Is it the happiness of being alive?”\n\n“Will you tell me if I listen?”\n\nIn my blue striped hammock, I pray.\n\n“I will listen intently, and watch for your tears,\n\nFor you both have been my confidantes these past few years,\n\nYou saw me weep as well,\n\nBared witness to my struggle on a fateful day,\n\nThat it takes to heal and grow in the desert.\n\nYou saw me laugh ’til I couldn’t anymore,\n\nWhisked away as I read adventures through your branches.\n\nI will hear your story, just as I have told you mine.\n\nI will live inspired by your strength,\n\nLean into your supportive trunks,\n\nCherish it,\n\nFor there are so many stories your branches have to tell,\n\nAs they twist and turn throughout your life.\n\nAs you continue to thrive in the harshest of deserts.”\n\nLauren Bright resides in Morongo Valley. She considers her loves to be writing, dancing and painting. Also, she has a cat named Cat.\n\n“Desert time” was a concept I heard often before finally moving to the desert. I understand that it means things just take longer here. The plants and trees grow slower. People’s lives move slower. I heard it is hard to get things happening because, well, “desert time.” I thought, “I have been living in cities and working in fast-paced industries for 15 years. I am going to keep my usual pace.”\n\nLiving in the high desert for over one year now, I have lived through all the weather changes, the wildlife cycles. I have observed the subtleties of each season. I have experienced how the light changes throughout the year. I have been shocked at how the position of the sun varies so much from winter versus summer. In the winter, the light shines well into my living room on the south side of the house. In summer, the sun is so far north that it is on the other side of the house and doesn’t even shine into the living room at all.\n\nTime is funny here.\n\nIn the summer, it is easy to naturally wake up at or before sunrise. Get up and try to cram in as much as you can before the midday sun forces you indoors to a slow halt. The animals are out as well, to make the most of the morning. The roadrunners and gamble quails scurry around for snacks. Ground squirrels scramble from bush to bush to avoid becoming one. A nap in an air-conditioned space is the best way to avoid the afternoon heat. The hours from 1 to 6 p.m. are slow. Sluggish. The sun is relentless and I am convinced it will never drop below the mountains to the west. Five hours that last seemingly forever. As the sun is about to dip, but there is still light in the sky, turning on the stove or grill to cook dinner doesn’t seem so insane anymore. While cooking dinner, get some chores done before daylight is totally gone. Eat dinner al fresco. Take a walk around the neighborhood. The light on the plants then is magical. Saturated colors make everything look so rich. The bunnies come out to hop around and eat.\n\nIn the winter, days look beautiful from inside the house. The sun is shining, but finally not oppressive. Skies are clear and blue. But, go outside and the winds are maddening. They can last days, weeks. Everything around your house blows away unless it is heavy or bolted down. Our old aluminum windows rattle and shake all night. Will the Joshua tree finally uproot and fall over? Am I safe sleeping under a giant window of glass? Will the windows break and blow in? We pick up roof shingles around the yard after the big winds. Nature is slowly taking our house apart. The view is beautiful, but there are small opportunities of good working time. Then you race against daylight, because once the sun sets, it is pretty much time to be inside. Eat dinner and head to bed. Desert midnight is around 8 to 9 p.m.\n\nWe all know the desert is a place of extremes. Hot and cold. Dry weather and flash floods. Time is also an extreme here. There are days that fly by, when the sun time is short and you can never get enough done. Then there are those summer months that it seems will never end. You have cabin fever and wonder why the hell you moved to such an unsustainable environment.\n\nMy favorite days are the ones where I need to get to the studio to work, but I am so in awe of the beautiful landscape that I procrastinate by wandering around the land, checking on new blooms and plants. I know that I need to hurry up and get to work, but for some reason my instinct is to slow down and enjoy the scenery because, well, desert time.\n\nJanelle Pietrzak is a full-time weaver. After a lifetime of moving all around the country, she has settled in the high desert town of Yucca Valley where she owns a textile design studio and tiny shop called All Roads.\n\nAfter a long week of work, the last thing I wanted to do was get up from my couch. As I watched my Miami Dolphins squeeze out a last-second win, I could see the sun starting to cast a faint pink glow on the Little San Bernardino Mountains, and the weight of regret tugged at me.\n\nI’d told myself I would find a way to get outdoors that weekend, but with a bum ankle, a party Saturday night and the remnants of a hangover still lingering, I figured it might have to wait. The mountains and their hiking trails would still be there next Saturday.\n\nThen my gaze caught my Canon DSLR, almost forgotten in the corner of the room. It brought me back to the afternoon I first drove up the 10 freeway, and saw Mt. San Jacinto and its snow-covered tip two Februarys ago. My bookshelf, my TV, my kitchenware, my closet of clothes – once removed from a moving truck and carried into a room that felt so foreign then – now set the stage for a place that felt a little too much like a home I took for granted.\n\nI’d always promised my mom, who screeches for joy whenever she walks out of my apartment to see the mountains in the morning while visiting, that I’d never stop appreciating this indescribable place where I lucked into a job. So instead, I got up, quickly grabbed jeans and a long-sleeve shirt from my bedroom floor, snatched my Canon and my car keys, and hopped in my Ford Fusion to try and beat the sunset.\n\nDespite my heavy foot on the gas – screaming up Highway 62 as fast as other cars and traffic lights would allow – when the young woman at the gate to Joshua Tree National Park said, “Have a great day,” I worried I would leave disappointed.\n\nStill, I wove back and forth through the park and finally reached Keys View, taking the last parking spot as droves of people with their tripods had beaten me. Rather than try to shuffle between them, though, I struggled to find the unmarked rocky path up to Inspiration Point, nearly breaking into a dead sprint in my boots to cover the half-mile as quickly as my legs would move.\n\nAt the top, though the wind whipped and the couple sitting next to me snickered in between kisses and puffs of their blunt, it was the deepest quiet my ears had sensed in quite some time. As the big ball of light began to inch its way behind the towering mountains that create Palm Springs’ border, the click of my shutter broke the silence in the most pleasing way.\n\nTime was only defined by the dipping of the sun, the settling of the clouds, the ebbing and flowing of the reds, oranges and pinks of the sky, and the adjusting of the exposure on my camera. No Facebook notifications. No football scores. Just an unparalleled front seat to the greatest light show in Southern California.\n\nI was right. That trail, those mountains, the majestic sunset will be there tomorrow, next weekend, even next year, but I may not. And when I wake up in an urban high-rise apartment with towers of brick, metal and glass obstructing my view, I’ll regret those days and nights I put off adventure and beauty for another day.\n\nNathan Brown grew up in the freezing winters and humid summers of the Midwest, just north of Indianapolis in Indiana.

This piece originally appeared on her blog.\n\nThis winter, in the shimmer of morning, I was invited to stay on the west shore of the Salton Sea in a house hidden in the date palm plantations of the desert valley, a welcomed quelling of the loneliness and wind of desert mountains. The invitation appeared the way all things do in the desert, by secret prayer, answered. The house was small: one room with sand-plastered walls painted magnolia, one wooden bed, one cane-backed plantation chair, and a large arched window.\n\nI accepted the invitation and spent afternoons curled on soft cotton, piled high, white with warmed patina. Protected by the sacred fronds, I’d drift in and out of daydreams and look out onto the desert.\n\nAt the end of the rows of date palms and ranches was a sea, neglected and forgotten, with waters of murky lavender that lapped onto powdered fish bones. Spellbound, after sleep, I would visit and stand on the sacred bones as the spun gold of the heavens faded.\n\nOne duskfall, I noticed across the sea on another shore, inklings of splendor and echoed lullabies. I wanted to be nearer, so I pushed a paint-chipped boat into the water, climbed in and without oars, trusted the sea’s current.\n\nI drifted across the wakes until I arrived at a row of quiet dwellings. Upon stepping out of my boat, I noticed a girl sound asleep. Hovering above her bed, her black hair fell like a waterfall. She slept in the looming twilight as the ruffled gauze of her faded apricot gown whisked the air.\n\nShe had been there all along on the opposite shore and had slept all winter. I kept my distance so as not to wake her. I wondered who loved her. And couldn’t help but imagine love must have sent her into such a peaceful sleep that she floated above her own piled cotton. She glowed in the sea’s reflection of the arriving moon.\n\nI left her sleeping and continued on. The ghostly sands blew onto the streets past the lonesome shacks.\n\nI heard a melody in the distance. A chanteuse sang through an open window. Her porcelain fingers plucked notes from the strings of a well-traveled guitar. She sang of her heartbeat just as I could feel mine. Strangers gathered around to listen to her words of sweet loss and heard her long after the singing. I fell asleep under a grand tamarisk tree in her yard and in the morning as I opened my eyes, its branches swam in the air, still lullabied.\n\nI walked to the sand to find my boat. The sea was now a shade of mint tsavorite. A poem set softly alight by the sun read: “I still love you.”\n\nMercè Clay wrote this in homage to the Bombay Beach Biennale 2019, and was especially inspired by installations “Loving, Loving” by Vera Sola, “Levitation” by Josèphine Wister Faure featuring gown by Heidi Merrick and “I Still Love You” by Olivia Steel. Thanks to Lauren Brand, hostess, for an invitation to the evening.\n\nPulled over at a Vista Point to check the oil,\n\nI step out barefoot onto gravel\n\nWarmed by the sun.\n\nThere’s no cell reception and\n\nNo cars in either direction –\n\nJust clouds swept from the bottom by wind.\n\nI’ve been driving home all day into a breeze,\n\nThat has the baked earth smell I find so comforting,\n\nAs I pass from the Sonoran Desert into the Mojave.\n\nI look down the slope to a wash\n\nObscured by desert willow and\n\nPlants I don’t know the name of.\n\nI’m feeling thoughtful,\n\nSo I consider all the roots tapping into\n\nThe moisture from old rain,\n\nAnd beneath them an ancient aquifer,\n\nAnd beneath that, rocks that may never be exposed,\n\nHeated not from the sun, but from the core of the earth.\n\nI wonder what it’s like from underneath looking out:\n\nThe plant root hairs,\n\nThe tiniest dimples of my footprints,\n\nThe long rugburn of the highway,\n\nAnd the moon,\n\nA faded crescent today,\n\nLike an angel on the earth’s shoulder.\n\nKara Sajeske is an illustrator living and working in Joshua Tree.

So many people talking at me, the sound of dishes clanking and froth wands whistling at my regular coffee shop. Music playing at work. Class lectures. The sound of the dishwasher running. Somehow, even at the end of the day, when the lights are turned off and my phone’s across the room, I can still hear the electricity of the city humming through my walls and my pillow.\n\nAnd then it starts all over again.\n\nAlarm. Breakfast sizzling. Traffic honking. 8 hour lectures. People talking. Dishes clanking. Music playing. Washers going. Outlets humming. Alarm. Breakfast sizzling. Traffic honking. 8 hour lectures. People talking. Dishes clanking. Music playing. Washers going. Outlets humming.\n\nSilence.\n\nAnd I hold my breath, cause surely this is a dream.\n\nIt’s still...silent.\n\nAm I dreaming? I guess it’s not technically silent. But there’s no noise.\n\nI hear the wind whispering and the sand grinding beneath my feet. As if I were pinching salt between my fingers.\n\nI’m back to the infinite golden hills at sunset. No man or skyscraper in sight. The lands so empty, I feel my mind breathing just from the sight of it.\n\nStillness.\n\nAnd sadly it’s not a dream. But gladly it’s a memory. One from not too long ago.\n\nI know some people who feel abandoned in the desert. They feel alone and forgotten, forsaken and betrayed. Yet, how come I find rest in a stagnant, barren land.\n\nI once heard God sing a desert song.\n\nIt wasn’t what I expected.\n\nIt was one note. Held out for a long moment. And there were no instruments behind the one note.\n\nJust silence. And it put me right to sleep.\n\nI imagined him painting the hills. With as much intention as the boulders in Yosemite. That kind of intentionality in art puts my soul at ease and my mind to sleep.\n\nI don’t live in the desert anymore.\n\nI live in a busy city, within a busy life with a lot of noise. But I’ve found that my sobering moments, the ones that take place in my mind, take place in the desert where I use to reside.\n\nEmily Wall is a 23 year old full-time student studying acting, dance and film in Redding California, though her hometown is Palm Desert.

This woman meant well, I’m sure, but I didn’t plant the rosebushes.\n\nI did spend many hours in my rocking chair on my front porch, staring across the arroyo into the chaparral covering the neighboring mountain. I breathed in the air scented with pungent white sage, the spicy vanilla of the blooming redshank, and the patchouli-like stink of our tiny native wildflower whose name no one knows. I drew the desert air deep into my lungs and released it as slowly as I could. Seconds of breathing turned into hours which turned into days. Time passes slower in the desert, it seems. Time passes, but grief does not.\n\nEach loss carries its own means of navigation, but no promise that the next one – because one thing life can promise is that there will forever be a next loss until finally, restfully, we reach the ultimate one ourselves – but there is no promise that the next one will hurt any less. With each loss we learn to bear not only this one, but that one. That next one coming.\n\nWhen I was a little girl growing up in the Imperial Valley, 15 miles from the Mexican border, after every earthquake my family would drive into the desert and search for signs of damage. It was never hard to find.\n\nThere were rifts, fissures and ridges. There were fresh new cracks in the rocky sand whose soft edges crumbled into the tiny abyss when we stepped too near. The earth had changed. The face of the map had been re-drawn. One had to learn a new method of navigation, if, say, the road had shifted a few feet away. But the journey wasn’t over. The journey didn’t end because the road did.\n\nMy heart, my life, is a quake-damaged landscape with areas labeled ‘Here there be monsters,’ but I’ve learned not to avoid them. I explore those areas tentatively, offer a gentle stroke of recognition to the monsters I encounter, tell them they are welcomed to take up residence. My monsters are my battle scars, my mythological reminders that I fought and lost but yet live. I welcome them, each one, lovingly, because even the wildest beast may be tamed.\n\nThe desert sky is wide enough that I don’t need to plant a garden to reflect my losses. The dry wind bears it, each scent supports it. Ultimately, the space here may hold multitudes. Grief is a monster that never goes away. We carry him forever; but in time we learn to manage the weight of him. Just carrying him makes us stronger.\n\nSara Marchant received her Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and Writing for the Performing Arts from the University of California, Riverside/Palm Desert.

I get up, change from my pajamas into a simple T-shirt, gym shorts and tiny tennis shoes. I’m 6 years old and I’m happy.\n\nMy mom, my sister and I drive to the entrance of the Sabas Nieves trail of the El Ávila Mountains in Caracas, Venezuela. I always get lazy at the start, but once we start going up the trail, the trees, the views of downtown Caracas and the promise of my favorite ice cream once we get back down keeps me going.\n\nHiking the Sabas Nieves trail was a weekend tradition back then. Years have passed, our family grew and traditions changed, but the memories of our hikes have always stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nIt’s been almost eight years since I left Venezuela and almost five years since I left my parents’ house in Texas for college. When I accepted an internship at The Desert Sun and relocated to Palm Springs almost two years ago, I knew nothing about the Coachella Valley. I had lived in the U.S. for six years and, having resided in Houston and Baton Rouge, I forgot that living in an area surrounded by mountains was a possibility.\n\nNow, Caracas and the Coachella Valley could not be more different. One’s a city within a valley in a tropical, humid area merely an hour from the Caribbean Sea, and the other is an arid, desert region with cactuses, intense heat in the summer and a whole lot of sand. But the first time I saw the San Jacinto Mountains along the desert cities, I remember feeling like I was back home.\n\nBut being far away from family and old friends, working hard and dealing with life’s ups and downs can be isolating. So, I hold on to old memories and make sure I create new ones by exploring the world I now found myself in.\n\nEvery Friday, I set my alarm for an early morning wake-up call, hit the snooze button about 10 times. I get up, change from my pajamas into a simple T-shirt, gym shorts and somewhat bigger tennis shoes. I pick up my friend at her house and we hike South Lykken Trail.\n\nWe talk about work, our lives, plans for future vacations and where we are going to have lunch when we’re done. Between admiring the recently revived plants (thank you rainy winter) and each other’s support, we make it to the top.\n\nAs I look at the valley from above, I think about my family and how they’re always with me even when we’re apart. I think about my friends and the many adventures we’ve gone on. I think about how lucky I am to have landed in a place like this and in that moment, even after the worst of weeks, I am happy.\n\nJose Bastidas is the food reporter and producer for The Desert Sun. Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, Jose moved to the U.S. in 2009 and studied Mass Communication at Louisiana State University. He first moved to the Coachella Valley when he accepted an internship at The Desert Sun in 2015.\n\nWhen I travel, I struggle to find time to sit back, enjoy, contemplate and observe my new surroundings sufficiently. Meticulously calibrated schedules sever my connection to my natural senses and leave me stressed out. It is no easier to find time to think and ponder at home.\n\nAs a recent resident of Palm Springs, I still enjoy some anonymity in public spaces where I can meditate uninterrupted (at least until a friend or neighbor greets me). Somehow I get energy from being in the presence of other people, especially those I don’t know. I can gather up their vibes, store them and feel revitalized enough to give them all back to others.\n\nI discovered this power in New York City, where I could walk among thousands of people, collecting energy like a squirrel collects acorns. In Florence, I would sit in the Piazza della Repubblica and absorb the history in every stone, monument and tower. At Leidseplein square in Amsterdam – filled with chairs and tables on a sunny, warm day – I imagined comedy and drama flowing from my fellow diners.\n\nOnce while sitting outside the Starbucks at the corner of Tahquitz and Palm Canyon, I realized I had found a similar space in Palm Springs. My local, public square is bounded by the Starbucks, the Welwood Murray Memorial Library, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and the empty space under construction where I hope the 22-foot-high statue of Marilyn Monroe will return. While the desert modernist grandeur of the library represents the sole architectural focal point, adding Marilyn across from the library could create the perfect architectural counterweight (as it once used to be).\n\nIn my square, like other European plazas, I can sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and a pastry while watching the downtown foot traffic. After finding the optimal seat for viewing, I savor the aroma and flavor of my brew, nosh a bit and enjoy the parade. If I am in a restless mood, my thoughts go to, “Oh, no! What is that he’s wearing?” But more often, I play games like “What country are they from?” or “Are they married or dating?”\n\nIf the passersby don’t grab my attention, there is sometimes a person at a nearby table whose life story I can fabricate. What to others may look like an ordinary tourist in my mind has become an international opera star trying to avoid the paparazzi, while the man behind her tries discreetly to take her photo with his phone. I might even play the role of a secret agent or slumming celebrity.\n\nThese moments alone are rarely guilt-free because there is always some other more productive use of my time. But for the small rental fee embodied in a purchased cup of coffee, a seat at my public square provides a welcome respite from my daily routine.\n\nDavid Kelly is a former banker, executive chef and lawyer who currently enjoys writing and performing his works at CONNECTED, Bohemian Café and The Desert Sun’s Coachella Valley Storytellers Project.

Benitez-Brown) is a Filipino-American artist, who splits his time between Quezon City and LA.\n\nHot weather is a regular part of life in the Coachella Valley.\n\nThis past summer, temperatures soared above 120 degrees; even during fall months, the heat often rises above 100, sometimes late into October. How can anyone live through this – months of triple-digit temperatures – let alone find beauty at this time of year, when, due to the understandable mass exodus of fair weather residents and tourists, it often feels like we’re living in a ghost town?\n\nLike many others, I hide behind dark curtains, holding a seemingly endless vigil of waiting for the sun to go down. When it does finally slide behind Mount San Jacinto and cover the valley with a long curtain of shade that begins in Palm Springs and slides across the desert floor to the Little San Bernardino Mountains, I venture outdoors to mostly empty roads.\n\nEven though temperatures often hover in the 90s or higher at this time of night, I emerge from my South Palm Desert condo to go on my daily walk. I wear my reflective, fluorescent green Nike tank top, the lightest shorts I have and a small backpack that holds my 2-liter CamelBak reservoir filled to the brim with water and a 1-liter water bottle, frozen solid.\n\nDuring my one-hour, 4-mile roundtrip walk, the water bottle will completely melt. As the sky darkens, I walk uphill along Highway 74, passing Silver Spur trailer park and Cahuilla Way. I steadily sip water and hold the frozen bottle alternately to the back of my neck, the front of my chest and under each arm, to help cool myself down.\n\nAs I begin to unwind, my senses tune in to the sound of raucous crickets hiding in the thick desert landscaping in front of Bighorn Golf Club. The rhythm of walking helps to ease the tension in my housebound muscles, and I start to breathe more easily. I get closer to the edge of the wild desert, to the curve in the road where Highway 74 begins to switchback up into the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument, and I look up at the dark sky and am astonished by the beautiful view of warm stars and a toenail of new moon. I feel the sudden rush of a connection to the deep magic of the desert, with its infinite possibilities and ancient history, and I sense the rustling of the palm tree oases I know are tucked into the canyons just beyond where I stand. I imagine a family of thirsty bighorn sheep picking their way down rocky cliffs to drink, and I’m overwhelmed with the understanding that this is a wild desert that few people truly know, evoked only during times of intense weather such as this.\n\nAnd then, I hear the yips of a pack of coyotes cascade down from Cahuilla Hills. When their cries fade into the darkness, I savor the silence, which now feels like a warm balm rather than loneliness.\n\nRuth Nolan is professor of English at College of the Desert.

She spends most of her time taking photographs, writing poetry, or wandering around the desert.\n\nEvery desert trip began with a quick stop off Highway 10 for date shakes and chili at Hadley’s. We’d sit at the counter beneath black and white signed photos of old Hollywood stars I was too young to recognize. Giant tour busses parked alongside the green and yellow building while tourists took a bathroom break or browsed the aisles of mixed nuts and novelties. This was our desert ritual that meant we were almost there…\n\nTurquoise waters sparkled against the stucco and concrete of a generic condominium complex pool, which overlooked a brilliant green golf course in Palm Springs. This is where my dad taught me how to swim.\n\nOverwatered lawns and manicured sidewalks encircled a royal blue manmade lake in La Quinta, where in the mud between the grass and concrete path, my cousins and I played with army green toy soldiers and mini plastic farm animals while my grandparents made sandwiches or went out for a round of tennis.\n\nA few years later my sister and I took the 10 on our own, to dance across the emerald green polo fields of Indio. We moved to the sounds of Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV On The Radio in little jean cut offs and big sunglasses under a cloudless sky.\n\nThe desert I seek now is not painted in such vivid greens and blues, after all my parents are divorced, my grandparents are long gone, and Coachella now costs half my paycheck to listen to bands I no longer know. So those desert memories are magic to me, as they capture the time when my family came together and actually shared meals. When adults and children spent just as much time playing as the other. The desert was our haven, where life was vivid and worries were none.\n\nToday I know how water is such a precious resource, how 330 acres of manicured lawns is unnatural, almost criminal, and how life’s worries will follow you wherever you go. But I still long for the desert, seeking the magic it carried for me before I knew magic was something to be sought after. I continue to come back here, not just to relive those memories that undoubtedly shaped who I am today, but to chase the desert’s brilliant sunsets, expansive horizons and magnificent super blooms. To look up at the sky and see stars I forgot were always there. To watch the sunrise because I want to – not because I have to on my way to an early work shift. To look out at a sea of dirt, dust and Joshua trees. To marvel at the blanket of yellow gold wildflowers across the desert floor. To sit in quiet, far from any reception or media, so that my mind can finally think for itself. To sip on a date shake while I recall the time I first learned to swim, or when I danced the night away beneath the desert sky, or when life was vivid and worries were none.\n\nNina Harada is a writer, actor and artist.

Along the way I spot a number of bushes and plants from our hour with the guide, making sure to repeat the names I’ve written down so that they don’t get lost like so many other things.\n\nSoaptree yucca. Wolfberry. Desert marigold.\n\nThe plants of a childhood spread out across the high deserts of Arizona and California, always present by never quite appreciated. Now I cling to their names like a free climber to a ledge, determined not to take for granted the landscape that dominates my life, waking and sleeping.\n\nI will admit I have an ulterior motive. Our early dates revolved around taking advantage of the natural beauty of Arizona. Somehow, despite living in a place renowned for its expansive landscape and access to nature, we seem to have lost the magic of those first explorations together. Our Sedona trip for me represents a lifeline back to that place where everything is new and each discovery together is a forking in the trail with no clear end in sight.\n\nWe pause at a rock wall on top of a ridge to take advantage of the shade provided by a ponderosa pine. It’s our first opportunity for conversation that doesn’t involve one of us having to stare at the back of the other. Our conversation, observed by the red and umber striped peaks of nearby Cathedral Rock, meanders in a way that is both pleasant and familiar. We talk about erosion and the nature of colors. We discuss how we would foster a sense of curiosity in our theoretical children by encouraging them to explore the natural world. We make plans for more hikes, more time away from our community, more intention in how we spend our time together.\n\nOn that lookout in the land of tourists and overpriced crystal shops, it becomes clear that this day was not a bad idea; it was exactly what we needed.\n\nA guitar plays.\n\nThe sound bounces off art-laden walls, filling the concert space.\n\nI sing an Indian folk song which wildly enters the sonic forest.\n\nOutside, the desert is quiet.\n\nJoshua Tree takes me as I am this cold night. Barren land makes space for me to croon in the language of my grandparents, “Kesariya Balam, padharo mhare des!” Oh my Beloved, come to my land!\n\nI drove into the desert in May of 2015, freshly divorced and hoping for the kind of redemption that breathing new air always seems to offer. As I passed a familiar, color-changing mountain, the cacophony of heartbreak rang in my ears, and I almost missed its message. The mountain’s message, that is. It came to me as two clear, sequential instructions:\n\n1. Write a poem, and\n\n2. Have courage\n\nI thought exactly what anyone would think: That’s a dumb, bossy mountain that clearly has no real-life experience. It’s never gone through a complex problem requiring a robust solution.\n\nI unloaded my car of the clothes and books I’d brought from Texas, and rested my head in my mother’s lap before doing the inevitable – Googling “local poetry reading.”\n\nThe next morning, I formulated a poem in my head while driving to an open mic. I ordered an organic brew and dribbled the words of the poem onto the back of the receipt.\n\nComing down from the creative high, I could smell the words. They reeked of having loved too much. They smacked of the sort of pining that remains popular in Bollywood films but is too buttery thick for my American sensibilities. Adding to its deficiencies, the poem had too many driving metaphors. I decided it couldn’t be released into the Universe, so I placed the whimpering piece in my back pocket. Without skipping a beat, the saucy mountain let out an “ahem!” for ignoring instruction No. 2.\n\nA couple of cloistered months later, I went to another open mic and did what I swore I wouldn’t do – I became that kind of poet and apotheosized both my lost relationship and my slowly fading identity. My ex-husband and I got the two-become-one-thing right, but in all the wrong ways. As he disappeared from my life, “I” disappeared from my life. Standing before several desert poets, I festered in the fury of all the avoidable mistakes we had made. They clapped for me. Smiled at me. Deflected from the smell of pity in the air by telling me they liked “this image” and “that simile.” They forgave me.\n\nThe barren desert wasn’t barren after all.\n\nMore than two years later, I’m under the balcony seats of a secluded concert venue, not far from the Joshua Forest. You know, the forest with funny, punky looking trees that would never judge me. Or you.\n\nMy voice emerges from within the audience,\n\n“Saajan aaya…”\n\nThe Beloved has arrived.\n\nCapital “B” beloved.\n\nMy listeners are either confused or captivated. Outside, the mountains are quiet and still in the chill of an exceptionally starry night.\n\nSamira R. Noorali is a well-rounded writer and with experience in journalism, poetry and playwriting.

A car was already marooned in the current, with its driver standing on the other side, waiting for some help.\n\nIf not for the harrowing possibility of being washed away, the day was as picturesque as they come. Migrating birds with white feathers and long legs wading through shimmering water, set against the backdrop of snow-topped mountains and a cobalt sky.\n\nI heard the water rushing over the hidden asphalt. The current carried rocks and vegetation, making a roar and muting the otherwise audible noise from people and engines. I was astounded by the force and speed of this impromptu river, crashing into civilization as residents were on their way to Target or the Post Office.\n\nI hear stories from people who were raised here, about a time when the whole valley would shut down while the wash crisscrossed every major artery of Palm Springs and the surrounding towns. I am learning the power of the Whitewater River and its distributaries, as well as its primary source, Mount San Gorgonio. Also known as Old Grayback, and part of the Transverse Ranges, its snowmelt feeds the river and its frenzied washes.\n\nIt’s not hard to be in awe of the dramatic changes we experience in the Coachella Valley. We live in this desert of opposites. Nature and technology. Cactus and rain cloud. Our senses are surrounded by beauty so raw, we are drawn to touch it. Engage with it. Immerse ourselves utterly and escape the digital rhythms of our lives. The harsh summers provide us with a Mother Nature so unforgiving, we are reminded of our tenuous hold on this planet. We witness the cycle of birth and death annually, as the rain and river give life, and the arid heat takes it away.\n\nI returned to the same spot today on Cathedral Canyon, hoping to see those white birds. The yellow grasses told me what I already suspected. Other than a rill no wider than three feet, the landscape was transformed back into a field.\n\nThat day by the wash will remain with me forever. Life was reinvigorated for a momentary season of excess and plenitude. Down here in the valley, the lizards, the saltbush and we humans are but passing through. Our inventions of conditioned air and roaming vehicles help us to survive, but I will always have respect for the power of wind, water and temperature.\n\nThey come for the winter, visitors from northern climes, and indeed it is sight to behold the nature that flourishes here. The mountain draws our eye to the sky. A netherworld of snow and cloud peers down on us as if from another time zone. Ancient and silent, the mountain’s silhouette is an elder. San Jacinto speaks to us in a language of memory, and we may listen freely, if we choose.\n\n“Remember this cycle of abundance and growth, of lack and conservation. Imprint it in your DNA. Pass it on to your children. I will erase the dry riverbed’s dust with a yearly offering of water from my stone temple, to sustain you for another day.”\n\nMelissa Jordan Willis is an artist, wife and mother – and a Los Angeles transplant four years ago.

I stood there numb to everything.\n\nNow, what? What about that loft we were going to get? Or the two children we imagined running in our backyard?\n\nSnapping out of my daze, I heard his voice shouting from downstairs, “Grab my bike off the mantle, will you?” The studio now looked like it did the day we arrived. Empty. Sunlight hit the wooden floors, and I closed the door before slipping the keys under. The smell of the panadería across the street whiffed into my nose as I took one more glance at the old man who waited to die on our street every day, smoking his last cigarette while notes of jazz filled the city. All of this ultimately became a part of me.\n\nBut this isn’t our story; it’s mine, and you’re just a part of it.\n\nI hauled everything I owned into my car, with my ex-lover’s bicycle attached to the roof. The fog eventually disappeared, the roads shifted from pavement to gravel and the heat seeped into my skin. Mountains on every corner replaced buildings, and we were back on 1-10 headed for the desert. The only noise you could hear was the clamoring of the wine glasses we bought together, the rattling of his bike and a loud, vast, open sound only the desert landscape can produce. Two summers ago, after a stint of city living and what seemed to be an enormous amount of young love, I found myself back at my childhood address. Seeing the windmills silhouetted against the mountainside, the comfort of home rushed into my body. The desert held a familiar scent – my grandmother’s Filipino cooking, soy sauce mixed in with vinegar, ginger and garlic simmering ever so slowly in a huge metal pot, along with the subtle smell of coconut bundled in banana leaves – and the feeling that everything was going to be alright. Or at least that was the sensation I craved.\n\nThere I was, unpacking everything in my parents’ garage. I’d left behind one of the best teaching jobs in Oakland and a life I thought I knew. On the evening of my return to the desert, the gradient of colors from the sunset melded into a fiery warmth that embraced my existence. Within that moment, I realized I needed to let all of it happen.\n\nExhausted from the drive, I went to the backyard and dug my feet into the earth. The damp grass felt good against my hot skin, and I wasn’t sure how to move forward or if I even could. As I looked up at the summer moon, my body knew this was the end of a relationship but the beginning of something new. Sometimes people, places and things happen because they help you arrive at your next destination. I never planned to move back here, but the desert chose me.\n\nMichelle Castillo is a writer, educator, community arts organizer and social activist based out of Palm Springs.

While the car is on. It’s 4:30 a.m. and I’m wondering if the McDonald’s in Baker is open 24 hours. I’m wondering if I’m up for whoever would be at a McDonald’s in Baker in 5 a.m. I’m gauging the drive to Tecopa and imagining, over and over, sinking into the hot mud of the spring. I lift my head into the cold air, hands still rubbing each other in the exhaust, and see the first light hit the white cross and then bleed out on the pink rocks. Mojave Desert Preserve, January.\n\nMy 9-year-old daughter scratches the ice on the inside of the SUV window, thrusting her hand out of the mass of her sleeping bag wrestled into a sitting position. Heart, she scratches. Smiley face. And then the dog’s name. We’re up.\n\nIn the next hour, she’ll watch the local college field trip cool older kids at White Cross Campground get up from their dozen tents and start packing for their day’s trek. She’ll get growled at by the dude in the remote back of the dispersed camping area who wants us to stay further than 200 yards from his motorhome. She’ll scramble through scree to find petroglyphs peeking through chia flowers. Until we are parked and drinking hot tea made on a burner in the back of the truck while the trains rush by, the conductor blasting the horn at her, at us, the only humans standing within a few miles, waving back at him, as he shoots past and sinks back into the desert.\n\nLater, after the dog barks at being left standing on the lava rocks as we crawl into a cave, after we carry the dog down the ladder into the lava tubes, stand in the cave a bit, and carry the fool dog back up, a guy says to her, watching the entire circus enterprise, “You should know, you have a really cool mom.” But I want to tell him, oh tell her anything at this age, she also thinks I’m a good singer and God knows that’s not true. But she also knows I just tossed her a cup in the back of the car and said pee here then. She knows there comes a moment in every night in every tent where I say enough, please stop talking. She is just now getting old enough to know all moms are not like me. If I get the balance just right, somewhere between tough love and gentle listener, that may in the end be said to be to my credit.\n\nIn the meantime, January in the cold desert still sounds good to her, so I haven’t broken her yet.\n\nLiving in the far southeastern end of the Coachella Valley was not always something I appreciated. Definitely not when I was a younger person. Growing up on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian Reservation in Thermal, the desolateness seemed to stunt my ability to dream. The vast open desert, agricultural fields and treacherous-looking mountains represented infinite emptiness at the time. I remember feeling so far away from anywhere, and believing that everything was happening someplace else.\n\nIn high school, my parents facilitated an interdistrict transfer for me to Palm Desert High. They believed I would receive a better education there. It was a different world from the community of Torres Martinez. Some of my fellow students had cars at ages 16 and 17 that were more fancy and expensive than those of our teachers. Life seemed privileged for a lot of my peers. But not for me and not for the young people I knew growing up. Our reservation and the surrounding rural community was, as it still remains, a place where many who live there work the hardest and also earn the least.\n\nExperiencing this proximity of poverty to extreme wealth in the desert was suffocating to me. Thus, as a teen, I could not wait to leave. Fortunately, my university education led me to schools in South Dakota, Humboldt County in Northern California and the Bay Area. All places of tremendous beauty. America’s vast great plains. The regal redwood forest. The state’s largest estuary. These journeys had the same origin and led me back to the same place, Torres Martinez. Each voyage away from home strengthened my appreciation for the reservation landscape. The distance from the rushing nature of city life now fosters my ability to think clearly.\n\nPeople often come to our area and see nothing but poverty and potential for expansion. But the reality is that Desert Cahuilla history, lifeways and culture have been there far longer than anything else. Those of us who were taught to can see the places relevant to our creation all around us. Everything, down to the natural colors of the earth, has meaning to us.\n\nIt’s clear that not everyone sees it this way. To some, our home area is a place where they can leave things they don’t want near them. Unwanted human waste, polluted water, old furniture and useless appliances are dumped in our homelands. Developers don’t see the wide open space as a sanctuary for free desert animals and plants to live, like my family does. Though the tribe has authority on what happens within our boundaries, there’s no regulating everything. Our quiet is encroached on weekends with the sound of bullets ringing out from sport hunters who are after the birds, as well as the incessant hum of cars from the nearby racetrack.\n\nThe proximity that once drove me away is coming even closer to my home. But now, it’s what keeps me around appreciating all that remains.\n\nTerria Smith is a tribal member of the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.

The excitement around this year’s lineup reminds us how much pride and passion there is within the Portuguese community, not only here in Rhode Island, but across the world.”\n\nSince the 2026 IPMA ceremony will coincide with the 52nd anniversary of Portugal’s Carnation Revolution, IPMA Co-Founder José “Zack” Xavier revealed that a special surprise is being planned.\n\n“It’s going to be a special day,” Xavier said. “We’re going to have a special intro performance to commemorate the 25 de Abril.”\n\nThe IPMA show will air in Portugal on RTP1 and worldwide through RTP International and additional television networks across North America, and it’s expected to reach more than 20 million households.\n\nIn his remarks, IPMA President Manuel da Costa thanked their sponsors and stressed how the IPMA is a celebration unlike any other.\n\n“This is unique in the world,” he said. “We don’t do this show because there’s money to be made; there’s culture to be celebrated.

Widely regarded as the hottest Portuguese-language act today, they pair massive streaming numbers with sold-out arenas. Known for hits such as “Te Amo” and “A Nossa Dança,” the two siblings currently serve as mentors on The Voice Portugal.\n\n“They’re one of the biggest Portuguese-speaking acts in the world right now, and having them on the IPMA stage is a true honor,” Saraiva said.\n\nD.A.M.A: Lisbon’s hit-making pop trio blend sleek hooks with hip-hop and acoustic flair. Known for hits such as “Mãe” and “Casa,” they’ve become one of Portugal’s most popular contemporary acts.\n\nRichie Campbell: With his roots in reggae and dancehall and his voice now leaning into R&B and afrobeats, Portuguese star Richie Campbell has sold out Lisbon’s MEO Arena and earned multi-platinum status at home. Known for popular tracks like \"Do You No Wrong\" and \"Love Again,\" he is also the founder of the independent label and agency Bridgetown.\n\nNémanus: The Portuguese duo have become a staple of Portuguese-language party anthems. Known for hits like “Amar no YoY o” and “Fazer com Ela,” they’re celebrated for their upbeat sound and high-energy performances.\n\nNelson Sobral: The Portuguese-Canadian singer-songwriter blends roots rock, soul, and blues with heartfelt storytelling. A two-time IPMA nominee, his music pairs classic rock grit with soulful vocals and magnetic stage energy.\n\nAssol Garcia: A Cape Verdean-American singer based in Boston, Assol Garcia fuses soulful vocals with Afro-Lusophone and world-music influences. She is a three-time IPMA nominee, and won the IPMA \"World Music\" category in 2024 with her song “Caxon Ka Tem Cofre” (ft.

Chu, the fantasy musical received mediocre reviews compared with last year’s beloved hit, although the Oz prequel has still cast a spell on the box office. “Wicked” stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande also managed nods for their turns as witches Elphaba and Glinda, while the film received two additional nods for best original song (“No Place Like Home” and “The Girl in the Bubble”).\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nSydney Sweeney\n\nThe polarizing young star earned a standing ovation and ecstatic reviews out of Toronto Film Festival for her transformation in “Christy,” a sports biopic about real-life boxer Christy Martin. But the film’s glowing reception was overshadowed by poor box office and headlines around Sweeney’s controversial American Eagle jeans campaign, and ultimately has been a nonstarter this awards season.\n\nWill Arnett and Laura Dern in ‘Is This Thing On?’\n\nBradley Cooper has directed two awards heavyweights in 2018’s “A Star is Born” and 2023’s “Maestro,” both of which earned multiple Oscar and Globes nominations across categories. But the actor-turned-filmmaker may not have such luck with “Is This Thing On?,” a scrappier, lighter dramedy about a man (Arnett) who discovers stand-up comedy after splitting from his wife (Dern). Neither Arnett or Dern made it into the drama acting categories, and the film was blanked across the board.\n\nHugh Jackman\n\nThe Australian showman is out on the Oscar campaign trail for “Song Sung Blue,” an agreeable yet middling biopic about Mike and Claire Sardina, who fronted the Neil Diamond tribute band Lightning & Thunder. Hudson earned a best actress nomination for her winning turn as a tragedy-stricken singer, but Jackman’s dramatic turn was ignored by the Globes.\n\nWunmi Mosaku\n\nThe \"Sinners\" standout has picked up awards momentum this last week, winning best supporting performance at the Gotham Awards and earning a nomination from the Critics Choice Awards. But the Nigerian-British breakout was passed over for a Globes nod, while Emily Blunt (\"The Smashing Machine\") surprised in the best supporting actress category.\n\nRachel Zegler\n\nSay what you will about Disney’s much-maligned “Snow White”: Zegler was absolutely enchanting in this live-action reimagining, bringing gumption and warmth to an otherwise two-dimensional character. In a year that is short on genuine comedies and musicals, voters could have made room for this Golden Globe-winning “West Side Story” star.\n\nDaniel Craig\n\nCraig has been nominated for three best actor Golden Globes, two of which were for “Knives Out” movies. But his latest stint as Southern-fried detective Benoit Blanc in “Wake Up Dead Man” was curiously absent from this year’s nominations. If we had to guess, there may have been category confusion, since Craig's singular sleuth takes a backseat to Josh O’Connor’s reformed bad-boy priest.\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nThere’s an alternate universe where Lopez gets her long-overdue first Oscar nomination for “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” in which she soars in some of the most spectacular song-and-dance numbers in years. But the big-screen musical was a box-office calamity, and her Globes snub sadly feels like a nail in the coffin for her chances this season.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\n\nIn \"Marty Supreme,\" the Oscar winner delivers a true movie-star performance as a fading icon who just can’t shake Timothée Chalamet’s puckish social-climber. But not even Paltrow could squeak into this year’s most competitive category, with multiple supporting actress contenders vying for slots from “Sinners,” “Sentimental Value” and “One Battle After Another.”\n\nDakota Johnson\n\nIn a less-crowded year, Johnson would be a Globes shoo-in for her wry work as a New York matchmaker in “Materialists” – one of the year’s few indie films that was a legit box-office phenomenon. But with flashier performances in the comedy or musical category, Johnson’s thoughtful showing went unnoticed.\n\nLiam Neeson\n\nIf you need further proof that the awards engine is broken, look no further than Neeson’s inspired work in “The Naked Gun” reboot. The laugh-a-minute spoof showed up nowhere in this season’s nominations, while more dramatic turns from Jesse Plemons (“Bugonia”) and George Clooney (“Jay Kelly”) sneaked into the comedy category.\n\nChanning Tatum and Kirsten Dunst in 'Roofman'\n\nChalk it up to poor marketing and a crowded opening weekend, but this gentle charmer has mostly vanished from the Oscar conversation, save for a supporting actress nod for Dunst from the Independent Spirit Awards. That’s a shame, because both Dunst and Tatum do career-best work in this low-key, true-life tale, which was totally blanked at the Globes.\n\nJeremy Strong\n\nIn the afterglow of fall festivals, Strong seemed poised to ride the goodwill for Jeremy Allen White in the solemn biopic “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” Strong was the film’s highlight as Bruce Springsteen’s attentive manager Jon Landau, although the “Succession” actor was unfortunately passed over on Globes nomination morning.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/11/07/taylor-swift-beyonce-not-nominated-grammys-2026/87125979007/", "title": "Taylor Swift, Beyoncé aren't nominated for 2026 Grammys.

Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nThe history-making project broke several records and earned Beyoncé multiple accolades. She was the leading nominee at the 2025 Grammy Awards with a total of 11 nods.\n\nShe took home multiple awards including album of the year and best country album, presented by Swift. It was the first time a Black woman was nominated and won in the category. That same year, Swift received a total of six nods though she did not take home any awards.\n\nIn July, Beyoncé closed out her 32-stop Cowboy Carter and Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour, and it became the highest grossing country tour of all time. Since the tour, fans have begun anticipating her next \"Act III\" album, which she has yet to announce.\n\nTaylor Swift's 'Life of a Showgirl' released after Grammy eligibility period\n\nSwift announced her 12th album \"The Life of a Showgirl\" in a promo for fiancé Travis Kelce's podcast \"New Heights\" 12 minutes after midnight on Aug. 12. However, the album wasn't released until Oct. 3, about a month after the August deadline for the upcoming award show.\n\nThe 12-track project has already had a historic run. Shortly after its debut, \"The Life of a Showgirl\" broke the modern-era record for the most albums sold in a week in the United States, selling over 3.4 million units in pure album sales. It became the largest sales week for an album since Luminate began recording data in 1991.\n\nSwift also released a corresponding movie \"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl\" on Oct. 3. The film came in at No. 1 at the North American box office that same weekend with $33 million, according to estimates from Comscore. That meant Swift had the No. 1 album and No. 1 movie on the same weekend, a feat not even Prince accomplished with the release of \"Purple Rain\" in 1984, Deadline noted.\n\nSwift's \"The Life of a Showgirl\" album will be eligible for the 2027 Grammys.\n\nFollow Caché McClay, the USA TODAY Network's Beyoncé Knowles-Carter reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @cachemcclay.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/12/08/golden-globes-nominations-list/87606680007/", "title": "'One Battle After Another' tops 2026 Golden Globes nominations list", "text": "Updated Dec. 8, 2025, 3:24 p.m. ET\n\n\"One Battle After Another\" is shaping up as an Oscar contender after a strong showing in the Golden Globes nominations announced Dec. 8.\n\nThe Golden Globe Awards air Jan. 11 on CBS and stream on Paramount+ (8 p.m. ET/5 PT).\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Emma Stone and George Clooney were all nominated for a Golden Globe in the lead acting categories.\n\nOscar season has an early favorite, with \"One Battle After Another\" receiving nine Golden Globe nominations.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's acclaimed movie is up for best comedy/musical, as well as best actor for Leonardo DiCaprio and best actress for Chase Infiniti, at the 83rd Golden Globe Awards, which announced this year's nominees on Dec. 8.

Beyoncé’s unexpected win of Best Country Album and Album of the Year, Kendrick Lamar's five Grammy sweep and Doechii being the third woman to win Best Rap Album since the category’s creation made for a stellar awards show. The 2025 Grammys will not soon be forgotten, as they came in the wake of years of outcry over the Recording Academy's controversial decisions and deeply ingrained racial bias.\n\nGrammy nominations were released on Nov. 7 and there has been no shortage of internet discourse since. Many fans were stunned to hear that Lorde’s “Virgin” received zero nominations, along with The Weeknd’s “Hurry Up Tomorrow,” the latter being an ironic decision given that The Weeknd performed multiple songs at the 2025 Grammys after publicly boycotting the show for snubbing his “After Hours” album.\n\n\"Lorde is a wonderful artist who has been around a long time and has gotten her share of criticism, but who hasn't?\" FSU English Professor David Kirby said. \"I've noticed the Academy often reacts when the public criticizes its snubs, so look for her to get some nods next time around.\"\n\nThe FSView asked 38 students about their predictions across more than 20 categories, some of which proved much more divisive than others. The most anticipated decision is Album of the Year, a respected award recognizing an album’s artistic and technical excellence.\n\nStudents were torn between four albums: “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” by Bad Bunny (27%), “Chromakopia” by Tyler, the Creator (23%), “Mayhem” by Lady Gaga (17%) and “Man’s Best Friend” by Sabrina Carpenter (17%).\n\n“DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” is a complex work that combines personal reflection on memory with political commentary on Puerto Rico's history. The album immediately received critical and commercial success, with “BAILE INoLVIDABLE” becoming the most-streamed song in the world for a brief period.\n\nIf Bad Bunny wins this category, he will further cement this album as a significant cultural statement for Puerto Ricans by using his fame to highlight their issues: gentrification, displacement, exploitation, colonialism and disaster recovery.\n\nRecord of the Year is another significant category that highlights the recording of a song, focusing on the performing artist, producers, engineers and mixers who put it together.\n\n“Abracadabra” by Lady Gaga led with 27% of the vote, followed by “Wildflower” by Billie Eilish (21%), “DTMF” by Bad Bunny (21%), “Luther” by Lamar and SZA (17%) and “Manchild” by Carpenter (14%).\n\nSong of the Year focuses more on the song’s composition: its lyrics, melody and overall structure. The two most popular predictions tied: “Abracadabra” by Lady Gaga (20%) and “Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters” (20%).\n\nThis outcome solidifies Lady Gaga’s “Abracadabra” as one of the best single releases of this year. “Abracadabra” became Gaga’s biggest solo song debut on Spotify on its release day. It is also notable that the soundtrack for “KPop Demon Hunters” has become so popular that it is considered comparable to that of major pop artists like Gaga.\n\nBest New Artist is a category that recognizes an artist whose work achieved a breakthrough into public consciousness during the consideration period. KATSEYE (30%) is a girl group that has exploded in popularity over the past year, so it is no surprise that many students think they will bring home this Grammy. Still, pop-soul artist Olivia Dean (23%), pop-jazz band The Marías (17%) and dance-pop artist Addison Rae (17%) were close behind.\n\nThe most popular music genre is, as the name suggests, pop, and students are in overwhelming agreement about who will win these categories at the next Grammys. 52% of students agreed that Chappell Roan’s newest hit single, “The Subway,” will win Best Pop Solo Performance.\n\nSurprisingly, 48% of students decided that “Defying Gravity” by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo will win Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, which would be the first song from a movie musical to win this category since “Shallow” from “A Star is Born” (2018).\n\nMany students agree that the Best Pop Vocal Album will be Carpenter’s “Man’s Best Friend” (50%), even though she received fewer votes for the categories in which her single “Manchild” was nominated. Carpenter won this category at last year’s Grammys for “Short n’ Sweet.” A staggering 83% of students agree that Carpenter’s “Manchild” music video will win Best Music Video.\n\nThe predictions for what will be named Best Dance/Electronic Album were staggering: 76% of students expect a landslide win for “Fancy That” by PinkPantheress. The number of students who predicted Tyler, the Creator’s “Don’t Tap the Glass” to win Best Alternative Music Album was an overwhelming 57%.\n\nThe Grammys’ rock category has been relatively uninteresting for the past few years, with most previous nominees being bands whose relevance was long gone; for example, The Rolling Stones won Best Rock Album in 2025 for “Hackney Diamonds” despite the album receiving little critical praise.\n\nAbout 59% of students predict Hayley Williams’s single “Glum” will win Best Rock Song. Students also predict that “Private Music” by Deftones will win Best Rock Album, continuing the Grammys' trend of giving the most prestigious rock awards to long-established artists.\n\nThe R&B category has been overtaken by songwriter, singer and producer Leon Thomas. He has won a Grammy for his producing work before, but 2026 might be the year he is fully acknowledged for his musical talent. About 44% of students predict Thomas will win Best R&B Song for “Yes It Is” and 58% predict his newest album, “Mutt,” will win Best R&B Album. Still, there are two close contenders for Best Song: “Heart of a Woman” by Summer Walker (24%) and “Folded” by Kehlani (24%).\n\nThe rap genre is the second-most-popular music genre and the music of Tyler, the Creator and Lamar has overtaken these categories. Predictions for Best Rap Song are semi-evenly split between “Anxiety” by Doechii (20%), “TV Off” by Lamar featuring Lefty Gunplay (32%) and “Sticky” by Tyler, the Creator featuring Glorilla, Sexyy Red and Lil Wayne (39%).\n\nBest Rap Album is almost a split between Lamar's “GNX” (48%) and “Chromakopia” by Tyler, the Creator (48%).\n\n“This is one of the best Rap Album of the Year lineups in years,” Senior sociology major Kai Smith said.\n\nThe anticipation surrounding the 2026 Grammy nominations has sparked lively discussion among FSU students. As this award show continues to evolve, it underscores the necessity for diverse voices in music and many of these predictions reflect that FSU students care about this.\n\n“The Grammy Awards suck. It’s just another way for major record labels to create more buzz around their top artists to generate more sales revenue. The whole thing is just a popularity contest,” Senior musician and international affairs major Zach Juhlin said. “It’s a bunch of artists voting for other artists with no real concern for creativity. Sometimes they’ll actually get it right, but most of the time it’s just the industry hyping itself up.”\n\nGrace Myatt is a Senior Staff Writer for the FSView & Florida Flambeau, the student-run, independent online news service for the FSU community.

The vehicles will be invited to our comparison event in October, when we can drive vehicles back to back and learn more about their features and technology.\n\nNine finalists – three for each award category – will be announced at the Los Angeles auto show in November. That gives jurors a few more weeks for further evaluation and test drives.\n\nThis year, the jury also created a scholarship fund for people seeking careers in journalism and automotive design and engineering.

Kemp was a three-time All-Star, two-time Gold Glove winner and two-time Silver Slugger. He finished with 287 home runs, 184 stolen bases and a .284/.337/.484 slash line.\n\nSP Cole Hamels (59.0 career WAR)\n\nHamels was a workhorse pitcher who spent the first 10 of his 15 seasons in the majors with the Philadelphia Phillies. As a 24-year-old in 2008, he led the Phillies to a title -- earning MVP honors in both the NL Championship Series and the World Series. A four-time All-Star, Hamels finished his career with a record of 163-122 and an ERA of 3.43 in 2,698 innings.\n\nThe ballot also has a Washington Nationals flavor with three former Nats among this year's first-timers.\n\nInfielder Howie Kendrick , who hit the clutch home run in Game 7 to propel Washington to a World Series title in 2019.\n\n, who hit the clutch home run in Game 7 to propel Washington to a World Series title in 2019.

Drummond said the four were chosen from a pool of 44 applicants that included city, county, tribal and state criminal justice professionals.\n\nDrummond said the idea for the award program came from his work with an organized crime task force created earlier this year by his office. He said part of the effort involved building relationships with tribal, state, federal, county and municipal law enforcement officers.\n\n“As a result of that experience, I realized that we need to celebrate the best and brightest of Oklahoma’s law enforcement community,” he said.\n\nDrummond's new program comes during the same time the attorney general is considering a run for governor in 2026. Candidates across the political spectrum often tout endorsements from police and fire unions in their campaigns.\n\nDrummond, however, declined speak about a possible race for governor. \"I think it's premature,\" he said. \"The problem is the day that I either announce for reelection or announce for another office is the day people are going to go, 'Oh, everything that Drummond does is political.'\"\n\nDrummond said he was focused on his job as attorney general — the state's top law enforcement official — and part of that job is to ensure that law enforcement officials are recognized for their work. He said the finalists for the program were nominated and chosen by other representatives of the law enforcement community.\n\nMike Fina, the executive director of the Oklahoma Municipal League, an association that represents and advocates for the state’s cities and towns, said he believed recognition programs like the one launched by Drummond could have a positive impact on the 587 cities and towns in the state and assist with the recruitment of new law enforcement officials.\n\n“We struggle with (finding police offices) in small towns,” Fina said. “I wish he’d do the same with volunteer firefighters. It’s a big struggle there, too.”\n\nThe program also has drawn praise from police, union and municipal officials.\n\n“It’s great to see the AG’s office recognizing the amazing work our state’s law enforcement officers perform day in and day out,” Oklahoma City police Sgt. Gary Knight, a spokesman for the agency, said in an email.\n\nEchoing Knight, the president of the state’s police union said his organization hoped the award program would be a positive reflection on law enforcement as a whole.\n\n“I think society often needs to be reminded of the valuable role that law enforcement plays in keeping our community safe and our residents safe,” said Mark Nelson, president of the Oklahoma State Fraternal Order of Police. “It’s appropriate to honor officers who’ve done a phenomenal or outstanding job that might deserve recognition.”\n\nNelson added that law enforcement officers often don’t go looking for recognition and often shy away from it while simply doing their job.\n\n“We’re just out here to serve our communities,” he said. “Anytime we can highlight the role, even specifically some of these officers to the public of what it is that we do ... most people don’t see that day in and day out.”\n\nWho are the 2024 nominees?\n\nThe nominees and the four regional winners will be recognized at a Dec. 2 reception, during which the state's Officer of the Year will be announced.\n\nIn a news release about the program, Drummond said the four finalists represented “courage, selflessness and unwavering commitment.” The finalists include:\n\nOklahoma City Police Department Detective Lauren Cunningham, representing the northwest region of the state.\n\nCunningham is a 16-year police veteran. She has served in the homicide division and investigated crimes against children and cases of domestic violence. Drummond pointed to Cunningham's investigation of the deadly 2023 shooting at Whiskey Barrel Saloon as an example of her work.\n\n“They spent weeks assembling video, photographs and 3D imaging technology to show the movements of the defendants at the crime scene,” Drummond’s news release said.\n\nOklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Derek Fry, representing the northeast region of the state.\n\nA nine-year veteran of the highway patrol, Fry is one of two recipients of the 2023 Trooper of the Year Award. Drummond said Fry was instrumental in stopping a Kansas armed robbery suspect.\n\nAfter lethal force was authorized, Drummond said Fry fired on a suspect's car near Highway 412. The suspect lost control of the vehicle and ran away toward a populated area. Fry chased the suspect, who was armed with an AK-47, and fatally shot the man. Fry is currently with the Oklahoma Counter Terrorism Intelligence Center.\n\nNorman Police Department Master Police Officer Benjamin Gomez, representing the southwest region of the state.\n\nIn 2023, Gomez was named the Norman Police Department’s Officer of the Year, earning recognition for his work in “all facets” of policing, including submitting more than 230 felony/misdemeanor charges, completing more than 819 calls for service and serving more than 360 hours of community outreach.\n\nDrummond praised Gomez for his quick actions that saved a 2-year-old who had been choking and his efforts that led to the arrest of a couple charged with trafficking fentanyl.\n\nBryan County sheriff’s Deputy Austin Murray, representing the southeast region of the state.\n\nDrummond said Murray was able to subdue a suspect who had chased his fleeing wife and two children. The man's pickup had struck the wife’s vehicle, forcing her to crash into a tree off a highway near Achille.\n\nMurray, who has been with the department for nearly four years, recently received the Medal of Valor from the Oklahoma Sheriffs' Association for his actions in the case.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/29"}]}

The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned of rock and mudslides.\n\nBy Friday, the massive storm will stretch across nearly the entire central U.S., from the Gulf Coast to the Canadian border, threatening everything from whiteout conditions to damaging winds, unusually warm temperatures, wildfires, dust storms and tornadoes.\n\nAccuWeather senior meteorologist Tom Kines told USA TODAY the storm could be among the strongest on record in terms of low pressure.\n\n\"This is going to be a very significant, very strong storm,\" he said, adding that the barrage of extreme weather will likely lead to power outages and travel delays on roads and at airports.\n\nThe forecast comes days after an expansive storm similarly trekked across the U.S. last week, unloading snow in the northern Plains and bringing tornadoes and wildfires to the South. At least five storm-related deaths in Nebraska and Mississippi were tied to that storm.\n\nWestern US braces for deluge, snowstorms\n\nThe National Weather Service says the storm will arrive on the West Coast early Wednesday and bring heavy rain to coastal California.\n\nSouthern California is at risk of flash flooding and debris flow, the weather service said, especially in areas impacted by the outbreak of wildfires in January.

The weather service began issuing red flag warnings across the region on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to the threat of fast-spreading fires, the Southwest could again experience dust storms.

Still, it is expected to get close enough to land to bring damaging winds to Mexico's coast.\n\nThree to 6 inches of rain, with isolated areas of10 inches, were forecast across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima and Jalisco over the next few days, the hurricane center said. \"Life-threatening\" flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, were forecast.\n\nTropical Depression 2: Forms off southeastern Mexico, forecast to become tropical storm\n\nFlossie, Barry get names from separate lists\n\nThe National Hurricane Center names storms in both basins but pulls from separate lists. The Pacific hurricane season actually starts May 15, while the Atlantic season began June 1.\n\nBoth basins are seeing more named storms than would be expected this early in their seasons, DaSilva said. Barry, as the second named storm for the Atlantic, is more than two weeks early. On average, a second storm is named on July 16.\n\n\"Flossie will be sixth named storm in the Pacific, where the average 6th named storm is Aug. 3. So we are two months ahead,\" DaSilva said. \"This has been a very hot start to the season.\"\n\nSystem could threaten Florida on Fourth of July\n\nLater in the week, forecasters are watching for disturbances off the Southeast coast of the U.S. starting around the Fourth of July.\n\n\"The next thing to watch is what might happen July 4-7,\" DaSilva said.\n\nHe said a cold front is expected to stall in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Storms often form from stalled cold fronts, he said. DaSilva does not expect a hurricane, although the weather front could bring heavy rains to North Florida. But the threat remains several days out and it is possible it could result in only rip currents, he said.\n\nHow do hurricanes form?\n\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\n\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reaches 39 miles per hour.

One model is showing us (having) a possible 48-hour reprieve in about five or six days from now, followed by another system that comes in. This is definitely a unique pattern; it is definitely something we haven't seen in quite some time. It is too soon to say is it is record breaking, but I have been here for seven years and it is a unique pattern to have received this much rain in a constant period,\" Weber said.\n\nThe meteorologist compares the systems to a similar time period in 2019, where the area saw more than average rainfall. He said this year, we are seeing more rainfall more consistently than the influx we saw in 2019, resulting in the flooding we are seeing throughout the area.\n\nIn a rough estimate created by the NWS for the upcoming week, the Amarillo area is expected to see 1.5 to 3 inches of additional rainfall over the next seven days. In the area from Canadian down to Amarillo to Clarendon and over to Childress, total rainfall is estimated to reach upwards of 3 to 5 inches in the upcoming week.\n\n\"With constant raining every day and with very little breaks, the soil is not getting a chance to dry out so that it can absorb future rainfall amounts,\" Weber said. \"So, it is beginning to almost treat any rainfall that occurs not completely like concrete but not too far off of what it is like for rain to hit concrete, resulting in the waters running to flow into the drainage areas, which we are now beginning to see overflow as well.\"\n\nAs more rainfall occurs, Weber urges individuals to take caution while driving, especially at night where visibility is lowered and rainfall is forecasted to occur.\n\n\"With more rainfall happening especially at night, it is very easy to not know how deep the water is. ... So water that may look a couple of inches, especially in a lower car, you face more risk of entering a flooded area and putting yourself at risk or causing damage to your vehicle. So if you are unsure, turn around don't drown,\" he said.\n\nNWS has issued a flood watch now until June 6 at 7 p.m.; this watch is due to the rise of water levels in our area, including lakes, rivers, creeks, streams, low-lying and flood prone locations and poor drainage areas. The flood watch is currently in effect for portions of the panhandle of Oklahoma, including Cimarron and Texas counties, as well as portions of the Texas Panhandle including Armstrong, Carson, Dallam, Deaf Smith, Hansford, Hartley, Hutchinson, Moore, Oldham, Palo Duro Canyon, Potter, Randall and Sherman counties.\n\nAccording to media reports, the Amarillo Emergency Communications Center received more than a dozen water-stalled vehicle reports overnight Wednesday. And the American Red Cross told media that multiple homes were damaged after flooding in Hereford.\n\nAll trails were closed Thursday at Palo Duro Canyon Park, which said the hill driving down into the lower portion of the park was blocked on one side by a boulder. A portion of Park Road 5 was closed from the Lighthouse parking lot to Cactus Picnic Area. According to the Canyon Fire Department, the city had received 4.77 inches of rain since Wednesday evening, making many low water crossings in and around Canyon impassable and bar ditches overflow onto roadways. And the Randall County Sheriff's Office said the US Department of Fish and Wildlife was releiving some of the pressure on the Buffalo Lake dam by releasing some of the water down Tierra Blanca Creek, with the water being non-potable to the point of no contact.\n\nThe NWS also warns all individuals to stay away form the Canadian River area; with the fluctuating of water levels, there is a high risk for flooding. The NWS advises individuals to stay off the water as well and advises against any water activities including kayaking, tubing, swimming, and/or boating.\n\n\"All it takes is about 6 inches of rushing water to knock you off your feet and 12 to 18 inches to sweep your car away,\" Weber added, \"so stay on top of the forecast each day, understand the areas with poor drainage and avoid those areas. Understand that with the morning or late afternoon commutes to pay extra attention to the rainfall.\"\n\nRandall and Potter counties, city of Canyon declare local disasters\n\nRandall County Judge Christy Dyer signed a Declaration of Local Disaster related to severe weather and prolonged flooding on Thursday, June 1, the county said in a Thursday afternoon update.\n\n\"The continued rainfall across the panhandle has led to flooding along Tierra Blanca Creek as well as the area inside SW Loop 335 along 77th Avenue,\" a news release states. \"Numerous County roads are currently closed, and swift running water crossing roadways will cause more roads in Randall County to be closed as this event continues.\"\n\nThe release said Judge Dyer, in cooperation with each respective elected body, has ordered Lake Tanglewood, Timbercreek Canyon, The Palisades and River Falls closed to the public for any type of recreational activities under the authority of the declaration. In addition, Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuge has been temporarily closed to the public by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Palo Duro Canyon State Park is currently open, but the county said officials are closely monitoring the situation.\n\n“Protecting the safety of residents as they travel through areas of concern are a priority for Randall County,” said Judge Dyer.\n\n\"The Amarillo Office of Emergency Management is working with the Red Cross to establish shelter locations for citizens affected by the flooding,\" the release said. \"Plans are currently in the works to establish a shelter in Canyon and one in Amarillo.\"\n\nResidents are encouraged to stay home after dark, and officials urge all residents to turn around and not to drive through flooded areas, to prevent accidents and ensure public safety.\n\nIn addition, Canyon Mayor Gary Hinders signed a Declaration of Local Disaster related to severe weather and prolonged flooding on Thursday. The declaration of a local disaster related to severe weather and prolonged flooding cited \"widespread and severe property damage and dangerous conditions.\" Weather conditions pose the threat of continued flooding and carry the imminent potential of endangering lives and damaging property on a large scale. The declaration also mentioned violators could face a fine or jail time.\n\nAs with other areas in the Texas Panhandle, the city of Canyon has experienced continued rainfall leading to city road closures due to swift, running water at high water levels on the road.\n\n“The Canyon area has been impacted by floods in levels we have not seen in many years,” Hinders said in a news release. “The State of Emergency allows us to both protect our citizens and potentially provide assistance to them as we have upcoming weather events predicted by the National Weather Service.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Potter County Fire Rescue said Potter County issued its own Declaration of Local State of Disaster for the northern and northwestern parts of the county, signed by County Judge Nancy Tanner, in response to the ongoing flood emergency. \"Whereas, from May 18, 2023, at the latest, and continuing through the date of this Declaration, portions of northwestern and northern Potter County, Texas, specifically including, but not limited to, the Valle De Oro community and its surrounding area, have suffered, and continue to suffer, widespread and severe damage, loss of property, and the imminent threat of damage, injury, and loss of life and property resulting from flooding,\" the declaration says, it notes flooding has resulted in severe damage to residential property and public and private infrastructure, and has rendered a number of residences and properties inaccessible by roads or motor vehicles, including motor vehicles utilized by first responders.\n\nThe disaster declaration includes, but is not limited to, the Valle de Oro community, its surrounding area and all areas of the Canadian River basin up to the point at which the river flows into Lake Meredith and includes a mandatory evacuation.\n\nThe Potter County action activated emergency plans, \"including authorization for the furnishing of aid and assistance to the affected area and all people located in the affected area.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/04/storm-forecast-tornadoes-flooding-thunderstorm/82838697007/", "title": "Child killed in major flooding as storms soak central US", "text": "April 4, 2025 Updated April 6, 2025, 12:21 p.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary Millions are at risk from powerful storms bringing hail, damaging winds, flooding, and potential tornadoes.\n\nThe storms, fueled by an atmospheric river, have caused tornadoes, flooding, and destruction in multiple states.\n\nCatastrophic and potentially historic rainfall is expected, with some areas receiving up to 15 inches of rain.\n\nRounds of thunderstorms further inundated communities across the central U.S. on Friday as hard-hit areas were still reeling from an outbreak of severe weather and tornadoes that ravaged neighborhoods and killed at least eight people.\n\nMore than three million people from Texas to Illinois were at an enhanced risk of powerful storms threatening flooding rain and possible tornadoes, especially across western Arkansas into southeast Missouri, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe storms, fueled by a stationary atmospheric river, unleashed tornadoes Wednesday night and Thursday from Arkansas to Illinois, flattening homes, destroying businesses and overturning semi-trucks.\n\nAs the rain picked up, rural areas and major cities became submerged in floodwaters.

Areas at risk include parts of northeastern Texas, southeastern to northwestern Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois, western Kentucky and south-central Indiana.\n\nThe number of tornado watches across those same states fell in the NWS' last evening update. Nine counties in northeastern Texas are under watch, 35 counties in Arkansas, three counties in southeast Missouri, eight counties in southern Illinois, 22 counties in western Kentucky, and four counties southwestern Indiana.\n\nOhio River at Cincinnati forecast to crest Monday\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio, has issued flood warnings for areas along the banks of some of Greater Cincinnati's most prominent rivers.\n\nWith heavy rainfall continuing to oversaturate the region, all communities that sit along the Ohio River at Cincinnati have been placed under a flood warning. The river level is just above 45 feet as of Friday afternoon. It is expected to crest at 60 feet by Monday morning, putting it in the moderate-flooding stage.\n\nAdditionally, areas along the Great Miami and Little Miami rivers are now under flood warnings. The Great Miami River at Miamitown and the Little Miami River at Milford are both forecast to reach moderate flood stage by Sunday.\n\n–The Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nIndiana man who died in storm was loving father, wrestling fanatic\n\nNathan Merritt adored his 3-year-old son, Tatum.

The city of Shelbyville is about 30 minutes southeast of Indianapolis.\n\nLocal leaders are requiring residents in the affected areas to evacuate, and urging them to leave immediately.\n\n\"Those who refuse to leave may face law enforcement intervention to ensure their safety and to prevent risk to public health and safety,\" a news release reads.\n\n– Noe Padilla, Indianapolis Star\n\nKentucky child dead after being swept away in floodwaters\n\nPolice officials in Frankfort, Kentucky, said a 9-year-old boy died after reportedly being caught in floodwaters while walking to his school bus stop.\n\nThe Frankfort Police Department said Friday morning that emergency crews responded to an emergency call and found the boy, later identified as Gabriel Andrews, deceased.\n\n\"My heart breaks for this family,\" Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement on social media. \"We need everyone to understand that all water poses a risk right now.

Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Director Patrick Sheehan on Thursday confirmed five storm-related deaths, but the number could grow, he said. The deaths include one person each in Carroll, McNairy and Obion counties and two people in Fayette County.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Husted said West and Middle Tennessee could see some lull in activity on Friday afternoon and evening, but another set of severe storms is expected Saturday that could bring catastrophic flooding to an already saturated ground.\n\n“Saturday is the day that concerns me the most right now,” he said Thursday night. “Saturday is a dangerous day going into Saturday night for flash flooding.’\n\n–The Tennessean\n\nNWS releases data on Indiana twister\n\nThe National Weather Service in Indianapolis released its official tornado tracking report on most of the tornadoes that touched down in Indiana on Wednesday night.\n\nThe report confirmed that at least seven tornadoes touched down across the state. Notable information on a twister that tore through Carmel is not expected to be available until possibly Saturday morning. NWS tornado surveyors have not been able to finish assessing damage in the city needed for the report.\n\nAmong the tornados was an EF2 tornado formed and touched down outside Indianapolis that damaged over 20 homes, reached peak wind speeds of 120 mph, traveled 9.6 miles and left at least one person injured; an EF0 that hit near the Illinois border where it damaged a home and two buildings in traveling 10.8 miles; and an EF1 that reportedly damaged several Amish properties and destroyed \"well-built pole barns\" in reaching peak wind speeds of 105 mph.\n\n– Noe Padilla, Indianapolis Star\n\nFriday rainfall update: Heavy rain in Kentucky\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, the weather radar on Friday morning didn’t appear much different than it did 24 hours prior, as rain and thunderstorms persisted over the same areas from Oklahoma through Kentucky.\n\n\"Multiple flash flood warnings are in effect across Kentucky, the site of some of the heaviest rainfall so far, with 8 to 12 inches falling across a broad area over the past two days,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Brian Lada. \"This includes 9.96 inches in Bowling Green, well above the 6.27 inches that typically falls in the city throughout all of April, according to historical averages.\"\n\nAs inch after inch of rain pummels the Ohio River Valley, Kentucky creeks are spilling over their banks and feeding the commonwealth's major rivers, many of which are expected to hit major or moderate flood levels by this weekend, the Louisville Courier-Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nIn addition, much of the Ohio River downstream of Louisville, until its confluence with the Mississippi River west of Paducah, Kentucky, is forecast for moderate flooding in the coming days, though exact flood levels and timing could vary as rainfall continues.\n\nFriday's severe weather outlook focuses on Texas, Arkansas\n\nFriday has the makings of a very dangerous day for severe weather in the South, the Storm Prediction Center warned: \"Several strong to intense tornadoes are possible late this afternoon and evening.\"\n\nAs for location, \"clusters of severe thunderstorms may overspread a corridor from northeast Texas through western and northern Arkansas late this afternoon and evening,\" the center said. \"A couple of EF2-EF3+ tornadoes, hail to the size of baseballs, and isolated damaging wind gusts are possible.\"\n\nNo reported delays or disruption due to NOAA cuts\n\nThis wave of severe weather is one of the first since the Trump administration began to sharply cut the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration workforce, part of an initiative by the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, to slash the size of the federal payroll. The weather service is housed within NOAA.\n\nThe layoffs and a buyout program are expected to shrink NOAA's headcount by roughly 20% and could hamper some of its operations, scientists and researchers have said.\n\nDespite those concerns, there were no apparent delays or disruption in the weather service's forecasts for the areas affected by this week's storm system.\n\n–Reuters\n\nLandslide blocks highway in Kentucky\n\nIn northern Kentucky, a landslide blocked all lanes of the Mary Ingles Highway, officials said Friday.\n\nThe landslide was reported just before 3 a.m. Campbell County dispatchers did not give a timeline for when the highway will be cleared, but said it is expected to be closed “for a while.\"\n\nThe Mary Ingles Highway reopened less than a year ago after a 2019 landslide shut down a portion of it. The highway was closed until July 2024 for a $9.1 million maintenance and repair project to stabilize the area.\n\nAt least four inches of rain has fallen so far in northern Kentucky and that could double by Sunday, forecasters said.\n\n– Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nSchools close for another day\n\nThe severe weather on Friday impacted the schedule of hundreds of students across Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio.\n\nIn each of these states, school districts switched to remote learning, delayed the start of class or closed schools all together, citing dangerous travel conditions and power outages.\n\nIn many areas, this was the second or third day of class interruptions.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings, flood watches\n\nPower outages\n\nTens of thousands were without power Friday as storms continued to wallop the middle of the country.\n\nIn Michigan, where crews have struggled to restore power since the state was hit with disastrous storms last weekend, about 77,944 homes and businesses were without power Friday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOther states with climbing outage numbers include Indiana, 17,151; Pennsylvania, 15,861; Kentucky, 11,062; Arkansas, 10,940.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid\n\n(Image credit: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)\n\nIn the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\n2. Storm Christoph, UK\n\n(Image credit: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)\n\nThe period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n3. Cyclone Ana, Fiji\n\n(Image credit: Leon Lord/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\n4. Winter storms, Texas\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\n5. Dust storm, China\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nFlights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\n6. Flooding, New South Wales\n\n(Image credit: Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\n7. Cyclone Seroja\n\n(Image credit: Alfred Ike Wurin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\n8. Record temperatures, Moscow\n\n(Image credit: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\n9. Heat dome, Pacific Northwest\n\n(Image credit: Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSoaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.\n\nBlistering Pacific Northwest temperatures should act as a wake-up call\n\n10. Bootleg fire, Oregon\n\n(Image credit: Payton Bruni/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA “heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season” saw “one of the largest blazes in Oregon’s history” consume more than 364,000 acres of land, the BBC reported in July. More than 2,000 firefighters tackled the wildfire, which took more than a month to contain. The fire “generated its own weather system”, noted Oregon Live, and thousands of homes were threatened by the blaze, which saw residents temporarily housed in evacuation centres in the state.\n\n11. Flooding, west Germany\n\n(Image credit: Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFloods destroyed homes and bridges along the River Ahr in July, while in the German village of Schuld, water “engulfed streets and swallowed homes” CNN reported. Victims will be supported by a government-approved €400 million recovery package, as ministers have promised to move quickly on rebuilding affected areas, Euronews reported. A study by World Weather Attribution found that this event was between 1.2 and nine times more likely to happen in 2021 compared to pre-industrial periods.\n\n12. Flooding, China\n\n(Image credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 300 people died when China’s Henan province experienced severe rainfall and flooding in July. Twelve people lost their lives in a Zhengzhou metro train, with survivors describing how water leaked through the carriage’s doors until it became difficult to breathe. While the country typically experiences flooding in the summer months, this year’s occurrence was “exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, conversion of farmland and the worsening climate crisis, as well as overwhelmed flood mitigation systems,” The Guardian reported.\n\n13. Wildfires, Greece\n\n(Image credit: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHuge wildfires “ravaged” large regions of southern Europe in August, claiming lives in Greece, Turkey and Italy, The Guardian reported. The blaze came as a heatwave swept the region, and Greece’s second largest island - Evia - was evacuated. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised for the blazes, and said that more than 580 fires have broken out in the past seven days. More than 20 countries offered to send firefighting resources, and the “camaraderie” that’s developed between Greek and British firefighters “is testament to the scale of the job before them”, Sky News reports.\n\n14. Hurricane Ida, US\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMore than one million homes and businesses were left without power in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Ida made landfall on 29 August, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Ida hit with maximum sustained winds of 150mph. It was later downgraded to a tropical depression, and moved from a category four storm to category one. “Katrina followed a similar trajectory”, Sky News said. In the following days, Storm Ida moved up the northern-eastern coast of America. Subway stations and roads were flooded in New York, where the lives of at least nine people - including that of a two-year-old boy - were claimed by the storm. For communities in New Orleans, Ida has brought “painful reminders of the death and devastation” caused by the 2006 hurricane which killed more than 1,800 people, The New York Times reported.\n\n15. Monsoon floods, India and Nepal\n\n(Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeveral Nepalese regions and two Indian states were hit by “heavy late monsoon rains” in October, Reuters reported. “Deadly flash floods” took the lives of more than 180 people as “homes were submerged or crushed by rocks”, said the BBC. The Nepalese government committed to giving each of the victims’ families $1,700 (£1,220) in response.\n\nThe unseasonal rainfall was attributed to the climate crisis, but some experts indicated that hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and “excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes”, had contributed to the damage caused to the region’s “fragile ecology”, said the broadcaster.\n\n16. Tornadoes, Kentucky\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden said that Kentucky had experienced “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. More than 30 tornadoes “tore through” Kentucky and seven other states, claiming the lives of at least 90 people, and leaving thousands of residents homeless, said Sky News.\n\nThe state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said that this was “the most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history”.\n\nTwo brothers, aged 15 months and three months old, were placed in a bathtub before being carried away by the severe winds. Their grandmother, Clara Lutz, later learned that both boys had been found alive in her garden under the upturned bath.\n\nBiden’s infrastructure bill has allocated billions of dollars to climate resilience projects, in the hope of strengthening infrastructure and defence against future extreme weather events.\n\n17. Typhoons, Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross described “complete carnage” in coastal areas of the country after Super Typhoon Rai “sent some 400,000 people running for safety” on 16 December, said the BBC. Thousands of military and service personnel were working to assist with search and rescue efforts in the worst-hit areas.\n\nWinds of around 120mph ripped through the nation’s south-eastern islands, injuring at least 500 people. A further 375 people are known to have died. “There are some areas that look like it has been bombed worse than World War Two,” Red Cross chair Richard Gordon told the BBC.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/05/07/severe-weather-flash-flooding-forecast/83490017007/", "title": "Severe weather, flash flooding threaten Texas, Louisiana and more", "text": "Updated May 7, 2025, 8:48 a.m. ET\n\nAs the threat of severe thunderstorms and potential tornadoes lingers over parts of the Great Plains and Louisiana on May 7, forecasters warned that excessive rainfall could lead to additional flash flooding that has already turned deadly in Texas.\n\nMore than 8 million people were under flood watches issued by the National Weather Service across much of Louisiana and parts of Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi. Another pocket of flood watches covered parts of New York state, where rain on already saturated areas could lead to flooding from runoff and full rivers and streams.\n\nOn May 6, a 10-year-old girl in Texas was found dead after having been swept away in \"rapidly rising flood waters\" two days earlier in Brenham, the fire department said. Brenham is located about 90 miles east of Austin.\n\nMeanwhile, another round of strong to severe thunderstorms was a risk in south Texas, with the main threat coming from large hail. More storms are expected across the Tennessee and mid-Mississippi valleys and Central Plains regions.\n\nHouston weather forecast; storms to expand south\n\nStrong to severe storms are expected in the Houston and Galveston area of Texas on May 7, forecasters there said. Widespread showers and thunderstorms will last through early afternoon, with the greatest risk of severe weather south of Interstate 10. Large hail, strong wind and localized minor flooding are all risks.\n\nMore rounds of storms are expected on May 8 from western and southern Texas along the Gulf Coast, bringing heavy rainfall and some flash flooding. Louisiana is especially at risk for additional flash flooding and excessive rain.\n\nThe rainfall is also set to expand into the Southeast, with 4 to 8 inches across northern Florida, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas over the next several days.\n\n\"Weeks' worth of rain will fall in a matter of days across parts of the South over the next few days as a storm crawls east,\" AccuWeather said in an advisory.\n\nMeanwhile, more storms are headed to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on May 8, the weather service said. The region was hit by back-to-back thunderstorms in recent days and has more heavy rainfall to look forward to. The rain will be particularly focused on higher elevations of northeastern Pennsylvania, northwestern New Jersey and southern New York, the weather service said.\n\nFlooding turns deadly in Texas\n\nBrenham, Texas, in the east-central part of the state, was inundated by floodwaters amid heavy rainfall on already soaked ground earlier in the week of May 4. The Brenham Fire Department said 10-year-old Devah Woods, a third-grader at Brenham Elementary, was swept away at about 4:25 p.m. on May 4.\n\nBystanders tried to rescue the girl after she was caught in the quickly rising floodwaters. Crews spent two days searching for her amid ongoing severe weather using dogs, drones and thermal imaging technology. She was found dead at about 10 a.m. on May 6.\n\n\"This tragedy has deeply affected our community. We ask everyone to continue thinking and praying for Devah’s family during this unimaginable time. In the face of heartache, Brenham has shown what it means to come together – with strength, compassion, and unity,\" the Brenham Fire Department said.\n\nAt the end of April, back-to-back days of severe storms brought tornadoes, damaging winds and flooding rains to a large swath of the country, leaving at least five dead in Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.\n\nWhere is this weather coming from?\n\nThe National Weather Service said an \"omega block\" has been dominating the weather patterns in recent days, but will \"finally begin to evolve through mid-week.\" Unsettled weather isn't over with yet, however.\n\nAn omega block is so named because of its resemblance to the Greek letter omega (Ω). According to Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman, \"if you trace the path of the jet stream across the U.S. from the West to the East, you will trace out the Greek letter omega.\"\n\n\"This configuration blocks the typical west-to-east flow of the jet stream, much like a large rock in a small stream forces the flow of water around it,\" he said. \"That's why meteorologists call it a blocking pattern.\"\n\nIt's a type of weather pattern typical of April and May, preventing the typical west-to-east movement of most storm systems. The result is the locking in of chilly and unsettled conditions in some parts of the country while milder and dry conditions exist in between.

The National Weather Service said repeated additional rounds of heavy rain are likely to produce instances of flash flooding from the central Plains to the Midwest on Aug. 10.\n\nIn hard-hit Milwaukee, no flood-related deaths were reported within the city, but residents are facing major property damage, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said around noon on Aug. 10. Officials pleaded with residents to stay out of their cars and off the roads. Thousands of homes were also without power in the region, according to the local energy company.\n\nMilwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski said 65 water rescues were completed overnight. Dozens of people were rescued from in or on top of their cars, he said.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers ordered National Guard vehicles and operators to support Milwaukee County's response to severe floods, especially in areas facing flash flood warnings.

The Wisconsin State FFA Honors Band and Choir, featuring members ages 13 to 21, got a much bigger audience than anticipated at the Youth Exhibit Hall as hundreds sought shelter from the storm.\n\nMonte Dunnum, the band’s director, said the bolstered crowd got into the performance.\n\n\"I think we were able to raise their spirits in what became a torrential downpour for more than an hour and eventually led to the fair closing early,” Dunnum said. “FFA band members had a great time and I think the audience had at least a really nice diversion during a weather delay.

No, but here's when they ...", "text": "Updated July 30, 2025, 6:02 p.m. ET\n\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Wednesday between 4.25% and 4.5% – exactly as interest-rate traders' bets had predicted after the policy-making body's meeting in June.\n\nTraders now see the Fed’s Oct. 29 meeting as the most likely chance for an interest rate cut. That means short-term interest rates – which are heavily influenced by the Fed's decisions – could remain elevated for several more weeks.\n\nAhead of the Fed's announcement on Wednesday, two-thirds of interest-rate traders bet the Fed would cut its interest rate in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool. In the two hours after the decision, which included a Jerome Powell press conference, many rate-cut bets shifted to October.\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool tracks the likelihood that the Fed will change the federal funds rate based on futures prices.\n\nWill the Fed lower interest rates?\n\nThe Fed's policymaking committee hasn't reduced its short-term interest rate since the 0.25% cut at its December meeting.\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nDuring his comments following Wednesday's meeting, Fed chief Powell told reporters that neither he nor others on the policy making committee have predetermined plans for interest rates following their Sept. 17 meeting.\n\n“We have made no decisions about September. We don't do that in advance,\" Powell said, adding that the Fed will receive two rounds of employment and inflation data to inform its assessment ahead of its next meeting.\n\nWill interest rates drop in 2025?\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariff proposals have put the Fed in a difficult position: Inflation stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has moderated, but consumer prices may be on the rise again. Inflation ticked up slightly in May and June – when it rose to a 2.7% annual rate. Analysts suggest lower energy prices are helping to minimize the impact of tariffs.\n\nHow much tariffs will raise prices in the coming months remains uncertain, as many details remain unresolved. If the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates before it's clear how tariffs are affecting the prices we pay, it could unintentionally trigger inflation − by encouraging more borrowing to pay for goods made more expensive by those tariffs.\n\nThe Fed tries to hold inflation steady at about 2% each year while keeping as many Americans employed as possible. The June jobs report showed unemployment ticked down slightly to 4.1% and the economy added 147,000 jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistic will give us the next look at U.S. employment on Friday morning.\n\nCurrent unemployment rate\n\nThough other indicators also suggest the economy remains relatively strong, Powell cautioned after the May meeting that recent inflation and employment data could be indicators of early signs of concern. But he said the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and their impact on the economy has led them to keep interest rates unchanged.\n\n\"I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty about, for example, where tariff policies are going to settle out,\" Powell said. \"When they do settle out, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment? I think it’s too early to know that.\"\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/12/investing/stocks-week-ahead", "title": "Another big Fed rate hike is coming. But how many more after that ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by a half of a percentage point for the second consecutive time at the end of its next meeting on June 15. After that, all bets are off. Bigger rate hikes could be in the cards as consumer prices surge.\n\nMore rate hikes are likely in the coming months because Jerome Powell and the rest of the Fed can’t declare victory against rampant inflation anytime soon, especially since consumer prices rose 8.6% year-over-year through May.\n\nIn fact, the chances of a three-quarters of a percentage point hike on Wednesday, while still somewhat remote, shot up following the May CPI report.\n\n“The Fed needs to show resolve. It can’t afford to appear that it doesn’t have conviction about getting their arms around this stubborn and persistent inflation. The next two meetings have to be half-point hikes,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist of The Private Bank at Union Bank.\n\nBut Lowenstein acknowledged there is a growing debate as to whether the Fed should slow down the pace of rate hikes, or even pause for a meeting, later this year to assess the impact of higher rates on the broader economy. There is a lag between when higher rates are announced and when they actually slow consumer spending.\n\nTo be sure, a pause seems less likely after the hot inflation report for May. In fact, traders are now pricing in a more than 40% chance of a three-quarter-point hike at the Fed’s July meeting. Economists at Barclays wrote Friday that it “is a close call” as to whether the Fed hikes rates that much in June or July.\n\nStill, not everyone thinks the Fed has to be that aggressive. The Fed has begun a process called quantitative tightening, which could slow consumer demand by pushing long-term interest rates higher.\n\nHere’s how that works: As part of the Fed’s 2020 Covid stimulus efforts, the central bank bought massive amounts of bonds and mortgage-backed securities. This so-called quantitative easing has pushed the Fed’s balance sheet to an unwieldy size of nearly $9 trillion.\n\nNow, the Fed is unwinding some of these assets by letting bonds on its balance sheet mature and not reinvesting principal payments back into those bonds. This should, in theory, push long-term yields higher. That could be another reason why fears of multiple big rate hikes from the Fed could be overdone.\n\n“Quantitative tightening is definitely going to push long-term rates higher and I don’t think the market is factoring that in. Investors are probably expecting an overly hawkish Fed,” said Sandy Villere III, a portfolio manager with St. Denis J. Villere & Co. “The market overreacted and that is giving us opportunities to buy some things.”\n\nVillere said that bonds and some small-cap US companies are looking attractive. But he conceded that investors have to tread cautiously. There is no guarantee that the Fed can slow the economy without causing a recession.\n\n“We’ll see if the Fed can pull off this magic trick and have a soft landing instead of a crash landing. There is no doubt that the Fed waited too long to react to inflation,” Villere said.\n\nOthers worry that big rate hikes from the Fed aren’t going to help bring down inflation, especially since a big chunk of higher prices are due to surging energy costs. And unless the Fed can somehow broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, good luck seeing any relief at the pump anytime soon.\n\n“We had hoped that we had reached peak inflation,” said Jay Woods, chief market strategist at DriveWealth. “But the Fed doesn’t control the price of oil and gas. Consumer spending habits are going to change drastically.”\n\nTech canaries in the coal mine?\n\nTech stocks are having a brutal year. The Nasdaq is in a bear market as investors fret about the impact of higher rates on Silicon Valley’s profits.\n\nAre the fears justified? Investors will get a better sense after two giant software companies — Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) — report earnings this week.\n\nBoth companies have big exposure to Corporate America. Oracle is a leader in database and customer relationship management software while Adobe’s creative tools (PhotoShop, Acrobat and InDesign to name a few) are used by armies of business graphics designers.\n\nShares of Oracle and Adobe have, like the rest of tech, both tumbled this year. Oracle’s stock is down nearly 25% while Adobe has plunged more than 30%.\n\nInvestors will be paying close attention to see what each company has to say about the outlook for corporate tech spending for the next few months and beyond. They could give Wall Street more clues about how other cloud software giants, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), SAP (SAP) and Amazon (AMZN), are doing.\n\nAnother cloud leader, Dow component Salesforce (CRM), recently reported strong earnings. But the company trimmed its outlook and also said it plans to be more “measured” about hiring in the future.\n\nUp next\n\nMonday: Earnings from Oracle\n\nTuesday: US producer prices\n\nWednesday: US retail sales; Federal Reserve policy announcement\n\nThursday: US housing starts and building permits; US weekly jobless claims; earnings from Kroger (KR), Jabil (JBL) and Adobe\n\nFriday: US industrial production", "authors": ["Paul R.

Those declines including a pair days where the market dropped a combined 13.9%.\n\nFollowing market's rapid tumble, it quickly rebounded as Trump and Congress quickly approved a first-round of stimulus payments for Americans, and the Federal Reserve's measures also boosted the outlook for the economy.\n\nHow the stock market has changed since Election Day\n\nThe downturn since mid-February is in stark contrast to the 4.5% run-up in the S&P 500 following Trump's election when traders predicted his administration would usher in more business-friendly policies. Since Trump first began laying out plans for tariffs for Canada and Mexico, the S&P 500 has fallen 17.4% from a high of 6144 on Feb. 19.\n\nA wide variety of factors related the tariffs may be leading traders to bid down stocks, but Oxford Economics, a global economic forecasting company, pointed to the overall drag tariffs would place on the economy and, ultimately, corporate profits.\n\nOxford Economics estimated Friday that the United States' combined tariff rate will be 24%, higher than it was in the 1930s. The company predicted – even before China's announcement – the higher taxes on imported goods will push inflation up to 4.5% while slowing economic growth to 1.3% from the 2% it predicted last month.\n\n\"Wealthy consumers’ stock market gains kept the economy growing in 2024 despite high prices,\" Adams of Comerica Bank wrote. \"But the wealthy won’t feel confident enough to keep spending if this keeps up.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/29/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates-live-updates/78003837007/", "title": "Fed keeps interest rates unchanged amid inflation, pressure from ...", "text": "Updated Jan. 29, 2025, 6:24 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve paused its interest rate cutting campaign Wednesday and gave no signal it plans to lower rates again in the near term amid uncertainty spawned by inflation and President Donald Trump’s economic policies.\n\nThe decision to hold rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% could mark the beginning of an extended respite as the Fed assesses the course of inflation and awaits details on Trump’s trade and immigration plans. Alternatively, it could be a brief hiatus if inflation swiftly resumes a pullback and officials believe the President’s policies will modestly nudge up consumer prices.\n\n“In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the (Fed) will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” the Fed said in a statement following a two-day meeting.\n\nThat mirrors the guidance Fed officials provided in December and signals “some patience” as they weigh further reductions in the key rate while navigating myriad economic and policy crosscurrents, according to Barclays.\n\nInflation broadly has eased since a pandemic-related surge but stayed elevated in recent months. The economy and job market have been remarkably resilient, though hiring has slowed substantially. And it’s unclear to what extent Trump will slap certain imports with tariffs and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status, and what the effects will be on the economy and inflation.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed removed its assertion in December that inflation “has made progress” toward the Fed’s 2% goal, simply noting that “inflation remains somewhat elevated.”\n\nIt also gave a nod to a job market that has picked up steam lately - with unemployment edging down to a historically low 4.1% - and doesn’t seem to need a boost from Fed rate cuts.\n\n“The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid,” the Fed said. That’s an upgrade from the previous statement that noted “labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.”\n\nNoting that inflation is still above the Fed's 2% goal while the economy and job market are strong, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday, We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust\" interest rates.\n\nTrump accuses Fed, Powell of failing to stop inflation\n\nAfter Wednesday’s Fed meeting, President Trump accused the Fed and Powell of creating and failing to stop pandemic-era inflation, which has fallen but has yet to return to the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nTrump, who appointed Powell as Fed chair in 2018, said he would lower inflation himself through various initiatives including energy production, American manufacturing and \"slashing regulation.\"\n\n“The Fed has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary Regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses.”\n\nThe president’s message also accused the Fed of being too focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and climate change.\n\nFed keeping an eye on Trump economic policy plans\n\nPowell said the Fed would be carefully watching the Trump administration’s new stance on tariffs, immigration, fiscal policy and regulatory policy but would not rush its response.\n\n\"The (Fed) is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted,\" he said, adding there are many details about any tariffs that are unclear, including how they could affect consumer prices.\n\n“It's one thing to do that, to make assessments about what might happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don't act until you see much more than we see now,” he added.\n\nStock market reaction\n\nU.S. stocks fell after the Fed kept rates steady, as expected, but seemed to shift its view on inflation.\n\nBut while the Fed dropped its reference to inflation making “progress, Powell downplayed the change as a technical one and said recent inflation readings generally have been positive.\n\n“The market is already jumping on the omission of inflation progress from the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) statement as a hawkish signal,” or wanting to fight inflation, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. Doves are less concerned with inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended the day down 0.5% at 6,039.31; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.31% to 44,713.52 and Nasdaq fell 0.5% to 19,632.32.\n\nPowell addresses Trump’s plan to 'demand' interest rate drop\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s comment last week that he would “demand interest rates drop immediately,” assuming oil prices soon fall, presumably lowering inflation, Powell declined to comment.\n\n“The public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we have, focusing on using our tools to achieve our goals, and really keeping our heads down and doing our work,” Powell said, adding that he hasn't been in contact with Trump.\n\nPowell later reiterated that the Fed would continue to operate independently.\n\n\"That's always what we're going to do. And people should have confidence in that,\" he said.\n\nThe Fed’s decision comes nearly a week after he told the World Economic Forum he’ll “demand that interest rates drop immediately” after OPEC takes steps to lower oil prices. Such a move presumably would help push down inflation.\n\nTrump's remark set up a clash with Powell and the central bank, which is structured as an independent agency insulated from political influence so it can make decisions based on the best interests of the economy. Trump repeatedly badgered Powell to cut rates during his first term, though it didn’t appear to affect Fed moves.\n\nWhat causes the Fed to change interest rates?\n\nThe Fed raises interest rates or keeps them higher for longer to lower inflation by discouraging borrowing and economic activity. It cuts rates to juice a flagging economy or bring rates back to normal as inflation moderates.\n\nWhat is the current Fed interest rate?\n\nWednesday’s decision to hold the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate steady comes after officials reduced it by a total percentage point at three straight meetings late last year. That has lowered borrowing costs for credit cards, some mortgages and auto and other loans, and sparked a stock market rally. It also has pushed down bank savings yields that were finally generating healthy returns.\n\nIs inflation really going down?\n\nAfter raising the federal funds rate to a 23-year high to curb a pandemic-related price surge in 2022 and 2023, the Fed slashed it as its preferred annual inflation measure fell from 5.6% in early 2022 to 2.8% in November – still above its 2% goal.\n\nBut inflation has been stuck at that mark in recent months and economists predict a report Friday will reveal a similar figure. That has led Fed officials to predict fewer rate cuts and a pause at this week’s meeting even apart from Trump’s policies.\n\nMonthly cost increases, however, have been tamer and that should translate to milder annual price rises the first half of 2025 due to favorable comparisons with year-ago figures, Goldman Sachs said in a research note. That could give the Fed some leeway to cut rates again within months.\n\nWhat's the state of the job market?\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market heated up in December, with employers adding 256,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dipping. Hiring, however, has slipped below pre-pandemic levels and net job growth is robust chiefly because of low layoffs, possibly foreshadowing a slowdown.\n\nThe government this week is expected to report the economy grew close to a sturdy 3% annual rate in the fourth quarter and for all of 2024.\n\nHow many rate cuts are expected in 2025?\n\nEconomist Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics said the Fed could still agree to as many as three quarter point rate cuts this year, starting as soon as March, if inflation resumes its descent and the job market slows.\n\nFed Governor Chris Waller recently told CNBC he wouldn’t rule out a March rate cut. “As long as data comes in good on inflation, then I can certainly see cuts coming sooner than markets are pricing,” he said. He has said he doesn’t think tariffs will have a big impact on inflation.\n\nBoth Fed officials’ median estimate and futures markets forecast two rate cuts this year. Markets reckon the first will come in June.\n\nYet some Fed officials have said the recent high inflation readings suggest they should be cautious, especially in light of a solid economy that doesn’t appear to need the Fed’s help. Toss in tariffs that are likely to be passed along to consumers through higher prices and an immigration crackdown that shrinks the labor supply and could raise wages. Both policies could reignite inflation by the second half of the year, Barclays says.\n\nDeutsche Bank estimates 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would raise inflation nearly a percentage point to 3.7% by the end of the year. Additional duties on China could lift inflation further.\n\nAs a result, Barclays predicts just one rate cut this year in June while Deutsche Bank doesn’t foresee any. Even a pivot to rate hikes is possible, Barclays says, if Trump’s planned tax cuts rev up the economy while tariffs and deportations boost inflation expectations that drive inflation itself higher.\n\nOthers project small price bump from tariffs, saying say a drop in imports would strengthen the dollar, lowering import prices for Americans and at least partly offsetting the duties.\n\nUnder a worst-case scenario, tariffs and deportations could both goose inflation and reduce consumer spending and economic growth. That would present a thorny dilemma for the Fed - keep rates high to beat back inflation or lower them to jolt the economy.\n\nHow will Trump’s economic plans affect interest rates?\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s plans to cut taxes, impose hefty tariffs on imports and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status have generated an unusual level of uncertainty about the course of the economy, inflation and interest rates.\n\nUSA TODAY previously looked at various scenarios that could result from Trump's economic policies.\n\nIn one predicted scenario, his policies could modestly stoke inflation while the economy slows but posts solid growth. That could move the Fed to order two, or possibly three, rate cuts this year.\n\nOr, Trump’s initiatives could more emphatically reignite inflation while the economy grows sturdily or even heats up. That would probably mean fewer rate cuts from the Fed in 2025 -- perhaps none. It might even put rate hikes back in play, forecasters say.\n\nAnother possibility: Trump’s blueprint could drive inflation higher while also weakening the economy, an unusual tandem that would pose a vexing dilemma for the Fed: Cut? Hike? Stand pat?\n\nFed 'reviewing' Trump’s anti-DEI orders\n\nPowell at a 2021 conference said he believes the most successful organizations \"are often the ones that have a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion.”\n\nWednesday, Powell said he still believes that to be true, but the Fed is reviewing Trump’s executive order to end diversity and inclusion efforts in the federal government.\n\n“We are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,” he said.\n\nPowell addresses Fed staffing levels\n\nTesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk last month accused the Fed of being “absurdly overstaffed.”\n\nWhen asked for his thoughts, Powell said the Fed runs a “very careful budget process.”\n\n“We owe that to the public, and we believe we do that,” he said.\n\nWhy would the Fed stop cutting interest rates?\n\nThe Fed chose to reduce its benchmark interest rate three times at consecutive meetings in late 2024.\n\nWhy stop now?\n\nIf the Fed pauses in its downward path on interest rates, the regulatory pause will have lot to do with inflation. Consumer prices have continued to rise in recent months, albeit at a slower pace than in most of 2022 or 2023. The Fed’s perfect-world inflation target is an annual rate of 2%. The current inflation rate, as of December, is 2.9%. The figure represents a five-month high.\n\nEven as the Fed ordered the last of its 2024 rate cuts, at its December meeting, the panel forecast a significantly slower pace of cuts in 2025, citing lingering inflation and strong economic growth.\n\nIn that meeting, the Fed projected only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four they had envisioned in September.\n\nWill interest rates ever go down?\n\nThe Fed didn't budge on interest rates, which means American consumers may have to wait a while to see borrowing costs go down on, well, pretty much everything.\n\n“Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. “That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else. That means it is maybe more important than ever to get that high-interest debt under control.”\n\nThe average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.26%, LendingTree reports. That would be a prime example of high-interest debt.\n\nThe average interest rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage is 6.65%, according to Zillow. Bankrate puts the national average at 7.05%. Either way, mortgage rates are much higher now than three or four years ago, when they sat near historic lows.\n\nWhy does the Fed raise or lower interest rates?\n\n\"Part of the mission Congress has given to the Federal Reserve is to keep prices stable. This means not letting prices rise or fall too quickly,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland says on its website.\n\nWhen inflation is running high, the Fed typically raises interest rates to slow the economy and bring inflation down. When inflation is too low, the Fed might lower interest rates to stimulate the economy and raise the inflation rate.\n\nThe central bank also lowers rates to stimulate a soft economy and job market, or just to give the economy some breathing room. That, economists say, is what the Fed has been doing over the past year.\n\nWhy did the Fed cut interest rates in 2024?\n\nThe Fed hiked interest rates to a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% to fight a historic inflation surge. After holding rates at that level through parts of 2023 and 2024, the Fed began lowering its benchmark rate in September, signaling that inflation was coming under control. The annual inflation rate has eased from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to 2.9% in December: much lower, but still above the Fed’s 2% inflationary goal.\n\nA series of rate cuts brought the benchmark federal funds rate down a full percentage point between September and December 2024, to the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2025/12/10/federal-reserve-interest-rates-mortgages-credit-cards-car-loans/87667466007/", "title": "Fed cuts rates: What's next for mortgages, credit cards, car loans", "text": "Dec. 10, 2025, 2:37 p.m. ET\n\nForecasts vary for how many more times the Fed could cut interest rates in 2026. Some say one, two or even three more rate cuts ahead.\n\nMortgage rates already have fallen as markets anticipated a Fed rate cut in December.\n\nCantankerous and increasingly cautious consumers — perhaps put on edge by seemingly shrinking paychecks, a weaker job market and stubbornly high prices — gave the Federal Reserve more room to cut interest rates for a third time in 2025.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 10, the nation's central bank cut short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point. The Fed's December rate cut drove the short-term federal funds rate to a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%.\n\nThe Fed noted in its statement that \"job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up through September. More recent indicators are consistent with these developments.\"\n\nThe decision was not unanimous. \"Voting against this action were Stephen I. Miran, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting; and Austan D. Goolsbee and Jeffrey R. Schmid, who preferred no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting,\" according to the Fed's statement.\n\nFor consumers, the Fed's latest rate cut means lower rates on credit cards and home equity lines of credit.\n\nThe average rate for a home equity line of credit now is 7.81% — that's down from an average of 8.55% a year ago, according to Bankrate.com data. HELOCs tend to follow the Fed, especially for existing borrowers, so another slow drift downward is likely.\n\nWill mortgage rates fall even more?\n\nIf you're wondering when mortgage rates will go down, the news isn't all that promising.\n\nMortgage rates are down from a year ago but experts aren't expecting rates to fall significantly in 2026.\n\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage hit an average of 6.19% as of Dec. 4, according to data from Freddie Mac's primary mortgage market survey. The lowest average in 2025 was 6.17% for the week of Oct. 30.\n\nMortgage rates are a half of a percent lower than a year ago when the 30-year fixed rate mortgage averaged 6.69%.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed rate mortgage soared in the 7% range through much of January and even had been as high as 6.89% in late May, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nGoing forward, the trend for mortgage rates will depend on activity in the 10-year U.S. Treasury market, which serves as the benchmark for mortgages and other long-term rates.\n\n\"Mortgage rates are the most interesting —and difficult — to predict,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for Bankrate.com.\n\nMortgage rates are influenced much more by how the 10-year Treasury is trading and investor expectations, Rossman said.\n\n\"My best guess is that mortgage rates will decline slightly, on balance, over the next year,\" Rossman said.\n\n\"But it could be a bumpy ride. If worries intensify about job losses and a possible recession, rates would fall further — but it wouldn't be a great time to buy a house,\" Rossman said.\n\nHe predicted that 2026 could be a volatile year for mortgage rates.\n\nInflation fears — and a possible loss of Fed independence — could promote spikes in mortgage rates at some points in 2026, Rossman said. On the other hand, bad news on the jobs front or a greater likelihood of a recession would trigger periodic dips in mortgage rates.\n\nAccording to one forecast by Realtor.com, mortgage rates are forecast to average 6.3% in 2026, easing affordability pressures slightly, while home prices rise by 2.2%.\n\nWill tariffs, higher prices ahead hold back Fed?\n\nWhat the Fed does next in 2026 isn't clear-cut.\n\nEconomic cloud cover remains when it comes to the most recent jobs and inflation data, which continues to be lacking following the 43-day federal government shutdown that ended Nov. 12.\n\nWe're also still working out the kinks of on-again-off-again trade policies that involve sudden spikes in tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, often followed by delayed start dates and negotiations to lower levels for the new tariffs.\n\nWill we see higher prices in some areas as more businesses pass along the higher costs of tariffs in 2026? Will we see more job cuts, as companies move to cut other costs, which will make consumers more reluctant to spend?\n\nFor much of 2025, experts say, many businesses cushioned the blow by not passing along price hikes due to significantly higher tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Some experts say consumers should brace for more sticker shock ahead — and higher inflation, which could limit the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates too much further in 2026.\n\nThe tariff story is far from over.\n\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, for example, is up for joint review by July. Imports from Mexico and Canada have been subject to U.S. tariffs this year, but analysts at Brookings note that \"most trade across the three countries continues to face zero tariffs, underscoring the ongoing importance of the agreement.\"\n\nHow many rate cuts will the Fed really need to initiate next year?\n\nHonestly, we're dealing with another unknown at this point — and hearing a range of best guesses here from economists for how often the Fed could cut rates in 2026.\n\nCarl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust, told the Detroit Free Press that he expects only one more rate cut — another quarter point cut — in the first half of 2026.\n\n\"We're close to the end,\" Tannenbaum said.\n\nHigher prices could still be ahead in 2026\n\nInflation still is higher than the Fed's target inflation rate of 2% and Tannenbaum maintains that prices for some goods could go higher in 2026 once the full impact of higher tariffs is felt next year.\n\nThis year, many companies stockpiled a great deal of inventory, particularly from China, anticipating a trade war. Now, those inventories are depleting and new orders will be made that reflect higher tariffs on many goods imported into the United States.\n\nMany companies chose to absorb some of the higher costs of tariffs, cutting into profit margins, in 2025. But, Tannenbaum said, companies may be more likely to raise prices in 2026 on some goods.\n\nWhile the job market has been tough to read, Tannenbaum said he does not see the unemployment rate spiking in 2026. He puts the odds of a U.S. recession at around 20%, which is relatively low.\n\nIf the unemployment rate remains relatively low and the stock market doesn't face a serious setback, Tannenbaum said, the economy will have room to grow.\n\nDoes a weaker jobs outlook drive the Fed to cut further?\n\nCould we, maybe, see two rate cuts next year?\n\nUniversity of Michigan economist Gabriel Ehrlich said the U-M economics team is projecting two rate cuts in 2026. The economists project two cuts of 25 basis points each, tentatively penciled in for Fed meetings in March and June next year.\n\nThat would follow three moves by the Fed policy committee to cut short term interest rates in 2024 and another three rate cuts at the last three Fed meetings in 2025.\n\nEhrlich, director of the Ann Arbor university's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics, noted that the labor market data available since the last meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee on Oct. 29 and Oct. 29 indicated a continued trend of gradual softening in the labor market.\n\nHe noted that consumption growth — the increase in spending by individual consumers and households on goods and services — was weak in September, the last month of available date.\n\n\"The partial data that we have so far for the current quarter are mixed,\" Ehrlich said.\n\n\"Vehicle sales retreated in October and edged up in November. Johnson Redbook same store sales appear to be holding up. Consumer sentiment remains downbeat, though,\" he said.\n\nWould the Fed cut rates three times in 2026?\n\nOthers remain more pessimistic about the jobs outlook and see more room for the Fed to cut rates even further in 2026.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, said he expects the Fed to cut short-term interest rates three more times in the first six months of 2026. Each cut is likely to be a quarter point.\n\nJob growth, Zandi said, has come to a standstill and the unemployment rate, while still low, is steadily rising.\n\nAnd the Fed itself is on edge, facing ongoing threats by the Trump administration to its power to act independently when making decisions about interest rates and other monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed, Zandi said, \"desperately wants to avoid a recession, as it would be blamed for it, which would significantly threaten its independence.\"\n\nLet's not forget that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term as Fed chair ends in May.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been pushing for the Fed to cut rates further and will nominate someone who agrees with him.\n\n\"But will the rest of the committee agree?\" Bankrate.com's Rossman said.\n\nWhat's ahead for borrowers and K-shaped economy\n\nIf the Fed does drive short-term rates substantially lower in 2026, consumers could see much bigger declines in interest rates charged for credit card debt, home equity lines of credit and more.\n\nThe Fed's December rate cut would lead to a rate cut of a quarter point for existing cardholders within a month or two, Rossman said.\n\nRossman noted that the Fed cut rates by a quarter point in September and October, so most cardholders have already seen a 50-basis point decline in their credit card rates.\n\nThe national average credit card rate being offered to new customers, though, probably won't move much since that refers to new offers don't necessarily need to change, Rossman said.\n\nJust before the Fed cut rates in September, the first rate cut in 2025, the average rate for credit cards being offered to new customers was 20.12%. The national average being offered now to new cardholders is 19.83%, down 29 basis points, according to Bankrate.com\n\nRossman warned that long-term rates, such as mortgages, even could move higher if a string of rate cuts in 2026 stokes inflation and leads to questions about Fed independence.\n\nWe're hearing many economists talk even more about a K-shaped economy — where some some groups saw their wealth shoot up and others saw their financial outlook slide down.\n\nBetter-off households saw an upward swing in that K as their portfolios climbed after stock prices soared on Wall Street, their home values rose, and their wages went up.\n\nThe downward slope in that K represents households that lost ground, many who do not own homes or have much money invested in stocks or 401(k) plans. Some consumers in this group lost jobs, saw their rents climb, and struggled further to make ends meet as prices remained high for groceries and other goods.\n\nMiddle and lower-income households, who don’t have significant stock portfolios face making payments on their debt, are struggling to maintain their spending, Zandi said.\n\nReal consumer spending so far in 2025 has increased by only 1.3% annualized.\n\nBy contrast, Zandi noted, real consumer spending increased by 2.95% in 2024. \"Typical spending growth would be closer to 2%,\" he explained. \"1.3% is weak growth.\"\n\nRight now, many consumers continue to spend on many items, but Zandi adds they are doing so with \"limited enthusiasm.\"\n\nThat could be one reason why consumers are seeing so many promotional prices and discounts early in the holiday season from a long list of retailers, including some offering higher-end brands to those built on everyday low prices and weekly sales.\n\n\"The well-to-do are doing the bulk of the spending, fueled by the surge in the value of their AI stock holdings,\" Zandi said.\n\nThe runup in housing values and stock prices largely benefited already well-off consumers, Zandi said, because ownership of those assets is highly concentrated among upper middle class and wealthy consumers.\n\nU-M's Ehrlich said the AI boom has contributed to the rise in stock prices, while wage growth is slowing and limiting financial gains for people who depend on a paycheck.\n\nIf lower interest rates help re-energize the labor market or the residential construction sector, he said, households that are more dependent on wage income would see financial benefits.\n\nFrom a consumer standpoint, continued declines in interest rates could help some consumers refinance their higher rate car loans and mortgages. Others could find it more affordable, Ehrlich said, to buy a home or car if interest rates are lower.\n\n\"From an employment standpoint, Michigan workers would also benefit from stronger vehicle sales in that scenario,\" Ehrlich said.\n\nNo doubt, the Fed's December rate cut soon will help many on the margin.\n\n\"The Fed’s rate cuts should result in lower credit card and home equity loan rates, as well as lower borrowing costs for small businesses that borrow from banks at the prime rate, which is tied to the federal funds rate,\" Zandi said.\n\nUnfortunately, auto loan and mortgage rates are not as directly tied to the moves that the Fed makes.\n\nRossman said many new car buyers are seeing offers where the average 60-month new car loan rate is 7.05% — down from 7.59% a year ago. It's possible, he said, that average new car loan rates being promoted by lenders could fall slightly below 7% in 2026.\n\nBankrate's data is based on a survey of banks in large markets around the country, based on what is being offered directly to consumers with a 700 credit score. The data doesn't include dealer or manufacturer financing. Car buyers also pay higher interest rates on auto loans if they have lower credit scores.\n\nBut Zandi said the Fed’s rate cuts should help lower borrowing costs in general.\n\n\"Michigan’s economy will benefit most directly from more auto sales and production, but this is a small lift, as the Fed is widely expected to cut rates, so this is already reflected in borrowing costs and stock and other asset values,\" Zandi said.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and potentially different horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.”\n\nPut simply, the Fed raises interest rates or keeps them high to fight inflation and cool the economy. It lowers rates to jolt a weakening economy or dig it out of recession.\n\nBut Trump’s tariffs present unusual double-barreled worries: They’re expected to push up prices sharply and thus sap consumer spending that makes up 70% of economic activity. They’re also intensifying business uncertainty that could stifle investment and spur layoffs.\n\n\"Unemployment is likely to go up as the economy slows, in all likelihood, and inflation is likely to go up as tariffs find their way and some part of those tariffs come to be paid by the public,\" Powell said. \"So that's the strong likelihood.\"\n\nPowell is suggesting the Fed will decide when – and how much – to lower rates by assessing whether high inflation or a sagging economy poses the greatest risk.\n\n“For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” Powell said.\n\nMany economists expect the import duties to boost the Fed’s preferred inflation measure from 2.7% to as high as 4% to 5% later this year. But if the fees spark negotiations between the U.S. and other countries, they could nudge up inflation to just about 3%.\n\nIn a speech earlier this week, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he believes there’s still a good chance officials can cut the central bank’s key interest rate later this year.\n\nUnder one scenario, in which very high tariffs remain in effect, he said he believes the boost to inflation could be large but temporary. Meanwhile, the negative effects on the economy could be significant, prompting the Fed to lower rates sooner and more sharply.\n\nAlternatively, he said, the import fees could be significantly reduced through negotiations with other countries. In that case, the Fed could wait and see how much of the cost is passed to consumers and perhaps trim rates more modestly later in the year.\n\nAfter lifting its key rate to a 23-year high in 2022 and 2023 to fight a pandemic-related inflation spike, the Fed lowered the rate substantially late last year. But stubbornly high inflation and concerns that Trump’s tariffs will reignite inflation have kept officials on hold.\n\nIn February and March, Trump slapped a 20% fee on Chinese shipments to the U.S.; 25% on imported steel and aluminum; 25% on all imported cars and light trucks; and 25% on some goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nThis month, he ratcheted up the stakes with a minimum 10% fee on all imports and double-digit charges on dozens of countries before announcing a 90-day pause on the higher duties for nations other than China. Yet a hike of China’s tariff to 145% more than offset the concessions for other countries.\n\nThe President sowed further confusion last week by initially exempting smartphones, computers and other electronics from the higher tariffs before Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said they would be included in a coming duty for computer chips.\n\nBottom line: Many economists figure the average U.S. tariff on imports has soared from about 3% early this year to about 25%.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information and to correct a typo.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/06/17/fed-interest-rates-predictions/84244079007/", "title": "Fed holds interest rates steady. Here's when they might lower them.", "text": "June 17, 2025 Updated June 18, 2025, 3:00 p.m. ET\n\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Wednesday between 4.25% and 4.5% – exactly as interest-rate traders' bets had predicted after the policy-making body's meeting in early May.\n\nThe traders' bets now predict there's little chance the Fed will lower interest rates until its meeting on Sept. 17. That means Americans won't see short-term interest rates – which are heavily influenced by the Fed's decisions – decline for at least another three months.\n\nFollowing the Fed's Wednesday announcement, there was still just a 58% chance the Fed will cut its interest rate in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The FedWatch tool tracks the likelihood that the Fed will change the federal funds rate based on futures prices.\n\nThe Fed's economic projection also released Wednesday showed that the majority of the policy-making committee expect they will still make two rate cuts this year.\n\nWhen interest rates could fall in coming months\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nWill interest rates drop in 2025?\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariff proposals have put the Fed in a difficult position: Inflation stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has moderated, but consumer prices may be on the rise. Inflation ticked up slightly in May from a year earlier to 2.4%. Analysts suggested lower energy prices last month helped to minimize the impact of tariffs.\n\nHow much tariffs will raise prices in the coming months remains uncertain, as most remain unresolved. If the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates before it's clear how tariffs are affecting the prices we pay, it could unintentionally trigger inflation − by encouraging more borrowing to pay for goods made more expensive by those tariffs.\n\nThe Fed tries to hold inflation steady at about 2% each year while keeping as many Americans employed as possible. The May jobs report released June 6 showed unemployment remained steady at 4.2% and the economy added a 139,000 jobs.\n\nThough other indicators also suggest the economy remains relatively strong, Powell cautioned after the May meeting that recent inflation and employment data could be indicators of early signs of concern. But he said the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and their impact on the economy has led them to keep interest rates unchanged.\n\n\"I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty about, for example, where tariff policies are going to settle out,\" Powell said. \"When they do settle out, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment? I think it’s too early to know that.\"\n\nWhere interest rates stand on credit cards and car loans\n\nThe Fed's three interest rate cuts in 2024 quickly translated into lower payments for short-term loans made on credit cards and for cars:\n\nIncreases and decreases in credit card interest rates are closely linked to the prime rate, which is generally 3 percentage points higher than the fed funds rate. Auto loans also follow a similar pattern. All three remain well above where they were in early 2022 when Powell signaled the Fed planned to start raising interest rates to curb inflation.\n\nHigher mortgage interest rates add to housing troubles\n\nMortgage rates are primarily influenced by long-term interest rates, which in turn are shaped by expectations about inflation and the overall direction of the economy. Since the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in late September, mortgage rates have risen in tandem with short-term rates by several percentage points.\n\nMore importantly for homebuyers, mortgage rates are still more than double what they were in 2021. In December 2021, with rates at 3.1%, a buyer purchasing a $425,000 home with a 20% down payment would have paid $1,453 a month in principal and interest. At last week’s rate of 6.8%, that same mortgage would cost $763 more each month.\n\nContributing: Rachel Barber", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/12/08/federal-reserve-december-interest-rate/87551858007/", "title": "Fed rate cut, division expected at December meeting", "text": "Dec. 8, 2025, 5:06 a.m. ET\n\nA contentious year for the United States' central bank is expected by analysts to end with more dissents and uncertainty – two themes that have emerged in recent Federal Reserve meetings.\n\nFed watchers mostly expect a third consecutive rate cut when the Federal Open Market Committee concludes its final meeting of 2025 on Dec. 10. Still, for those looking to the Fed for relief from high prices, a December rate cut isn't guaranteed – Chair Jerome Powell said as much at the end of the last Fed meeting.\n\nAnalysts expect multiple dissents alongside another quarter percentage point rate cut.\n\n“Generally speaking, the Board of Governors has a dovish skew, while the regional Fed presidents Fed presidents—who do not all vote—lean more hawkish,” Wells Fargo economists said in a Dec. 4 note. “While we expect opposition in both directions of the policy decision again, more dissents are likely to be in favor of keeping the policy rate unchanged.”\n\nWhy are Fed officials divided?\n\nSeveral Fed officials have cautioned that potential tariff-driven inflation pressures shouldn't be dismissed, according to James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\n\n“The economy is still growing, equity markets are at all-time highs and unemployment remains very low so to them, there doesn’t appear to be a pressing need to cut rates again,” Knightley said to USA TODAY. “However, the more dovish members of the Fed argue that the second part of their mandate, maximizing employment, is looking more challenged.”\n\nPrivate-sector lay-off data, a downbeat assessment on the economy from the Fed’s own Beige Book, and New York Fed President John Williams seemingly breaking in favor of a rate cut, add to the case for another cut, Knightley said.\n\nAs of Dec. 7, the CME FedWatch tool predicted the Federal Open Market Committee will lower its target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, down to 3.5% to 3.75%.\n\nThe last meeting of a high-pressure year\n\nJon Hilsenrath, a senior advisor at StoneX, said he expects “a very divisive” December meeting to cap off a high-pressure year.\n\nSince President Donald Trump returned to office in January, he has repeatedly attacked Powell in an effort to browbeat the Fed into lowering rates. In April, Trump said Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough!”\n\nSoon, the president may get his wish. While Powell’s term on the Fed’s Board of Governors expires in 2028, his term as chair will end in May 2026. The president is expected to nominate Powell’s replacement early next year.\n\nHis latest appointment to the Fed, Gov. Stephen Miran, prompted concerns about the Fed’s independence as Miran took a leave of absence, but did not resign, from his role as chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers to join the central bank.\n\nThe president also attempted to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook in August over allegations she had lied on two home mortgage applications in 2021. Cook said Trump lacked authority to oust her and that she planned to challenge the move in court, according to a statement from her attorney. In October, the Supreme Court said Trump couldn't terminate Cook immediately and that it would take up the case in January.\n\nTrump’s abrupt dismissal of U.S. Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, following a disappointing jobs report, also stirred up controversy. Trump then nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni to lead the agency. After economists and lawmakers raised concerns about the quality of BLS data under Antoni’s leadership, Trump withdrew the nomination.\n\nMost recently, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he plans to advocate for a requirement that Fed presidents reside in their districts for at least three years before they could be appointed to their positions. If not, he said, “we’re going to veto them.”\n\n“The statistical agencies and the Fed are ending the year with their credibility in question,” Hilsenrath said. “(Trump) is prepared to push very aggressively against the Fed, but he tends to pull back a little bit when he sees that the markets get unnerved.”\n\nData gap muddies economic outlook\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is still without recent key economic data, further complicating matters.\n\nAfter the federal government shutdown delayed data collection and dissemination, the BLS canceled the October inflation and jobs report, but said partial data for that month will be included in November reports. It also postponed the November jobs report to Dec. 16 and the November inflation report to Dec. 18.\n\nThe latest Consumer Price Index for September showed inflation at 3%, higher than the Fed’s 2% target. The September jobs report found U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, though the unemployment rate rose slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%.\n\nPrivate-sector reports have filled some of the data gaps created by the shutdown. A Challenger, Gray & Christmas report found U.S. employers announced 71,321 layoffs in November, down from 153,074 job cuts in October.\n\nThe ADP National Employment report, which is based on payroll data, found private employers shed 32,000 jobs in November.\n\nGiven how much data will be released before the Fed’s January meeting, a Bank of America Global Research report said their economists are skeptical Powell could be “credibly hawkish” at his Dec. 10 press conference.\n\n“Powell is unlikely to get away from data dependence,” the report said. “We wouldn't be surprised if markets start pricing a (January) cut more aggressively in the near term.”\n\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2024/11/05/consumers-didnt-benefit-much-from-the-last-rate-cut-what-happens-now/75988638007/", "title": "Another Fed rate cut is ahead but also likely is ongoing uncertainty ...", "text": "Nov. 5, 2024 Updated Nov. 6, 2024, 4:17 p.m. ET\n\nBorrowers barely felt interest rates budge after the Fed's first rate cut back in September, and they're not about to get a big bang for their buck Thursday when the Federal Reserve makes its next move.\n\nMany economists and Fed watchers expect the central bank to lower short term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point Thursday — the second rate cut in what's projected to be a string of rate reductions in the next year or so.\n\nCurrently, Goldman Sachs economics research is penciling in another four consecutive interest rate cuts in the first half of 2025 but also acknowledged in its Monday update that more uncertainty exists regarding the Fed's path next year.\n\nInflation has cooled significantly from its peak more than two years ago. We're nowhere close to the 9.1% inflation spike that hit in June 2022 — the highest level in 40 years.\n\nThe consumer price index was up 2.4% in September year over year. It was the smallest 12-month gain since February 2021. The CPI for October will be released Nov. 13.\n\nThe Fed raised short term rates 11 times to fight inflation, and now the Fed is on a path to cut rates after inflation has moderated.\n\nA quarter-point cut would bring the federal funds rate down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The short-term federal funds rate is the interest rate used for overnight loans among banks but it plays a huge role in influencing many interest rates that consumers and businesses pay to borrow throughout the economy.\n\nThe Fed's next meeting — its last scheduled meeting for 2024 — is Dec. 17 and Dec. 18. Some experts are forecasting another quarter-point cut at the December meeting, too. If that takes place, the federal funds rate could be in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% by year end.\n\n'Card declined' scares online shoppers in latest scam to run up fraudulent charges\n\nMost consumers still dealing with high interest rates\n\nMost people aren't talking about the great deal they just got on a credit card rate or a car loan, though.\n\nThe average credit card rate now is 20.5% — down just a tiny bit from the 20.78% average on the morning of Sept. 18, before the Fed announced its first rate cut that afternoon, according to Bankrate.com data.\n\nThe average 60-month new car loan rate being marketed now is 7.51%, according to Bankrate.com data. That's down from an average of 7.67% on the morning of Sept. 18.\n\nThe average 48-month used car loan rate now is 8.21%, down from 8.3% on Sept. 18, according to Bankrate.com data.\n\n\"Consumers have yet to benefit much from the Fed’s rate cut,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's.\n\n\"Credit card and auto loan rates have peaked, but they are falling very slowly, at least so far,\" Zandi said. \"It will take more rate cuts and time for competition among lenders to kick in before consumers benefit.\"\n\nMortgage rates fell but then edged up\n\nMortgage rates actually edged up since the Fed's last rate cut of a half-point on Sept. 18. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage averaged 6.72% on Oct. 31, according to data from Freddie Mac's latest primary mortgage market survey. That's down from the 7.79% weekly average a year ago on Oct. 26, 2023.\n\nBut we're still talking about a decent bump up from the 6.08% recent low that was hit in the Sept. 26 survey.\n\nMortgage rates — which don't move in lockstep with changes in the federal funds rate — have gone up based on various headwinds, including the outlook for the economy and the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"The strong economy has caused investors to expect the Fed to cut rates more slowly,\" Zandi said.\n\nAnd, he added, at various points in mid- to late-October, expectations had grown that former President Donald Trump would win the 2024 election on Nov. 5. Long-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates overall, Zandi said, would end up higher because Trump's tariff, immigration and tax policies would fuel inflation and bigger budget deficits.\n\n\"Mortgage rates are the wild card,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for Bankrate.com.\n\nMortgage rates, Rossman noted, are one of the least Fed-dependent consumer rates. Instead, the 30-year mortgage rate tends to track 10-year Treasuries plus a profit margin.\n\n\"Investors have pushed long-term yields higher in recent weeks,\" Rossman said.\n\nMortgage rates, he said, went up with the growing likelihood that a soft landing would mean the Fed wouldn't have to cut rates as much, possibly.\n\nThe bond market in recent weeks also could have been anticipating more inflation ahead in the long run, Rossman said, if Trump won the election and we ended up with higher tariffs, deficit-financed tax cuts and lower immigration, which could drive up the cost of labor.\n\nSome \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" has taken place, Rossman said.\n\nConsumers who are looking to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, though, cannot expect to see 30-year mortgage rates in the 3% to 4% range any time soon, no matter what happens, Rossman said.\n\nMortgage rates, he said, are likely to be a lot higher than we got used to over most of the past 15 years.\n\nWhat kind of rates can we expect by late December?\n\nRight now, Rossman said, consumers can expect to continue to see a \"slow, steady drift downward for credit card, auto loan and CD rates.\"\n\nSavers are already seeing some lower rates, such as the newly announced rates for I Bonds. Series I Savings Bonds issued from Nov. 1 through April 30, 2025, will have an annualized rate of 3.11% for six months after the bonds are issued. That includes a 1.2% fixed rate that remains with the 30-year life of the I Bond.\n\nThe new I Bond rates are down significantly from the rates for I Bonds issued from May through October, which had a 4.28% annualized rate for six months. Those I Bonds carry a fixed rate of 1.3% that will remain for the 30-year life of the bond.\n\nBy year's end, Rossman said:\n\nThe average credit card rates offered to consumers could be around 20% to 20.25%.\n\nThe average 60-month new car loan could be between 7% and 7.25% at the end of 2024, Rossman said, while the average 48-month used car loan could end up between 7.75% and 8%.\n\nThe average 1-year CD rate could be between 1.75% and 2% in roughly eight weeks. Currently, the average 1-year CD rate is 2%. That's down from 2.05% from the morning of Sept. 18, before the Fed rate cut was announced that afternoon.\n\nWhat's next after the presidential election?\n\nThe risks of a contested 2024 presidential election were expected to hold back spending and possibly stunt economic growth, but on Tuesday, former President Donald Trump clearly won the needed 270 electoral votes to return to the White House in January.\n\n\"There is nothing but downside risk to the economy the longer it takes to determine who won the election,\" Zandi said Saturday.\n\n\"The collective psyche is already fragile, and a protracted and contentious election process will be difficult for investors, businesses and consumers to tolerate,\" Zandi said then.\n\nBut Wednesday morning such a scenario was more unlikely. The Dow Jones Industrial Average initially gained more than 1,000 points Wednesday morning on news of the Trump victory.\n\nDiane Swonk, chief economist for KPMG US, noted that the Fed is more focused on lifting its foot off the brakes right now and \"not hitting the gas to rev the economy.\"\n\nThe KPMG report released before Election Day stated that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to \"leave the door open a crack for a final quarter-point cut in December.\"\n\nBut the report also highlighted concerns about the aftermath of what's been advertised as an election that \"could be one of the tightest elections in a string of close elections.\"\n\n\"Concerns over the outcome of the elections, and any delays in determining the winner of the presidential election, will fuel policy uncertainty,\" the KPMG report noted.\n\nSo far, the Nov. 3 report noted, the impact of that uncertainty on actual economic activity has not been substantial. Yet, uncertainty did hold back some spending.\n\n\"CEOs have said that they are holding off on big investment decisions until after the cloud of uncertainty lifts over what appears to be a razor-close race,\" according to the Nov. 3 KPMG report.\n\nMost economists still expect the Fed to cut rates Thursday. But uncertainties remain about what path the Fed will take in 2025 and what shifts the economy — and inflation — could take as Trump heads to the White House.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

High interest rates are just making their payments go way higher. A lot of people are opting to wait.”\n\nFor buyers brave enough to dip their toes in the water, the market has been fickle.\n\nOne of Comfort’s clients received an estimate on a mortgage application before the Federal Reserve announced it would start cutting rates. “Then rates started going back up and now her payment is going to be more than when we originally started looking,” she said. “It’s extremely frustrating.”\n\nThat experience isn’t a fluke. On Sept. 18, when the Federal Reserve made its first cut of 2024, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.09%. Three months later, just after the central bank on Wednesday announced its third cut of the year, the federal funds rate is down a full percentage point. Mortgages, meanwhile, are up nearly that much: the 30-year-fixed averaged 6.72% in the week ending Dec. 19, according to Freddie Mac data.\n\nFind your next home: AddressUSA puts the power in your hands\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nMortgages follow bonds, not bank rates\n\nThe Federal Reserve controls the rates at which banks loan money to each other overnight. But mortgages have a much longer lifespan, and as a result they most closely track 10-year U.S. Treasury notes – debt issued by the U.S. government and traded by investors in the bond market.\n\nMortgage guarantor Fannie Mae recently highlighted “investors' expectations for monetary and fiscal policy, economic growth, and inflation” in an article laying out factors influencing rates for 10-year Treasury notes.\n\nIf investors expect inflation to be higher, for example, investors will want higher yields so their investments don't lose value. It’s also the case that when inflation goes higher, the risk that interest-paying investments will lose value makes their prices decline. Bond prices decline when yields rise, and vice versa.\n\nWhy are mortgage rates higher than bond yields?\n\nWhile mortgages go in the same direction as the bond market, there is still a big “spread,” or difference between the two. On Sept. 18, when the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.09%, the 10-year Treasury averaged 4.10%.\n\nMortgages are much riskier investments than debt issued by the government of the largest economy in the world. Individual homeowners can and do default regularly.\n\nMortgages are also riskier because homeowners can refinance whenever they want, for any reason, with no penalty. Investors and institutions that buy mortgages and mortgage bonds have no guarantee that they’ll be able to count on constant cash flows from those financial products, so they demand more yield – and lower prices, as described above – to buy them.\n\nBut mortgage rates aren’t even staying the same – they’re rising\n\nIn short, that's because risks are rising.\n\n“Inflation has barely budged since last December, it means that this last mile will indeed be much more difficult than many predicted,” said Selma Hepp, chief economist for CoreLogic.\n\nThe Fed has made significant progress in taming runaway inflation, but finally touching its 2% target will be hard. Policymakers acknowledged as much Wednesday when they forecast fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously expected.\n\n\"Inflation has been moving sideways,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference, adding that achieving the goal of 2% inflation has \"kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year.\"\n\nLooking forward, there’s no reason to expect the bond market to pick up, Hepp said. “It's the concern about the debt and the deficit, but also we are in an environment where economic growth is looking like it's going to remain stronger. And that requires a higher natural rate of natural interest rates.”\n\nMortgages, meanwhile, have their own concerns: with rates for home loans having been so elevated for such an extended period over the past two years, investors have every reason to expect more prepayment risk than usual, Hepp noted.\n\n\"We're in a period of heightened uncertainty,\" Hepp said. \"It's hard to price mortgages when you have so little certainty.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/19"}]}

An aid group with workers in Syria said people jumped from buildings in a panic.\n\n\"The new tremblor has unsettled families and communities who’ve already had their sense of security shaken to the core,\" Jenelle Eli, a global spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told USA TODAY from Geneva.\n\nIn Hatay, police rescued one person trapped inside a three-story building and were trying to reach three others inside, HaberTurk television reported.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken took a helicopter tour Sunday of some of the worst-affected areas and pledged a further $100 million in aid to help the region.\n\nPanicked jump from buildings\n\nIn northwest Syria, aid workers with the nonprofit Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations-USA reported at least 94 injuries and several collapsed structures, with a number of people hurt after jumping from buildings.\n\n\"Most of the injuries are a result of people panicking,\" said Najah Allouch, a spokesperson for the Minnesota-based group. \"The latest information we have is that eight people jumped and were injured out of fear of their buildings collapsing. Luckily, they were only injured.\"\n\nDeaths, injuries still being tallied\n\nIn the Turkish city of Adana, eyewitness Alejandro Malaver said people left homes for the streets, carrying blankets into their cars. Malaver said everyone is really scared and that “no one wants to get back into their houses.”\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly visited the region earlier Monday. Erdogan said around 1.6 million people are currently being housed in temporary shelters.\n\n\"We’re hearing reports of damage and loved ones separated and so the nightmare of the past few weeks is starting over again for some residents,\" Eli told USA TODAY.\n\nTurkey’s disaster management agency, AFAD, said the quake was centered around the town of Defne in Hatay province. It was followed by a second tremor of magnitude 5.8. Reuters reported that Monday's temblor set off panic and damaged buildings in the city of Antakya.\n\nHatay province is on the Mediterranean coast, bordered by Syria to the south and east. The province was slammed by the Feb. 6 quakes that Turkish officials say killed more than 41,000 people in their country alone. Several thousand people also died in Syria as a result of the quakes, which injured tens of thousands of people across the two nations and left hundreds of thousands homeless.\n\nDisaster struck the region Feb. 6\n\nOn Feb. 6, a magnitude 7.8 quake struck southern Turkey, U.S. Geological Survey said. Hours later, a 7.5 magnitude quake hit more than 60 miles away. Scores of violent aftershocks followed, leaving destruction and devastation in their path.\n\nMore than a week after the earthquakes, search teams said they were still hearing voices from under the rubble. Despite the rare, inspiring rescues, thousands of bodies were being removed from toppled buildings, and experts said the chances of finding survivors are increasingly slim. Two weeks later, many people remain in the streets without shelter.\n\nAftershocks collapse damaged buildings\n\nBecause so many people are seeking shelter in temperatures that are still dropping below freezing some nights, they appear willing to risk entering what appear to be undamaged buildings.\n\nBut those buildings may have been damaged by the initial quakes and were poised to collapse when this strong new aftershock occurred, California-based structural engineer Andy Thompson said.\n\n\"It's an extremely challenging situation made much worse by the continuous aftershocks and the concern of damaged buildings being pushed to the point of collapse,\" said Thompson, who has responded to quakes in Haiti, Chile and India. \"You might have an undamaged home that's in the shadow of a building that's about to collapse.\"\n\nThompson, the CEO of quake-assessment company SafeHub, said quickly assessing the damage levels of buildings is a tough task, complicated by ongoing rescues, shortages of heavy equipment and safety concerns from aftershocks.\n\n\"In these situations, we would never say that a building is safe. The thing that structural engineers would be saying, what we're looking at, is the question: 'Is it less safe than it was before the primary event?'\" he said. \"The challenge is that you need to make thousands of evaluations very quickly with a limited number of experts.\"\n\nDesperate survivors taking risks\n\nFormer U.S. Marine Andrew Cote, who recently returned from the Hatay area following a four-day search-and-rescue trip, said many buildings still standing were nevertheless teetering on the edge.\n\nIn one case, he said, two approximately six-story apartment buildings had teetered sideways into each other, posing significant risk of further collapse. In many other places, he said, the first floors of buildings collapsed but the rest of the building remained standing, sometimes with an exterior wall missing.\n\nHe said even without quakes, pieces of buildings were still falling off nearly two weeks after the initial quake. But with nowhere else to go, people are camping outside their former homes or sleeping in cars to stay warm in temperatures that are still falling below freezing some nights.\n\n\"My immediate thought is the few buildings that were still vertical have now come down, exponentially increasing the search area,\" he said Monday, reflecting on the new quake.\n\nCote works for BRINC Drones, which makes tactical drones with two-way video and audio capability. In Hatay, they used the drones to fly up several stories, break a window and then fly down hallways and through rooms to search, keeping rescuers outside until it was deemed safe or necessary to enter.\n\nCote said many international teams had sophisticated thermal cameras or acoustic sensors, but most of the searching is being done by hand by desperate residents searching for family members and friends.\n\n\"I saw people without shoes climbing around – it was so emotionally driven, with safety as an afterthought,\" he said. \"They were in it with their hands, with fence posts that they turned into crowbars.\"\n\nNew damage worsens existing humanitarian disaster\n\nAuthorities are warning the disaster areas could be hit by a cholera epidemic, compounding the already dire risks facing displaced residents.\n\nMany people are living in temporary shelters with poor access to hygiene, which raises concerns for the spread of infectious diseases. Syria was already facing a cholera outbreak, and a vaccination campaign to curb its spread was halted by the quake.\n\nAdditionally, millions are now living without permanent shelter or access to preventative medicine or treatment for ongoing disease like diabetes, because resources are focused on acute and disaster care.\n\n\"Restoring access to essential health and water services is crucial to prevent outbreaks and save lives,\" said Eli, the spokesperson for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\n\nHow to help Turkey, Syria: Relief efforts ongoing after more earthquakes rock region\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/02/16/mexico-struck-massive-7-5-magnitude-earthquake/347281002/", "title": "Mexico hit by major 7.2-magnitude earthquake", "text": "Feb. 16, 2018 Updated Feb. 17, 2018, 1:17 a.m. ET\n\nA massive earthquake hit Mexico Friday evening, leaving buildings shaking throughout the southern portion of the country.\n\nThe earthquake was first measured as a 7.5-magnitude and later lowered to having a 7.2-magnitude by the U.S. Geological Survey.

The Chilean government estimated that 2 million people were left homeless and more than 58,000 homes were destroyed.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The force creates waves that radiate outward in all directions away from their source, sometimes crossing entire ocean basins, according to a description from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nUnlike wind-driven waves, which only travel through the topmost layer of the ocean, tsunamis move through the entire water column, from the ocean floor to the ocean surface.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/05/earthquake-northern-california-usgs/76801185007/", "title": "'Swaying back and forth': Magnitude 7 earthquake, aftershocks rock ...", "text": "Dec. 5, 2024 Updated Dec. 6, 2024, 8:19 a.m. ET\n\n(This article has been updated to correct the location of the fault where the earthquake occurred.)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO ‒ A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck near the town of Petrolia on Thursday at 10:44 a.m. local time, generating a now discontinued tsunami warning that stretched from southern Oregon to San Francisco.\n\nThe quake occurred on the sparsely populated northern coast of California in a seismically complex area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction. It is where three tectonic plates meet and the Northwest’s Cascadia subduction zone and California’s San Andreas Fault system meet. The quake itself occurred on the Mendocino fault zone.\n\nIn Arcata, California, just under 60 miles from Petrolia, 25-year-old Jared Mitchell was having an early lunch in his apartment when he felt a \"jolt,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\n“It wasn’t that big of a violent shake,” said Mitchell, an assistant manager at Los Bagels, a bagel shop in town. “But my apartment was swaying back and forth for a bit. It was kind of scary, like I was on a raft in the middle of the sea.”\n\nBy 12:30 p.m., less than two hours after the initial quake, the area had experienced 13 different aftershocks, ranging from 5.1 to 3.1, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. By 2:30 p.m., the USGS had reported at least 39 aftershocks of at least a 2.5 magnitude in the region, including Petrolia and Ferndale.\n\nThe National Tsunami Warning Center canceled its warning at 11:54 a.m. local time and said no tsunami observations were available to report. \"No destructive tsunami has been recorded,\" the center said. However, it advised the public not to reoccupy hazard zones until local emergency officials indicate it is safe to do so.\n\nHow many people felt the earthquake?\n\nUSGS initially estimated more than 150,000 people might have been exposed to earthquake shaking, between just north of Fort Bragg to Eureka. One USA TODAY reporter in San Francisco did not feel its impacts, but another resident right on the San Francisco Bay said it was the longest earthquake she'd ever felt.\n\nTraci Grant, 53, a public relations specialist, said she was on the phone with a friend when she felt her San Francisco apartment of 20 years “swaying.\"\n\n“I felt my whole apartment was moving in slow motion,” said Grant, adding that the older building she lives in the Marina District is retrofitted. “For a moment I thought I should get my purse and my cat and get out.”\n\nGrant said she felt it for nearly 30 seconds, “which was long enough to me.” She said nothing fell down in her apartment.\n\n“It just kept going and going,” Grant said. “It was scary and a bit exciting at the same time. ... It was more of a roll than just shake, shake, shake.”\n\nSee where the epicenter was\n\nEarthquake rocks in complex area where 3 tectonic plates meet\n\nThe Earth’s crust is made up of many tectonic plates that move slowly over the Earth's surface. Thursday’s earthquake hit in an area that’s extremely complex, seismically speaking, said Stephen DeLong, a supervisory research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nIt’s near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a tectonic boundary where three plates meet: the Pacific, North American and Juan de Fuca. The Triple Junction is also the point that the Northwest’s northern Cascadia subduction zone and the southern San Andreas Fault system meet.\n\nThursday’s earthquakes are occurring in the Mendocino fracture zone, said Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.\n\nLarge earthquakes also occurred near the junction in northern California in previous Decembers, according to the geological survey. There were two, a 6.1 and 6.0, near Petrolia in 2021 and a 6.4 near Ferndale in 2022.\n\nMore aftershocks expected\n\nThe USGS released an aftershock forecast on Thursday.\n\nThere is a greater than 99% probability of one or more magnitude 3.0 earthquakes in the area over the next day, a 74% chance of a magnitude 4.0 or larger, 22% chance of a magnitude 5.0 and larger and a 3% chance of magnitude 6.0 or larger.\n\nApproximately 10,000 Pacific Gas and Electric customers in Humboldt county were initially without electric power on Thursday as the utility assessed its gas and electric systems. By 3:30 p.m. that number had been reduced to 500 customers as inspections were conducted. “No damage to PG&E critical facilities, gas system or generating assets has been reported,” said spokesperson Megan McFarland.\n\nHow common is a Bay Area tsunami warning?\n\nBetween 1850 and 2004, 51 credible tsunamis were recorded in San Francisco Bay, according to 2004 research led by Lori Dengler, a professor emeritus at Cal Poly Humboldt. Only two of those generated damage, the 1960 Chile earthquake and the 1964 Alaska earthquake, which generated waves of almost 4 feet at the Presidio, the authors reported.\n\nPrevious tsunami warning canceled\n\nPreviously, a tsunami warning advised a tsunami could arrive along the coast starting near Fort Bragg at 11:10 a.m. local time and move along the coast in northern California and southern Oregon, arriving in San Francisco at 12:10. Residents within the zone – stretching from Davenport, California, northwest of Santa Cruz, to the Douglas Lane county line in Oregon – were urged to move off the water and beach and evacuate inland beyond tsunami hazard zones.\n\n\"Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets,\" the tsunami warning center advised. \"Repeated coastal flooding is possible as waves arrive onshore, move inland, and drain back into the ocean.\"\n\nJust how big is a 7.0 quake?\n\nMagnitude is a measurement of the strength of an earthquake. Officially it's called the moment magnitude scale. It's a logarithmic scale, meaning each number is 10 times as strong as the one before it. So a 5.0 earthquake is ten times stronger than a 4.0.\n\nThe magnitude and effect of an earthquake, according to Michigan Technological University:\n\nBelow 2.5: Generally not felt.\n\n2.5 to 5.4: Minor or no damage.\n\n5.5 to 6.0: Slight damage to buildings.\n\n6.1 to 6.9: Serious damage.\n\n7.0 to 7.9: Major earthquake. Serious damage.\n\n8.0 or greater: Massive damage, can destroy communities.\n\nPreliminary data from the U.S. Geological Survey indicates a 32% chance of estimated economic losses of $1 million-$10 million, and a 32% chance of economic losses of $10 million-$100 million, with the chances of losses greater than that estimated at 15%.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/10/asia/earthquake-papua-new-guinea", "title": "Papua New Guinea rocked by massive 7.6 earthquake | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nA massive 7.6 earthquake struck Papua New Guinea on Sunday, causing landslides, cracking roads and damaging buildings.\n\nWhile the extent of the damage remains unclear, photos showed debris strewn across highways and cracks opening up in roads.\n\nThe quake struck at a depth of 90 kilometers (roughly 56 miles) near Kainantu, a town with a population of roughly 8,500 people, the United States Geological Survey reported.\n\nDebris lies strewn across a highway following a landslide near the town of Kainantu, following a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in northeastern Papua New Guinea on Sunday, Sept. 11, 2022.

While New York Mayor Eric Adams called him a \"strong person of interest in the shooting that shook our city,\" he was not immediately charged in Thompson's death and was held in Altoona where police recovered a 3D-printed \"ghost gun\" and silencer.\n\nWritings found on Mangione, the son of a prominent Baltimore family, showed \"some ill will toward corporate America,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.\n\nIn a four-star Goodreads review of The Unabomber Manifesto he posted in January, Mangione wrote, \"It's easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it's simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\"\n\nHe then quoted another, unidentified, writer who praised Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, who killed three people and injured 26 in a string of bombings: \"You may not like his methods, but to see things from his perspective, it's not terrorism, it's war and revolution.\"\n\nHere's what we know about Luigi Mangione.\n\nThe Unabomber and radical violence\n\nIn his online book review, Mangione wrote that Kaczynski, who died in prison last year, \"was a violent individual - rightfully imprisoned - who maimed innocent people.\"\n\nHe then quoted \"a take I found online that I think is interesting.\" That unnamed writer more clearly embraced Kaczynski, who targeted figures in academia and the business world from 1978 to 1995.\n\n\"Oil barons haven't listened to any environmentalists, but they feared him,\" that writer said of Kaczynski.\n\nUnder the review, Mangione selected several passages from the manifesto, whose formal title was \"Industrial Society and its Future,\" including one that reads, “The concept of 'mental health' in our society is defined largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress.”\n\nProminent family, Ivy League graduate\n\nMangione is from a well-known Baltimore family, the Baltimore Banner reported.

He showed the police the same fake New Jersey ID that the gunman was believed to have presented to a hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Nov. 24, the commissioner said.\n\nIn addition to the fake ID cards, Mangione had a gun and silencer similar to the ones authorities believe the killer used in New York, Tisch said. The gun used in Thompson's murder is believed to have been a \"ghost gun\" assembled with a 3D printer, NYPD Chief of Detectives Kenny said.\n\nClothes, including a mask consistent with the one seen in images released by police, were also recovered, Tisch said.\n\nMangione remained in custody in Altoona on firearm charges, according to Tisch. Although he has not been charged with Thompson's murder, New York detectives were en route to Pennsylvania to further interview him about the shooting, the commissioner said.\n\nDocument found with Luigi Mangione\n\nAuthorities found a \"handwritten document\" in Mangione's possession, which spoke to \"his motivation and mindset,\" Tisch said. This document is currently in possession of the Altoona Police Department as part of their investigation, Kenny said.\n\nBased on briefly speaking with Altoona police, New York police don't see specific threats to other people mentioned in the document, Kenny said.\n\nKenny said that while the investigation was ongoing, “We believe, at this point – our investigation is leaning towards he was acting alone.”\n\nWhat was Luigi Mangione doing in the McDonald's?\n\nWhen authorities approached Mangione inside the McDonald's, \"he was sitting there eating,\" according to Kenny.\n\nAlthough Mangione had a fake passport, investigators don't believe he was planning to flee the country, Kenny said.\n\nWhether Mangione will be brought back to New York will be dependent on the Manhattan District Attorney's Office because he is facing gun charges in Altoona, according to the chief.\n\nNYPD is also looking into Mangione's social media and the possible route he took to Altoona from Manhattan, Kenny said.\n\nLuigi Mangione has ties in Maryland, California and Hawaii\n\nMangione has ties in Maryland, California and Hawaii, according to Kenny.

Some reviews that appeared to reference the arrest were still active Tuesday morning, with some receiving hundreds of likes.\n\nThe spokesperson confirmed Google would continue to remove additional derogatory reviews online.\n\nAccording to Google's online policies, contributed content must be based on the reviewer’s real experiences with a location, and Google closely monitors policy-violating content. Google is also is placing additional protections on the profiles to prevent further off-topic reviews.\n\nThe negative reviews popped up online after Luigi Mangione, 26, was captured on Monday following a multi-day manhunt at a McDonald’s in Altoona, about 100 miles east of Pittsburgh. According to Pennsylvania State Police, he was spotted eating at the restaurant by a customer who alerted a McDonald's employee.\n\nMultiple Google reviews circulated on social media and in news reports showed people slamming the restaurant for people \"snitching\" on the suspect, leaving one-star ratings and glorifying the suspect for his actions.\n\n'Shocked and devastated': Family of suspected United Healthcare killer speaks out\n\nThe reviews are in line with some social media users who did not sympathize with Thompson's death, instead resorting to mockery and memes. A similar discourse played out during high-profile news events like the assassination attempts on Donald Trump and the sinking of the Titan submersible.\n\n\"When events like this occur, it is human nature to try and compartmentalize our understanding of it to make sense of it and make ourselves feel better, safer,\" Laura Petiford, a licensed marriage and family therapist, previously told USA TODAY. \"If we can believe that someone deserves what they got, separating ourselves from that person creates a sense of psychological safety for us.\"\n\nPetiford added that holding one man accountable for all issues in the health care industry is \"akin to holding immigrants wholly responsible for many of our societal challenges.\"\n\n\"You can hold two ideas in your mind that seem contradictory,\" Amy Morin, psychotherapist, author and podcast host, previously said to USA TODAY. \"For example, you might tell yourself, 'It's unfortunate this happened and I hope it leads to change,' or 'I'm sorry someone lost their life and I hope this loss helps people understand the insurance system is broken.'\"\n\n'Review bombing' following an arrest at an Altoona McDonalds\n\nThe pessimistic comments were the latest in what is known as \"review bombing,\" where a business is hit with a slew of bad reviews based on a political view or an occurrence unrelated to its actual business.\n\nMangione was arrested and charged Monday night with murder and other felonies in connection to Thompson's fatal shooting in New York City.\n\nAuthorities said they found a 3D-printed handgun and a silencer when they searched Mangione's backpack upon detaining him at the McDonald's. The police officers, responding to a restaurant employee's tip, said they recognized Mangione right away from widely distributed law enforcement photos once he removed his face mask upon their request.\n\nA criminal complaint filed by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, also charged Mangione, with forgery, tampering with records or identification, giving police false ID, and possessing instruments of a crime. He was arraigned and jailed without bail and on Tuesday awaiting extradition back to New York City to face a murder charge filed by Manhattan prosecutors late Monday.\n\n'Our family is shocked'\n\nNino Mangione, a Maryland state delegate, is a cousin of Luigi Mangione, WBAL-TV. reported. Nino Mangione released a statement on social media on behalf of the family after the arrest Monday night:\n\n\"We only know what we have read in the media,\" Nino Mangione posted on X. \"Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\"\n\nThe Baltimore-area family issued the statement before New York City prosecutors charged Mangione with murder.\n\n(This story was updated to add information.)\n\nContributing: David Oliver, John Bacon, Nick Penzenstadler,Jonathan Limehouse and N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

A New York City jury found Penny, a former Marine, not guilty on charges of killing Neely, a homeless Black man, on the subway last year after placing him in a chokehold for roughly six minutes. Penny's lawyers argued he did not intend to harm Neely and was trying to protect other subway passengers, who witnessed Neely screaming that he was hungry, thirsty and ready to kill someone.\n\nReactions to the trial fall on party lines: Democrats described Neely’s death as emerging from systemic issues related to race, poor funding for mental health care and lack of social services for the homeless. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers rallied in support of Penny, painting him as a hero.\n\nTikTok asks Supreme Court to review ban legislation\n\nTikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance are asking the United States government to take a closer look at legislation that could ban the social media platform.

Users who have TikTok on their devices would still be able to use the app, but banning TikTok from app stores would prohibit future software updates.

With information flooding in, the NYPD ultimately said a tip from a McDonald's restaurant employee allowed authorities to identify and locate the suspect, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione.\n\nMangione was arrested on five charges in Pennsylvania Monday, but has yet to be charged in relation to the killing itself, as of Monday evening. Police said Monday that a search found Mangione in possession of fake IDs, a \"ghost\" gun and silencer and clothes and a mask matching the suspected shooter.\n\nWith law enforcement agencies lauding the tip given by the McDonald's employee as crucial, questions have arisen as to the offered rewards and who will end up getting them. Here's what would need to happen for the up to $60,000 in rewards to be paid out.\n\nWho is the 'person of interest' arrested in CEO shooting?\n\nMangione, 26 was initially detained as a person of interest Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania on gun charges. Mangione has not been charged with murder or other crimes related to the CEO's killing, as of Monday evening.\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said he was found with a gun, mask and fake identification card \"consistent\" with items believed used by Thompson's killer.\n\nThe man was identified Monday based on a tip after he was recognized by a McDonald’s restaurant employee, Tisch said. The employee told police they saw him around 9:15 a.m. in the restaurant \"acting suspiciously\" and carrying multiple fraudulent IDs, as well as a U.S. passport.\n\nNYPD, FBI offer a combined $60,000 for UnitedHealthcare shooter\n\nThe NYPD initially offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Thompson's shooter. Over the weekend, the FBI added the shooter to the Most Wanted list and publicized an additional $50,000 reward.\n\nHundreds of tips poured in after authorities released multiple photos and offered $60,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nWho would get the reward for turning the killer in?\n\nAt this point, no one is entitled to the award and likely won't be for a while.\n\nWhile law enforcement agencies are asking for the public's assistance in finding the shooter, not just any tip that proves useful will be rewarded with the $60,000. A tip would have to not only lead to the arrest of a suspect, but a conviction as well.\n\nUntil a trial can be held and a perpetrator is convicted in a court of law or at least indicted, no one will be eligible for the reward.\n\nHow are rewards determined and paid?\n\nTo be eligible for a reward through the FBI, you would first have to be nominated by a U.S. investigating agency such as the Department of Defense or the FBI to receive the reward, according to the FBI's website. A person who provided information cannot self-nominate.\n\nAn interagency committee then reviews the nomination and its legal eligibility. If it is determined that the information provided merits a reward, the suggestion is passed on to the Secretary of State, who makes the final decision. In federal cases, the Attorney General must also agree.\n\nThe FBI generally does not announce that a reward has been paid out. The agency does not share information received as part of the investigation, nor does it disclose identity information about individuals who receive payment, though it does submit a confidential report to Congress.\n\nBeing found eligible for or even being approved for a reward does not guarantee the receipt of a specific amount of funds. Reward payment amounts are based on multiple factors, the FBI says, including the value of the information provided, the level of threat mitigated by the information received, the severity of danger or injury to U.S. persons or property presented by the threat, the risk faced by a source and his/her family and the degree of a source’s cooperation.\n\nA payment to a source may be any amount up to the total dollar amount of an advertised reward offer.\n\nAs far as the NYPD, the rewards program is executed through Crime Stoppers, where tips can be anonymously called in at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or online at crimestoppers.nypdonline.org. After submitting information, tipsters receive a unique reference number.\n\nBecause law enforcement agencies do not gather other identifying information about tipsters, those hoping to receive a reward will have to call back or go online to check the status of the investigation using this reference number, according to the NYPD and Crime Stoppers websites. If a reward is being offered and the New York City Police Foundation and/or Crime Stoppers Board of Directors approves one related to their tip, the caller will then be instructed as to how to receive it.\n\nWould McDonald's employee that reported 'person of interest' get the reward?\n\nMangione, the suspect named in the investigation, has not been charged with Thompson's murder, as of Monday evening.\n\nTo receive the FBI reward, the McDonald's worker would first have to be nominated by an involved agency and then be approved through the committee. If the Secretary of State were to agree, they would then determine how much money the information provided by the employee is worth, up to but likely not totaling the $50,000 advertised.\n\nIn both the case of the NYPD and FBI, rewards are only paid after an arrest and importantly, indictment or conviction, depending on the situation and agency.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Nick Penzenstadler, Jonathan Limehouse, N'dea Yancey-Bragg, Jorge L.
