Find that out, plus when to celebrate, why it's a ...", "text": "Colorful beads, cheerful music and king cakes galore are right around the corner. If you’re eager for Mardi Gras celebrations to begin, you’re not the only one.\n\nBefore the big day – or week for our New Orleans friends – here’s everything you need to know about Mardi Gras, including dates, the meaning of the holiday, traditions and more.\n\nWhat is Mardi Gras?\n\nMardi Gras is the climax of Carnival season and is celebrated the day before the Christian season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. In French, Mardi Gras means “Fat Tuesday,” another name for the holiday,\n\nCarnival begins with Three Kings Day, also known as Epiphany and Little Christmas, and is a pre-Lent festival honoring the beginning of the new year and the rebirth of nature, according to Britannica.\n\nWhile the dates and exact celebrations of Carnival vary by location, the United States celebrates Mardi Gras beginning 10 days before Shrove Tuesday, also called “Pancake Tuesday” or “Pancake Day,” when it is customary to eat all the fats in the house before Lent.\n\nShrove Tuesday comes from the practice of “shriving,” purifying oneself through confession, before Lent, and is another element of the holiday, according to Almanac.\n\nWhen is Mardi Gras?\n\nBecause Mardi Gras is always observed on the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, the date of observance changes each year but is typically held in either February or March.\n\nThis year, Mardi Gras will be celebrated on Tuesday, Feb. 13, according to Almanac.\n\nNext year, Mardi Gras is on Tuesday, March 4.\n\nHistory of Mardi Gras\n\nFort Louis de la Mobile, located about 60 miles south of New Orleans, was named “Pointe du Mardi Gras” on March 2, 1699, by French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, also known as Sieur de Bienville, when his men and Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville came across the plot of land and realized it was the eve of Mardi Gras, according to Mardi Gras New Orleans.\n\nThe first Mardi Gras celebration in America was celebrated in 1703 in the settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile.\n\nMardi Gras was celebrated soon after the city of New Orleans was founded in 1718, but was briefly banned when the Spanish took control of New Orleans until Louisiana became a U.S. state in 1812, according to History.\n\nIn 1827, a group of students wearing colorful costumes danced through the streets of New Orleans, copying the festivities they saw while visiting Paris. A decade later in 1837, the first Mardi Gras street parade was recorded and remains a yearly occurrence to this day.\n\nNow, Louisiana is the only state that recognizes Mardi Gras as a legal holiday, although other states like Alabama and Mississippi have their own elaborate Carnival festivities.\n\nHow is Mardi Gras celebrated?\n\nFor those observing Shrove Tuesday and Pancake Day for religious reasons, the holiday is marked by attending church services and using up household ingredients by feasting with friends and family in preparation for fasting, according to Christianity.\n\nYou might even see people enjoying pancake races, where participants run while flipping pancakes in a pan. The tradition dates back to 1445 in Olney, Buckinghamshire, where, upon hearing church bells, a local woman ran out the door flipping pancakes in a skillet because she couldn’t be late for the shriving service at church, according to Almanac.\n\nMardi Gras, known for more elaborate celebrations, is typically celebrated with jubilant music, street celebrations and parades, often occurring for the days leading up to Fat Tuesday, too. Carnival season is also marked by ornate costumes, street processions and masquerade balls in some countries.\n\nAround the world, similar pre-Lenten festivals take place.\n\nBrazil hosts weeklong Carnival festivities; Canada’s Quebec City hosts the Quebec Winer Carnival; Germany celebrates Karneval (also known as Fastnacht or Fasching) with costume balls and the tradition of women cutting off men’s ties; and Denmark celebrates Fastevlan, a holiday similar to Halloween where children dress up and collect candy.\n\nMardi Gras traditions\n\nKrewes\n\nKrewes are an element of Mardi Gras dating back to 1857.\n\nDuring that year, holiday celebrations in New Orleans became inundated with drunken debauchery and violence that city officials considered getting rid of the festivities. To avoid this, members of a group known as the Cowbellion de Rakin Society (which held an annual parade on New Year’s Eve) stepped up to restore order.\n\nThe society formed a new organization, called the “Mystick Krewe of Comus,” to stage their own Mardi Gras parades annually and ensure less chaotic gatherings. Today, more than 70 krewes operate in New Orleans, with elite balls, parades and supper dances for Carnival and Mardi Gras, according to History.\n\nKrewe of Rex, founded in 1872, is among the most famous Krewes. Officially called the “School of Design.” a prominent person is chosen to be Rex, that year’s King of Carnival and leader of the organization’s group of esteemed citizens, and is given a symbolic key to the city by the mayor. The first Rex was the Grand Duke Alexis Romanov Alexandrovitch, brother of the heir apparent to the Russian throne at the time.\n\nBeads\n\nAlexandrovitch of the Krewe of Rex is credited with establishing purple, gold and green as the official colors of Mardi Gras, stemming from the colors of the duke’s royal house. The colors translate to the beads thrown from parade floats into crowds, another holiday tradition, and each have a different meaning; purple represents justice, green for faith and gold for power, according to Almanac.\n\nThe beads were originally made from glass and tossed to crowd members who exhibited the traits of the beads, with those who caught them receiving good luck for the coming year. Beads are typically plastic but remain popular during Mardi Gras.\n\nKing cake\n\nA king cake is a pastry with a tiny figurine of a baby baked into the dough to be revealed in a slice or bite of the bread, similar to how Jesus was revealed as the Son of God to the three wise men, according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nCatholics in New Orleans have a tradition of eating elaborate king cakes throughout the entire Epiphany season, like a “roscon de reyes” or “rosca de reyes,” enjoyed in Latino countries, but king cakes are enjoyed by all Mardi Gras observers whether religious or not.\n\nKing cakes can also be made from a Danish pastry with cinnamon and icing in Mardi Gras colors. Whoever finds the baby within the cake is responsible for hosting the next party and getting the next king cake, according to Almanac.\n\nShriving bell\n\nA Shrove Tuesday tradition is to repent sins in preparation for the start of Lent, marked by the ritual of ringing church bells, known as the Shriving Bell, to call everyone to confession and let people know it’s time to fry their pancakes, according to Christianity.\n\nSome churches burn the palms distributed during the previous year’s Palm Sunday liturgies to make ashes for Ash Wednesday the day after Shrove Tuesday.\n\nICYMI:Artist Jamie Wyeth's glimpse of Truman Capote at New York restaurant is tied to 'Feud'\n\nZulu coconuts\n\nParades are a major part of Mardi Gras celebrations, and if you find yourself in the crowd celebrating, chances are you’ll encounter a Zulu coconut.\n\nZulu coconuts are one of the more eye-catching items to be thrown from holiday parade floats and are painted coconuts or balls thrown or handed to people by members of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club. Zulu is one of the oldest African American krewes, with its first parade dating back to 1909, and began the tradition of throwing coconuts to members of the crowd in 1910, according to History.\n\nFlambeaux\n\nIn all the revelry, you might be wondering how people keep their wits about themselves and don’t get lost in all the fanfare. That’s where flambeaux, the flame torches lighting the way for parade-goers during nighttime Mardi Gras celebrations, come in.\n\nFlambeaux is French for “torch” and dates back to a custom established by the Comus krewe.\n\nMid-19th century towns didn’t have the same sufficient street lighting available today, so torches were needed to make up for it. The original flambeaux carriers during Mardi Gras were enslaved individuals and free men of color, who would receive coins tossed to them by crowds lining the parade route, according to History.\n\nToday, the coin-tossing tradition continues, but flambeaux has transitioned into a performance art of its own, with carriers wearing robes and dancing and performing tricks with their torches.\n\nMasks\n\nAlong with the trademark colors of Mardi Gras parade floats, elaborate masks are a signature part of the holiday fun.\n\nThe usage of masks dates back to early celebrations when masks allowed celebrants to hide their true selves, escaping societal and class expectations to let loose however they wished, according to Almanac.\n\nFried foods and rich treats\n\nGiven the fasting that follows Shrove Tuesday, there are plenty of tasty eats to go around during Mardi Gras.\n\nAside from a king cake, Mardi Gras is a time for beignets, pillow bits of fried dough dusted with powdered sugar.\n\nIn Poland, the Tuesday before Lent is called “Paczki Day” for the traditional Polish doughnuts that are puffy and jelly-filled, according to Britannica.\n\nOther delicacies you can find during Mardi Gras, according to Almanac, include:\n\nFaasenacht (also spelled “fastnacht”) among the Pennsylvania Dutch, a traditional rectangular donut with a slit in the middle.\n\nA sweet cream bun called “semla” in Sweden, where the holiday is known as “semmeldagen,” “semlans dag” or “fettisdagen.”\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Rodney Smith Jr. tweeted Monday to announce his “Mowing with Cops” tour started Wednesday in Apopka, Florida. Smith says on his website that he wants to mow at least one lawn in each state for the elderly, disabled, single parents or veterans, and he’s inviting police officers to mow with him. He had a special police-themed mower made. His website shows it’s painted black and white and has emergency lights. Smith was inspired to begin a free yard mowing service in 2015 after seeing an elderly man cutting his lawn. Individual and corporate donations have helped pay for hotel rooms and other expenses.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Scientists say the chances of a polar bear encounter have increased, with the bears arriving on shore earlier and staying on land longer. Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey found changes in sea ice habitat have coincided with evidence that polar bears’ use of land is increasing, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The bears come to land from the Beaufort Sea during the ice-melt season, the average duration of which has increased by 36 days since the late 1990s, researchers said. The bears are arriving “a little bit ahead of schedule,” said Todd Atwood, a research wildlife biologist leading the U.S. Geological Survey’s polar bear research program. Polar bears usually come to shore in mid-August, but residents have reported sightings as early as May in Kaktovik, a small town about 640 miles north of Anchorage, biologists said.\n\nArizona\n\nAjo: A humanitarian organization that provides aid to border crossers says it is opening an office to welcome visitors for a few hours on Thursday afternoons and Saturday mornings in the southern Arizona desert community of Ajo. The Ajo Samaritarans say they will first open the office in the border town Thursday to provide information about their work. The group says Ajo residents have provided water and other aid to travelers in the Sonora desert for generations. The office will be staffed from 4 to 6 p.m. Thursdays and from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturdays. Border volunteer Scott Warren, who is set to be retried in November on two felony counts of harboring migrants in the U.S. without permission, lives in the community and volunteers with the Ajo Samaritans.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A baby raccoon with a brain injury that hinders her mobility is walking again with the help of a wheelchair. Walkin’ Pets, which makes wheelchairs for animals, says the source of Vittles’ injury is unknown, but it prevented her from balancing and supporting herself. Susan Curtis is a wildlife rehabilitation specialist who helps the state’s bats and raccoons. The company says Curtis found Vittles when she was 8 weeks old. Walkin’ Pets project manager Jennifer Pratt says the wheelchair will adjust as Vittles grows. The company says Vittles can use the wheelchair to sharpen her balance and stability so she can walk on her own. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the company says it’s unlikely Vittles will make a full recovery. But early intervention sparks hope.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The city’s school board voted Tuesday to preserve but cover up a public high school mural depicting slavery and the killing of a Native American. After a public outcry, the board voted 4-3 to reverse its June vote to paint over the “Life of Washington” mural at George Washington High School. Instead, staff were directed to work out alternatives to cover the mural with panels or other materials depicting “the heroism of people of color in America” and their fight against racism and poverty, said board President Stevon Cook, who made the proposal. The cover-up will require an environmental review, and the mural will remain on display at least until then. The 1936 work painted directly on the school walls depicts the life of George Washington. Sections of the 1,600-square-foot work were intended to show the darker side of that history.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s child abuse hotline will not change its policy to accept tips via social media, email or text. The Colorado Sun reports the recommendation came from a statewide task force that determined the hotline is set up to take tips only via phone. The review occurred after an internal memo a year ago raised concerns the child welfare division was not being responsive to texts, social media messages and emails about possible abuse and neglect. Officials say an email account for submitting reports went unchecked for more than four years. Officials determined five cases of possible neglect that were undiscovered until May needed immediate attention. The task force recommended caseworkers receiving written tips should record a report via the phone line before forwarding the written information to the hotline center.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: The new president of the University of Connecticut has begun implementing a plan he hopes will double research spending in the next decade, but he warns that unfunded pension liability could hurt the school’s ability to attract and keep top researchers. Thomas Katsouleas began his tenure at the state’s flagship school Aug. 1 and spoke Wednesday at his first Board of Trustees meeting. Elevating UConn’s status as a top research institution is among his top priorities, he said. He hopes to increase the school’s research money from about $265 million to more than $500 million in federal grants and other funding within a decade. But he also warned that UConn and its medical arm, UConn Health, are handicapped by an unfunded pension liability, which is estimated at $52 million this fiscal year.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The governor has signed into law a package of bills aimed at making it easier for formerly incarcerated people to get professional licenses in some trade fields. Delaware State News reports Gov. John Carney signed three bills Monday that supporters say they hope will improve employment access by removing roadblocks for ex-convicts facing reentry challenges after prison. The bills are designed to help job-seekers obtain licenses in trade fields as plumbers, electricians and massage therapists. The bills modify the impact of criminal history on applicants’ license eligibility by allowing the massage board and electrical examining board to grant waivers for people with certain felony convictions to obtain licenses. It also prohibits the boards from considering some convictions that are more than 10 years old.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new survey from FutureBrand rates the District of Columbia as the No. 4 city in the world, WUSA-TV reports. The study examined culture, business, tourism, quality of life and value systems. It also noted tolerance and environmental friendliness. According to FutureBrand’s site, it unites global experts in strategy, design and innovation to future-proof businesses through brand experiences that drive profitable, long-term growth.\n\nFlorida\n\nKissimmee: A homeowner association says it’s against the rules for an Army veteran to fly a Puerto Rican flag outside her home. The Rolling Hills Estates HOA in Kissimmee recently told Frances Santiago that flags other than a U.S. flag, a military flag or a sports flag aren’t permitted. Santiago tells Orlando television station WFTV-TV that she and her husband, Efrain, decided to fly the flag to support protesters demanding the governor’s resignation in the U.S. territory. Three weeks later, she got a violation notice from the association in the Orlando suburb. The couple says it may be time for the HOA to revisit its rules, especially with Kissimmee’s growing Puerto Rican population. They’ve hired a lawyer and say they have no intention of lowering their flag.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Sports Illustrated is celebrating college football’s 150th season by ranking the top 10 all-time greatest mascots, putting the University of Georgia’s bulldog in first place. The magazine includes both real and costumed mascots in this week’s edition. Following Uga is the Duck at the University of Oregon, Mike the tiger at Louisiana State University, Bevo the longhorn bull at the University of Texas and Stanford University’s Tree. The University of Colorado’s 1,200-pound live buffalo named Ralphie, University of South Carolina’s costumed gamecock named Cocky, Western Kentucky University’s Big Red, Syracuse University’s orange named Otto and University of Tennessee’s bluetick coonhound named Smokey closed the list. The latest Uga is the 10th iteration of the mascot, which the magazine says has been a staple since 1956.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Supreme Court has ruled Hawaii’s constitution requires reasonable access to Hawaiian language immersion programs. Hawaii News Now reports the justices ruled the programs are a necessary component in restoring Hawaiian language and culture. The case brought by the parent of two schoolchildren on Lanai says the island’s only public school did not offer a Hawaiian language immersion program. In a 4-to-1 decision, justices ruled that access to a Hawaiian language class only a few times per week was not sufficient. The ruling says steps must be taken to build an immersion program. In a written dissent, Justice Paula Nakayama says the state should provide “as many students as possible” with access to immersion programs but disagrees that the state constitution requires it.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Forest Service says $25,000 is being used for a federal-state project in eastern Idaho to identify road-killed animals in a major wildlife migration corridor to determine collision hotspots and potential locations for wildlife crossing structures. The agency says 75% of historical migration routes for elk, bison and pronghorn have been lost in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Freemont County has many of the remaining migration routes but a high rate of wildlife-vehicle collisions. The project started earlier this summer and uses volunteers to identify dead animals on U.S. Highway 20 and State Highway 87. Officials say the information can help the Idaho Transportation Department better understand wildlife-road conflicts through the Caribou-Targhee National Forest.\n\nIllinois\n\nAlton: A marker will be placed at the site where the state’s first soybeans were planted. Officials of the Illinois State Historical Society will join Lewis and Clark Community College representatives when the marker is dedicated Aug. 23 in Alton. The Telegraph reports Dr. Benjamin Franklin Edwards traveled to San Francisco in 1849 and helped shipwreck survivors from Japan. They reportedly showed Edwards their appreciation with a gift of “Japanese peas.” Edwards returned to Alton in April 1851 and gave six of the peas to a friend, who planted them in his home garden. The U.S. Agriculture Department reports Illinois’ 2018 soybean production totaled 688 million bushels. Alton Mayor Brant Walker says commemorating the soybean planting adds a new chapter to the city’s history.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The city’s police chief says a budget proposal dedicating $1.2 million toward officer body cameras doesn’t mean they’re coming quickly. A city spending plan released Monday by Mayor Joe Hogsett includes the body camera funding boost as the police department is in the midst of a pilot program in which some officers are using such cameras from three companies. Police Chief Bryan Roach says a decision on how to proceed with the cameras for the department’s some 1,100 street officers is months away. Roach says the $1.2 million would be enough to start a body camera program but estimates that’s about half of what would be needed each year. The fatal police shooting of a man earlier this month involved Indianapolis officers without body cameras.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds held a news conference at the Iowa State Fair on Wednesday to make a special request of towns: Show the world your hometown pride for an opportunity to win a custom water tower. The “Home Town Water Tower Contest” encourages towns throughout the state to submit their own two-minute video that features a “water element” in their community. The winner of the contest will receive a new water tower complete with a one-of-a-kind design from a local artist. Video submissions will be accepted through Sept. 30. A public vote to be held Oct. 1-11 will determine the winning video. Iowans take a great deal of pride in their unique water towers. The “Ol’ Smiley” water tower in Adair has long been a roadside icon. Last year, Sioux City spent thousands painting the phrase “Home of Sioux City Sue” on their water tower.\n\nKansas\n\nRiverton: A Route 66 destination in southeast Kansas is receiving a cost-share grant from a federal preservation program that is expected to end this fall. The Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program awarded Nelson’s Old Riverton Store a $2,500 matching grant to upgrade its exterior. The Joplin Globe reports the Riverton store opened in 1925, one year before U.S. 66 was designated. Originally intended to last 10 years, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program was extended for another decade in 2009. It is set to expire in October. Bill Thomas, chairman of the Road Ahead board of directors, says supporters are working to ensure the passage of federal legislation to designate Route 66 as a National Historic Trail and to ensure the National Park Service oversees the trail.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: University of Louisville trustees have approved the school’s purchase of a financially struggling hospital under a plan that would include a $50 million state loan. UofL trustees approved the transaction at a meeting on campus Wednesday. The deal will significantly increase UofL’s footprint in the medical sector of Kentucky’s largest city. Under the deal, UofL would purchase the greater Louisville market assets of KentuckyOne Health Inc., which includes Jewish Hospital. The deal includes the promise of state support though a $50 million loan. Half of the loan would be forgivable if job retention and other conditions are met. Trustees authorized UofL President Neeli Bendapudi to negotiate and finalize the agreement.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Authorities have made an arrest in an attack on comedian Andy Dick outside a nightclub where he had performed. In a news release, New Orleans police spokesman Aaron Looney says 46-year-old David Hale was arrested early Wednesday and booked into jail on suspicion of second-degree battery and simple battery. Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office spokesman Philip Stelly said he did not know whether Hale had an attorney. Dick told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate someone punched him early Saturday, knocking him out for 15 minutes. Dick was outside the French Quarter club when he was punched. Robert Couvillion, who promoted the show, says the performer didn’t have any reason to expect to be attacked. The comedian and musician is known for his role in the 1990s NBC TV show “NewsRadio.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s wild blueberry industry could be looking at another difficult summer, as the crop is projected to remain much smaller than just a few years ago. The Pine Tree State is America’s sole commercial producer of the wild berries, which are smaller than the more ubiquitous cultivated blueberries often seen in grocery stores. Maine’s crop exceeded 100 million pounds every year from 2014 to 2016 before plummeting to 50.4 million pounds last year. Horticulturist David Yarborough, emeritus wild blueberry specialist with the University of Maine, says a cold winter and wet and cold spring are likely to blame for the lower projections. He says the total harvest might again be only about 50 million pounds. The state’s wild blueberry industry is also struggling with Canadian competition and somewhat low prices to farmers.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A teachers union is calling for fans to be donated to schools as sweltering heat pushes classroom temperatures into the triple digits, but the district says electrical infrastructure may not be equipped to handle it. The Baltimore Sun reports the union hopes to hand out 500 fans in response to a lack of functional air conditioning in city schools, some of which have none at all. But Baltimore Schools Chief Operations Officer Lynette Washington is warning against it, saying the buildings don’t have the electrical load to withstand it. The union is pushing back. President Diamonte Brown is quoted by the paper as responding: “If you’re so concerned about the electricity being overloaded, then fix it.” The paper reports the district has an almost $3 billion maintenance backlog from decades of underfunding.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: It’s a sight for sore eyes for commuters on the MBTA’s Orange Line. The first new trains in decades – six of them initially – are going into service Wednesday on the transit line, which runs from the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston to Oak Grove station in Malden. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority eventually plans to replace the entire existing Orange Line fleet with 152 new trains by 2022. The new vehicles are being built by the Chinese-owned company CRRC at a manufacturing plant in Springfield. The T says the new trains will have more spacious interiors, along with wider doors, more handrails, better lighting, and safety features including audio and visual warnings that the doors on the train are opening or closing.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Rapper Big Sean’s philanthropic foundation is hosting another weekend of events aimed at helping youth in his hometown. The 2nd annual Detroit’s On Now Weekend kicks off Saturday with the unveiling of the Sean Anderson Production Studio in the Dauch Campus Boys and Girls Club. It’s part of an effort to help Detroit children launch careers in the entertainment industry. Big Sean will host a discussion Sunday that focuses on mental health and the stigma around it in the black community. Scheduled guests include psychiatrist Jessica Clemons and sociologist and author Michael Eric Dyson. Other planned events include live performances, health screenings, apprenticeship opportunities and carnival rides, as well as free food, haircuts and braiding. The nonprofit Sean Anderson Foundation was organized in 2012.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A record number of prison inmates in the state were placed in solitary confinement last year. The Minnesota Department of Corrections placed inmates in solitary more than 8,000 times in 2018. Minnesota Public Radio News reports the number of solitary sentences has been going up steadily for the past two years. Last session, the Legislature passed a law requiring mental health screening for inmates being placed in solitary. Republican Rep. Nick Zerwas of Elk River, one of the sponsors, says he’s concerned about the numbers. In June, the Corrections Department implemented new regulations that increase the maximum time allowed in solitary from 90 days to a year. Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell says that ultimately, the department wants to provide incentives to help people get back into the general prison population.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: One of the four tests that the state’s public school students take in high school may be going away. A testing task force is recommending the state Board of Education scrap a now-required U.S. history test. Students formerly had to pass that test, plus exams in English, algebra and biology, to graduate. Now there are alternate routes to graduate, but some Mississippi students still don’t earn a diploma. Teacher groups and others who say Mississippi students take too many tests are pushing for change. The history test also counts in the grading system under which high schools and districts are assigned A-to-F grades. The recommendation will be considered next week by the state’s accreditation commission. If that group agrees, the state Board of Education would likely seek public comment before voting.\n\nMissouri\n\nChesterfield: The little girl from suburban St. Louis who became the inspiration behind the St. Louis Blues’ improbable run to the Stanley Cup championship is back in school for the first time in two years. Laila Anderson has a rare autoimmune disease that forced her to miss two school years. Until Tuesday. In a video posted by the Parkway School District, Laila says she hopes to inspire as many people as she can. She also jokes that as much as she loves her parents, “I need a break from their faces.” Laila had a bone marrow transplant in January, just as the Blues began their stunning worst-to-first turnaround. She was such a fan that the team flew her to playoff games and made her part of the victory celebration in June.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is looking to support the U.S. Forest Service in fighting off a lawsuit challenging a wildfire mitigation project. The Independent Record reports state Attorney General Tim Fox filed a request Monday to intervene in the litigation over the Ten Mile-South Helena Project. The project calls for forest thinning, logging and burning on more than 27 square miles in the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest. Helena Hunters and Anglers and the Montana Wildlife Federation filed a lawsuit earlier this year over concerns about the impact of mechanized logging on wildlife. The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Native Ecosystems Council also filed a lawsuit, contending the federal agency erred in its environmental analysis for the project. The lawsuits have been consolidated into one case.\n\nNebraska\n\nCrete: A private university in this state where pot remains broadly illegal plans to offer an online program this fall that will cover the science, cultivation, processing and regulation of marijuana and hemp. Doane University in Crete will offer the three-course program. Chemistry professor Andrea Holmes will help teach the certificate program, and she told the Omaha World-Herald that the industry is growing rapidly. She cited jobs across the country for cultivators, technicians, scientists, geneticists, administrators, salespeople, marketers and advertisers. Nebraska bars recreational and medicinal marijuana, but lawmakers cleared the way this spring for a limited number of farmers to grow hemp, a low-THC version of the cannabis plant. THC is the compound that gives marijuana its high.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled against the state in a battle with the U.S. government over its secret shipment of weapons-grade plutonium to a site near Las Vegas, but the state’s attorney general says the fight isn’t over yet. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the state’s appeal after a judge refused to block any future shipments to Nevada. The court in San Francisco said the matter is moot because the Energy Department already sent the radioactive material and has promised that no more will be hauled there. “The remedy Nevada sought – stopping the government from shipping plutonium from South Carolina to Nevada under the proposed action – is no longer available,” the court wrote. Nevada also wanted the court to order the government to remove the plutonium it shipped last year but didn’t reveal had arrived there until January.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A state survey says 24% of high school-age youth reported having used electronic cigarettes and cigars, vaping and hookah devices in a 30-day period, compared to the national average of 13%. The data is from the 2017 New Hampshire Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Tricia Tilley, the state Health Department’s deputy director for its Division of Public Health Services, says the increase puts a new generation at risk for nicotine addiction. She notes a new state law that updates the definitions of electronic smoking devices and liquids and clarifies that all tobacco-related product devices are prohibited in any public education facility or grounds.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: For two days this fall, “Sopranos” fans can immerse themselves in the world of the hit show at SopranosCon. The convention, to be Nov. 23-24 at the Meadowlands Expo in Secaucus, will be an “interactive, street festival themed fan experience,” according to the event website. In the midst of the show’s 20-year anniversary and upcoming prequel, super fans will have the chance to meet cast members and even go to an official after-party. Exhibits, screenings, Q&As with cast members, trivia and costume contests are just some of the activities on the itinerary for the event. The layout of the convention will be inspired by the Feast of St Elzear and will celebrate Italian culture in New Jersey with food, drink, art, music, comedy and some show-related businesses, according to the website.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: Some Navajo Nation officials are seeking to ask the state to rename a U.S. highway after one of the longest-serving Native American lawmakers in U.S. history. A Navajo legislative committee is requesting New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham name U.S. Highway 491 in honor of the late state Sen. John Pinto, who died in May at the age of 94 and had long sought to turn the deadly U.S. 666 into a four-lane highway and to change its name to U.S. 491. U.S. Highway 491 stretches about 194 miles from Gallup, New Mexico, through Colorado to Monticello, Utah. Pinto was a World War II Navajo code talker and served over four decades in the New Mexico Legislature.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Who’s a good dog? The American Kennel Club says there are now a million of them. The club announced Wednesday that a Bernese mountain dog named Fiona recently became its 1 millionth “canine good citizen,” including dogs past and present. Fiona and owner Nora Pavone had a special reason for pursuing the club’s mark of canine comportment: Fiona spends her days comforting people at the Pavone family’s Brooklyn funeral home. “We wanted her to have proper manners when she’s meeting with so many different people … for her to just be polite and gentle and always in control,” Pavone says. “To gently go up to someone and nudge their hand when they just need her to be next to them.” The club introduced the canine good citizen title in 1989 to promote polite doggy behavior and responsible pet ownership.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The trial is underway in a lawsuit that accuses novelist Nicholas Sparks of defaming the former headmaster of a private Christian school he founded in the state. Saul Hillel Benjamin accuses Sparks of telling Epiphany School parents, a job recruiter and others that Benjamin suffered from mental illness. The jury in the trial that began Wednesday in Raleigh will decide whether the private K-12 school in Spark’s hometown of New Bern, the author and the foundation Sparks created to support the school should pay damages. Benjamin’s lawsuit alleges that the author of “Message in a Bottle” and “The Notebook” defamed him and violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. Benjamin was in the headmaster’s position for less than five months and says he was forced out.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Traffic at the state’s eight commercial service airports is up 12% in July compared to last year. The state Aeronautics Commission says more than 110,000 people boarded planes at the airports in Bismarck, Minot, Williston, Dickinson, Grand Forks, Fargo, Devils Lake and Jamestown during the month. The Bismarck Tribune says Williston had the highest percentage increase, at nearly 27%. Year-to-date boardings for the eight airports are up more than 10%, to nearly 691,000 passengers. Travelers can reach nine nonstop destinations from North Dakota, though two are seasonal.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Amid concern about the use of facial-recognition capabilities, Ohio’s attorney general says the state database of driver’s license and law enforcement photos hasn’t been used improperly for mass surveillance or broad dragnets. Even so, Republican Attorney General Dave Yost says he’s ordering training requirements for officers who use the facial-recognition system. He’s also requiring that requests for such searches be handled by the state crime lab until those requirements are met. Concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse as federal investigators have searched such databases unbeknownst to drivers whose photos were scanned. Yost says he’ll appoint advisers to help ensure Ohio’s system is an effective law-enforcement tool that also protects people’s privacy and rights.\n\nOklahoma\n\nMedford: No injuries were reported after a 3.4 magnitude earthquake shook a sparsely populated area of northern Oklahoma. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake was recorded about 2:40 p.m. Tuesday about 8 miles south-southeast of Medford and at a depth of about 4 miles. No damage was immediately reported. Geologists say damage is unlikely in temblors below magnitude 4.0. Thousands of earthquakes in Oklahoma have been linked to underground injection of wastewater from oil and gas production. The USGS reports the number of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes is on pace to decline for the fourth straight year after state regulators began directing producers to close some wells and reduce volumes in others.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A new law curbing use of the death penalty in the state now appears to go further than supporters intended, after a recent ruling that a former death row inmate cannot be sentenced to death upon retrial. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that the state’s prosecutors are working to determine how many murder cases might be affected. Meanwhile, lawmakers behind the new law said Tuesday that they were surprised and would seek a fix as soon as possible – even asking the governor to call a one-day special session next month. In passing Senate Bill 1013 this year, lawmakers limited use of capital punishment to a narrow set of circumstances, including terrorist acts and murders of children or law enforcement officers. But officials also appeared to take pains to ensure those changes would apply to sentences moving forward.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State officials have announced plans to close two centers for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities over the next three years. The Department of Human Services says public meetings will be held next month to gather comment on the plans to close the Polk State Center in Venango County in western Pennsylvania and the White Haven State Center in northeastern Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County. The Polk center currently serves 194 residents and the White Haven center 112. Officials say the commonwealth has steadily closed most state centers since the 1960s, “when best practices turned toward community-based settings and away from institutions.” Fifty years ago, the department served more than 13,000 people with intellectual disabilities in state-operated facilities, but today fewer than 720 receive care in such facilities.\n\nRhode Island\n\nLincoln: Twin River Casino says it is feeling the competitive bite from a new resort casino in neighboring Massachusetts. Twin River said Tuesday that it could be forced to lay off up to 30 table game supervisors to reflect the loss in business. The casino in Lincoln says revenue from table games dipped 34% in July compared to the same month the prior year. July was the first full month of operation for the Wynn Resorts-owned Encore Boston Harbor casino in Everett. Twin River said the impact of the competition was greater than it had expected, and it’s exploring the possibility of voluntarily reducing hours to avoid some layoffs – and also hopes business will pick up enough after Labor Day to allow some workers to be rehired.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The mayor says affordable housing must be included in a $1billion redevelopment project near the city’s trendy downtown area. Mayor Knox White told a meeting last week that he considers affordable housing to be “non-negotiable.” Greenville’s city center is considered a model for revitalization, and officials are looking at a proposal to spend $1 billion on a redevelopment project within walking distance of the area. As many as 1,500 apartments would be built under the current plan, and White says that must include a mix of housing types. The area that’s being redeveloped doesn’t currently include housing, but it’s beside one of the city’s oldest African American communities. Rising home prices are raising concerns about what will happen to area residents.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYankton: A county commissioner has been banned from entering Yankton City Hall for a year. Yankton County Commissioner Gary Swensen was sent a letter by Yankton’s city attorney outlining the ban. KYNT-AM obtained a copy of the letter, dated Aug. 12. In the letter, City Attorney Ross Den Herder says Swensen’s recent social media posts are “perceived as threatening to City staff and its elected officials.” The Yankton Daily Press & Dakotan reports Yankton Mayor Nathan Johnson appeared before the commission last week about Swensen’s posting of a cartoon on social media. The cartoon shows a priest telling a woman who confessed to killing a politician that he is “here to listen to your sins, not your community service work.” Swensen has apologized for the cartoon.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The producers of the Hallmark Channel’s made-in-Memphis “Graceland” movies are selling off three films’ worth of props, wardrobe items, Christmas decorations and Elvis memorabilia. The sale does not signal the end of the Hallmark-Graceland relationship – in fact, more Elvis-connected feature-film romances are planned. In addition to Christmas items, the extraneous inventory includes clothes worn by actors in the three Memphis-based Hallmark Channel movies, “Christmas at Graceland” and “Wedding at Graceland,” with Kellie Pickler and Wes Brown, and the upcoming “Christmas at Graceland 2,” now officially titled “Christmas at Graceland: Home for the Holidays,” with Adrian Grenier and Kaitlin Doubleday, which finished shooting last week. The cash-only sale will take place Aug. 22-23 at 1910 Nonconnah Blvd., Suite 106.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: An archaeological dig at the Alamo to help preserve the historic Texas mission has unearthed musket balls that experts say could date to the 1800s. The San Antonio Express-News reports the survey of the mission-era west wall of the Long Barrack is meant to help determine how best to protect the oldest component of the Alamo. Crews are digging four pits to help expose the 1700s limestone wall to its foundation in an effort to fight moisture. Archaeologist Kristi Nichols says workers so far have recovered musket balls, a mid-1800s bottle and tin-glazed majolica from the Spanish colonial period. The survey began nearly a month ago. Preservation of the Alamo is part of a wider $450 million development plan for the area.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Wildlife officials say they have found and put to death a bear that bit a 13-year-old boy on his ear and cheek at a campground in eastern Utah. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources said Tuesday in a news release that officials found the black bear Friday night within a mile of the riverside campground where the incident occurred on Aug. 9 east of Moab. Wildlife officials euthanized the bear after determining it matched the size, color and tracks of the bear that attacked the boy. The boy was treated and released from the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The campground was reopened Monday. This is the second bear attack in Utah this summer. A bear was captured and killed in June after it scratched a boy camping in northern Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has launched a website that shows the results of lead testing in water at the state’s schools and child care facilities. The testing is being done at approximately 440 schools and more than 1,200 child care facilities. It’s required under a new law in which schools and child care centers also must make fixes or take outlets, such as drinking fountains, out of service if the results show lead above 4 parts per billion. Officials said Wednesday that the fixes, such as replacing fixtures, are relatively inexpensive. The state is covering the cost of the testing and up to a certain amount of the remediation. Nearly 300 child care facilities and five schools have been tested. The website shows the test results at institutions and if action has been taken.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Police say more than 50 television sets have been mysteriously placed on front porches in a neighborhood outside the city. Henrico County police Lt. Matt Pecka said residents found older model televisions outside their front doors Sunday morning. He told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that video from one doorbell camera showed a person wearing TV-shaped headgear while dropping off a TV set. Police believe more than one person is responsible. A similar incident occurred in a nearby neighborhood last year. It’s unclear if the incident is a crime. Pecka said that dropping off the televisions on front porches is “at most” illegal dumping. Most of the TVs will be recycled. But a couple of residents indicated they would keep their televisions for now.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has thwarted a rare veto by Mayor Jenny Durkan by voting for a second time to create a special fund for the city’s soda-tax revenue. The Seattle Times reports the new tax raised about $22 million last year, more than initially predicted, and the mayor and councilmembers disagree on how to spend it. When the council passed the tax in 2017, it indicated the money should be used to boost healthful-food and early-education programs serving low-income communities of color that are targeted by soda marketing. But when the mayor drew up this year’s budget, she used about $6 million from the soda tax to supplant baseline allocations for food banks, a parent-child program and other services that previously had been supported by the city’s general fund. The maneuver freed up $6 million for her other priorities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBethany: Bethany College in West Virginia is asking people who like the outdoors to volunteer to help clean up its trail system next month. Projects will include brush cleaning, trail restoration, rubbish removal and outdoor classroom repair. Volunteers should wear work clothes, preferably long pants and sturdy shoes or boots. The school will provide water, bug spray, gloves and tools. The trail system is an asset of Parkinson Forest, which was deeded to the school in 1914. The system includes a waterfall, numerous hiking spots and the outdoor classroom. The cleanup is set for Sept. 15.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: GOP lawmakers in the state found themselves in the unusual position Wednesday of breaking with anti-abortion groups and advocating for a bill that broadens birth control access, an area where Democrats typically lead. Republicans could undermine a key Democratic campaign issue by passing the bill, but they also find themselves in conflict with groups that are typically their allies. Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Family Action, a leading anti-abortion group, oppose the measure on moral and ethical grounds, saying increasing access encourages premarital sex and the odds of unintended pregnancies and abortions. Only doctors can prescribe hormonal birth control under current state law. The bill would allow pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraceptive patches and birth control pills, with some caveats.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Officials say a firework rocket that was launched during a show for the Pyrotechnics Guild International convention landed in a home and sparked a small fire. The Gillette News Record reports the rocket broke through the roof of the Gillette home about 2 miles from the event center where the fireworks display was taking place Sunday. The Campbell County Fire Department says the flames were extinguished before firefighters got to the house. No one was injured. Guild spokesman Tom Sklebar says the organization will pay for the damages. He says a rocket “took an errant trajectory” after it was launched and hit the house. The fireworks convention started last Saturday and runs through Friday. It features fireworks shows on four nights.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/15"}]}

So can it work?\n\nIf the experience of other cities around the world that have tried it is any indication, the answer appears to be yes. London, Singapore and Stockholm have all reported that “congestion pricing” systems similar to the one now being planned for Manhattan led to initial reductions in traffic and improvements in air quality, while creating a steady stream of revenue to support public transit and other infrastructure.\n\n“New York is a prime example of cities where it tends to work, which is very high density, with relatively good public transportation” or at least the skeleton of a good system, said John Rennie Short, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland Baltimore County.\n\nBut critical questions still to be resolved that could determine what the experiment ultimately looks like and whether it is successful, experts said.\n\nNew York has to work out details of the plan, which would use a network of license plate readers to bill vehicles for using surface roads anywhere in Manhattan south of Central Park. That includes the cost of the toll, which is likely to be more than $10.\n\nWill the tolls raise enough money to make the city’s strained mass transit system reliable? Is there enough alternative transportation for commuters who decide to give up their cars? How will the tolling system affect the delivery trucks, taxis and ride-hail vehicles that now comprise a big proportion of Manhattan traffic? And will so many vehicles be made exempt from the tolls that the effect on travel patterns is minimal?\n\nMitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, predicted that in the end the city might see only a modest decline in traffic, as people either absorb the cost and keep driving, or switch to services like Uber and Lyft.\n\n“We’re not going to see people abandon their cars to get into the subway,” he said.\n\nPrimarily, he said, the system is likely to benefit the public transportation system, which now has a new source of revenue for much-needed repairs and upgrades.\n\n“This is a terrific victory ... for the mass transit ridership and for New York’s capacity to respond to the crisis of its mass transit system,” he said.\n\nNew York state legislators approved a conceptual plan Monday for the tolling system, which would supplement an existing network of bridge and tunnel tolls that charge $9.50 to $15 for vehicles coming into Manhattan via seven of the 20 bridges and tunnels leading onto the island.\n\nMore:These 10 cities have the most aggressive drivers in the nation\n\nA panel will now be convened to set the toll prices — one recent proposal suggested around $12 for passenger vehicles — and create possible exemptions or credits for some drivers. That could include discounts for motorists already paying a toll to enter Manhattan. The earliest the tolls could begin is Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nOne model for the system has existed since 2003 in London, which offers evidence that the system could work — and a cautionary note for how it may need to adapt over time.\n\nInitially, London charged drivers 5 pounds, or about $6.50, to come into the central part of the city during the workweek.\n\nThe toll initially had a considerable effect. In its first year, congestion dropped 30%, buses got 6% faster and there was a 12% reduction in emissions.\n\nIn recent years, however, congestion has dramatically worsened, despite the fee rising to 11.50 pounds, about $15, per day. Officials say that was due in large part to the flood of app-based for-hire vehicles like Uber, which were initially exempt from the tolls. As a result, the city is lifting the exemption starting April 8.\n\nMore:Yep, Los Angeles has the world's worst traffic congestion — again\n\nIn Stockholm, a pilot program that was put in place with less-than-enthusiastic public support in 2006 became much more popular as people saw immediate drops in congestion and air pollution, so much so that residents voted to make it permanent in 2007. Singapore’s system has been around since the 1970s.\n\nAbout 717,000 vehicles a day enter the Manhattan zone considered for the program, a recent city study said. One estimate said a congestion pricing plan with an $11.52 toll could reduce traffic by 13 percent and raise gross revenues of $1.1 billion per year, much of which would go to support trains and buses after expenses.\n\n“Even a small reduction in traffic can have a substantial impact on the larger traffic network,” said Kate Slevin, senior vice president of state programs and advocacy at Regional Plan Association, an advocacy organization that supports the congestion toll.\n\nAsked about concerns over whether such a beleaguered transit system could even handle more riders if people decided not to drive into Manhattan, Slevin pointed out that transit officials have almost two years to take steps that will help, like redoing bus routes.\n\n“The good news is there’s going to be a couple of years before the congestion toll is turned on,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/27/nyc-congestion-pricing-tolls-approved/70362175007/", "title": "Congestion pricing in NYC hikes tolls to $23 for driving in midtown", "text": "The Federal Highway Administration has approved New York’s plan to implement a toll on driving in midtown Manhattan to combat traffic congestion, the first program of its kind in the United States.\n\nDrivers could pay up to $23 to drive through Manhattan south of 60th Street. The specific cost and implementation of the toll have yet to be finalized, but it could be put in place as early as 2024.\n\nHow the toll system will work — including the toll amounts, who will be eligible for credits and who will be exempt from the toll — will be decided by the Traffic Mobility Review Board. Once that is decided and approved by the MTA, the plan will have to receive final approval from the FHWA.\n\nThe new tolls are expected to generate another $1 billion yearly, which would be used to finance borrowing to upgrade the subway, bus and commuter rail systems operated by the MTA.\n\nPeople headed into Manhattan already pay big tolls to use many of the bridges and tunnels connecting the Hudson, East and Harlem Rivers. The special tolls for the southern half of Manhattan would come on top of those existing charges.\n\nThe New York state legislature approved the conceptual plan for congestion pricing in 2019, but the implementation has been stalled by COVID-19 and a lack of federal guidance.\n\nMore:NYC has a new plan to cut traffic. It might cost drivers an extra $23 drive into Manhattan\n\nAccording to the environmental assessment, travel speeds in Manhattan’s central business district decreased 22%, to an average of about 7 mph, between 2010 and 2019, and drivers experience about 102 hours of lost travel time per year as a result. Local bus speeds have decreased 28%.\n\nOfficials in New Jersey, where commuters to Manhatten would face daily tolls, have objected to the proposal.\n\nNew Jersey's congressional delegation, led by U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, and Gov. Phil Murphy have sent numerous letters asking the FHWA to require the MTA to conduct a full environmental impact study. Gov. Phil Murphy announced his administration was exploring legal options.\n\n\"While we are not necessarily opposed to a carefully crafted congestion pricing proposal, we are deeply disappointed by the FHWA’s limited review and skeptical of the motives of a financially ailing agency that has failed to meaningfully engage with our Administration on this issue,\" Bailey Lawrence, a Murphy spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nJanno Lieber, who heads the MTA, said the agency is taking New Jersey into consideration while working to finalize the congestion pricing plan.\n\n\"They don't ask our permission to increase tolls on the Garden State Parkway or the Jersey Turnpike — they just increase tolls on the areas they control,\" Lieber told Marcia Kramer during a June 11 interview on CBS.\n\nCities including London, Singapore, and Stockholm have implemented similar tolling programs for highly congested business districts. In London, congestion fell 30% and pollution dropped by almost a quarter the year after congestion pricing was implemented according to the Washington Post.\n\nMore:A new study reveals which US city has the worst traffic, and it's no longer Los Angeles\n\nContributing: Colleen Wilson, Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/politics-on-the-hudson/2019/04/04/congestion-pricing-new-york-what-you-need-know-new-manhattan-tolls/3364983002/", "title": "Congestion pricing in New York: What you need to know about the ...", "text": "ALBANY –Drivings entering the southern half of Manhattan will have to pay a toll under the first-in-the-nation congestion-pricing system approved Monday by New York lawmakers.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders spent two months negotiating the tolling plan, which won't launch until 2021 at the earliest.\n\nThe goal, Cuomo said, is twofold.\n\nFor one, the toll is meant to dissuade drivers from entering Midtown and Lower Manhattan's notoriously congested roadways, with the hope of encouraging them to reduce emissions by taking public transit.\n\nBut it's also a money-maker: The revenue generated from the toll will ensure the Metropolitan Transportation Authority can borrow $15 billion to revamp the city's subway system, bus lines and commuter rail.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the state's new congestion-pricing system:\n\nWhere will I have to pay a toll?\n\nThe short answer: You will pay a toll if you drive on 60th Street and all points south in Manhattan.\n\nThe toll applies to any \"roadways, bridges, tunnels, approaches or ramps\" that are within that area, which the law refers to as Manhattan's Central Business District.\n\nFor reference: 60th Street is toward the very bottom of Central Park, which ends at 59th Street.\n\nAre there any exceptions?\n\nYes.\n\nYou won't be charged a toll if you stay on FDR Drive or the West Side Highway or the Battery underpass that connects the two, according to the law.\n\nThe surface roadway portion of the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel (better known as the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel) that connects to West St. also won't be subject to the toll.\n\nEmergency vehicles and those designed to transport the disabled are also eligible for an exemption.\n\nWhen will the tolls launch?\n\nNo sooner than Dec. 31, 2020, according to the law.\n\nHow much will the toll be?\n\nWe don't know yet.\n\nThe congestion-pricing law sets up a new board — the Traffic Mobility Review Board — that will study the issue and recommend what the toll will be.\n\nThe board, which will be appointed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, has to come up with a variable pricing structure, where different tolls will be charged for peak and non-peak traveling times.\n\nIt will have five members and a chairman. One of the members will be recommended by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, another will have to live within the Metro-North Railroad coverage area and another will be from Long Island, per the law.\n\nUltimately, it will be up to the MTA board to adopt the toll recommendations. The toll has to be enough to support bonding $15 billion to support the MTA's capital plan from 2020 to 2024, according to the law.\n\nMore:How the state budget will impact your wallet, for better or worse\n\nWhen will we know what the toll will be?\n\nUnder the law, the Traffic Mobility Review Board will have to make its toll recommendation no sooner than Nov. 15, 2020 and no later than Dec. 30, 2020.\n\nYou may notice that very-specific window is immediately following Election Day 2020, when all 213 state lawmakers will be on the ballot.\n\nAsked Thursday about the fortuitous timing, Cuomo said it was coincidental.\n\n\"You cannot have a toll until you put in the electronic tolling,\" Cuomo said. \"You don't have the capital plan.\"\n\nWhat will the money go toward?\n\nImproving the often-maligned New York City transit system, including the parts of the subway system that have fallen into disrepair.\n\nThe law requires that 80% of tolls collected go toward capital projects that improve New York City's bus and subway systems.\n\nThe Metro-North Railroad will get 10% for capital projects — including but not limited to parking facilities, rolling stock, capacity enhancements and expansion — while the Long Island Rail Road will get the remaining 10%.\n\nMore:Congestion pricing gets a boost. But will bridge crossers be double tolled?\n\nMore:Hudson Valley poised to get piece of congestion-pricing revenue\n\nWill there be a bunch of toll booths in Manhattan now?\n\nNot likely.\n\nThe tolling system will be designed and implemented by MTA Bridges and Tunnels in cooperation with New York City.\n\nBut it almost certainly won't be the old-school, traditional toll booths you see on the Thruway, when you pull up and an attendant hands you a ticket.\n\nInstead, it will likely be an all-electronic, cashless tolling system, where you travel through an overhead gantry at normal speed.\n\nThen, either the driver's E-ZPass is charged or a photo of their license plate is taken and the driver is billed via mail. That would be consistent with a statewide trend, with the Thruway moving toward a cashless tolling system.\n\nWhat about bridge and tunnel tolls? Will I pay two tolls?\n\nThat's also up in the air.\n\nCuomo and lawmakers had tried to negotiate which bridges and tunnels would be exempt from the congestion-pricing tolls, but they couldn't come to an agreement.\n\nThey couldn't agree, so instead they kicked it to the Traffic Mobility Review Board, which will make a recommendation on which bridges and tunnels should be exempt.\n\nEven with exemptions, the board has to ensure that the toll will raise enough for the MTA to bond $15 billion.\n\nWhat would an exemption mean?\n\nIf you were to drive over a bridge that is ultimately made exempt, the toll you paid on the bridge would be deducted from what you owe for driving into the congestion-pricing zone.\n\nHudson Valley lawmakers, for example, want the new Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge to be exempted from congestion pricing.\n\nJCAMPBELL1@gannett.com\n\nMore:New York state budget deal reached: Everything you need to know\n\nMore:How the state budget will impact your wallet, for better or worse", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/04/07/new-york-city-congestion-pricing-subway-traffic-emissions-column/3365624002/", "title": "New York congestion pricing can inspire other cities if done right", "text": "Ali Chaudhry\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nNew York will soon become the first city in the country to implement congestion pricing. A lot is riding on its success — and not just for New York.\n\nOnce a transportation pioneer, New York City’s crumbling subway and clogged roads are reflective of our country’s infrastructure neglect. It’s symptomatic of the crisis facing other cities in the U.S. that are seeing the same cracks form in their systems, and many of those cities have no financial ability to keep their systems in a state of good repair.\n\nWhen congestion pricing kicks in at the end of 2020, drivers will pay a user fee to enter high-traffic zones in Manhattan below 60th Street. The fee will raise an estimated $1 billion annually that can be leveraged in the finance markets to bring up to $15 billion in capital to the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which runs New York City’s subway and buses. That will go a long way toward the billions needed to fix the subway.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nSelf-driving car technology can't deliver on overblown ride-sharing promises\n\nWould a Silicon Valley algorithm in a driverless car let you into a line of traffic?\n\nPoor road quality costs consumers at the pump and boosts greenhouse emissions\n\nCongestion pricing as a concept is not new. London, Singapore and Stockholm have all tried it with remarkable results that include better air quality and reduced traffic — areas where New York City desperately needs to improve.\n\nBeyond the economic impact, the gridlock on our streets has literally become a life or death situation. We all cringe when ambulances and emergency vehicles wail endlessly as they try to get through a sea of traffic. Even organ delivery services are trying to find more reliable ways to move around because of the short window of time to deliver donated organs. And that is all in addition to the need to reduce our carbon footprint to protect future generations.\n\nAnnouncements that we’ve seen about lower-emission buses are great, but the average vehicle speeds in the Midtown core of Manhattan average less than 5 mph, slightly faster than walking. There is no point in forcing the MTA to replace its older fleet of buses with costly new buses that will remain stuck in traffic and that no one will use.\n\nHow New York can set a good example\n\nFormer Mayor Michael Bloomberg first proposed congestion pricing in New York City more than a decade ago but the political appetite didn’t exist to get it done. After another decade of gridlock, increasingly deteriorating subway service and a lack of sufficient federal funding to keep the system functional, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature finally authorized it a week ago. But that’s only the first step. What comes next will be just as big a challenge.\n\nIn order to inspire congestion pricing to become more widely adopted, New York must once again lead the way in innovation and implementation. What does that mean?\n\n► Ensuring transparency and real public engagement to address concerns about how we start this new system and its impact on local communities and businesses.\n\n► Bolstering bus services and other transportation alternatives in outer boroughs that lack subway access, providing a viable alternative to driving into the new congestion pricing zone — especially for disabled travelers. We can’t penalize people for using cars when they don’t have other transit options.\n\n► Communicating clearly with street signage and GPS devices to avoid driver confusion that results in added user fees.\n\n► Ensuring the technology used to regulate tolls is non-invasive and unobtrusive on our streets and in our neighborhood. It must also interface seamlessly with existing tolling systems already in use for driving into New York City.\n\n► Guaranteeing a smooth billing process and good customer service system.\n\n► Looking at ways to offer reduced user fees for zero-emission vehicles and carpooling services.\n\n► Increasing enforcement on streets and buses to penalize motorists who block bus lanes and intersections and attempt to evade user fees.\n\nHow New York implements and administers this new system will serve either as an example to cities around the world or as a cautionary tale. As other cities increasingly look for innovative ways to fund their aging transportation networks and address climate change, New York cannot afford to get this wrong. We need to implement this system smoothly and fairly, and we need to be clear in communicating about it.\n\nIf we can make congestion pricing work here, we can make it work anywhere.\n\nAli Chaudhry is AECOM’s chief development officer in New York City and a former New York State deputy secretary for transportation.

Kathy Hochul and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy rubbed shoulders at a Regional Plan Association event where they discussed their partnership on transportation issues.\n\nThe tolling plan, which the two governors don't agree on, would charge New Jersey drivers more to enter Manhattan. It was not mentioned at the event — and Murphy is now \"closely assessing\" legal options over the decision.\n\nThe New Jersey governor called the decision \"unfair,\" \"ill-advised\" and a \"money grab,\" in a statement released Friday afternoon.\n\n\"Since Day One, I’ve stood against the disproportionate negative impacts of congestion pricing on New Jerseyans – a greater financial burden on New Jersey commuters, double tolling, toll shopping, a lack of revenue for NJ Transit, outsized environmental burdens on certain North Jersey communities, and financial impacts on the Port Authority’s capital budget,\" Murphy's statement read.\n\n\"As a conceptual matter, I support congestion pricing, but it must be structured in a way that is fair to all sides. UntiI New York’s congestion pricing plan is fixed, I will keep working closely with partners from both states and both sides of the aisle, including Congressman (Josh) Gottheimer and our congressional delegation, to halt implementation of this misguided tolling plan. Our administration is closely assessing all legal options.”\n\nMurphy has in the past threatened to veto Port Authority of New York and New Jersey minutes over the matter.\n\nThe FHWA’s decision about the plan — which could charge drivers as much as $23 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street — was announced about four months after a decision was expected.\n\nThis will be the first congestion pricing program in the country, following other countries, like Singapore and Sweden.\n\n\"Congestion pricing is a generational opportunity to make it easier for people to get around in, and get to, the Central Business District, by reducing traffic and funding improvements to the public transit system,\" said John J. McCarthy, the MTA's chief of external relations. \"To do it right, environmental equity has been an integral component. We are grateful that the FHWA has acknowledged the Project Sponsors’ efforts to date and has found the document has met the standards for legal sufficiency.\"\n\nEarlier this week, seven members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation penned a letter to Hochul calling on her to cancel the plan. They urged her to “come to the table with Gov. Phil Murphy and NJ Transit to develop new plans to reinvest in affordable public transit options in our region.”\n\nGottheimer, the most vocal New Jersey elected official against the plan, told reporters on a call Friday afternoon he found the decision “completely outrageous.”\n\n“For folks who are struggling to make ends meet, this is a devastating blow,” he said. “Every single nickel that the MTA will literally pilfer at the pockets of Jersey families will go to the MTA.”\n\nThe seven members of Congress argue that New Jersey commuters who go into Manhattan already contribute a great number of dollars to New York’s economy through income tax and hefty tolls on the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and George Washington Bridge, crossings operated by a bistate agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nThe MTA would use the money generated from the tolling program to fund its capital plan to improve subways and buses, while also reducing pollution and congestion in the most trafficked part of the region. Last year, the agency released a 4,000-page environmental assessment that provided seven scenarios outlining different ways to charge vehicles and weighing whether some vehicles should be credited, like buses or those that use crossings that already have tolls, like the Lincoln and Holland tunnels.\n\nAmong the reasons New Jerseyans have taken issue with this is because they were largely kept out of the agency’s planning for the toll program and because none of the money would be used to improve New Jersey’s public transportation network, which could see more riders if people choose to avoid the extra toll.\n\nLast year, Murphy called on the U.S. Department of Transportation to require the agency to do a more thorough environmental review and slow down the approval process for the plan.\n\nMurphy has also noted in the past that the tolling program could have severe consequences without capacity improvements at New York Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main portals for the vast majority of New Jersey commuters who already use public transportation to get to Manhattan. Improvement plans are underway at both facilities, but years away from completion.\n\nThe FHWA, in its letter to the MTA, said its environmental review “mitigates the adverse effects from the preferred alternative” and must allow 30 days for public review. After that, a toll board will be assembled – which does not include representatives from New Jersey – that will decide how the tolling program will work, what vehicles and crossings (if any) get credited or exempt, and when the program would go into effect.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2024/07/12/venice-tourist-tax-hike-2025/74384859007/", "title": "Venice renews tourist tax system for 2025, hikes price", "text": "Crispian Balmer\n\nReuters\n\nAI-assisted summary Venice's experimental payment system for tourists had a limited impact on reducing crowds.\n\nThe pilot scheme, which has been watched closely by other European tourist hotspots, covered just 29 days and will end on Sunday.\n\nThe city council is looking to discourage daytrippers, especially during weekends and holidays when visitors can top 100,000 - double the number of local residents.\n\nROME − Venice's experimental payment system for tourists only had a limited impact on reducing crowds in the lagoon city, meaning prices will almost certainly be hiked next year, a politician who led the project said on Friday.\n\nIn a world first, the famed Italian destination introduced a 5 euro (about $5.45) charge in April for daytrippers arriving on particularly congested days, hoping the levy would deter some people from visiting.\n\nThe pilot scheme, which has been watched closely by other European tourist hotspots, covered just 29 days and will end on Sunday, opening the way for a period of consultation to decide how to proceed with the project in future.\n\nSimone Venturini, the city councilor responsible for tourism and social cohesion, said the initial assessment was positive and confirmed the system would be renewed in 2025 but acknowledged that there were still large crowds.\n\nDestinations behind a paywall?What to know about the increasing tourist fees worldwide.\n\nEnjoy your worry-free vacation: Best travel insurance policies\n\n\"On some weekends there were less people than the same time last year ... but no one expected that all the day trippers would miraculously disappear,\" he told Reuters, speaking by telephone from Venice.\n\n\"It will be more effective in the coming years when we increase the number of days and lift the price,\" he added, without saying how much visitors might have to pay in 2025.\n\nThe city council is looking to discourage daytrippers, especially during weekends and holidays when visitors can top 100,000 - double the number of local residents.

Andrew Cuomo and top lawmakers have spent this week locked in behind-the-scenes talks over how the state will spend more than $160 billion for the new fiscal year, which begins April 1.\n\nBut like every year, it's not just about dollars and cents.\n\nLawmakers and Cuomo are debating a series of policy issues as part of the talks, which has complicated negotiations as they struggle to reach a deal ahead of Saturday's budget deadline.\n\n\"These are very complex issues that we're working through, and we're working through all of them simultaneously,\" Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nMore:Cuomo's budget: 10 facts and figures\n\nSen. Rich Funke, R-Perinton, Monroe County, said lawmakers would \"like to get a deal this week.\"\n\n\"If it was just about dollars and cents, we probably would have had a deal yesterday,\" he said.\n\nHere's a look at 10 issues wrapped up in budget talks:\n\nPay raise\n\nIt's a regular debate at the Capitol: Should state lawmakers and agency commissioners get their first raise since 1999?\n\nIt's looking like they may get an opportunity this year — as long as the budget is on time.\n\nCuomo said he would support a raise for lawmakers and commissioners if the budget is approved before Sunday.\n\nState lawmakers receive a base salary of $79,500, though most receive extra stipends worth anywhere from a few thousand dollars to $41,500.\n\nAgency commissioners, meanwhile, receive between $90,800 and $136,000 by law.\n\nCuomo and lawmakers are talking about approving an independent commission that would be able to approve a pay hike. One already exists, but it's not required to meet again until 2019.\n\n\"I desperately need a pay raise for the employees in the executive chamber, the executive agencies to be competitive,\" Cuomo said. \"We're trying to get quality people into state government and frankly, we are wholly non-competitive.\"\n\nSchool aid\n\nCuomo and lawmakers appeared to closing in on an agreement to bump up funding for education by nearly $1 billion, which would push the total to nearly $27 billion for the coming fiscal year.\n\nMore:Funding for New York schools: What to know this year\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, wants districts to be required to disclose more about how they spend the money.\n\nSpecifically, he's looking for districts to show how much they put toward each individual school — which would have the largest impact in the massive New York City school district.\n\nUber/Lyft fee\n\nSenate Republicans appear to have beaten back a $1 per ride surcharge on ride-hailing services in upstate, but a $2.75 fee is expected for parts of Manhattan.\n\nAssembly Democrats had proposed adding a $1 surcharge on Uber and Lyft rides outside New York City to fund upstate public-transit systems.\n\nMore:Higher tax for Uber, Lyft trips could be on the way\n\n\"We’ve had no discussions in our conference about taxing Uber upstate. That was rejected early on by all of us upstate,\" Funke said.\n\nA $2.75 fee on rides from Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services appears likely for much of Manhattan as a way to boost funding for the city's troubled subway system.\n\n\"We're talking about congestion pricing and taking first steps toward congestion pricing and we're talking about long-term revenue streams for the subway,\" Cuomo said.\n\nHe continued: \"A for-hire vehicle charge would be a step in that direction.\"\n\nSexual harassment\n\nCuomo and lawmakers are facing pressure to bolster the state's sexual-harassment laws in response to the national #MeToo movement and several scandals within the state Capitol itself.\n\nBut Cuomo and legislative leaders have faced criticism for how the policies are being negotiated: Behind closed doors by four men, including Cuomo, Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, R-Suffolk County; Senate Independent Democratic Committee Leader Jeff Klein, D-Bronx; and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx.\n\nMore:Four men, including one accused of forcible kissing, negotiating NY's harassment policies\n\nCuomo, meanwhile, said the policies are being hammered out by a working group that includes his top aide, Melissa DeRosa, and Senate Democrats' top counsel, Shontell Smith.\n\nSenate Democrats, however, say that's not right: They say they've only received briefings on what's been negotiated and their leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Yonkers, hasn't been in the talks.\n\nCasino bailout\n\nThe owners of del Lago Resort and Casino in Seneca County and the Rivers Casino & Resort in Schenectady are struggling to meet their revenue projections and are looking for a bailout from the state.\n\nCuomo, however, says he's not interested.\n\n\"They’re private concerns and I don’t want to get into the business of bailing out private concerns,\" he said.\n\nMore:Del Lago casino, struggling with revenue, seeks state bailout\n\nDel Lago's owners, including Rochester developer Thomas Wilmot, say they will continue to push.\n\nTaxes and fees\n\nCuomo says he's still pushing for a provision that would allow businesses to opt in to administer a payroll tax rather than a state income tax.\n\nThat move, Cuomo believes, would help residents avoid hitting the new $10,000 federal cap on state and local tax deductions. Businesses have been skeptical, however.\n\n\"We're trying to change the state tax code to avoid the federal assault on New York, which requires us to change our tax code from an income tax to a payroll tax,\" Cuomo said.\n\nMore:From income taxes to payroll taxes: What to know about Cuomo's plan\n\nSenate Republicans, meanwhile, say they will oppose hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes and fees that Cuomo originally proposed to close a $4 billion budget gap.\n\nThat includes measures that would broaden the state's sales tax on online marketplace purchases and tax opioid manufacturers.\n\n\"If you think that we have a revenue problem in New York state, you are sadly mistaken,\" Sen. Terrence Murphy, R-Yorktown, Westchester County, said. \"We have a massive spending problem.\"\n\nElection reform\n\nCuomo and Assembly Democrats have pushed a variety of reforms that they believe would make it easier to vote.\n\nThat includes early voting, which would allow voters to cast their ballot prior to Election Day.\n\nIt's not clear, however, whether any voting reforms will make it through into the final budget.\n\n\"We don't have a total agreement and until you have a total agreement, anything is possible,\" Cuomo said of budget talks.\n\nBail reform\n\nCuomo had pushed for ending cash bail for misdemeanors and some felonies, arguing that it unfairly keeps low-income people behind bars while they await trial.\n\nThe issue, however, appears to have fallen out of budget talks.\n\nIt could be revisited before June, before the Legislature ends its annual session.\n\n“Bail reform will be dealt with outside of the budget, I think,” Flanagan told reporters Tuesday.\n\nChild Victims Act\n\nIt's a similar story with the Child Victims Act, a proposal to extend the state's statute of limitations for sexual crimes in which a child is the victim.\n\nSenate Republicans and the Catholic Church have raised concern about a key provision in the bill that would open up a one-year window for previous victims of child sexual assault to bring claims.\n\nThe measure is not expected to be in the final budget.\n\nEarly deadline\n\nTechnically speaking, Cuomo and lawmakers need to approve a budget by Sunday to have an on-time spending plan.\n\nBut the practical deadline is actually Friday afternoon.\n\nGood Friday and the beginning of Passover fall on Friday, followed by Easter on Sunday.\n\n\"That is a complication,\" Cuomo said. \"The calendar is a little shorter, but I'm still cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nIf a budget deal isn't reached before Friday, lawmakers would likely approve a short-term extension of the state's current budget to avoid a state shutdown.\n\nIncludes reporting by Albany Bureau Chief Joseph Spector.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2019/07/05/paid-parking-returns-to-downtown-sarasota/4755421007/", "title": "Paid parking returns to downtown Sarasota", "text": "James Bennett III\n\njbennett@heraldtribune.com\n\nSARASOTA — The newly installed parking meters on Main Street quickly caught the attention of downtown patrons.\n\nChip Beeman, owner of Main Bar Sandwich Shop and Pastry Art Bakery Cafe, both on Main Street, said customers immediately had questions when they saw city workers installing the pay stations last week.\n\n“I had several customers come in and ask, ‘Am I supposed to be putting money in the meters?’” Beeman said, adding that workers came by shortly after to install signs that said the meters wouldn’t be activated until “after July 8th.” “Now, I’m hearing customers coming in and going, ‘This can’t be happening. I’m not liking it.’”\n\nThe decision to install meters, along Main Street, Palm Avenue, and Ringling Boulevard — near the Sarasota County Historic Courthouse and Judge Lynn N. Silvertooth Judicial Center — was made on Nov. 5, 2018, by the Sarasota City Commission. The board cited congestion and a $633,912 parking division deficit as the motivation to again paid parking.\n\nMark Lyons, Sarasota’s parking manager, said that the July 8 start would be more of a test period and would be isolated in the Judicial District. If all goes according to plan, the paid parking would go into effect the following week.\n\nLyons also said that enforcement of the paid parking would be light in the beginning to help patrons transition to the new program smoothly. Lyons added that there will also be a one-time ticket waiver; people who have forgotten or overlooked the paid parking will have their first citation waived, provided they’re able to produce receipts showing that they spent at least $25 at a downtown business. The new paid parking program will give customers their first 10 minutes for free, but they still have to enter their information at one of the pay stations or on the ParkMobile app.\n\nOf the approximately 4,000 parking spaces in downtown Sarasota, about 89% are still free to park, the city estimates. However, the most desirable parking spaces will have meters.\n\n“In the west side of (U.S.) 301, in the downtown area, it’ll be (enforced) Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Those will be hard times,” Lyons said, while in the Judicial District, aligning with the business schedule, “it will operate Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.”\n\nThe anticipated price for parking is $1.50 for an hour, but patrons won’t have to pay for the full hour if they don’t plan on staying parked for that long. The meters will accept cash or card and patrons will also be able to pay for their parking through a mobile phone application called ParkMobile. Once the user has registered their license plate number in the app, they will be able to receive notifications when their time is close to running out and pay for more time remotely.\n\nThere will be 43 pay stations, including the First Street parking lot, which will cost $1 an hour, and about 35 new pole-mounted meters scattered about the end of Main Street and on Palm Avenue. This will be the first time the city has attempted to use meters along Main Street since launching a program in the spring of 2011. The meters took a three-month hiatus when local merchants complained that the paid parking was hurting their businesses, but were brought back in October 2011 for tourist season. They were uninstalled the following year.\n\nThat wasn’t the city’s first rocky bout with paid parking. A similar scenario unfolded in the 1940s after meters were first proposed in 1937. A paid parking program in 1942 was aborted after a mere six months, but meters were back on the streets four years later.\n\nDowntown disagreements\n\nA Frequently Asked Questions page about the paid parking program starting last week says that downtown merchants will benefit because the parking meters will create a higher turnover rate in parked cars, thus creating more foot traffic and opportunities for businesses to make money. The page also maintains that revenue could be redirected back to affected businesses, after covering expenses, to pay for improvements to storefronts or streetscapes, wayfinding systems, micro-transit or trolley programs.\n\n“When they did the meters the last time I wasn’t here, but the prior owner told me that he had up to 30% losses,” Beeman said. “I think that if you create a negative for customers, and what I mean by negative is a hassle for them to park, that they will find another place to go.”\n\nBeeman added that his team is trying to remain positive and supports the paid parking program in Sarasota garages. “I think that it’s one of the best things that they’ve done,” Beeman said.\n\nCity garages, such as the ones on Palm Avenue and State Street, reduced the amount of free parking from three hours to two hours in November, on the same day the City Commission voted to bring back paid parking in downtown Sarasota.\n\nRon Soto, third-generation owner of Soto’s Optical Boutique at 1383 Main Street, says that he’s expecting the meters to generate more business, rather than diminish it. During the city’s last attempt to implement paid parking, he said, his business had an uptick in customers. Soto partially attributes the increased business to his ability to accommodate confused or inconvenienced customers. He placed a sign in his window that advertised the shop would help people deal with the inadequate meters and had a bowl of quarters ready for people who needed to break a dollar. Soto got the idea from his father, who did the same thing in the late ’60s and early ’70s.\n\nBoth Soto and Beeman agreed on one thing, though. “Destination shops” that sell things like carpets or glasses will likely benefit from steadily moving traffic, while merchants selling cheaper goods for frequent visitors are likely going to be hurt by the paid parking.\n\n“So currently, a cup of coffee is $2, right? People come here and they sit here and they drink that $2 cup of coffee. I don’t make a lot of money on it. But yet they sit here and drink that,” Beeman said. “And that cup of coffee is going to cost them another dollar and 50 cents. That cup of coffee went from $2 to $3.50.”\n\nBeeman’s sentiment was mirrored by Jerome Guet, a manager at C’est La Vie, 1553 Main Street. He looked back to the confusion on inconvenience his customers faced last time. “Sometimes, if they can’t park or can’t find a spot, they go somewhere else,” Guet said. “Last time, we were down like 10-20%, so hopefully it doesn’t affect us the same way.”\n\nAnish Patel, owner of Patellini’s Pizza at 1429 Main Street, said that he isn’t in a position to question the city. “I think they’re the ones that have knowledge of the issue so I abide by their decision,” Patel said. The last time there was paid parking on Main Street, he added, Patellini’s would “feed the meter” from time to time to keep a spot for delivery drivers.\n\nA fresh approach\n\nOne of the main reasons downtown merchants think the past meters failed was how inconvenient they were to use. Some said that the software may have been buggy, while others said that the meters were difficult to read.\n\nLyons said choosing new pay stations was an important issue for the parking department. He explained that after interviewing leading international pay station companies, the top three candidates delivered demonstration products to be tested in St. Armands for a month. During that testing period, patrons were surveyed on which ones they liked best. The surveys were conducted both day and night and with different weather. Eighty percent of the surveyed population agreed on one pay station, which is now being used at the St. Armands garage and will also be used in downtown Sarasota.\n\n“As I like to say, they’re as easy to use as an ATM,” said Lyons, adding that the city of Chicago recently bought 4,000 of the same machines.\n\nJack Bennington, an owner of Bennington Tobacconist and president of Bennington incorporated, said the city has done a good job with the paid parking program on St. Armands.\n\n“What I discovered was that a lot of the parking was taken up by employees and owners,” Bennington said, adding that he used to look out and see all of the parking spaces filled but wondered where all of the customers were. “It takes time for people to get used to things, but then it becomes second nature.”\n\nIn approximately four months, the St. Armands parking meters have generated $287,541 for the parking department, noted Sarasota city spokesman Jason Bartolone.\n\nLyons added that this attempt at paid parking stands out from previous attempts because the committee took time to thoroughly analyze the equipment and the reasons for implementing it. He added that there will be a new communication platform as well.\n\n“I think it’s going to be good. I think we understand how to function and how to communicate with the merchants, if there’s something we need to look at modifying will do it quickly,” said Lyons. “We’re just taking a holistic approach to trying to make this work this time in a different way. And, you know, while we might not please everybody, I think we’re going to get the sweet spot; I hope.”\n\nTimeline of paid parking in Sarasota • December 1937 — Parking meters that charge 5 cents for one hour of parking are considered by the city. Mayor E.A. Smith leaves the decision to public opinion. The merchants association opposes the plan and it is dropped. • March 1941 — The City Commission votes in favor of the immediate installation of parking meters as a cure to traffic congestion problems. Five cents grants one hour of parking. The installation is put off until January 1942 and fails after a six-month trial. • September 1946 — Due to “congested traffic,” the City Commission declares a parking ordinance on Main Street, Orange Avenue, Central Avenue, Pineapple Avenue, Sixth Street, Seventh Street, Palm Avenue and Lemon Avenue. Parking meters are installed and the meters take nickels and pennies. • April 1967 — Between 500 and 600 meters are removed downtown. Some merchants expect an immediate sales boost; others say it will take a while to determine if the removal benefits business. The final meters are done away with in the late ’70s. • December 2010 — The Palm Avenue garage opens to the public. • May 2011 — The city installs pole-mounted parking meters in downtown Sarasota. The meters are put on hiatus over the summer, then returned to service in October. • March 2012 — The paid parking program is terminated after business owners press the city, citing decreased sales. • July 2015 — The State Street garage opens. • November 2018 — The Sarasota City Commission votes to reinstall parking meters in downtown Sarasota and to reduce free parking in city garages from three hours to two. • February 2019 — Paid parking is enacted in St. Armands Circle. • July 2019 — Paid parking returns to downtown Sarasota.\n\nTimeline of paid parking in Sarasota", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/11/hochul-congestion-pricing-nyc-traffic-climate-change/74019302007/", "title": "New York City congestion pricing plan was good. Hochul is off base", "text": "One of the many reasons I decided to move to New York City was to avoid driving. Sometimes I miss it; most of the time, I don’t. I’m not alone: The majority of people in New York City do not own cars.\n\nNonetheless, 700,000 vehicles enter the city’s business district in Manhattan daily.\n\nAt the end of June, the city was supposed to implement a congestion pricing plan to charge commuters $15 a day to drive into the area below 60th Street. It was a decision mandated by state law in 2019. Last week, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul put an indefinite pause on that plan, citing the economy.\n\n“Circumstances have changed and we must respond to the facts on the ground – not from the rhetoric from five years ago,” Hochul said.\n\nUnfortunately, the project’s pause is a mistake, and will create more headaches the longer it’s stalled.\n\nHochul's lack of courage is just another example of the Democratic Party refusing to implement progressive policies. She's pausing the program in favor of appeasing drivers, some of whom don't even live in her state, and it's disappointing for those of us who want to see actual changes before it's too late.\n\nGOP votes against birth control:Republicans want to control women so much they voted against protecting contraception\n\nDriving in New York City means lots of cars, lots of congestion\n\nThere are nearly 1 million people who commute to New York City from the Hudson Valley, Long Island and other parts of the state every day. An additional 1.6 million people go to work across boroughs.\n\nCongestion pricing would have encouraged more carpooling and public transit usage and cut down on the number of cars in Manhattan on a daily basis.\n\nFor some people, the switch would have been more difficult: Transit options vary wildly even between boroughs, with fewer subway lines in Queens and the Bronx; Staten Island only has one rail option.\n\nOn the other hand, the New York subway system is one of the largest in the world with about 470 stations.\n\nThere are also plenty of transit options for folks coming in from other areas. There’s the Long Island Rail Road, the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) train, the Metro-North Railroad, 14 Amtrak routes and at least three major commercial bus systems in the surrounding area.\n\nI’m aware that many people don’t have a choice in whether or not to commute; it’s one reason I feel strongly about the need for a robust public transit system. It’s also not true that driving is the only way to commute into the city. The problem is that these systems need money to be improved upon – something that, long term, could have been generated by congestion pricing.\n\nThe cost of lost cash\n\nCongestion pricing was also going to benefit the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) by bringing in at least $1 billion in revenue annually.\n\nThat money was supposed to pay for the extension of a subway line, a project that would add subway stations, new electric buses, and renovations to multiple stations to make them compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nAs Trump's guilty verdict sinks in,why are Republicans still supporting a convicted felon?\n\nThis is money that the MTA desperately needs. After her decision, Hochul initially pushed for a tax hike behind closed doors. State lawmakers rejected the idea but are now looking at providing $1 billion to the MTA, without saying where the money would come from.\n\nSeems like something that could have been generated with a new toll – oh wait, that was the original plan.\n\nAir quality, climate change action take a back seat\n\nThe financial losses aren’t the only way New Yorkers are worse off without congestion pricing. Fewer cars on the road would have had impacts on pollution in the city.\n\nThe plan was supposed to mean an estimated 120,000 fewer cars on the road, which in turn would improve air quality in three boroughs.\n\nNew York City planned to reduce greenhouse emissions 85% by 2050. Congestion pricing would have helped us achieve that goal. As a young person, I find it disappointing that people in power are yet again putting climate change on the backburner in the hopes of scoring political points.\n\nCongestion pricing isn’t perfect; there’s a reason multiple lawsuits were filed to stop its implementation. Even so, it would have huge benefits for the city, and would bring us up to speed with cities like London, Stockholm and Singapore.\n\nThe plan to push it off indefinitely will only delay something that must happen for us to take control of the climate crisis and improve our transit systems.

Yet on average, each vehicle is used only 4% of the time,\" he writes. \"This is massively inefficient, not only because it’s a waste of money, but also because the majority of our cities’ land has been paved over with infrastructure built for parked or slow-moving cars.\"\n\nLyft is in a battle against market giant Uber for dominance of the U.S. ride-hailing market. Both companies are pitching younger consumers on both the cost effective and moral imperative of group travel, Lyft with Lyft Line and Uber with UberPool.\n\nZimmer says that about a third of all Lyft rides are booked with Lyft Line, and that jumps to 50% in urban centers such as San Francisco.\n\nNot only does traffic cost money in the former of repeated gas fill-ups, but it also cuts into family time and work productivity. Americans spend 5.5 billion hours in traffic each year, costing families more than $120 billion in extra fuel and lost time, according to a 2014 White House report.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump targeted the nation's crumbling infrastructure during his campaign, and has vowed to allocate government funds to rebuild roads and bridges.\n\nWhile Zimmer applauds the notion of fixing existing arteries, his take is that we should not add new lanes and highways but rather rethink the way our roads are deployed during high traffic times. Specifically, Zimmer suggests adopting a system of \"smart lanes\" that incentivize drivers to travel in groups.\n\nThese are similar to existing carpool lanes, except that they'd charge non car-poolers a fee during prime-time traffic.\n\n\"The solution involves a simple three step process,\" Zimmer writes in the post.\n\nLyft will be first to get breakthrough Chevrolet Bolt EV\n\nFirst, \"based on local traffic data across the country, city and regional governments should classify specific streets and highways as smart lanes.\n\n\"Next, a federal infrastructure fund should be created to provide grants to those cities and states that establish eligible smart lane infrastructure sufficient to eliminate traffic.\n\n\"Last, the recipients should re-invest all funds generated by these smart lanes back into hard infrastructure like roads and bridges, creating jobs, as well as into public transit, using the smart lanes to give buses faster travel times and further increase accessibility.\"\n\nZimmer notes that smart lanes would generate revenue from those not carpooling during rush hour, and then return to being non-fee lanes in off-peak hours.\n\n\"The smart lanes will be 100 percent free for any vehicle with three or more people and have a market-based price for vehicles with fewer than three people,\" he writes. \"This gives consumers a choice in how to move around more efficiently.”\n\nThe idea of charging motorists for what once was considered the presumed right to commute to urban centers has already gathered steam.\n\nCities such as London, Singapore and Milan — whose inner-city congestion is legend — already employ systems that asses fees to drivers who venture into downtown areas in private cars.\n\nLondon's Congestion Charge of $13 is in effect from 7 am until 6 p.m. A similar approach taken by Stockholm saw traffic decrease in the Swedish city by 22%.\n\n\"Logan and I have been together for 10 years, and we’ve been obsessed with same themes,\" says Zimmer, whose first company ZimRides, helped college students connect with riders traveling to the same destinations. \"We’ll continue to push for change, and we think we can have a big impact at Lyft, but also takes collective action and policy.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/17"}]}

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CBS News this month there is likely to be \"one hell of a fight\" between Obama and congressional Republicans this year over Gitmo. \"Rather than closing Guantanamo Bay, he should be filling up the place because terrorism is on the march,\" he said.\n\nDetainees transferred this week to Kazakhstan were captured in Pakistan and turned over to the United States because of suspected ties to the al-Qaeda terrorist group. They were regarded as enemy combatants, accused of working with terrorists in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led invasion following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThree of the detainees identified by the Department of Defense are from Yemen: Asim Thabit Abdullah Al-Khalaqi, Muhammad Ali Husayn Khanayna, and Sabri Muhammad Ibrahim Al Qurashi. Each has been held at Gimto for more than 12 years.\n\nThe other two are from Tunisia: Adel Al-Hakeemy, and Abdullah Bin Ali Al-Lufti, who had been held for more than 12 years and 11 years, respectively.\n\nThe men range in age from the mid-30s to the late 40s, and used many aliases. They provided varying levels of intelligence about al Qaeda personnel and operations, according to Defense Department documents released by WikiLeaks. In some cases, officials said they provided inaccurate information, or did not appear to know much about terrorist operations.\n\nNone of the five detainees were ever tried.\n\nOne man — Asim Thahit Abdullah al-Khalaqi — was born in Saudi Arabia, but denied citizenship there because his father was Yemeni, according to documents.\n\nThe report said that \"John Walker Lindh, an American currently serving 20 years in prison for supplying services to the Taliban and carrying a weapon on the Taliban front lines, stated detainee traveled with his group to the front lines.\"\n\nInformation about the detainees was also obtained through interviews with Abu Zubaydah, an al-Qaeda operative who was subjected to harsh interrogation techniques by CIA operatives after his capture. Those techniques, which a Senate Intelligence Committee report released in December said were extreme, have been called torture by President Obama.\n\nFor example, Zubaydah said Khalaqi fought with al-Qaeda \"in the final days before the Taliban fell in Afghanistan,\" according to a Defense Department report.\n\nKhalaqi, the military documents show, was recommended for transfer from Guantanamo on Jan. 1, 2007.\n\nOne of the Tunisian transfers, Adel Al-Hakeemy, was accused of being a military adviser to 9/11 leader Osama bin Laden, and battled U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan, according to a document posted on WikiLeaks.\n\nAlka Pradhan, an attorney for Al-Hakeemy, said many of the leaked defense documents are filled with mis-information, and that her client \"never met Osama bin Laden, he never knew Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nInstead, Pradhan said, Al-Hakeemy was a chef who lived in Italy, went to Pakistan to find a wife, married into a big family, and later got caught up in a government security sweep. \"The Arabs were turned over by the Pakistanis,\" said Pradhan, counsel for a group called Reprieve US, which deals with Gitmo and death penalty cases.\n\nAnother Tunisian, Abdullah Bin Ali Al-Lufti, has had a variety of health problems, according to documents, including kidney stones, depression, high blood pressure, and possible tuberculosis.\n\nThe fact that the five detainees hailed from Tunisia, and Yemen complicated their transfers.\n\nThe United States has been unwilling to send Yemenis back to their home country because they could join militant activities there. Detainees have not been sent to Tunisia because of concern about possible persecution in that country.\n\nGreg McConnell, an attorney who represented Sabri Muhammad Ibrahim Al Qurashi, said the government cleared his client for removal in 2009, but \"there was no easy transfer\" for him because of government instability in Yemen.\n\nThe reluctance of many countries to take prisoners at Gitmo is one of the reasons the prison has remained open, despite Obama's pledge to close it as early as 2010. The administration has also faced opposition from lawmakers who objected to plans to move detainees to the United States.\n\nAs part of a stepped-up effort in 2014, the administration has transferred detainees to Afghanistan, Uruguay, Slovakia, Georgia, Algeria, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nA special task force reviewed all five of the men being sent to Kazakhstan, said the Pentagon statement.\n\n\"As a result of that review, which examined a number of factors, including security issues, these men were unanimously approved for transfer by the six departments and agencies comprising the task force,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/politics/guantanamo-detainee-saudi-arabia/index.html", "title": "Guantanamo detainee to be transferred to mental health facility in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US government is set to transfer a detainee from the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba who authorities once alleged was an al-Qaeda operative who planned to be the “20th hijacker” on 9/11 but failed to board United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in rural Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter his capture nearly two decades ago, Mohammed al-Qahtani was imprisoned, tortured by the US government and – when charges against him were dropped in 2008 – left to languish behind bars.\n\nCNN previously reported that al-Qahtani’s lawyers said he is severely mentally ill, battling schizophrenia, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his torture. They have waged a protracted legal battle for al-Qahtani’s repatriation to Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn Friday, the Periodic Review Board, a government entity established during the Obama administration to determine whether detainees at the facility were guilty, recommended repatriating al-Qahtani to a mental health facility in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe board “determined that continued law of war detention of the detainee is no longer necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States,” according to public documents.\n\nThe board said in a filing posted on its website that it “recognizes the detainee presents some level of threat in light of his past activities and associations,” but the board believes “the threat the detainee presents can be adequately mitigated.”\n\n“The Board understood that Saudi Arabia can provide comprehensive mental health care, and the Board noted Saudi Arabia’s ability to monitor the detainee after completion of the rehabilitation program. Also, the Board considered the detainee’s significantly compromised mental health condition and available family support,” the final determination report said.\n\nThe board recommended certain conditions of al-Qahtani’s repatriation to Saudi Arabia, such as a “comprehensive set of security measures including monitoring and travel restrictions.”\n\nThe New York Times first reported the board’s recommendation.\n\nAl-Qahatani’s attorneys, Shayana Kadidal and Luna Martinez with the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement, “He belongs in a psychiatric facility in his home country of Saudi Arabia, not in a prison.”\n\n“Despite the severity of his illness, Mohammed has never posed a risk to anyone but himself. In recent years the voices in his head have increasingly told him to harm himself—by doing things like swallowing broken glass and not disclosing it to his doctors—making his transfer out of Guantánamo an urgent matter,” they said. “We are hopeful that Mohammed’s torment will be lessened when he is in the care of trusted psychiatrists who speak his native language, far from the scene of his torture, and where he can receive vital support from his family.”\n\nCNN reported last month that at least five other detainees who were at Guantanamo for more than a decade had been cleared for release. The decision on their release came as the prison marked 20 years since it was opened under President George W.

The Defense Department has no plans to return to Afghanistan to “retrieve or destroy” the equipment, reads the report, which has been provided to Congress.\n\nThe US gave a total of $18.6 billion of equipment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) from 2005 to August 2021, according to the report. Of that total, equipment worth $7.12 billion remained in Afghanistan after the US withdrawal was completed on August 30, 2021. It included aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and other materials, according to the DoD report.\n\nThe huge value of the hardware left behind will serve to refocus attention on the chaotic and hasty Afghanistan withdrawal that has been heavily criticized by lawmakers from both parties.\n\n“Much of the remaining equipment” left in Afghanistan requires “specialized maintenance that DoD contractors previously provided” to Afghan forces “in the form of technical knowledge and support,” the report states.\n\nThe Department of Defense was required to submit a report to Congress “regarding the disposition of United States property, equipment and supplies provided to” Afghan forces that “were destroyed, taken out of” or “remain in Afghanistan,” states the report, which is dated March 2022.\n\n“The $7.12 billion figure cited in the Department’s recent report to Congress corresponds to ANDSF equipment and not U.S. military equipment used by our forces,” Army Major Rob Lodewick, a Defense Department spokesperson, said in a statement. “Nearly all equipment used by U.S. military forces in Afghanistan was either retrograded or destroyed prior to our withdrawal and is not part of the ‘$7.12 billion’ figure cited in the report.”\n\nFrom Afghanistan to Ukraine\n\nThe report also says that five Mi-17 helicopters that had been in Afghanistan were officially transferred to Ukraine in 2022, though they were already in Ukraine for maintenance before the US left Afghanistan. The Department of Defense notified Congress of its intent to transfer the helicopters in January 2022, before Russia’s invasion of the country had begun, and Ukraine signed a letter of acceptance on March 11, 2022.\n\n“These five helicopters were in Ukraine undergoing overhaul maintenance when the Afghan government collapsed, and have remained there since,” the report states.\n\nOf other materials the US had previously procured for Afghanistan but not sent to the country, the US has given some “non-standard munitions” to Ukraine, including about 37,000 122mm howitzer rounds, the report states.\n\nThe US has also transferred over 15 million rounds of Ball rifle ammunition, over 99,000 40mm high-explosive/fragmentation grenade cartridges, and about 119,000 82mm high-explosive mortar rounds to Ukraine from material that was previously procured for Afghanistan, the report states.\n\nThese munitions have been transferred to Ukraine under presidential drawdown authority, the report states.\n\nUS military equipment and weapons left behind\n\nAircraft worth $923.3 million remained in Afghanistan. The US left 78 aircraft procured for the government of Afghanistan at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul before the end of the withdrawal. These aircraft were demilitarized and rendered inoperable before the US military left, the report states. The US military conducted its non-combatant evacuation from Afghanistan in August, primarily through that airport.\n\nA total of 9,524 air-to-ground munitions, valued at $6.54 million, remained in Afghanistan at the conclusion of the US military withdrawal. The “significant majority” of the “remaining aircraft munitions stock are non-precision munitions,” the report states.\n\nOver 40,000 of the total 96,000 military vehicles the US gave to Afghan forces remained in Afghanistan at the time of the US withdrawal, including 12,000 military Humvees, the report states. “The operational condition of the remaining vehicles” in Afghanistan is “unknown,” the report states.\n\nMore than 300,000 of the total 427,300 weapons the US gave to Afghan forces remained in Afghanistan at the time of the US military withdrawal, according to the report. Less than 1,537,000 of the “specialty munitions” and “common small arms ammunition,” valued at a total of $48 million, are still in the country, the report states.\n\n“Nearly all” of the communications equipment that the US gave to Afghan forces, including base-station, mobile, man-portable and hand-held commercial and military radio systems, and associated transmitters and encryption devices also remained in Afghanistan at the time of the withdrawal, the report states.\n\n“Nearly all” night vision, surveillance, “biometric and positioning equipment” totaling nearly 42,000 pieces of specialized equipment remained in the country, the report adds.\n\nAnd “nearly all,” of the explosive ordinance disposal and demining equipment, including 17,500 “pieces of explosive detection, electronic countermeasure, disposal and personal protective equipment” also remained in Afghanistan, according to the report.", "authors": ["Ellie Kaufman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/955482/twenty-years-of-guantanamo-prison-camp-biden", "title": "Twenty years of Guantánamo: can Biden finally close the US prison ...", "text": "The US has had a presence in Guantánamo Bay, on Cuba’s southeast coast, since the Spanish-American war of 1898, when marines landed there to remove the island from Spanish colonial control.\n\nFive years later, a nominally independent Cuban government leased the site to the US as a naval base.

Bush launched the “Global War on Terror” in response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001, when the US was desperate to obtain information from captured terrorists – and was prepared to “work the dark side”, as the then vice-president Dick Cheney put it.\n\nThe Bush administration held that US legal protections didn’t apply to al-Qa’eda or Taliban prisoners, but it didn’t want to test this theory on US soil. As a result, 100 wire cages were erected in just 96 hours at Guantánamo, which received its first detainees – 20 men captured in Afghanistan – on 11 January 2002, four months to the day after the destruction of the World Trade Centre.\n\nHow did the world learn about the camp?\n\nThe Pentagon announced it, and released a soon-famous picture of the new arrivals kneeling in orange jumpsuits, blackout goggles and shackles, which was taken by a US navy photographer. Guantánamo was meant to be the military’s showpiece detention camp, housing “the worst of the worst”, as its first commandant, General Michael Lehnert, put it.\n\nA spokeswoman for then secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld released the photo because she thought it would assure the world the detainees were being well treated. It had precisely the opposite effect. As the camp filled up – Guantánamo has handled roughly 780 people since 2002, 15 minors among them – it became an international byword for the follies and excesses of the War on Terror.\n\nRazor wire and guard towers keep detainees inside the camp in 2010 (Image credit: Miladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHow bad was it?\n\nThe wire cages were soon replaced by cells made from shipping containers. Later, more conventional prison facilities appeared. By 2010, conditions were comparable to those in supermax prisons in the US. In its early years, however, prisoners were subjected to beatings, sleep deprivation, sexual abuse and humiliations, and other “enhanced interrogation techniques”, though the most extreme sessions took place at CIA “black sites” (unofficial jails) elsewhere.\n\nIn June 2004, the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a confidential report saying that treatment of the detainees in Cuba was “cruel, unusual and degrading”, amounting to “a form of torture”. In 2009, Susan Crawford, a Bush administration official, conceded that torture had been carried out there. There have been numerous hunger strikes and cases of self-harm; and seven apparent suicides.\n\nWho were the prisoners?\n\nEarly on, Rumsfeld complained in a memo that the camp was filled with “low-level enemy combatants”. In fact, in 2006, a study of 517 detainees found that 55% had not even been determined to have committed any hostile acts against US forces or their allies; only 8% had been clearly identified as al-Qa’eda operatives.\n\nMost had been captured in Afghanistan, where the US had offered big rewards – “enough to feed your family for life”, as one leaflet put it – in return for “Arab terrorists”. As a result, foreign travellers and people’s personal enemies were swept into the net.\n\nHowever, in 2006, a number of “high-value detainees” were rendered there from CIA black sites, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged architect of the 11 September attacks, and Hambali, a member of the Indonesian Islamist group that carried out the 2002 Bali bombings.\n\nWhy hasn’t it been closed?\n\nAt the 2008 election, Barack Obama, John McCain and the outgoing President Bush all agreed that Guantánamo needed to be closed. Obama tried to, by executive order, on his second day in office. But foot-dragging by the Pentagon, Republican opposition and, arguably, Obama’s lack of political boldness, meant the effort failed.\n\nThere were overwhelming legal difficulties. Thanks to torture and the extra-legal nature of the enterprise, prisoners couldn’t be tried in civilian courts. The next-best solution, military tribunals, raised constitutional problems and lacked credibility.\n\nAt the same time, many prisoners couldn’t be repatriated, either because they’d be in danger in their home countries, or because they were seen as a security risk there. The Obama administration was reduced to bargaining with third countries to take them.\n\nAn unused detainee space in one of the detention facilities at the US Naval Station in Guantánamo Bay in 2010 (Image credit: Miladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat’s the situation now?\n\nOf 780 total detainees, only 12 have ever been charged, and two convicted (by military tribunals). The trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others is now in its tenth year of pre-trial hearings. Under President Bush, 500 detainees were transferred out of the prison or released. Under Obama, 197 detainees were repatriated or resettled in third countries.\n\nUnder Trump, who promised to fill the site with “bad dudes”, one more was transferred. There are now 39 detainees at Guantánamo. President Biden also wants to close it, but has limited options: most Republicans still regard it, in Rumsfeld’s words, as “the least worst place” to keep such suspects. In theory, some could be tried by other countries. Legal avenues could be found for convicting others in the US. In the meantime, it will endure: the Pentagon has asked for $88m to build a hospice for ageing detainees.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Uk", "Rebecca Messina", "Rafi Schwartz", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/04/30/obama-news-conference-100-days/2123391/", "title": "Obama: We need to close Guantanamo Bay", "text": "Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY\n\nObama notes that Congress has blocked him from closing Guantanamo\n\nPresident doesn%27t commit to military action in Syria\n\nObama also pushes back against criticism of FBI regarding bombing suspect\n\nWASHINGTON—President Obama said Tuesday that his administration would re-engage Congress on closing the U.S. military-run detention center at Guantanamo Bay, calling the facility a \"recruitment tool for extremists\" and suggesting it is undermining U.S. security.\n\n\"It needs to be closed,\" Obama said at a White House news conference marking the first 100 days of his second term. \"I'm going to go back at this.\"\n\nObama's comments come as military officials say that as many as 100 prisoners at Guantanamo are engaged in a hunger strike.\n\nWith the situation getting more difficult, the Pentagon in recent days dispatched 40 additional Navy medical personnel to Guantanamo to deal with the hunger strikers. They bolstered a staff of about 100, said Lt. Col. Samuel House, a detention camp spokesman.\n\nObama had vowed in his 2008 presidential campaign to close Guantanamo during his first year in office but failed to get it done in his first term.\n\n\"It' is not a surprise to me that we are having problems in Guantanamo,\" Obama said. Obama called Guantanamo unsafe and expensive and said it lessens cooperation with U.S. allies.\n\nHe noted that Congress has legislatively blocked him from closing Guantanamo--lawmakers have attached provisions to military spending bills that bar the administration from spending on trials for Guantanamo detainees and early in his presidency his administration faced stiff opposition to a plan to transfer detainees to a facility in Illinois\n\nOn Tuesday, the president offered no solution to getting around congressional hurdles.\n\nRep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, took issue with Obama's charge that Congress has blocked him from closing Guantanamo.\n\n\"The President faces bipartisan opposition to closing Guantanamo Bay's detention center because he has offered no alternative plan regarding the detainees there, nor a plan for future terrorist captures,\" McKeon said in a statement.\n\nAdvocates of closing Guantanamo say there are two important steps Obama can take toward his end goal--wresting control of his closure policy from the Pentagon and directing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to start certifying for transfer detainees who have already been cleared for transfer--more than half the prison's population--but continue to be held at the detention center in Cuba.\n\n\"There's more to be done, but these are the two essential first steps the president can take now to break the Guantanamo logjam,\" said Anthony Romero, the American Civil Liberties Union executive director.\n\nEighty-six Guantanamo prisoners were cleared for release more than three years ago. Most of them are from Yemen, but Obama halted transfers to that country following a failed attempted by a Nigerian man to blow up a Detroit-bound flight on Christmas Day 2009. The assailant had ties to the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nLast week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote to National Security Council Adviser Tom Donilon that it was time to reconsider the status of those 86 prisoners.\n\n\"The fact that so many detainees have now been held at Guantanamo for over a decade and their belief that there is still no end in sight for them is a reason there is a growing problem of more and more detainees on a hunger strike,\" Feinstein wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama agreed that Guantanamo might have been seen as necessary after the Sept. 11 attacks. But the president said the time to close the prison for high-value terror suspects who were captured on foreign soil is now.\n\n\"The idea that we would still maintain forever a group of individuals who have not been tried, that is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop,\" Obama said.\n\nObama also appeared to defend the Defense Department's decision to force feed the striking prisoners.\"I don't want these individuals to die,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama addressed intelligence reports that show chemical weapons were likely deployed in Syria. He said it would be a \"game-changer\" if it is confirmed that Syria's President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons on his people.\n\nBut when pressed on whether confirmation would mean military action, the president said that it only means that his administration would have to rethink its options.\n\n\"We don't know how they were used, when they were used, who used them.,\" Obama said. \"And when I am making decisions about America's national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapon use, I've got to make sure I've got the facts.\"\n\nObama had previously drawn a \"red line\" on the use or transfer of chemical weapons by Assad's regime.\n\nObama said that taking additional action without hard evidence could compromise the U. S. position internationally.\n\n\"If we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we can find ourselves where we can't mobilize the international community to support what we do,\" Obama said.\n\nBut Obama stressed that if it is confirmed that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons, his administration would take new action.\n\nObama also pushed back against criticism from some GOP lawmakers that have suggested that the FBI dropped the ball when the Russian government asked it to investigate one of the Boston bombing suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in 2011.\n\n\"Based on what I've seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing,\" Obama said. \"But this is hard stuff.\"\n\nIn other developments, Obama commented about Jason Collins, the NBA player who became the first active athlete in major league sports to come out as gay. Obama said he spoke to Collins on Monday and called him \"a terrific young man.\"\n\n\"I told him that I could not be prouder of him,\" Obama said.\n\nObama also responded to criticism about his inability to get the Senate to pass legislation to enhance background checks in the aftermath of last year's school shooting in Newtown, Conn., which left 20 small children and six educators dead.\n\nAsked whether he had \"any juice\" left to get anything done in Washington, Obama responded jokingly that it sounded like he \"should just pack up and go home.\"\n\nThe president then paraphrased Mark Twain.\n\n\"Rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/23/obama-counter-terrorism-speech-drones-guantanamo-bay/2354001/", "title": "Obama outlines counterterrorism policy", "text": "David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nObama announces new limits on drone strikes against overseas targets\n\nHe also discussed how the terrorist threat has changed\n\nSpeech comes a day after administration revealed that drone strikes have killed four Americans\n\nWASHINGTON — President Obama outlined tighter rules for drone strikes and renewed efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison on Thursday, while calling on policymakers to rethink the nation's battle against terrorism.\n\nThe president discussed the war in Afghanistan, the attack on Benghazi and ongoing investigations of national security news leaks, and questioned the concept of the \"global war on terror\" that has prevailed since the strikes of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\"Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue,\" Obama said during a 59-minute speech at National Defense University in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"But this war, like all wars, must end,\" he added. \"That's what history advises. That's what our democracy demands.\"\n\nCongress also needs to act, Obama said. He called on lawmakers to loosen restrictions on moving Gitmo prisoners to the United States, approve more money for security of U.S. facilities overseas, and eventually repeal the 2001 authorization of military action that promotes \"a perpetual wartime footing\" and may give presidents too much power.\n\nCongressional Republicans challenged Obama's analysis of the struggle against al- Qaeda.\n\n\"We are still in a long, drawn-out conflict with al-Qaeda,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama. \"To somehow argue that al-Qaeda is quote 'on the run' comes from a degree of unreality that to me is really incredible.\"\n\nMcCain also said that he and others would work with Obama to find \"common ground\" for \"both our counterterrorism objectives and our highest values as a nation of laws.\"\n\nThe president spent much of his speech on two counterterrorism projects that have drawn sharp attacks from civil libertarians, drone strikes and the Guantanamo Bay prison.\n\nUnder a new set of rules, Obama said drone attacks will be confined to suspects \" who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people,\" and who cannot otherwise be captured. \"B efore any strike is taken,\" he said, \"there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured — the highest standard we can set.\"\n\nThe speech came a day after the Obama administration revealed that drone strikes have killed four Americans, all terrorist suspects, in counterterrorism operations since 2009. Obama defended the strike that killed American-born Anwar al-Awlaki, calling him a terrorist leader who \"was continually trying to kill people.\"\n\nObama also defended drone strikes in general, saying they \"have saved lives\" by eliminating terrorists, and are a legal part of a \"just war\" against terrorist organizations.\n\nThere have been civilian casualties that \"haunt\" him and his chain of command, Obama said, but that risk must be balanced against the threat from terrorist groups that are specifically targeting civilians. \"Doing nothing is not an option,\" he said.\n\nThe president also stressed that members of Congress have been apprised of every drone strike and that he is open to the possibility of some sort of independent oversight, such as a special court or a review panel.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which has criticized some of Obama's anti-terrorism actions, said the president sounded good notes on drones and Gitmo during his speech, but has to follow through.\n\nObama \"is right to say that we cannot be on a war footing forever,\" said Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU. \"But the time to take our country off the global warpath and fully restore the rule of law is now, not at some indeterminate future point.\"\n\nIn describing his plans to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, Obama said he is lifting his own moratorium of transferring detainees to Yemen. He also said a new senior envoy will be appointed to talk with other nations about taking in prisoners. There are currently 166 detainees at Gitmo.\n\nObama had pledged to close the facility during his first year in office. But his efforts ran afoul of congressional Republicans who opposed trials of terrorism suspects in the United States, and of other countries that refused to take some prisoners.\n\nSome detainees at the prison, meanwhile, are in the midst of a hunger strike, protesting their conditions.\n\nIn his speech, Obama called on Congress to lift some of those restrictions, and to establish a facility in the United States for detention and military trials of some Gitmo suspects.\n\nObama won applause from the crowd when he said, \"There is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened.\"\n\nThe Gitmo and drone discussions also drew the shouts of at least one protester, forcing Obama at one point to say: \"Let me finish.\"\n\nObama later said the woman's protests reflected the fact that \"these are tough issues.\"\n\nGOP members of Congress said U.S. trials of Gitmo detainees would invite terrorist attacks. Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Obama's \"renewed and ill-conceived push to close Guantanamo threatens the security of U.S. citizens at home and abroad.\"\n\nThe president's call to increase the security budget for facilities overseas stems from the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. building in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens.\n\nCongressional Republicans are investigating the Obama administration over Benghazi, claiming officials tried to cover up the involvement of a terrorist organization and were unprepared for such an attack.\n\nObama also urged Congress to approve a federal \"shield law\" that would help reporters protect confidential sources. The proposal comes amid news of a Justice Department seizure of records from the Associated Press and Fox News in connection with investigations of news leaks.\n\nObama said he respects the need for investigative journalism because it helps hold government accountable. He also said the government has to strike a balance between press freedom and the need to protect sensitive national security information.\n\nIn the meantime, Obama said he asked Attorney General Eric Holder to review the Justice Department guidelines on investigations that involve reporters. Holder is scheduled to report back to the president by July 12.\n\nAlthough Obama did not call predecessor George W. Bush by name, he did criticize some Bush counterterrorism proposals, including treatment of detainees and what he called \"torture.\" Obama said his administration changed many of those policies, and has improved its relations with other nations, particularly in the Muslim world.\n\nThe threat of terrorism still exists, Obama said, citing Benghazi, the April bombings at the Boston Marathon and the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas. But the nature of the threat has changed since 2001, he said.\n\nThe al-Qaeda organization that carried out 9/11 has been severely damaged, Obama said, including the death of leader Osama bin Laden during a U.S-led raid into Pakistan in 2011. New dangers come from al-Qaeda affiliates, localized extremist groups and homegrown terrorists.\n\nWhile no president can promise \"the total defeat of terror,\" Obama said the nation can \"dismantle networks that pose a direct danger to us, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.\"\n\nThat battle requires more than military action and law enforcement, he said, citing better diplomacy with other nations, intelligence sharing, more foreign aid and efforts to seek peace in the Middle East.\n\n\"Force alone cannot make us safe,\" Obama said.\n\nIn many ways, Obama's national security speech was a follow-up to his Feb. 12 State of the Union Address in which he pledged to be more open regarding his counterterrorism policies.\n\nThat night, Obama said that \"in the months ahead, I will continue to engage with Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/01/14/guantanamo-detainee-total-drops-below-100/78793168/", "title": "Guantanamo detainee total drops below 100", "text": "John Bacon\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTen Guantanamo Bay detainees have been handed over to the government of Oman, bringing the number of suspected terrorists held at the controversial center under 100, the Pentagon said Thursday.\n\nPresident Obama, in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, reiterated his determination to close the camp that dates back to 2002. Almost 800 prisoners have spent time at the facility on the island of Cuba that now houses 93 suspects, the lowest total since it opened, the Pentagon said in a statement.\n\nThe Guantanamo Review Task Force studied the cases, and the detainees were unanimously approved for transfer by the six departments and agencies involved, the statement said. It said the transfer took place with \"appropriate security and humane treatment measures.\"\n\n\"The United States is grateful to the Government of Oman for its humanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility,\" the statement said.\n\nObama made closing the prison a priority when he took office in 2009, but the pledge has proven difficult to make happen.

She is a biologist and conservationist, and a Rolex Award Laureate.\n\nCNN —\n\nHigh up in the Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve, the world’s smallest big cat stands at a precipice.\n\nThe mountainous reserve in Dhofar, southern Oman, is a world away from the nearby city of Salalah, which looks out over the Arabian Sea. Every year, far below, the coastal desert goes through a spectacular transformation, turning green in the summer monsoon and filling with temporary lakes, rivers and waterfalls. But the phenomenon doesn’t touch these elevations. Up on Jabal Samhan it’s arid and hostile, and it’s here the Arabian leopard calls home.\n\nOf the world’s eight leopard subspecies, the Arabian leopard is among the rarest, and it’s thought fewer than 200 adults live in the wild, says Urs Breitenmoser, co-chair of the Cat Specialist Group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, that figure is uncertain – data is hard to come by for this elusive creature, more often viewed through a camera trap than with the naked eye.\n\nThe leopard once lived across the Arabian Peninsula, but today the IUCN lists only Oman, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and possibly Israel as its range – and there have been no recent sightings in either Saudi Arabia or Israel. Human-wildlife conflict, the hunting of its prey species and habitat loss are all factors in the Arabian leopard’s precipitous decline.\n\nThe big cat is vulnerable to extinction, but dedicated conservationists are working to ensure it doesn’t share the fate of the lion and the cheetah in the region, and continues to have a future.\n\nThe Arabian leopard’s last stronghold\n\ncourtesy Hadi Al Hikmani/CNN\n\nOman is thought to have the largest population of Arabian leopards and Dhofar is home to around 50 adults living in the mountain ranges of Jabal Samhan, Jabal Qara and Jabal Qamar, according to Hadi Al Hikmani, manager of environmental affairs at the Office for the Conservation of the Environment in Salalah, part of the Environment Authority. The largest single population comprises 20 to 30 adults inside the 4,500 square kilometer (1,737 square mile) Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve, he says.\n\n“It’s very shy,” says Al Hikmani, who last saw a leopard in the flesh two years ago. A leopard can roam over 150 square kilometers (58 square miles), and with only 20 community rangers monitoring the species in the reserve, sightings are rare. “The only way to study these animals is by technology, whether it’s camera trapping or genetic sampling (often via scats),” he says.\n\nHistorically, pastoralists poisoned, shot and trapped leopards to protect their livestock. However killing a leopard or its prey, such as the Arabian oryx or Arabian gazelle, has been illegal in Oman since 1976.\n\nToday Oman is at the forefront of Arabian leopard protection. In 2014, the government launched a program to compensate farmers for lost livestock. It has proved effective, says Al Hikmani. But perhaps more so has been the education program that was rolled out to change attitudes towards the leopard.\n\n“We don’t want to punish people,” he says. “We want to work together with these people to protect this animal.”\n\ncourtesy Hadi Al Hikmani/CNN\n\nAl Hikmani is a walking example of a generational shift towards conservation. His father is one of the few people still herding camels around Jabal Samhan. “Forty years ago, he wouldn’t have hesitated to shoot a leopard. Now his son is leading their only leopard initiative on the ground,” explains Andrew Spalton.\n\nSpalton, a retired conservationist and former advisor of environmental affairs in Oman, first met a young Al Hikmani during fieldwork in the 1990s. The scientist needed a camel to carry his equipment, and the Omani guided beast and burden up Jabal Samhan. After finishing school, Al Hikmani went on to volunteer for Spalton’s Arabian Leopard Survey and later work for the government in conservation, gain a PhD, and co-author books on the leopard and Oman’s wildlife. “He’s a great success story,” Spalton says.\n\nSuccess is also a word tentatively used in relation to the Arabian leopard in Oman. The population, though small, is relatively stable and shows signs of expanding its range. Prey like the ibex and gazelle are bouncing back in Dhofar. However, Al Hikmani cautions that “there is still a lot of work to be done” to secure the species’ future.\n\nThe situation outside of Oman\n\nElsewhere, the Arabian leopard’s prospects in the wild are more uncertain.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, where the last recorded sighting of a leopard in the wild was one poisoned in 2014, it’s “quite certain by now that there is no reproducing population left,” according to Breitenmoser of the IUCN. But efforts are underway to bring the leopard back. The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) has committed $25 million to revitalize the kingdom’s indigenous leopard population and established the Arabian Leopard Fund to support conservation region-wide. Spalton is assisting big cat charity and RCU partner Panthera in surveying Saudi Arabia for wild leopards (none have been spotted so far), while a captive breeding program is building a population that could one day be reintroduced into the wild. The latest of 16 cubs was born last April.\n\nIn Aprll 2021, the latest of 16 cubs was born in captivity in Taif, Saudi Arabia as part of the kingdom's Arabian leopard breeding program. The Royal Commission for AlUla\n\nIn Yemen, the ongoing war has thwarted scientific fieldwork. The only recent evidence of Arabian leopards is via harrowing images and videos of dead leopards shared on social media, and in one case, footage of a leopard captured alive. “We simply don’t know whether there are a good number of leopards left (in Yemen),” says Spalton.\n\nIn 2015, the IUCN listed only a small pocket of Israel as “possibly” part of the Arabian leopard’s range. A 2006 study found evidence of just eight leopards and there have been no reports of recent sightings, though it has not been declared extinct in the country to date.\n\nA regionwide reassessment of the Arabian leopard by the IUCN is underway, which aims to redefine the subspecies’ range and provide new insights as to just how rare this critically endangered animal has become.\n\n“We need skilled personnel on the ground”\n\nThe Arabian leopard is one of eight leopard subspecies. Courtesy Hadi Al Hikmani\n\nIn the meantime, Al Hikmani is looking to shore up the leopard’s future in Oman. In 2021, the country announced a second protected area in Dhofar, close to the Yemen border, providing further sanctuary for the leopard.\n\nAl Hikmani also has his sights set on training up more homegrown conservationists. “We need skilled personnel on the ground,” he says, adding that community rangers have excellent local knowledge but lack scientific know-how. He’s drawing up plans to offer scholarships for professional training to empower Omanis living alongside leopards to contribute to scientific fieldwork.\n\nMeanwhile, boosting ecotourism could bring jobs and generate incomes for local communities, says Spalton (even if, he adds, the closest encounter a tourist might get with a leopard is hearing its call – if they’re lucky).\n\nThe end goal is creating a framework – both scientific and economic – in which the mistakes of the past cannot be repeated.\n\n“(We’ve) already lost some of our endemic and iconic species,” says Al Hikmani. “We don’t want to lose the leopard.”", "authors": ["Thomas Page"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/20/state-of-the-union-reality-check/22065423/", "title": "Reality check: The state of the union is ... partisan", "text": "Erin Kelly, Fredreka Schouten and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — In Tuesday's State of the Union Address, President Obama unveiled a host of new plans for the last two years of his presidency even as he faces for the first time a House and Senate united under Republican control. Some issues Obama raised and the reality he faces in trying to implement major changes:\n\n• ECONOMY\n\nStatement:\n\n\"At this moment — with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry and booming energy production — we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\"\n\nContext:\n\nThe economy is on the upswing. The unemployment rate fell to 5.6% in December, and the economy grew at a 5% clip during the third quarter of last year — the biggest expansion in more than a decade. Republicans note, however, that 8.7 million people remain out of work, and say that millions more are trapped in low-paying, part-time jobs.\n\nObama is trying to seize on the economic revival to push an array of new policies aimed at helping lower- and middle-income Americans, who have lagged behind in the recovery. They include proposals to give workers seven days a year of paid sick time and a plan to triple the child-care tax credit to $3,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo pay for the new programs, the White House wants to raise $320 billion over a decade though new taxes targeting wealthy individuals and large financial institutions. Those include boosting the top tax rate on capital gains to 28%, up from the current $23.8%. The rate will apply to top earners, such as couples making more than $500,000 a year.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner called it an outdated approach that pits \"one set of Americans against the other.\" Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who oversees banking policy in the House, argued that a proposed fee on big financial institutions — which the White House has said is aimed at discouraging big banks from risky and excessive borrowing — would eventually \"trickle down\" to consumers, making it more expensive for them to secure mortgages and car loans.\n\n• BIPARTISANSHIP\n\nStatement: \"If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.\"\n\nContext: Obama's call for cooperation comes as he threatens to veto eight bills from a new Congress that convened just two weeks ago.\n\nThe president has vowed to veto a homeland security spending bill passed last week by the House that would derail his recent executive order to protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from being deported and allow them to work legally in the USA.\n\nHe also plans to veto the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would carry crude oil nearly 1,200 miles from Canada south to Nebraska. The House approved the project on Jan. 9, and the Senate is debating it this week. On Tuesday, the White House threatened to veto a separate bill that would allow the automatic approval of natural gas pipeline projects if federal agencies do not act quickly on developers' applications for permits.\n\nObama also has promised to veto any bill — even a bipartisan one — that would impose new sanctions on Iran if it refuses to agree by June 30 to a permanent framework to limit its nuclear program. He has argued that the threat of more sanctions could derail negotiations with Iran.\n\nAnd the president threatened vetoes of a House-passed bill to reduce the number of workers getting insurance from their employers under the Affordable Care Act, a bill to weaken regulations governing the financial sector, a bill to make it harder for federal agencies to adopt new rules, and a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n• COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\nStatement:\n\n\"I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero. ... Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America.\"\n\nContext:\n\nThe program, which Obama first rolled out this month, would be available to students who attend college at least half the time, make steady progress and maintain at least a 2.5 grade-point average. It could benefit as many as 9 million students a year.\n\nCalled America's College Promise, the plan would cost $60 billion over a decade with the federal government footing 75% of the average cost of community college and participating states paying the rest. It requires congressional approval. Individual states also would have to sign off.\n\nThe proposal faces a steep climb in the Republican-controlled Congress, where top officials have balked at its costs. \"Unless the president has a responsible plan to meet our existing commitments, he shouldn't be making new promises the American people can't afford,\" said Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., who heads the House Education and Workforce Committee.\n\nEven some Republicans from Tennessee were cool to the idea. Asked whether he would back Obama's plan, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told CNN, \"Oh, no, no, no, no, no\" and said he would urge states to try their own community-college initiatives rather than support a new federal program.\n\n• WAR\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement:\n\n\"In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group ... and tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\"\n\nContext:\n\nThe president's call for Congress to authorize military force against Islamic State militants, also known as ISIL or ISIS, comes months after several lawmakers, including those in his own party such as Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., had urged him to seek such a measure. Congress is sure to offer support, especially with troops in harm's way. But Congress could attach restrictions to limit the time or scope of military options — or push the White House and Pentagon to do more. The White House, for example, has ruled out the use of U.S. troops on the ground. Airstrikes, however, would be more effective with special operations forces on the ground to call them in.\n\nThe U.S.-led air war, conducted with allies from Europe and the Middle East, has helped stall the momentum of Islamic State fighters who poured into Iraq in the summer, overran the northern city of Mosul and threatened Baghdad. In Syria, they have besieged the city of Kobani. Kurdish forces there, backed by American airstrikes, have retaken much of the city from militants, according to the Pentagon. But the Islamic State still controls vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.\n\n• CYBERSECURITY\n\nStatement:\n\n\"I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyberattacks. ... If we don't act, we'll leave our nation and our economy more vulnerable.\"\n\nContext:\n\nThe president proposed cybersecurity legislation last week to promote greater information-sharing between the government and private sector on cyberthreats.\n\nObama's proposal would give companies legal protection from lawsuits for sharing information about cyberattacks with the government. It also would require businesses to comply with privacy restrictions by removing unnecessary personal information before sharing data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAn information-sharing bill passed the House last session but stalled in the Senate as critics raised concerns about the danger of Americans' personal data being shared with the government.\n\nOne of the issues that Congress will have to grapple with is which federal agency should receive information from the private sector. While Obama is calling for the civilian Department of Homeland Security to get the information, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, thinks the data should go to the National Security Agency, which is part of the Defense Department.\n\n• IMMIGRATION\n\nStatement:\n\n\"Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hard-working mom is taken from her child, and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\"\n\nContext:\n\nAfter it became clear Congress was not going to pass an immigration bill in the last session, Obama issued an executive order in November to give temporary legal status to about 4 million of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe new Republican-led Congress has already taken action to derail the president's order. The House last week passed a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security that included amendments to bar any federal money from being used to carry out the executive action.\n\nThe bill also tries to kill a 2012 program by Obama that has protected about 600,000 young immigrants who were brought to the USA illegally as children from being deported. That program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), allows the young immigrants to work or attend school in the USA legally for two-year periods.\n\nThe House action puts the chamber on a collision course with Senate Democrats, who are likely to block the bill. Even if the Senate passes the legislation, Obama has vowed to veto it. If a compromise cannot be reached by the end of February, it could lead to a partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n• GUANTANAMO BAY\n\nStatement: \"As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice – so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I've been President, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half. Now it's time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It's not who we are.\"\n\nContext: There are 122 detainees at Guantanamo, which Obama refers to by its military abbreviation. The prison camps opened in 2002 after scores of detainees were scooped up on battlefields in Afghanistan and beyond. At first, they were housed in open-air, chain-link fence cages. Now, the detainees are held in modern, American-style penitentiaries. At its peak, the prison population neared 700. It costs about $3 million annually for each inmate housed there.\n\nObama vowed, in one of his first statements as president in 2009, to shut down the prison. That has proven far more difficult than initially thought. Republican members of Congress have fought to keep it open. Earlier this month, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., new chairman of the armed services committee and Obama's opponent in 2008, proposed a measure that would prevent transfers of detainees to war-torn Yemen.\n\nThen there is the matter of the high-value detainees, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. There is no date in sight for his military trial.\n\n• CUBA\n\nStatement:\n\n\"In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you're doing doesn't work for fifty years, it's time to try something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.\"\n\nContext:\n\nPresident Obama announced in December that the United States would re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than 50 years. As a result, the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments unveiled a new set of rules that will make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and sell products directly to small businesses there.\n\nBut there are limits to what the president can do alone. Only Congress can lift the trade embargo and approve unlimited travel to Cuba. And Congress must approve the use of federal funds to open a U.S. Embassy in Cuba.

Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox.\n\n'The Brutalist' is named best drama, 'Emilia Pérez' is best comedy/musical\n\nFinally, the big prizes of the night! \"The Brutalist\" is named best drama – which it is, since it topped this movie critic's top 10 list of 2024. \"I'm incredibly moved,\" says co-writer/director Brady Corbet, thanking those who stuck with it \"as it kept falling apart.\" He was told it was undistributable, that nobody would see it. \"I don't resent that, but I want to use that as an opportunity to lift up ... Films don't exist without the filmmakers. Let's prop them up.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThen it's time for \"Emilia Pérez\" to shine again, winning best comedy or musical. \"The light always wins over darkness,\" star Karla Sofía Gascón says in an impassioned speech. \"You can maybe put us in jail, you can beat us up, but you can never take away our soul, our existence, our identity. ... I am who I am, not who you want.\"\n\nFernanda Torres, Adrien Brody win drama actor categories\n\nWhoa! Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres pulls a heck of an upset, winning for best drama actress for \"I'm Still Here\" over Angelina Jolie (\"Maria\") and Nicole Kidman (\"Babygirl\"). \"So many actresses here that I admire so much,\" Torres says, dedicating the honor to her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, herself a previous Golden Globe nominee.\n\nBut then a more predictable pick, as Adrien Brody gets best drama actor for \"The Brutalist.\" \"I'm deeply humbled by this,\" he says. Brody says his movie is about \"the human capacity for creation\" so he shouts out his fellow actors \"who reach such heights with their work.\" He also thanks his parents, pointing out his mom's artistry and praising his dad for being \"the foundation for this family. All the love I receive flows back to you.\"\n\n'Shōgun' takes home best drama, actress for Anna Sawai\n\nNotch another couple for \"Shōgun,\" as Emmy winner Anna Sawai gets best drama actress and the FX epic snags best TV drama. She thanks Globes voters, \"even though I would vote for Kathy Bates any day,\" she admits with a smile.\n\n'Baby Reindeer' rules best limited series, 'Hacks' is top comedy\n\nNetflix's \"Baby Reindeer\" is named best limited series, which isn't a shocker considering how much of a viral, word-of-mouth hit that was. \"This is insane. 'The Rock' is there! I grew up with you, that's nuts,\" creator/star (and admitted pro-wrestling fan) Richard Gadd says, thanking people for embracing his dark, \"messed-up\" story.\n\nAnd the award for best TV comedy series goes to \"Hacks,\" which also won the category for its first season. (\"Abbott Elementary\" and \"The Bear\" won the past two years.)\n\nVin Diesel says hey to Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, 'Wicked' wins for box-office achievement\n\n\"Hey, Dwayne,\" Vin Diesel says to his \"Fast and Furious\" frenemy \"The Rock\" when he comes out to give the Globe for its newest category, best cinematic and box-office achievement. The first winner a year ago was \"Barbie\" and this year it's \"Wicked.\" Which is interesting because it's not even the top money-earner of 2024. (It ranks No. 3 behind \"Inside Out 2\" and \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\") \"This is for you, the fans,\" says \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu, adding that even with much pessimism in the world, \"we can still make art that's a radical act of optimism.\"\n\n'Challengers' picks up original score Golden Globe, 'Emilia Pérez' gets best song\n\nElton John and Brandi Carlile hit the stage for some jokes and to present a few movie music awards. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' thumping electronica in \"Challengers\" wins for original score – somehow beating \"The Brutalist\"! – while \"El Mal\" from \"Emilia Pérez,\" the showstopper for Zoe Saldaña, is named best original song. (That's No. 3 for \"Emilia.\")\n\n'Flow' gets best animated feature, Brady Corbet is best director\n\nHere's another shocker: \"Flow,\" a wordless film from Latvia about a cat surviving in a post-apocalyptic landscape, wins for best animated feature and beats out the higher-profile movies like \"The Wild Robot\" and \"Moana 2.\"\n\nNext up is the best director Globe, which goes to \"The Brutalist\" filmmaker (and now first-time winner) Brady Corbet. He says he's \"humbled\" to be in the category with fellow talented directors and Corbet's going to be a name you'll see mentioned a lot this Oscar season. He also mentions that \"his heart\" is with actress Aubrey Plaza and indie director Jeff Baena's family in the wake of Baena's death this weekend.\n\nSebastian Stan takes best comedy actor for 'A Different Man'\n\n\"A Different Man\" star Sebastian Stan asks for folks to champion movies about \"tough subject matters\" and for normalizing disfigurement in his acceptance speech for best actor in a comedy or musical. A win here definitely helps his standing in a crowded Oscar best actor field.\n\n'Popcorn actress' Demi Moore pulls a surprise, wins for 'The Substance'\n\nWow, it's tonight's first big surprise: Demi Moore wins best actress in a musical or comedy for horror movie \"The Substance.\" \"I'm just in shock right now. I've been doing this for a long time, 40 years now, and this is the first time I've won anything as an actor,\" Moore says. She once was called \"a popcorn actress\" and bought into that back in the day, but she points to the \"Substance\" script giving her career new life. \"I celebrate this as a marker for my wholeness ... and a reminder that I do belong.\" This helps cement her best actress Oscar spot – but could she win there, too? (That would be awesome.)\n\nColin Farrell wins for 'The Penguin,' Jodie Foster for 'True Detective'\n\nSomeone check on Batman, folks. As the villainous title gangster, \"The Penguin\" star Colin Farrell wins for best male actor in a limited series. He spent three hours every morning \"drinking black coffee and listening to '80s music\" as makeup artist Mike Marino turned him into the Penguin. \"I guess it's prosthetics from here on out,\" Farrell quips.\n\nThen Jodie Foster gets best female actor in a limited series for \"True Detective: Night Country.\" \"The greatest thing about this age and being in this time is having a community,\" she says.\n\n'Emilia Pérez' honored as top non-English language film\n\nMake that two for \"Emilia\": The Netflix musical crime thriller wins for best non-English language movie. Not only is it likely an Oscar best-picture contender but it's a favorite going into the international film category as well. Through a translator, French director Jacques Audiard says he hopes the movie is \"a beacon of light\" for those worried about the state of the world.\n\nAli Wong gets Golden Globe for stand-up comedy performance\n\nNate Bargatze, an extremely funny guy who really should host an awards show one of these days, presents the Globe for best stand-up TV comedy performance. Ali Wong wins out over Adam Sandler, Seth Meyers and Jamie Foxx with her special \"Single Lady.\"\n\nPapal thrill ride 'Conclave' snags best screenplay at Golden Globes\n\nJeremy Allen White wins best TV comedy actor for \"The Bear\" but he's not there to accept – probably because of his commitments playing \"The Boss\" in that Bruce Springsteen biopic. But Peter Straughan is in the house, getting his first screenplay win for \"Conclave.\" The papal thriller is a serious best picture contender, and beat out \"The Brutalist\" and \"Anora\" in the Globes category.\n\nJessica Gunning, Tadanobu Asano win TV supporting honors\n\nAfter Nikki Glaser does a musical bit mashing up \"Conclave\" and \"Wicked\" (\"Pope-ular, you're gonna be pope-ular\"), Jessica Gunning snags a supporting TV actress award for Netflix's \"Baby Reindeer.\" She says \"I can't believe this is happening to me\" has been her mantra this entire year after the success of the popular miniseries. \"I know 8-year-old me would be chuffed a bit.\"\n\nThen \"Shōgun\" nabs its second Globe of the night, with Tadanobu Asano taking home the supporting TV actor trophy. \"Wow! So maybe you don't know me. I'm an actor from Japan,\" he says excitedly. Asano goes back to filming tomorrow, and \"this is very big present for me!\"\n\nHiroyuki Sanada takes top TV drama actor crown for 'Shōgun'\n\n\"Shōgun\" cleaned up at the Emmys and it continues its domination tonight at the Golden Globes. Hiroyuki Sanada wins for best actor in a TV drama series. \"All of you have brought me here,\" he says, adding some advice to younger actors: \"Be yourself, believe in yourself and never give up.\"\n\nHe's 'A Real Pain': Kieran Culkin conquers best supporting actor field\n\nKieran Culkin looks like he could be a lock for Oscar gold, y'all. \"This is incredible,\" the \"A Real Pain\" star says in his acceptance speech after doing a tequila shot with his wife and Mario Lopez. He wins for best supporting actor, and after nonstop kudos thus far this awards season, Culkin's likely to run the table.\n\nJean Smart takes the first TV Golden Globe for 'Hacks'\n\n\"I never thought I'd be so glad to be called a hack,\" says Jean Smart, who follows her Emmy win for \"Hacks\" with a Golden Globe for best actress performance in a TV comedy.\n\nZoe Saldaña grabs the first trophy, is now a supporting actress front-runner for 'Emilia Pérez'\n\nThis year's race to Oscar supporting actress looks like a dead heat between Zoe Saldaña of \"Emilia Pérez\" and Ariana Grande of \"Wicked.\" Score the first round to Saldaña, who picks up the Globe win – the first award of the night. \"My heart is full of gratitude,\" a tearful Saldaña says in her acceptance speech.\n\nNikki Glaser goofs on Timothée Chalamet in her Golden Globes opening monologue\n\nNew host Nikki Glaser welcomes us to the Globes, \"aka Ozempic's biggest night.\" Unlike her viral Tom Brady takedown, the stand-up comedian announces she's not here to roast anyone: \"You could really do anything, except tell the country who to vote for,\" she says about the A-listers in attendance. \"You'll get them next time. If there's a next time. Ariana, hold my finger,\" she adds, pointing out Ariana Grande.\n\nShe gives a shout-out to servers and \"two-time Holocaust survivor\" Adrien Brody, makes a Diddy joke involving Stanley Tucci, and points out all the movie stars doing TV, like Cate Blanchett, Colin Farrell and Eddie Redmayne, who stars in \"The Day of the Jackal.\" \"It's about a spy no one can find because he's on Peacock,\" she quips. Glaser takes special note goofing on Timothée Chalamet, from how his name sounds like something Adam Sandler would say (which makes Sandler pop up to say it in a very Sandler way) to the actor's Bob Dylan voice and facial hair: \"You have the most gorgeous eyelashes on your upper lip.\"\n\nOverall, a pretty good job – and way better than Jo Koy last year!\n\nGlen Powell, Timothée Chalamet lookalikes hit the Golden Globes red carpet\n\nThis year’s Globes guest list included two Glen Powells: one who’s nominated for “Hit Man” and another one who actually goes by Maxwell in his day-to-day life. Max Braunstein won Austin’s Glen Powell lookalike contest and arrived midway through the red carpet with Miles Mitchell, aka the New York City Timothée Chalamet lookalike contest winner. Both men brandished signs that read “I won a lookalike contest and now I’m at the Golden Globes.” Their handler said the contest winners’ attendance was courtesy of CBS, the network broadcasting the awards show.\n\n'Wicked' star Ariana Grande rocks a new hair look at Golden Globes\n\nThe biggest blockbuster crashing this Oscar season is \"Wicked,\" which has amassed a $443.8 million domestic haul so far since November. We'll have to wait and see if an Oscar best-picture nomination is in store, but \"Wicked\" has a good chance of beating out \"Anora\" for best comedy/musical while Ariana Grande is a best bet for supporting actress. See more of our predictions here.\n\nGrande hit the Globes red carpet with a new hair color, a light brown dye job compared to her blonde Glinda locks, and was spotted hugging Miley Cyrus while in conversation with Sarah Paulson.\n\n'Emilia Pérez' could make Golden Globes history on Sunday\n\nNetflix's \"Emilia Pérez\" is up for 10 Globes but the most significant is in best actress in a comedy/musical. Karla Sofía Gascón has already made history as the first trans actor to be nominated in a film category and would mark another milestone if she were to win. (Fun fact: In 2022, \"Pose\" star Michaela Jaé Rodriguez became the first trans woman to win a Globe.)\n\nGascón is also predicted to be the first trans woman to earn a best actress Oscar nomination, a possibility she talked with USA TODAY about in November: “It would be absolutely wonderful and a real source of pride.\"\n\nWhen are the 2025 Oscars?\n\nOK, so Globe trophies are handed out tonight. But it's just the beginning for both winners and losers on the road to the Academy Awards. The next stop? Wednesday morning, when nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards will be announced.

However, he'll likely get bested by \"The Brutalist\" standout Adrien Brody in a stacked category.\n\nWho are the presenters at this year's Golden Globes?\n\nIt's not the Avengers but the Globes put together a superhero team to hand out trophies Sunday night, including Batman, Spider-Man, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Ghost Rider, Catwoman and the Penguin – or, as they're known off-screen, Michael Keaton, Andrew Garfield, Anthony Mackie, Gal Gadot, Nicolas Cage, Zoë Kravitz and Colin Farrell. \"The Substance\" co-stars Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley and \"Moana 2\" pair Dwayne Johnson and Auliʻi Cravalho will also be on hand to present honors alongside fellow luminaries like Colman Domingo, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ariana DeBose, Elton John, Glenn Close, Kerry Washington, Jeff Goldblum, Melissa McCarthy, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel and Viola Davis.\n\nHow do I watch the Golden Globes red carpet?\n\nThe E! network's \"Live From E!: Golden Globes\" special starts at 6 p.m. ET/3 PT, and \"Access Hollywood\" personality Zuri Hall and comedian Heather McMahan are taking over as hosts from the departing Laverne Cox. \"Entertainment Tonight\" and Variety are also co-hosting a digital pre-show (6:30 ET/3:30 PT) that will stream on Penske Media platforms.

She's also skewered Alec Baldwin and Rob Lowe, but Glaser found a new level of viral fame for brutally mocking Brady, an NFL legend, for his divorce from Gisele Bündchen. “The Golden Globes is not only a huge night for TV and film, but also for comedy,\" Glaser said in a statement.\n\nShe couldn't be any worse than last year's host Jo Koy, who notoriously bombed his Globes opening monologue. Glaser joins a long list of Golden emcees including Ricky Gervais, Jerrod Carmichael, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, and the dynamic duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.\n\nWhat time to the 2025 Golden Globes start?\n\nThe show will air live on CBS (8 p.m. ET/5 PT) as well as on the CBS app and Paramount+. There is a catch, however: Those with a Paramount+ subscription that includes Showtime can watch the Globes live, while subscribers with the cheaper Paramount+ Essential plan will have to wait until Monday. (It's worth springing for that extra five bucks a month: You get live Globes – woo-hoo! – plus no ads and Showtime series like \"The Agency,\" \"Yellowjackets\" and \"Dexter: Original Sin,\" a nifty 1990s-set prequel to the original \"Dexter.\")\n\nContributing: Marco della Cava, Brendan Morrow, KiMi Robinson and Jay Stahl", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/09/golden-globes-nominations-2025-live-updates/76768875007/", "title": "Golden Globes 2025 nominations live: 'Emilia Pérez' leads with 10", "text": "With no clear frontrunner, Monday's Golden Globes nominations started to put Oscar season in focus.\n\nNetflix's crime thriller musical \"Emilia Pérez\" leads the movie field with 10 total nods going into the 82nd Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 5, the first major awards show of 2025.

And, let me tell you, they had everything.\n\nThere was drama. (See: Jay-Z clapping back at the Recording Academy for snubbing his wife Beyoncé.) There was shock. (Thank you for the new album announcement, Taylor Swift!) And there were tears. (JoniMitchell, we don't deserve you.)\n\nKiller Mike was led out of the Crypto.com Arena in handcuffs, while Swift also made history as the first person to win album of the year four times. And Lainey Wilson, Miley Cyrus and Karol G claimed their first Grammys on music's biggest night.\n\nHere are the biggest updates, along with our unfiltered reactions of the awards show on CBS.\n\nTaylor Swift is 'mind-blown' after becoming first person ever to win album of the year four times\n\nYou know, I’m starting to think karma may really be her boyfriend. Nothing seems to get in the way of Taylor Swift's total music (and world) domination. The artist became the first person to win album of the year four times. “I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life, but I feel this happy when I finish a song,” she said, noting she was feeling \"mind blown.\" “For me, the award is the work.” She accepted the honor from Céline Dion, who made a surprise appearance as presenter following her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis. “I really mean it from my heart: Those that have been blessed enough to be here… must never take for granted the tremendous love and joy that music brings to our lives and to people all around the world,” Dion said.\n\nNeed a break?

After her fun, lively and seemingly Tina-Turner-inspired performance of “Flowers,” she returned to claim the trophy for record of the year for the same song. In her speech, she reminded everyone that, even though not everyone can win a Grammy, everyone is “spectacular” and trophies don’t define success. (Are you listening, Jay-Z?) After some quick thank you’s, she quipped: “I don’t think I forgot anyone, but I might have forgotten underwear. Bye!”\n\nMore:Miley Cyrus just won the first Grammy of her career\n\nEarlier, she spoke on behalf of all Los Angeles residents when she confessed she almost missed her first ever Grammys win due to heavy rain traffic. “This is just too iconic,” she said onstage beside Mariah Carey, accepting the award for best pop solo performance for “Flowers.\" “I just got stuck in the rain in traffic and thought I was going to miss this moment.” Anybody who has ever braved an LA freeway during a light drizzle knows exactly what she’s talking about.\n\nJay-Z uses 'thank you' speech to say his wife Beyoncé deserves album of the year\n\nWhile accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, Jay-Z used his acceptance speech to call out the Recording Academy's snubs against his wife, Beyoncé. \"We love y'all. We want y'all to get it right,\" he said. \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\" Though the Bey-Hive will surely eat this moment up, it's hard to feel much sympathy for a mega-wealthy, mega-awarded artist complaining at an awards show that his wife − also a mega-wealthy, mega-awarded artist − is actually entitled to more trophies.\n\nMore:Jay-Z calls out Grammys over Beyoncé snubs: 'We want y'all to get it right'\n\nJoni Mitchell silences and stuns crowd with 'Both Sides Now'\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is what the Grammys – and, dare I say, music itself – is all about. The most powerful moment of the broadcast came in the most simple, elegant performance of the night – something that’s become an unfortunate rarity at a show that tends to favor big dance numbers and pyrotechnics. Sitting in a regal chair and singing her soaring, timeless song “Both Sides, Now,” Joni Mitchell transported the Crypto.com Arena, and all of us watching at home, to a different place entirely. She sang with humility, grace and, most of all, a deep, deep love for music. It was moving. It was honest. It was unifying. It was everything a Grammys performance should be. Not to mention it was her first time performing at the ceremony ever too!\n\nDuring the premiere ceremony, Mitchell, 80, who suffered a brain aneurysm in 2015 that left her temporarily unable to walk or talk won for best folk album for \"Joni Mitchell at Newport (Live).\" Walking out onto the stage with a cane, Mitchell beamed at the crowd before giving a brief, humble thank you.\n\nMore:Joni Mitchell, 80, offers a stunning 'Both Sides, Now' for first Grammys performance\n\nVictoria Monét wins best new artist\n\nVictoria Monét won best new artist, beating out fellow nominees Gracie Abrams, Fred again, Jelly Roll, Coco Jones and Noah Kahan. Born Victoria Monét McCants, the artist came into the ceremony with seven Grammy nominations — behind only SZA with nine — and in the pre-show awards, she won best R&B album and best engineered album for \"Jaguar II\" but lost traditional R&B performance to PJ Morton.\n\nOprah, Fantasia honor Tina Turner in raucous In Memoriam segment\n\nThe In Memoriam segment, usually a somber montage honoring artists who've died, turned into a rousing concert, closing out with a lively tribute to Tina Turner, intro'd by Oprah Winfrey and ending with high-energy performance of \"Proud Mary\" by Fantasia. The number got everyone on their feet, and the energy could be felt through the screen. Detractors will surely say the segment should have been more subdued, but no one can deny Fantasia put on a good show.\n\nAnnie Lennox calls for Israel, Palestine ceasefire in middle of In Memoriam segment\n\nAnother potentially controversial In Memoriam moment? Annie Lennox ending her tribute to Sinéad O'Connor with a reference to the war between Israel and Palestine. \"Artists for ceasefire! Peace in the world!\" she exclaimed after her song.\n\nTaylor Swift announces new album 'The Tortured Poets Department' coming in April\n\nLeave it to Taylor Swift to zig when we all thought she would zag. After seeming to tease the re-recording of her album “Reputation” with a website crash earlier today, she ended up revealing she’s dropping a new album entirely instead. “This is my 13th Grammy, which is my lucky number,” Swift said, after winning best pop vocal album for “Midnights. “I know the way the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans. So I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the last two years, which is that my brand new album comes out April 19. It’s called 'The Tortured Poets Department.' I’m gonna go and post the cover right now backstage.\" Well, OK then!\n\nMore:Taylor Swift announces brand-new album at Grammys: 'Tortured Poets Department'\n\nLainey Wilson, from farmer's daughter to Grammy winner\n\nLainey Wilson joined Karol G and Miley Cyrus in the Grammy first-timers club. During her acceptance speech for best country album for \"Bell Bottom Country,\" Wilson, a fifth generation farmer's daughter from a town of 200, gave a winding extended metaphor about how making an album is a lot like farming, or something like that. “Sometimes when you find the right farming community, you can find the harvest of a lifetime,\" she said. I have never farmed before, but I trust her completely.\n\nKiller Mike wins Grammys but leaves in handcuffs\n\nKiller Mike's triumphant run at the Grammys took a turn after the rapper was handcuffed. Shortly after winning three awards during the pre-show ceremony, he was escorted out of the Crypto.com arena in handcuffs by a squad of police officers, video shared by The Hollywood Reporter's Chris Gardner on X shows. It's unclear if the rapper was arrested or will return for the live ceremony. USA TODAY has reached out to reps for Killer Mike, the Recording Academy and the Los Angeles Police Department. Killer Mike won Grammys for best rap song and best rap performance for his song \"Scientists and Engineers\" and best rap album for \"Michael.\"\n\nMore:Killer Mike escorted out of Grammys in handcuffs after winning 3 awards\n\nKarol G wins 'the first of so many' Grammys\n\nLet's go, Karol G! The Colombian singer and songwriter became a first-time Grammy winner, taking home the trophy for best música urbana album for her album \"Mañana Será Bonito.\" \"I promise you to give you my best always, and I hope this is the first of so many,\" she said onstage. It's been less than an hour, and we've already seen career firsts for two major artists. At this rate, who knows what will else will happen?\n\nTrevor Noah opening monologue: A Taylor Swift joke she actually laughs at\n\nAt the Golden Globes, you could practically hear a pin drop when host Jo Koy made a joke about the frequent Taylor Swift cutaways at NFL games. That joke didn't seem to land with the pop star then, who took a cold sip from her cup while staring daggers at the comedian. Lucky for Trevor Noah, Swift seemed to have found her sense of humor in time for the Grammys, laughing when he joked that every time he mentions Swift's name, the broadcast should cut to a former NFL player. The camera then focused on a befuddled Terry Crews. Noah stayed mostly complimentary throughout his opening monologue. Was he pandering a little to the A-listers? Sure, but it was no disaster, which, in the realm of award shows, should be counted as a win.\n\nTaylor Swift website crashes. Are we getting 'Reputation (Taylor's Version)' soon?\n\nApparently not. Swift's website crashed Sunday afternoon for about two hours, and Swifties believed the site was riddled with Easter eggs teasing the long-anticipated announcement of the re-release of her sixth album \"Reputation (Taylor's Version).\" Swift's website appeared to show an error message hours before the Grammys. The first line was \"Error 321 Backend fetch failed.\" (Error 321 is a communication error that would appear on a fax machine with a poor telephone line connection.) \"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now\" is a line from Swift's track \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" the lead single on \"Reputation.\" Turns out, however, Swift had other plans, announcing an entirely new album instead.\n\nJack Antonoff ties Babyface's record, gives shoutout to Taylor Swift\n\nWith his win for best producer of the year, non-classical, Jack Antonoff joined Babyface as the only person to win the category three times in a row. During his acceptance speech, which rounded out the premiere ceremony, Antonoff thanked his wife Margaret Qualley and others who have supported him in his career, including his collaborator Taylor Swift. \"We made a song called 'Out of the Woods' for '1989,' and, when I was waiting for that call that says, 'OK, now this goes to some big-name person,' she said, 'Let's mix this...,' \" he said. \"I love you to death, Taylor.\"\n\nMichelle Obama makes Grammys history\n\nThat’s double-Grammy-winner Michelle Obama to you! The former first lady took home the Grammy for best audio book, narration and storytelling recording for “The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times.” It’s the second time she’s won a Grammy (she won in 2020 for \"Becoming), making her the only former first lady with two wins.\n\nGrammys red carpet sees stars brave the rain\n\nIt’s the calm before the storm inside the massive white tent housing the Grammys red carpet, anyway. Outside, the downpour that meteorologists have promised all week has commenced. We are in the sweet spot on the carpet between artists attending the Grammys pre-show and the televised ceremony, and a few notable faces, including Josh Groban, boygenius and Victoria Monét, have made quick appearances. With two hours to go until the ceremony, things are certain to start heating up soon. –KiMi Robinson\n\nThe Beatles win best music video at the Grammys\n\nThe Beatles may have broken up about five decades ago, but they still can’t stop winning Grammys! The group won best music video at the premiere ceremony for their 1966 song “I’m Only Sleeping,” which got an official music video in November 2022. “I can’t believe I get to say this: I’d like to thank John, Paul, George and Ringo!” the video’s director Em Cooper exclaimed in her acceptance speech.\n\n'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer' win back-to-back Grammy honors\n\nWhat was that? You thought the Barbenheimer double features had finally come to an end? Well, think again: “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” which dominated theaters last summer, won back-to-back at the Grammys premiere ceremony. “Barbie the Album” won best compilation soundtrack for visual media and “Oppenheimer” for best score soundtrack for visual media. Billie Eilish and Finneas also made an early appearance to accept their award for best song written for visual media for their “Barbie” song “What Was I Made For?” “Making this song saved me a little bit,” Eilish said of the soft ballad in their acceptance speech.\n\nPentatonix, Sheila E., Jordin Sparks and more kick off early Grammys ceremony with rousing opening number\n\nWell, that got started with a bang! If downtown Los Angeles was feeling sleepy amid this uncharacteristic rain, it better be awake now after the opening number of the premiere ceremony. J. Ivy, Pentatonix, Larkin Poe, Jordin Sparks and Sheila E. took the stage for a rousing set that seemed to jolt the theater awake, ending with a booming drum solo from Sheila E. while Sparks belted for her life. Let’s hope that energy lasts, because the Grammy ceremonies are going to unfold over for the course of the next nine hours.\n\nWho votes for the Grammys?\n\nThe Illuminati − just kidding (kind of). Voting members of the Recording Academy do. These members, according to the organization's website, \"are composed of a pool of vetted and venerable performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, instrumentalists, and other creators currently working in the recording industry.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/12/22/famous-people-iowa-celebrities-actors-authors-ashton-kutcher-john-wayne/6447769001/", "title": "54 famous people from Iowa you'll want to know", "text": "As Iowans have not only shaped the course of their own state's history but that of the nation and — on occasion — the world.

From there, he began appearing in films including the 2001 release of \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n\n6 fictional characters from Iowa\n\nIowans really are everywhere, not content to be constrained to the realm of the real.

In 2007, HBO’s “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee” was named Outstanding Made for Television Movie.\n\n“Reservation Dogs” — co-created and executive produced by Taika Waititi, an Oscar-winning New Zealand moviemaker who is of Maori ancestry, and Harjo, a longtime independent filmmaker who is Seminole and Muscogee — isn't just considered groundbreaking for spotlighting Indigenous talents in front of the camera. The FX series, which streams on Hulu, is regarded as the first mainstream TV show on which every writer, director and series regular performer is Indigenous.\n\nAs an executive producer on both “Reservation Dogs” and “What We Do in the Shadows,” Waititi has the rare distinction of being double-nominated in the Outstanding Comedy Series category. (He was previously double-nominated in 2020 for Outstanding Comedy Series for \"What We Do in the Shadows\" and for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance for playing IG-11 on Disney+’s \"The Mandalorian.\")\n\nAlong with the four nods for \"Reservation Dogs,\" Indigenous actresses Lily Gladstone and Kali Reis are making history with their first Primetime Emmy nominations.\n\nAn Academy Award nominee for the Oklahoma-made film \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" and two-time \"Reservation Dogs\" guest star, Gladstone is nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her turn as a cop in Hulu’s “Under the Bridge.\" Reis earned a nomination in the same category for playing an Alaska state trooper HBO/Max’s “True Detective: Night Country.”\n\nTheir dual nods mark the first time any Indigenous women have been nominated for acting Emmys, according to Variety.\n\nBefore Wednesday's nods for Woon-A-Tai, Gladstone and Reis, the only other Indigenous nominee in any acting category was the late August Schellenberg, the Canadian Mohawk actor who starred in “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.” He received an Emmy nomination in 2007 for his performance as Sitting Bull in the telefilm.\n\nWhat is 'Reservation Dogs' about?\n\nFilmed primarily in and around Okmulgee, \"Reservation Dogs\" follows the misadventures of tight-knit teens Bear Smallhill (Woon-A-Tai), Elora Danan Postoak (Devery Jacobs), Willie Jack Sampson (Paulina Alexis) and Cheese Williams (Oklahoman Lane Factor) and their colorful community in the fictional small reservation town of Okern, Oklahoma.\n\nThe coming-of-age comedy is considered the first full-time, scripted network TV series to film almost entirely in Oklahoma.\n\nWith its Outstanding Comedy Series nod, \"Reservation Dogs\" is nominated in one of the top Emmy categories alongside the fellow FX series \"The Bear\" and “What We Do in the Shadows;\" ABC's \"Abbott Elementary;\" HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm;\" Max's \"Hacks;\" Hulu's \"Only Murders in the Building;\" and Apple TV+'s freshman series \"Palm Royale.\"\n\nThe third and final season of \"Reservation Dogs\" debuted on Hulu last August, with the 10th and final episode premiering in late September on the streaming service.\n\nThe series garnered widespread critical acclaim and blazed new trails for Indigenous storytelling during its three-season run on Hulu. It has been been recognized by the Peabody Awards, Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, Spirit Awards, Writers Guild Awards and American Film Institute.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's 2024 Emmy nominations announcement, though, \"Reservation Dogs\" had received scant love from the Television Academy, with just a single previous Emmy nomination in the technical categories, for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation in 2023. But that prize went to \"The Bear\" during the Creative Arts Emmy ceremonies.\n\nWhen are the 2024 Primetime Emmy Awards?\n\nFX's new drama series \"Shōgun,\" adapted from James Clavell's novel of the same name, earned a leading 25 nominations for the 2024 Primetime Emmy Awards. The network's hit \"The Bear,\" which released its third season last month, dished up 23 nods, setting a record for the most nominations by a comedy series in one year.\n\nThe 2024 Emmy Awards will be broadcast live on Sunday, Sept. 15, on ABC.\n\nPlus, the Television Academy's Creative Arts and Governors Gala ceremonies will take place Sept. 7-8.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/02/28/golden-globes-2021-winners-live/6825739002/", "title": "Golden Globes 2021: 'Nomadland,' 'Borat 2,' Andra Day win big prizes", "text": "Kicking off the strangest awards season of all time, road drama \"Nomadland\" and mockumentary sequel \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\" took home big honors at Sunday night's glitchy Golden Globes.\n\nIn a hybrid virtual/in-person ceremony hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, \"Nomadland\" won best drama and director (Chloe Zhao), while the \"Borat\" sequel nabbed best comedy and top actor in a comedy or musical (Sacha Baron Cohen).

'Borat' sequel is victorious for best comedy\n\n\"Thank you to the all-white Hollywood Foreign Press,\" Sacha Baron Cohen quips during his acceptance speech. He honors his \"incredible\" co-star Maria Bakalova but first paid tribute to the real comedy find of his movie, Rudy Giuliani. \"Who could get more laughs out of one unzipping?\"\n\nChloe Zhao takes best director for 'Nomadland'\n\n\"Thank you for making beautiful, beautiful movies,\" says Chloe Zhao, toasting her fellow nominees as she becomes the first Asian woman to win the category and the first woman to win it since Barbra Streisand did for \"Yentl\" in 1984. For the first time in Globes history, three women (Zhao, Emerald Fennell for \"Promising Young Woman\" and Regina King for \"One Night in Miami\") were nominated in the category. And like earlier, \"Mank\" filmmaker David Fincher took another shot out of his glass.\n\nGolden Globes' best and worst moments:From Tina and Amy's jokes to Chadwick Boseman's emotional win\n\nThe night's biggest losers:Glenn Close, Frances McDormand and the Globes voters\n\nChadwick Boseman receives a posthumous Globe for 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'\n\nChadwick Boseman's widow Taylor Simone Ledward gives a tearful salute to her late husband, the recipient of best actor in a drama. \"He would thank God. He would thank his parents. He would thank his ancestors for their guidance and sacrifices,\" she says. \"He would say something beautiful, something inspiring. ...

DeMille Award\n\n\"I'm so moved to receive this honor,\" Jane Fonda says in a speech that honors and calls for more diversity in Hollywood. \"Stories have a way of changing our hearts and our minds,\" she says, noting that she has been inspired by films like \"Nomadland,\" which showed \"the wanderers among us,\" and the immigrant tale of \"Minari.\" She concludes by saying more people need to be offered a seat at the table and in the room where decisions are made: \"Let's all of us make an effort to expand that tent.\"\n\n'The Crown' wins No. 3 and it's a big one: best drama series\n\nThat sound you hear is Baby Yoda crying: Instead of \"The Mandalorian,\" Netflix's \"The Crown\" takes best drama. Which means you REALLY should binge it now.\n\nShut out of best drama competition, 'Minari' wins foreign language film\n\nOne of the Golden Globes' most head-scratching moves this year was putting the acclaimed \"Minari\" – a very American film about a Korean family – in the foreign-language category, but it won there anyway. \"I hope we all learn how to speak this language of love to each other, especially this year,\" says the film's very happy director, Lee Isaac Chung.\n\nJosh O'Connor grabs another honor for 'The Crown'\n\n\"Crown\" gets its second award of the night, and \"that's quite a surprise,\" says Josh O'Connor, who wins best TV actor in a drama for playing Prince Charles. Now's the time to binge on the royal family if you haven't already. (Maybe after \"Bridgerton.\")\n\n'I Care A Lot' star Rosamund Pike receives comedy actress honor\n\n\"Ladies, I salute you,\" Rosamund Pike says accepting her Globe for best actress in a comedy or musical. \"Wow. I bet it looks like I care a lot. I do!\" She also adds that having to swim up from a sunken car was still \"better than being in a room with Rudy Giuliani,\" a cheeky nod to fellow nominee Maria Bakalova's \"Borat\" sequel scene.\n\nJason Sudeikis wins best TV comedy actor for 'Ted Lasso,' 'Schitt's Creek' gets best comedy\n\n\"Do I talk now?\" Jason Sudeikis says when he comes on to accept his honor. \"That's nuts, that's crazy.\" He gives a shout-out to his \"Ted Lasso\" cast: \"I know for a fact that they make me better.\" But \"Schitt's Creek\" upends \"Lasso\" for the best comedy honor. Star Dan Levy also calls for an infusion of inclusion before next year's ceremony: \"There is so much more to be celebrated.\"\n\nDiane Warren nabs original song Globe, 'Soul' takes best score\n\nNetflix's \"The Life Ahead\" gets its first Globe, for Diane Warren's tune \"Io Si (Seen),\" while Jon Batiste, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross accept best original score for Pixar's \"Soul.\"\n\nEmma Corrin takes best TV drama actress for 'The Crown'\n\n\"What?!\" Emma Corrin says happily for getting her Globe for \"The Crown.\" She also honors her character, Princess Diana: \"You have taught me compassion and empathy beyond what I could ever imagine.\"\n\nNorman Lear receives the Carol Burnett Award for his TV legacy\n\nNorman Lear made plenty of folks chuckle over the years with sitcoms like \"All in the Family\" and \"The Jeffersons,\" but paid special tribute to the woman whose name is on his newest award. \"Laughter adds to one’s life,\" he says, \"and no one’s made me laugh more than Carol Burnett.\"\n\nAaron Sorkin snags screenplay honors for 'The Trial of the Chicago 7,' David Fincher takes a shot\n\n\"This is very nice but it can't top the honor of being nominated beside these four screenplays,\" Aaron Sorkin says accepting his screenplay Globe for \"Chicago 7.\" He also mentions that his fellow nominees, Emerald Fennell (\"Promising Young Woman\") and Chloe Zhao (\"Nomadland\"), inspire Sorkin's daughter to be a filmmaker, \"and I'm never going to forgive you for that.\"\n\nA funny thing that happened on the filmmaker Zoom: When Sorkin was named the winner, a smiling David Fincher (whose late father Jack was nominated for \"Mank\") took a shot.\n\nMark Ruffalo gets Globe for 'I Know This Much Is True'\n\nThe award for best actor in a limited series goes to Mark Ruffalo for his dual roles in HBO's \"I Know This Much Is True.\" \"These are my peers, these are the people I look up to, so I'm honored to be here with you guys,\" he says, also thanking his family members who \"let me go off and bring these crazy (characters) home.\"\n\nHFPA promises to do better with member representation\n\nAfter getting pummeled in the press and by their own Globes hosts, Hollywood Foreign Press Association members took the stage to announce that Black journalists need to be a part of their group. \"We must also ensure that everyone from all underrepresented communities gets a seat at our table and we are going to make that happen,\" says former HFPA president Meher Tatna.\n\nBest animated film goes to Pixar's 'Soul'\n\nWe have already reached Zoom awards inception: While director Pete Docter accepts the animated film Globe for \"Soul,\" he holds up his phone so writer Kemp Powers can weigh in as well.\n\n'Schitt's Creek' star Catherine O'Hara wins best actress in a comedy\n\n\"This is great, thank you so much,\" Catherine O'Hara says when taking best actress in a TV comedy while her husband Bo Welch has strange applause noises coming out of his phone that are more distracting than helpful.\n\nJohn Boyega takes supporting honor for 'Small Axe'\n\n\"Do I just talk automatically?\" John Boyega says when coming on to accepting his award for supporting actor in a TV movie for his role in \"Red White and Blue,\" part of Steve McQueen's \"Small Axe\" anthology.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya wins best supporting actor for 'Judas and the Black Messiah'\n\nDaniel Kaluuya won the first Globe of the night, best supporting actor for \"Judas and the Black Messiah,\" and – maybe a sign of the times – either his mute was on during his virtual acceptance speech or there was a glitch. \"You're doing me dirty!\" he says once the snafu is fixed. He then thanks his \"leader and general,\" director Shaka King, \"for your inspiration.\"\n\nTina Fey and Amy Poehler take on COVID, HFPA in their opening monologue\n\nTina Fey and Amy Poehler open the show taking on COVID-era life, the lack of Black members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (\"You guys have to change that,\" Fey warns), and the fact that \"smoking hot\" first responders are in the live bicoastal audience instead of the usual A-listers like Meryl Streep and Brad Pitt. \"Thank you for being here so the celebrities can stay safe at home,\" Fey says. The twosome also run down a bunch of the nominated movies in play, like Pixar's animated \"Soul,\" where a Black character's soul gets put into a cat. \"The HFPA really responded to the movie because they do have five cat members,\" says Fey (who actually stars in \"Soul\").\n\nGolden Globes fashion is still fierce, even virtually\n\nEven though it's not a traditional carpet at the virtual Globes, those \"attending\" like Sarah Hyland, Angela Bassett and Amanda Seyfried still manage to look stunning.\n\nPre-show with Jane Lynch, Susan Kelechi Watson honors Chadwick Boseman\n\nWith no red carpet this year, Jane Lynch and Susan Kelechi Watson (\"This Is Us\") are anchoring NBC's pre-show and interviewing celebrities virtually, including Globe nominees Carey Mulligan and Leslie Odom Jr. as well as \"Law & Order\" star Christopher Meloni. Meloni shared a memory of meeting the late Chadwick Boseman, a Globe nominee for \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" when getting \"baseball lessons\" on the set of \"42.\"\n\n\"He was doing batting practice and I was hitting grounders to some stunt guys and I didn't know him. I walked up to him and I introduced myself. I was so happy for him, a young man, chance of a lifetime playing Jackie Robinson,\" Meloni said. \"Not only was he a great actor but he was an even better human being. His passing affected me deeply.\"\n\nSpike Lee's children are this year's Golden Globes ambassadors\n\nWhile Spike Lee's \"Da 5 Bloods\" may have been snubbed by the Globes, at least his family wasn't: Last month, Lee's kids were named ambassadors for Sunday's ceremony. Satchel, 26, and Jackson, 23, are the children of the director and his wife, producer Tonya Lewis Lee, who married in 1993. They are the first siblings of color to be named Globes ambassadors, and Jackson is the first Black male ambassador.\n\nCould Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Borat' sequel have the last Globes laugh?\n\nThe original \"Borat\" won star Sacha Baron Cohen a Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy or musical in 2007. Could its sequel have a \"very nice\" night Sunday? It's possible. Cohen is nominated again in the same category for \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,\" his scene-stealing co-star Maria Bakalova (best known for that cringe-y episode with Rudy Giuliani) is up for best comedy actress, and the movie's a strong contender for best comedy or musical.\n\nJane Fonda thanks fellow Globes honoree Norman Lear for help\n\nOn Sunday night, two Hollywood legends will receive special achievement honors at the Globes: Norman Lear is getting the Carol Burnett Award while Jane Fonda is the latest recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award. In a virtual discussion last week, Fonda thanked Lear for lending her a hand during the fallout from her 1972 trip to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.\n\n\"At the height of my being 'controversial' and I wasn't getting hired very much, you invited me to be to be on stage with John Wayne\" for the launch of the advocacy group People for the American Way, said Fonda. \"That meant the world to me, because that was not happening to me very often then. You went out of your way to send me a signal that I was still acceptable in the Hollywood crowd.\"\n\nWe miss the red carpet at the Globes, too\n\nUnfortunately, fashionistas don't have a lot to look forward to with no traditional red carpet at this year's Globes – and probably for most of the awards shows this season. For a high fashion fix, check out our gallery of the best Globes gowns ever.\n\nGlenn Close is favored yet again for Netflix's 'Hillbilly Elegy'\n\nSo what if the Netflix drama didn't get great reviews? You can never count out Glenn Close, an awards-season fave. Transformed into a tough-love grandma, Close is a strong contender to win her fourth career Globe. The supporting-actress category also includes Olivia Colman (“The Father”), Jodie Foster (\"The Mauritanian”), Amanda Seyfried (“Mank”) and Helena Zengel (“News of the World”).\n\nWhat's the Globes controversy over voting?\n\nOn its biggest night, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association – the group behind the Golden Globes – will also have to weather the fallout from the revelation via the Los Angeles Times this past week that the organization doesn't have any Black members. (The last time a Black person was counted among its ranks: 1987.) It's a problem that looks even worse when one considers snubs of \"Da 5 Bloods\" and other Black-led movies in the Globes' best picture categories.\n\nOn Friday, the advocacy organization Time's Up launched the #TIMESUPGlobes alongside a graphic that reads, \"Hollywood Foreign Press Association: Not a Single Black Member Out of 87.\" And many Hollywood personalities shared the protest on social media, including Shonda Rhimes, Ava DuVernay, Judd Apatow and Sterling K. Brown. \"Having a multitude of Black presenters does not absolve you of your lack of diversity,” Brown said Saturday on Instagram. “This is your moment to do the right thing. It is my hope that you will.”\n\nIt's hard to imagine Tina Fey and Amy Poehler won't take aim at the issue in their opening monologue. Meanwhile, the HFPA has said it will address the controversy during Sunday's awards broadcast.\n\nIs Chadwick Boseman bound for posthumous Oscar glory?\n\nUsually, at least one actor runs the table at the Globes, Screen Actors Guild and Oscars, and 2021 could be it for Chadwick Boseman, who died last year at age 43 of colon cancer. His nominated role for \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\" is a highlight in a career cut short early and he's favorite at Sunday's Globes. Only two other actors have posthumous Academy Awards – Peter Finch in 1977 for \"Network\" and Heath Ledger in 2009 for \"The Dark Knight\" – and both also took home Globes that same year.\n\nGlobes hosts and presenters will be live, winners are at home\n\nDue to COVID, this year's show will look very different than usual. The hosts will be bicoastal – Tina Fey at the Rainbow Room in New York City, Amy Poehler at the Los Angeles' Beverly Hilton – as will the bevy of presenters. That group includes Awkwafina, Kevin Bacon, Michael Douglas, Tiffany Haddish, Kate Hudson, Joaquin Phoenix, Margot Robbie, Kristen Wiig, Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\nThe nominees, however, will be all over the world and making their victory speeches virtually, be it in their tux or pajamas.\n\nWhat time are the Golden Globes?\n\nIf you're old school, the three-hour Globes ceremony airs live on NBC at 8 ET/PT. If you'd rather stream the show, it's also available on the Roku Channel, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV, Sling TV and Fubo TV. (If they're new to you, check out and see which have free trials.) And if you're just too busy on Sunday, the Globes will stream Monday on NBC/Universal's Peacock service.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/television/2021/07/13/emmys-2021-nominees/7952233002/", "title": "Emmy nominations 2021: What they got right and wrong", "text": "The 2021 Emmy nominations are a tribute to the lifelines that kept us entertained during the COVID-19 quarantine.\n\nWe're talking the steamy heat of \"Bridgerton,\" the scary drama of \"Lovecraft Country,\" the chess moves and plot twists of \"The Queen's Gambit\" ... and much, much more.\n\nWhen the nominations were announced Tuesday, both Netflix’s “The Crown” and the Disney+ series “The Mandalorian” grabbed 24 of them, the most for a single series.\n\nFollowing closely behind was \"WandaVision\" — the Disney+ nostalgia-TV mashup/Marvel superhero saga — with 23.\n\nAlthough 2020 wasn't the best year ever for TV, there's a good argument to be made that it was the most important one in the history of the medium.\n\nBroadcast, cable and streaming platforms became gathering places for people dealing with fear and isolation during the pandemic. There were no couch potatoes last year, only passengers on sofa lifeboats headed for a safe harbor.\n\nHere's a look at the nominees who'll be competing during the Sept. 19 ceremony airing on CBS — and some who weren't chosen, but still deserve our heartfelt thanks.\n\nNicest nominee: \"Ted Lasso\" was showered with 20 nominations for pulling off the minor miracle of promoting kindness and empathy when we needed them most.\n\nMeanest nominee: Josh O'Connor of \"The Crown\" could win his first Emmy for so perfectly capturing the narcissism and self-pity of Prince Charles after his marriage to Lady Di. (But we're certain he's pleasant in real life.)\n\nBest recognition of smart talk: In the variety/talk category, four shows were singled out that had the hardest-hitting political critiques: \"The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\" on Comedy Central, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on ABC, \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\" on HBO and \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\" \"Conan\" on TBS, which stuck to sillier realms, was also included — likely as a love letter to its final season.\n\nBest recognition of Smart moves: At 69, Jean Smart is having one of her best career seasons ever. The stellar actress is up for best comedy actress for HBO Max's \"Hacks,\" where she plays a veteran comedian facing unspoken age discrimination, and for best supporting actress in a limited or anthology series or movie for HBO's \"Mare of Easttown,\" where she was Mare's loving but irritating-to-her-durder mother.\n\nMost versatile transportation: It's a thriller. It's a drama. Actually, it's a ... laughfest? \"The Flight Attendent\" earned nods for comedy, actress for Kaley Cuoco and supporting actress for Rosie Perez, among others. You know, a dramedy category could solve these problems.\n\nMost successful unappreciated series: HBO may have canceled \"Lovecraft Country,\" but don't be surprised if it finds another happy home. The sci-fi drama earned an impressive 18 nominations, including ones for lead actors Jurnee Smollett and Jonathan Majors.\n\nBest 'SNL' appreciation: This year, the Emmys doubly recognized the long-running sketch show's two secret weapons: Kenan Thompson and Aidy Bryant. The versatile Thompson is in the running as an actor for both \"SNL\" and his NBC sitcom \"Kenan,\" while the adorable Bryant is up for \"SNL\" and Hulu's \"Shrill.\"\n\nBest indication Peacock could survive: The writing nominations for \"The Amber Ruffin Show\" and \"Girls5Eva\" are your hint to discover the NBC spin-off streaming network that's also home to \"Rutherford Falls.\" Triple high-quality alert!\n\nBiggest snub: \"Small Axe,\" the British anthology series from director Steven McQueen that chronicles West Indian immigrants in London, was a huge hit with critics. But the Amazon Prime Video standout only got a cinematography nod. Sure, it looked great, but what about the great acting (especially by John Boyega), writing and direction?\n\nMost persistent controversial pick: When the Golden Globes chose \"Emily in Paris\" as a comedy nominee, you could blame the foreign press for getting it wrong. But the Netflix comedy made the same good impression on Emmy voters. Still, putting it in a category shared by substantial comedies such as \"Black-ish,\" \"Ted Lasso\" and \"Pen15\" is like serving an eclair as a main course.\n\nMost history-making inclusion for drama: Kudos to Mj Rodriguez of FX's \"Pose,\" who becomes the first trans performer to be nominated in a lead acting category.\n\nMost history-making inclusion for comedy: \"Saturday Night Live” emerging star Bowen Yang is the first featured player (the step before becoming a regular cast member) to be nominated. Yang, who made a big impression last season with his “Weekend Update” segment as the Titanic’s iceberg, is also the first Chinese -American man to be nominated for a supporting actor Emmy, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMost surprising superstar exclusion: Hugh Grant got a nod for HBO's \"The Undoing,\" but not Nicole Kidman?\n\nMost difficult category for choosing a favorite: Most every category has strong contenders. But the limited series nominees are deserving of a five-way tie. How do you choose a winner from HBO's \"I May Destroy You\" and \"Mare of Easttown,\" Netflix's \"The Queen's Gambit,\" Amazon Prime Video's \"The Underground Railroad\" and Disney+'s \"WandaVision\"?\n\nBest Detroit shout-out: Until the movie \"Respect\" starring Jennifer Hudson comes out Aug. 13, the current winner of the best Aretha Franklin portrayal is Cynthia Erivo, who was nominated for best actress in a limited or anthology series or movie for National Geographic's \"Genius: Aretha.\" Don't forget the Motor City legend she portrayed. But who ever could?\n\nSecond- and third-best Detroit shout-out: Congrats to Courtney B. Vance, who hails from Detroit, for his guest actor nod for \"Lovecraft Country,\" and to Renee Elise Goldsberry, a former Detroiter and Cranbrook alum, for her supporting actress nomination for \"Hamilton.\" If only Goldsberry — and her new Peacock comedy — also had gotten nods for \"Girls5Eva.\"\n\nBiggest Michigan snub: The Golden Globes nominated Jeff Daniels for playing James Comey in Showtime's \"The Comey Rule.\" How hard would it have been for the Emmys to do the same for Chelsea's favorite son — and let him wear the dad shirt again that wowed at the Globes?\n\nBest \"Bridgerton\" nod: While it certainly merits a drama nomination and nobody would argue with actor nominee Rege-Jean Page's impact on the show, \"Bridgerton\" is almost guaranteed to win the gold for Julie Andrews, a contender for best character voice-over performance for her narration as the elusive Lady Whistledown.\n\nBest film nominated as a TV movie: Amazon Prime Video's \"Uncle Frank\" starring Paul Bettany is nominated for an Emmy, but it had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Discuss amongst yourselves.\n\nBest film nominated as a variety special (pre-recorded): Disney+'s \"Hamilton.\" Yet several actors from \"Hamilton\" are competing in the limited series or movie category. Now this is getting ridiculous!\n\nToughest co-star contest: The supporting actress in a drama category has three cast members from \"The Crown\" (Gillian Anderson, Helena Bonham Carter and Emerald Fennell) and four co-stars from \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (Madeline Brewer, Ann Dowd, Yvonne Strahovski and Samira Wiley). The only person who doesn't have to feel conflicted about rooting for herself is remaining nominee Aunjanue Ellis of \"Lovecraft Country.\"\n\nBest crown nod not associated with \"The Crown\": \"Oprah with Megan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special,\" which is included in the hosted non-fiction series or special category.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture writer Julie Hinds at jhinds@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/11/golden-globes-news/21585993/", "title": "'Boyhood' wins top honors at Golden Globes", "text": "Brian Truitt\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nRichard Linklater's long journey to complete Boyhood is beginning to look pretty worthwhile.\n\nThe movie cemented its status as an Oscar frontrunner Sunday at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. Boyhood was named best drama, Linklater won for best director and his star Patricia Arquette won for supporting actress for her portrayal of an underappreciated single mother.\n\n\"This is a very personal film for me, it couldn't be more personal, and it became very personal to everyone who worked on it,\" said Linklater, who filmed the coming-of-age movie once a year for 12 years.\n\n\"We're all flawed in this world, no one's perfect,\" he added, dedicating the director award to his parents and parents \"who are evolving everywhere and families who are just passing through this world and doing their best.\"\n\nArquette thanked her \"visionary\" director \"for allowing me to be part of something so human, so simple and groundbreaking and significant in the history of cinema\" and \"for shining a light on this woman and the many women like her and for allowing me to honor my own mother with this incredible character.\"\n\n\n\nMichael Keaton won for best actor in a musical or comedy and was one of two awards for Birdman, which also garnered best screenplay. It didn't win for best movie in its category, however — that honor went to Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nPlaying a former superhero-movie actor looking for a career comeback, Keaton said he was thankful for being in director Alejandro González Iñárritu's \"unbelievably gutsy, polished look at human nature\" and got choked up when talking about his friends, family and son.\n\n\"I'm so grateful from the bottom of my heart. You don't know what this means to me,\" he said.\n\nJulianne Moore made herself the woman to beat at the Oscars by taking best actress in a drama for Still Alice, in which she plays a woman with early onset Alzheimer's. She said the filmmakers \"wanted to celebrate who we are and what we value and who we love.\"\n\nAnd The Theory of Everything star Eddie Redmayne, who plays theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking in the biopic, won an important victory in a tough dramatic actor field.\n\n\"This was a huge privilege. The Hawking family allowed us into their lives and entrusted us with their story,\" Redmayne said. \"Getting to spend time with Stephen Hawking — who, despite all the obstacles put in his way, has lived passionately and fully and with great humor — was one of the great honors of my life.\"\n\nShowtime's The Affair defied the odds — as well as the power of fellow series Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones — to win for best drama on its first time out, and star Ruth Wilson snagged the award for best actress in a drama.\n\n\"If I have learned anything from writing a show about an affair, it's that how sacred and valuable and essential marriages are,\" said Affair co-creator Sarah Treem.\n\nKevin Spacey captured the honor for best actor in a drama for playing an underhanded House of Cards politician.\n\n\"This is just the beginning of my revenge,\" Spacey said at the beginning of an emotional acceptance speech. He concluded by saying, \"I just want to be better, but this is very encouraging.\"\n\nTransparent is the first streaming series for Amazon to win a Golden Globe, taking the honor for best comedy series as well as best comedic actor for Jeffrey Tambor.\n\n\"Oh, this is big. This is bigger than me,\" said Tambor, adding that with his transgender role, he's \"found more of Jeffrey than I've ever known in my life.\"\n\nTransparent creator Jill Soloway dedicated the award to \"the trans community\" and said she wanted the show to teach the audience about \"truth, authenticity and love.\"\n\nJ.K. Simmons took home a supporting actor honor for his sadistic jazz teacher in the movie Whiplash, and thanked both of the \"boy wonders\" involved: writer-director Damien Chazelle and co-star Miles Teller.\n\nTeller \"is a young actor of such maturity and brilliance. He inspired me every day to scream at him and hit him in the face,\" Simmons said in his acceptance speech.\n\nBig Eyes star Amy Adams won the award for best actress in a comedy or musical for playing Margaret Keane, a woman whom Adams said \"had such a quiet voice and such a strong heart and such a strong artistic vision and was ultimately able to use her voice.\"\n\nAdams also paid homage to the other actresses in the audience who are role models for her 4-year-old. \"You speak to her so loudly,\" she said. \"She watches everything and sees everything and I am so grateful for all of you women in this room who have such a lovely beautiful voice and are speaking to my daughter.\"\n\nThe Theory of Everything composer Jóhann Jóhannsson won for best original score, and musicians Common and John Legend accepted the original song award for Selma.\n\nCommon called Selma director Ava DuVernay a \"superhero\" when accepting the award.\n\n\"The first day I stepped on the set of Selma I began to feel that this was bigger than a movie,\" he said. \"I realized I am the hopeful black woman who was denied her right to vote. I am the caring white supporter killed on the front lines of freedom. I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand but was instead given a bullet. I am the two fallen police officers murdered in the line of duty, and Selma has awakened my humanity.\"\n\nLeviathan was named best foreign-language film and the sequel How to Train Your Dragon 2 took home the award for best animated feature.\n\nThe Honorable Woman star Maggie Gyllenhaal accepted her honor for best actress in a TV miniseries by noting the wealth of \"real\" roles for women in television.\n\n\"That's what I notice is evolutionary and revolutionary and turning me on,\" she said.\n\nGina Rodriguez won best actress in a comedy for her title role in the CW's first-year Latino-centric series Jane the Virgin.\n\n\"Thank you, God. for making me an artist,\" Rodriguez said. \"This award is so much more than myself. It represents a culture that wants to see itself as heroes.\"\n\nFargo conquered the TV miniseries category and star Billy Bob Thornton won for best actor in a miniseries.\n\n\"These days you get in a lot of trouble no matter what you say,\" Thornton deadpanned. \"You could say anything and get in trouble. I know that for a fact. So I'm just going to say thank you.\"\n\nThe Normal Heart's Matt Bomer won for supporting actor in a TV miniseries or movie. He honored both his co-star Mark Ruffalo — \"the heart and soul of the movie\" — and those who died or are still suffering from AIDS: \"We love you and remember you.\"\n\nDownton Abbey star Joanne Froggatt earned an award for supporting actress in a TV miniseries. She recalled hearing from many fans for a story line this past season that involved the rape of her character. In one letter, Froggatt said, \"the writer wasn't sure why she'd written, but she wanted to be heard.\"\n\nIn addition, Juliana Margulies and Don Cheadle presented George Clooney with the Cecil B. DeMille Award, given annually to honor the recipient's \"outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.\"\n\nClooney mentioned how 80% of the people in the Globes audience would lose their categories. But, he countered, \"for the record, if you are in this room, you've caught the brass ring. You get to do what you've always dreamed to do and be celebrated for it. That just ain't losing.\"\n\nHe also gave a sweet shoutout to his new wife, Amal: \"It's a humbling thing when you find someone to love. Even better when you've been waiting your whole life, and when your whole life has been 53 years … Amal, whatever alchemy it is that brought us together, I couldn't be more proud to be your husband.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/03/15/grammys-2021-top-moments-beyonce-billie-eilish/4695948001/", "title": "Grammys 2021 top moments: Beyonce, Billie Eilish, Lil Baby, more", "text": "Like a breath of fresh air after a long winter inside, the Grammys returned Sunday on CBS for a musical celebration after a terrible pandemic year.\n\nThanks to COVID-19 precautions, the 2021 Grammys were unusual, to say the least, but an entertaining and exciting production nonetheless. The laid-back awards show toggled between awards presented outdoors, intimate performances, pre-recorded songs and spotlights on struggling independent music venues around the country. The night was full of sweet and shocking moments, and a few that felt something close to normal.\n\nHarry Styles wore a feather boa (and later, a few others) and won a Grammy for \"Watermelon Sugar.\" Lizzo brought her energy (and an expletive). And the drummer from a little band called The Beatles, Ringo Starr, handed out the night's top prize to a surprised winner. And it was all done with masks, tables spaced 6 feet apart and a few nominees on Zoom.\n\nFrom a beautiful and heartbreaking In Memoriam segment to Trevor Noah as a casual emcee to Lil Baby's powerful performance, here are the Top 7 moments from this year's Grammys ceremony.\n\nMore:Brutally honest reviews of every Grammys 2021 performance\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nTrevor Noah keeps it short and sweet\n\n\"The Daily Show\" host lent his relaxed style of comedy to the proceedings, offering up rapid-fire jokes about the pandemic, politics and the socially distanced version of the Grammys. The hosts of music's biggest night rarely have as much time to fill as those who preside over the Oscars or Golden Globes, but Noah managed to show up just often enough to be memorable without overstaying his welcome.\n\nA moving memorial\n\nMost awards shows include an \"In Memoriam\" segment honoring luminaries in their fields who have died in the past year, and they run the gamut from somber to offensive (for their frequent glaring omissions). But the Grammys producers found a new and deeply emotional way to incorporate the segment into Sunday's ceremony. The traditional montage was occasionally interrupted by live performances offering musical tributes: Lionel Richie sang Kenny Rogers' \"Lady,\" and Brandi Carlisle offered an acoustic rendition of John Prine's \"I Remember Everything.\" In an especially tragic year, it was a fitting and beautiful moment.\n\nMore:John Prine's final song 'I Remember Everything' earns two posthumous Grammys, Brandi Carlile tribute\n\nMegan Thee Stallion and Cardi B bring 'WAP' to life\n\nMegan Thee Stallion won three Grammys, including best new artist, and was nearly bowled over by Beyonce's unexpected appearance to help her accept the award for best rap song for \"Savage.\" But she really stole the show with Cardi B for a live, electrifying performance of their hit \"WAP\" that featured backup dancers painted blue, a giant platform heel, a giant bed and dance moves that defied gravity.\n\nMore:Grammys 2021: Everything you missed\n\nLil Baby performs 'The Bigger Picture,' calls out Biden, police brutality\n\nLil Baby and Killer Mike's fiery performance of \"Bigger Picture\" included a staged police shooting of a Black man (played by Kendrick Sampson), imagery from Black Lives Matter protests, a direct callout to President Joe Biden by activist Tamika Mallory, and narration by James Baldwin, capped by a haunting fireworks display. On a night with a generally relaxed, uncontroversial vibe, it was by far the most openly political performance.\n\nBeyoncé makes Grammys history\n\nAlthough her appearance at the Grammys was a surprise to fans who thought she and husband Jay Z would skip the night, Beyoncé was a welcome presence, and she made history twice in the space of an hour, tying – and then breaking – the record for most-winning female artist, and the most winning singer, male or female, in the Grammys' 63-year history.\n\nAfter her final win of the night, the singer took time to congratulate her daughter Blue Ivy Carter, 9, now a Grammy winner, too. \"I know my daughter is watching,\" she said. \"Blue, congratulations – she won a Grammy tonight. I’m so proud of you. I’m so honored to be your mommy, all of your mommies. Ya’ll are my babies.\"\n\nTaylor Swift is the first woman to three-peat\n\nTaking home album of the year for her chill and woodsy \"Folklore,\" Taylor Swift made her own Grammy history by becoming the first woman to win that category three times. Swift first won in 2010 for \"Fearless\" and again for \"1989\" in 2016. The singer thanked her fans, collaborators Laura Sisk, Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner and boyfriend Joe Alwyn, \"the first person that I play every single song that I write.\" (Alwyn is credited on \"Folkore\" under a pseudonym, William Bowery.)\n\nSwift added, \"I had the best time writing songs with you during quarantine.\"\n\nBillie Eilish wins record of the year ... but thinks Megan Thee Stallion should have\n\nIn the final award of the night, Billie Eilish took home record of the year, one of the top prizes, for her single \"Everything I Wanted.\" But when she took to the stage, Eilish dedicated the win to fellow nominee Megan Thee Stallion, a moment that harked back to Adele praising Beyonce's \"Lemonade\" after winning album of the year for \"25\" in 2017. Then as now, the Recording Academy faced scrutiny after passing over Black women for the industry's top award.\n\n\"This is really embarrassing for me. Megan, girl. I was going to write a speech about how you deserve this, but then I was like, ‘There’s no way they are going to choose me,'\" Eilish said. \"Genuinely, this goes to her. Can we just cheer for Megan Thee Stallion, please?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/oscars/2020/02/04/oscars-2020-predictions-who-will-should-win-best-picture-actor/4642621002/", "title": "Oscars 2020 predictions: Who will win best picture, actor and actress?", "text": "After navigating the red carpets, acceptance speeches and plant-based menus of the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and other events, this year's awards season comes to a glamorous close with the 92nd Academy Awards (ABC, Sunday, 8 p.m. ET/5 ET).\n\nIt's been a speedier-than-usual road to the Oscars, though a bunch of also-rans (sorry, \"The Irishman\" and \"Little Women\") have been left mostly in the dust. So far, there's been little drama in the main acting categories, but the best picture race has been interesting, with \"1917\" scoring important Golden Globe and guild wins, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" appealing to the Tinseltown contingent, and SAG-honored \"Parasite\" looking to make history as the first foreign film to earn the Oscars' biggest prize.\n\nIt's almost time for a new crop of winners to be added to the Academy Awards' storied history, and here are our predictions for all the major categories:\n\nAll things Oscar:Find all of our Academy Awards coverage in one spot\n\nThe list:Who's nominated for an Oscar?\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe drama:Which one of these five movies will win best picture?\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\n“Ford v Ferrari”\n\n“The Irishman”\n\n“Jojo Rabbit”\n\n“Joker”\n\n“Little Women”\n\n“Marriage Story”\n\n“1917”\n\n\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”\n\n“Parasite”\n\nWill win: \"1917\"\n\nShould win: \"Jojo Rabbit\"\n\nSam Mendes' World War I thriller is the most impressive technical achievement in this category (and arguably of all last year): Edited as one seriously harrowing take, \"1917\" puts its main characters – and audience – through nearly two brutal hours of trench claustrophobia and battlefield paranoia, with the clock ticking toward tragedy. It's definitely deserving of Hollywood's highest honor, though so is Taika Waititi's World War II satire \"Jojo.\" The tale of a Nazi youth who learns that love triumphs hate is funny, subversive and winningly original. It's a fable that feels very resonant right now.\n\nACTOR\n\nAntonio Banderas, “Pain and Glory”\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”\n\nAdam Driver, “Marriage Story”\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, “Joker”\n\nJonathan Pryce “The Two Popes”\n\nWill win: Phoenix\n\nShould win: Driver\n\nPhoenix's visceral, unnerving transformation into the cackling comic-book supervillain – Heath Ledger won his posthumous Oscar for playing the same guy – seems destined to give the actor his first Oscar in a career full of thought-provoking performances. It's a long time coming for him, honestly. The talented Driver will be back in this category in the future, for sure, and while his portrayal of a divorcing dad isn't as showy as a clown-faced nihilist, it is a dynamic journey (with some singing!) from the pain and pettiness of separation to warmth and hope for the future.\n\nACTRESS\n\nCynthia Erivo, “Harriet”\n\nScarlett Johansson, “Marriage Story”\n\nSaoirse Ronan, “Little Women”\n\nCharlize Theron, “Bombshell”\n\nRenée Zellweger, “Judy”\n\nWill win/should win: Zellweger\n\nMaybe it's the fact that she took a step back from acting for a while and came back strong as iconic force of nature Judy Garland, but Zellweger proved in the biopic \"Judy\" that she's as vital an artist as ever. There are times in the film, depending on the scene or the angle, when Zellweger becomes Garland to an uncanny degree, belts a knockout rendition of \"Over the Rainbow\" and most importantly makes us feel how a Hollywood legend has to work her way out of a pit of despair. In a race full of powerful women, Zellweger stands out, and her yellow brick road ends with gold.\n\nSUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nTom Hanks, “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”\n\nAnthony Hopkins, “The Two Popes”\n\nAl Pacino, “The Irishman”\n\nJoe Pesci, “The Irishman”\n\nBrad Pitt, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”\n\nWill win/should win: Pitt\n\nEven competing against four legends, this is Pitt's Oscar. It's a career honor, for sure, after years of balancing being both an A-list movie star and one of the greatest character actors of his generation (though the former sometimes overshadows the latter). The steely stuntman Cliff Booth he portrays in Quentin Tarantino's 1969-set historical fantasy is an exquisite showcase for everything he does well, playing a dude who's oh-so-cool and kind of a hoot to be around but with a possibly darker side hiding just under his sunny, tanned exterior.\n\nSUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nKathy Bates, “Richard Jewell”\n\nLaura Dern, “Marriage Story”\n\nScarlett Johansson, “Jojo Rabbit”\n\nFlorence Pugh, “Little Women”\n\nMargot Robbie, “Bombshell”\n\nWill win: Dern\n\nShould win: Johansson\n\nUnfortunately, we can't pick the real winner of this category because \"Hustlers\" star Jennifer Lopez got snubbed. Her missing out means an apparently easy path to victory for Dern, who wowed the Netflix crowd as a bulldog-tough divorce attorney, a performance that's a joy to behold. Two nominations for Johansson this year was indicative of a fantastic year onscreen, and her \"Jojo\" performance was the beating heart of Waititi's comedy: Johansson's loving German mom was an empathetic role model for her young son, and she sold every single bit of understanding and tolerance needed to make \"Jojo\" sing.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nBong Joon-ho, “Parasite”\n\nSam Mendes, “1917”\n\nTodd Phillips, “Joker”\n\nMartin Scorsese, “The Irishman”\n\nQuentin Tarantino, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”\n\nWill win: Mendes\n\nShould win: Bong\n\nThe last six winners at the Directors Guild of America Awards took this Oscar, and that streak likely continues with Mendes, who crafted a splendid war film that was much more than the usual battlefield status quo. Tarantino also wouldn't be a bad pick, but Bong's multilayered storytelling begs to be honored here. The South Korean director's complex dark comedy will easily win international film, so he's not going home empty-handed, though the directing honor would be a fitting nod to his excellent work on a film that handled class and income inequality so entertainingly.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/04"}]}

Researchers also queried them about portion size.\n\nOptions were divided into food groups including animal foods (meat, dairy, eggs, fish or seafood), less healthy plant foods (food including potatoes and refined grains among others), and healthy plant foods like vegetables and legumes.\n\nParticipants told researchers whether they ate each item “never or hardly ever” or “two or more times a day.\" For drinks, responses ranged from “never or hardly ever” to “four or more times a day.\"\n\nUS cancer rates on decline in US:US cancer death rates across all age groups continue on downward trend, new study shows\n\nBowel (also known as colorectal) cancer is the 3rd most common cancer worldwide, according to the World Cancer Research Fund International. The risk of developing it over a lifetime is one in 23 for men and one in 25 for women, said one of the study's authors, Jihye Kim of Kyung Hee University in South Korea.\n\n“Although previous research has suggested that plant-based diets may play a role in preventing colorectal cancer, the impact of plant foods’ nutritional quality on this association has been unclear,\" Kim said in a news release describing the findings. “Our findings suggest that eating a healthy plant-based diet is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.”\n\nAntioxidants found foods such fruits, vegetables, and whole grains \"could contribute to lowering colorectal cancer risk by suppressing chronic inflammation, which can lead to cancer,\" she said.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund covers trending news for USA TODAY.

The typical Western diet, which includes a lot of processed foods, has long been shown to drive inflammation.\n\nAlthough much more research needs to be done to prove cause and effect, Dr. Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist at Mass General Brigham in Boston, said he's glad to see more support for the connection between inflammation, metabolic dysfunction and an increased risk for colon cancer.\n\n\"That risk can certainly be plausibly related to diet,\" said Chan, who studies the causes of colon cancer.\n\nWhile cancer rates overall and deaths from cancer have been falling, colon cancer rates have been climbing in recent decades among younger adults.\n\nThe rate of colon and rectal cancer diagnoses have fallen substantially since the mid-1980s, mainly because more people are getting screened and changing their lifestyle-related risk factors, according to the American Cancer Society. From 2011 to 2019, incidence of colon cancer fell by about 1% annually, mainly among older adults. In people younger than 55, rates have been growing by 1% to 2% a year since the mid-1990s.\n\nTo reduce risks of developing colon cancer, the American Cancer Society recommends eating plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and limiting or avoiding red and processed meats and sugary drinks. Smoking increases the risk for many types of cancers, and colon and other cancers have been linked to drinking alcohol.\n\nThe Gut study, led by researchers at University of South Florida Health in Tampa, found that fats in tumor cells from 162 colon cancer patients showed a “clear pro-inflammatory bias leading to dysregulated” metabolism.\n\nNow, what's needed, Chan said, are studies to see what individual people are eating and whether specific foods they eat are linked to the kinds of changes the new study found.

The promise has been that if you endure the awkwardness and invasiveness of having a camera travel the length of your large intestine once every decade after age 45, you have the best chance of catching – and perhaps preventing – colorectal cancer. It’s the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Some 15 million colonoscopies are performed in the US each year.\n\nNow, a landmark study suggests the benefits of colonoscopies for cancer screening may be overestimated.\n\nThe study marks the first time colonoscopies have been compared head-to-head to no cancer screening in a randomized trial. The study found only meager benefits for the group of people invited to get the procedure: an 18% lower risk of getting colorectal cancer, and no significant reduction in the risk of cancer death. It was published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudy researcher Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist who leads the clinical effectiveness group at the University of Oslo in Norway, said he found the results disappointing.\n\nBut as a researcher, he has to follow the science, “so I think we have to embrace it,” he said. “And we may have oversold the message for the last 10 years or so, and we have to wind it back a little.”\n\nOther experts say that as good as this study was, it has important limitations, and these results shouldn’t deter people from getting colonoscopies.\n\n“I think it’s just hard to know the value of a screening test when the majority of people in the screening didn’t get it done,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLess than half of people invited to get a colonoscopy in the study – just 42% – actually got one.\n\nWhen the study authors restricted the results to the people who actually received colonoscopies – about 12,000 out of the more than 28,000 who were invited to do so – the procedure was found to be more effective. It reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 31% and cut the risk of dying of that cancer by 50%.\n\nBretthauer said the true benefits of colonoscopy probably lie somewhere in the middle. He said he thinks of the results of the full study – including people who did and didn’t get colonoscopies after they were invited – as the minimum amount of benefit colonoscopies provide to a screened population. He thinks of the results from the subset of people who actually got the test as the maximum benefit people could expect from the procedure.\n\nBased on his results, then, he expects that screening colonoscopy probably reduces a person’s chances of colorectal cancer by 18% to 31%, and their risk of death from 0% to as much as 50%.\n\nBut, he said, even 50% is “on the low end of what I think everybody thought it would be.”\n\nOther studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.\n\nThe first randomized trial of colonoscopy\n\nThe NordICC study, which stands for Northern-European Initiative on Colon Cancer, included more 84,000 men and women ages 55 to 64 from Poland, Norway and Sweden. None had gotten a colonoscopy before. The participants were randomly invited to have a screening colonoscopy between June 2009 and June 2014, or they were followed for the study without getting screened.\n\nIn the 10 years after enrollment, the group invited to get colonoscopies had an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancers than the group that wasn’t screened. Overall, the group invited to screening also had a small reduction in their risk of death from colorectal cancer, but that difference was not statistically significant – meaning it could simply be due to chance.\n\nBefore the NordiCC trial, the benefits of colonoscopies had been measured by observational studies that looked back in time to compare how often colorectal cancer is diagnosed in people who received colonoscopies versus those who did not.\n\nThese studies can be subject to bias, however, so scientists look to randomized trials that blindly sort people into two groups: those who are assigned to get an intervention and those who are not. These studies then follow both groups forward in time to see if there are differences. Those studies have been difficult to do for colon cancer, which can be slow-growing and may take years to be diagnosed.\n\nThe researchers say they’re going to continue to follow participants for another five years. It could be that because colon cancers can be slow-growing, more time will help refine their results and may show bigger benefits for colonoscopy screening.\n\nResults need careful interpretation\n\nNormally, those kinds of disappointing results from such a large, strong study would be considered definitive enough to change medical practice.\n\nBut this study has some limitations that experts say need to be sorted out before doctors and patients give up on colonoscopies for cancer screening.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be canceling their colonoscopy,” said Dr. Jason Dominitz, the national director of gastroenterology for the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n“We know that colon cancer screening works,” said Dominitiz, who also co-authored an editorial that ran alongside the study.\n\nThere are several options for colorectal cancer screening. Those include stool tests that check for blood or cancer cells and a test called sigmoidoscopy, which looks only at the lower part of the colon. Both have been shown to reduce both cancer incidence and colorectal cancer deaths.\n\n“Those other tests work through colonoscopy,” Dominitz said. “They identify people at high risk who would benefit from colonoscopy, then the colonoscopy is done and removes polyps, for example, that prevents the individual from getting colon cancer in the first place, or it identifies colon cancer at a treatable stage.”\n\nPolyps are benign growths that can turn into cancers. They are typically removed when identified during a screening colonoscopy, which can lower a person’s risk of colorectal cancer in the future.\n\nStudies are underway in Spain and the US testing colonoscopy head-to-head against stool tests to see which is most effective.\n\nThe best way to screen for colorectal cancer\n\nDominitz said this randomized controlled trial was a test of advice as much as it was a test of the value of colonoscopy.\n\n“If you ask the population to do something, how much of an impact will it have?” he said.\n\nOverall, the study found that just inviting people to get a colonoscopy didn’t have a large beneficial impact across these countries, partly because so many people didn’t do it.\n\nDominitz thinks the low participation can be partly explained by the study’s setting. Colonoscopies are not as common in the countries involved in the study as they are in the United States. In Norway, he said, official colorectal cancer screening recommendations didn’t come until this past year.\n\n“They don’t see the public service announcements. They don’t hear Katie Couric talking about getting screened for colon cancer. They don’t see the billboards in the airport and whatnot,” he said. “So an invitation to be screened in Europe is, I think, likely to be somewhat different than an invitation to be screened in the US.”\n\nIn the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 have never been screened for colorectal cancer.\n\nIf you feel squeamish about getting a colonoscopy, the US Preventive Services Task Force says a variety of methods and regimens work to detect colorectal cancer. It recommends screening with tests that check for blood and/or cancer cells in stool every one to three years, a CT scan of the colon every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years paired with stool tests to check for blood annually, or a colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nIn 2021, the task force lowered the recommended age to start routine screening for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 because the cancer is becoming more common in younger adults.\n\nWhen it comes to colorectal cancer, Dominitz said, tests can only be effective if people are willing to do them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs proof, he points to early results from a large randomized trial from Sweden that’s testing colonoscopy, FIT testing and no screening at all.\n\nResults collected from more than 278,000 people enrolled between March 2014 and the end of 2020 found that 35% of the group assigned to get a colonoscopy actually got one, compared with 55% who were assigned to the stool test group.\n\nTo date, slightly more cancers have been detected in the group assigned to stool testing than in the group assigned to get a colonoscopy – “so participation with screening really is key!” Dominitz said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/09/17/coffee-linked-longer-survival-colorectal-cancer-patients-study/3477760001/", "title": "Coffee linked to longer survival in colorectal cancer patients: study", "text": "Coffee drinkers may have an edge against colon cancer, new research suggests.\n\nA study published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Oncology found a few cups of coffee a day was associated with longer survival and a lower risk of cancer progression in patients with colorectal cancer, according to researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nInvestigators found that in 1,171 patients treated for metastatic colorectal cancer, those who reported drinking two to three cups of coffee a day were likely to live longer overall and had a longer time before their disease worsened than those who didn’t drink coffee.\n\nParticipants who drank larger amounts of coffee – more than four cups a day – had an even greater benefit. These benefits held for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.\n\n“It’s known that several compounds in coffee have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and other properties that may be active against cancer,” says Chen Yuan, study co-author and research fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nDr. Scott Kopetz, professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center, said more is known about the role of antioxidants and its properties in early cancer development as opposed to established and metastatic disease.\n\nStudy authors emphasize the report was only able to find an association, not a cause-and-effect relationship. Experts say the study doesn’t provide sufficient evidence to recommend drinking coffee on a daily basis for people who have cancer.\n\n“Although it is premature to recommend a high intake of coffee as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer, our study suggests that drinking coffee is not harmful and may potentially be beneficial,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, study senior author and oncologist at Dana-Farber.\n\nKopetz said there may be a number of confounding factors that weren't measured by the study.

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nEating a lot of ultraprocessed foods significantly increases men’s risk of colorectal cancer and can lead to heart disease and early death in both men and women, according to two new, large-scale studies of people in the United States and Italy published Wednesday in British medical journal The BMJ.\n\nUltraprocessed foods include prepackaged soups, sauces, frozen pizza, ready-to-eat meals and pleasure foods such as hot dogs, sausages, french fries, sodas, store-bought cookies, cakes, candies, doughnuts, ice cream and many more.\n\n“Literally hundreds of studies link ultra-processed foods to obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality,” said Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University and author of numerous books on food politics and marketing, including 2015’s “Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning).”\n\n“These two studies continue the consistency: Ultraprocessed foods are unambiguously associated with an increased risk for chronic disease,” said Nestle, who was not involved in either study.\n\nA link to cancer\n\nThe US-based study examined the diets of over 200,000 men and women for up to 28 years and found a link between ultraprocessed foods and colorectal cancer – the third most diagnosed cancer in the US – in men, but not women.\n\nProcessed and ultraprocessed meats, such as ham, bacon, salami, hotdogs, beef jerkey and corned beef, have long been associated with a higher risk of bowel cancer in both men and women, according to the World Health Organization, American Cancer Society and the American Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nThe new study, however, found that all types of ultraprocessed foods played a role to some degree.\n\n“We found that men in the highest quintile of ultraprocessed food consumption, compared those in the lowest quintile, had a 29% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer,” said co-senior author Fang Fang Zhang, a cancer epidemiologist and chair of the division of nutrition epidemiology and data science at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Boston.\n\nThat association remained even after researchers took into account a person’s body mass index or dietary quality.\n\nWhy didn’t the new study find the same risk for colorectal cancer in women?\n\n“Reasons for such a sex difference are still unknown, but may involve the different roles that obesity, sex hormones, and metabolic hormones play in men versus women,” Zhang said.\n\n“Alternatively, women may have chosen ‘healthier’ ultraprocessed foods,” said Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study did find that eating a “higher consumption of ultraprocessed dairy foods – such as yogurt – was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in women,” Zhang said. “Some ultraprocessed foods are healthier, such as whole-grain foods that contain little or no added sugars, and yogurt and dairy foods.”\n\nWomen did have a higher risk for colorectal cancer if they consumed more ready-to-eat-or-heat dishes such as pizza, she said. However, men were more likely to have a higher risk of bowel cancer if they ate a lot of meat, poultry, or seafood-based ready-to-eat products and sugar-sweetened beverages, Zhang said.\n\n“Americans consume a large percentage of their daily calories from ultraprocessed foods – 58% in adults and 67% in children,” she added. “We should consider substituting the ultraprocessed foods with unprocessed or minimally processed foods in our diet for cancer prevention and prevention of obesity and cardiovascular diseases.”\n\nA link to early death\n\nThe second study followed more than 22,000 people for a dozen years in the Molise region of Italy. The study, which began in March 2005, was designed to assess risk factors for cancer as well as heart and brain disease.\n\nAnalysis published in The BMJ compared the role of nutrient-poor foods – such as foods high in sugar and saturated or trans-fats – versus ultraprocessed foods in the development of chronic disease and early death. Researchers found that both types of foods independently increased the risk of an early death, especially from cardiovascular diseases.\n\nHowever, when researchers compared the two types of food to see which contributed the most, they discovered that ultra-processed foods were “paramount to define the risk of mortality,” said first author Marialaura Bonaccio, an epidemiologist at the department of epidemiology and prevention at the IRCCS Neurologico Mediterraneo Neuromed of Pozzilli, Italy.\n\nIn fact, over 80% of the foods classified by the guidelines followed in the study as nutritionally unhealthy were also ultraprocessed, said Bonaccio in a statement.\n\n“This suggests that the increased risk of mortality is not due directly (or exclusively) to the poor nutritional quality of some products, but rather to the fact that these foods are mostly ultraprocessed,” Bonaccio added.\n\nNot real foods\n\nWhy are ultraprocessed foods so bad for us? For one, they are “ready-to-eat-or-heat industrial formulations that are made with ingredients extracted from foods or synthesized in laboratories, with little or no whole foods,” Zhang told CNN.\n\nThese overly processed foods are often high in added sugars and salt, low in dietary fiber, and full of chemical additives, such as artificial colors, flavors or stabilizers.\n\n“While some ultraprocessed foods may be considered healthier than others, in general, we would recommend staying away from ultra-processed foods completely and focus on healthy unprocessed foods – fruits, vegetables, legumes,” Mendelsohn said.\n\nIn 2019, the National Institute of Health (NIH) published the results of a controlled clinical trial comparing a processed and unprocessed diet. Researchers found those on the ultraprocessed diet ate at a faster rate – and ate an additional 500 calories more per day than people who were eating unprocessed foods.\n\n“On average, participants gained 0.9 kilograms, or 2 pounds while they were on the ultraprocessed diet and lost an equivalent amount on the unprocessed diet,” the NIH noted.\n\n“There is clearly something about ultraprocessed foods that makes people eat more of them without necessarily wanting to or realizing.” said Nestle.\n\n“The effects of ultraprocessed foods are quite clear. The reasons for the effects are not yet known,” Nestle continued. “It would be nice to know why, but until we find out, it’s best to advise eating ultraprocessed foods in as small amounts as possible.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/health/increased-alcohol-higher-cancer-risk-korea-wellness/index.html", "title": "Increased alcohol use linked with higher risk of cancer in new study ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPeople who increased the amount of alcohol they drank also had an increased risk of cancer, according to the results of a large study in Korea published on Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe study found that people who increased the amount they drank had a higher risk of all cancers, including alcohol-related cancers, than the group that made no changes to their drinking habits.\n\nThe risk also increased for non-drinkers who changed their habits and became mild, moderate or heavy drinkers.\n\n“This is another great example of how changing behavior could significantly decrease cancer deaths,” Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, told CNN in an email. “The most striking findings is the impact on cancer deaths with changes in alcohol consumption. Individuals should be strongly counseled that they can dramatically decrease their cancer risk if alcohol consumption is moderated.”\n\nThe study looked at data from more than 4.5 million participants. The study participants were from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, were 40 years old and up, had taken part in a national health screening in 2009 and 2011, and had available data on their drinking status.\n\n“In this large cohort study that used repeated measures of alcohol consumption, we found that individuals who increased their alcohol consumption, regardless of their baseline drinking level, had an increased incidence of alcohol-related and all cancers compared with those who sustained their current level of drinking,” wrote the study authors from the Seoul National University Hospital. “Quitting was not associated with a lower incidence of alcohol related cancer, but if abstinence was maintained over time, the incidence of alcohol-related and all cancers tended to decrease.”\n\nIn those who increased their drinking from being non-drinkers, the researchers found a high incidence of stomach, liver, gallbladder and lung cancer, multiple myeloma and leukemia.\n\nThey also found that there was an association between decreased risk of alcohol-related and all cancers and reducing heavy drinking to moderate or mild levels of drinking.\n\nAlthough the study has key strengths, such as the size of the cohort and the large number of cases, it also has some limitations, according to an accompanying editorial from experts at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nFirst, the two assessments of alcohol use took place two years apart with a maximum follow-up of seven years and the authors did not have details about participants’ alcohol intake earlier in life, meaning they couldn’t examine long-term changes.\n\nIt also lacked information on other healthy behaviors that could have happened alongside reductions in alcohol intake, so the changes in risk may not be attributed solely to alcohol use.\n\nThere was also no discussion about alcohol-induced flushing and an inherited deficiency in an enzyme involved in breaking down alcohol, which are common in East Asian populations. The editorial authors said that further research in other racial and ethnic groups is needed.\n\nDespite the limitations, the editorial authors said the research provides “important, new findings about the potential role of changes in alcohol consumption in cancer risk,” and suggest future studies follow its lead and examine the association in other populations and using longer intervals between assessments.\n\nThe American Cancer Society calls alcohol use “one of the most important preventable risk factors for cancer, along with tobacco use and excess body weight.”\n\nThe organization says that drinking accounts for around 6% of all cancers and 4% of all cancer deaths in the US.\n\nAccording to ACS and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drinking alcohol can increase the risk of six types of cancer: mouth and throat, larynx, esophagus, colon and rectum, liver and breast in women.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nACS also says that alcohol use probably increases the risk of stomach cancer and some others.\n\n“For each of these cancers, the more alcohol you drink, the higher your cancer risk,” ACS say. “But for some types of cancer, most notably breast cancer, consuming even small amounts of alcohol can increase risk.”\n\n“I think it’s very important that folks realize that heavy alcohol use can significantly increase the risk of cancer,” said Dahut. “Unfortunately, although this is not a new finding, this information would be very surprising to many.

At one point, moderate drinking was thought to be healthier than not drinking at all, because of possible benefits to the heart and bloodstream. A recent federal report supported that hypothesis, though the finding has been widely criticized. Other data finds that even moderate drinking, as Murthy said, can lead to health problems including cancer.\n\nNumerous studies have linked alcohol consumption with cancers, including those of the mouth, esophagus, breast, liver and colon, said Timothy Rebbeck, professor of cancer prevention at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.\n\n“More recent data have confirmed that even occasional alcohol consumption is associated with the risk of some cancers,” he said in a statement. Murthy’s warning appropriately emphasized the importance of limiting alcohol to reduce cancer risk, Rebbeck said.\n\nThe idea of a warning label was met with skepticism from trade groups representing alcoholic beverage manufacturers. The federal government should consider the entire body of scientific research – all harms and potential benefits – regarding alcohol before changing an existing warning label that does not mention cancer risks, Dr. Amanda Berger, senior vice president of science and research of the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement sent to USA TODAY.\n\nWhile many lifestyle choices carry potential risks, she said the council doesn’t recommend anyone drink alcohol to gain any health benefits and urges adults who choose to drink alcohol to consult their doctor.\n\nHow does alcohol cause cancer?\n\nThe human body breaks alcohol down into chemicals that can damage DNA, causing cells to grow out of control and become cancerous, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nAdditionally, alcohol can block the body from breaking down certain nutrients that can increase cancer risk. Alcohol can also increase blood levels of the sex hormone estrogen, which has been linked to higher risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe combination of smoking and drinking is \"multiplicative\" ‒ even more harmful than adding the potential damage of either one alone, according to the cancer institute.\n\nThe extent to which drinking alcohol may lower cancer risk of some cancers isn't fully understood and may be indirect, the institute said.\n\nWhat does research say?\n\nA recent review of alcohol and cancer research by a National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine committee published in December is meant to shape U.S. Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe review found people who drank moderately were less likely to die prematurely from any cause than those who never drank alcohol.\n\nModerate alcohol drinking was associated with higher risk of breast cancer, but the review couldn’t draw a conclusion on the association between moderate alcohol consumption and cancers of the mouth, throat, larynx and esophagus.\n\nOthers have disagreed with this assessment, including the National Cancer Institute, which warns that even those who drink no more than one drink per day and those who binge drink have \"modestly increased risk\" for some cancers.\n\nThe American Association of Cancer Research’s latest Cancer Progress Report highlighted the role alcohol has in causing cancer. Excessive levels of alcohol consumption increase risk for six cancers, from head and neck, to stomach cancers, the report said.\n\nIn the U.S., more than 5% of cancers were linked to alcohol consumption in 2019. Reducing consumption or stopping drinking altogether can decrease the risk of developing alcohol-related cancers by 8%, and for any cancer by 4%, the report said.\n\nDrinks have varying levels of alcoholic content, noted Jiyoung Ahn, a cancer molecular epidemiologist at New York University Langone Health. A Scotch neat has an alcohol by volume (ABV) level upwards of 40%, while a Modelo, America's most popular beer has 4.4% ABV, and a White Claw hard seltzer, 5%.\n\nIt’s important to remember that any amount of alcohol in the body will break down into chemicals, such as acetaldehyde, that can cause cancer.\n\n“If you drink more, it’s really clearly increasing your risk, so moderating and less drinking is better,” Ahn said.\n\nDr. Bruce Scott, president of the American Medical Association, a professional association of physicians, said Murthy's advisory will \"make completely clear\" the link between cancer risk and any alcohol consumption.\n\n\"(It) will bolster awareness, improve health, and save lives,\" Scott said in a statement. \"Despite decades of compelling evidence of this connection, too many in the public remain unaware of alcohol’s risk.\"\n\nContributed: Adrianna Rodriguez and Claire Thornton\n\n(This story has been updated to include new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/06/03/cancer-risk-lgbtq-people/73927708007/", "title": "LGBTQ+ population faces greater cancer risks.

New survey data presented Monday by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute also indicates that LGBTQ+ people experience discrimination in doctors’ offices that prevents them from getting adequate screening and care. The Dana-Farber survey shows that many health providers aren't attuned to the bias patients face.\n\nCoupled together, the new studies flag a problem in caring for a major sector of the population: Health care providers are not adequately identifying and treating cancer in LGBTQ+ patients. The new findings come amid a push to expand data so it better identifies people by their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\n“There may be folks that are avoiding health care because they don't feel welcome,” Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, told USA TODAY. “Then, when they do present for care, their cancer will be at a place where it's more likely to lead to morbidity, or potentially even mortality.”\n\nCancer risk:Americans have 40% chance of getting cancer. Who's most at risk and how can you prevent it?\n\nUsing federal health data from 2020 to 2022, American Cancer Society researchers found bisexual women who were 40 and older had much higher smoking rates compared with heterosexual women, according to a study published last week in the society’s journal, Cancer. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people also smoked cigarettes at higher rates than their heterosexual or cisgender peers.\n\nThe study found that lesbian and bisexual women had higher rates of excess body weight and tracked higher obesity rates in bisexual women. Additionally, the research found bisexual women and transgender people were less physically active. Bisexual women also had higher alcohol intake, meaning they reported having more than seven drinks a week.\n\nOne explanation for the increased risk factors was \"minority stress,\" from shouldering discrimination that leads to an increased mental health or substance use problems, or behaviors that increase cancer risk.\n\nScreening and vaccinations – including for hepatitis B and HPV – were equally sought or sought more frequently among LGBTQ+ patients than heterosexual or cisgender people. But cervical or colorectal cancer screening was lower among transgender men, the study found. Also, the prevalence of cancer-causing infections, such as HIV and HPV, was higher among gay and bisexual men than in other demographics despite the decline in these infections in recent decades.\n\nThe American Cancer Study report acknowledged there is a scarcity of data about LGBTQ+ people of color, who may face increased risk because of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe new research also identified barriers with health providers. Nine states, most of them in the South and the Midwest, permit health providers or insurers to deny care or services to LGBTQ+ people based on their beliefs, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a think tank that tracks religious exemption laws.\n\nEven when doctors felt they were treating everyone equally for cancer, patients still reported that bias had seeped into their health care, according to survey findings presented Monday by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute investigators at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology conference. Dana-Farber collaborated with the Moffitt Cancer Center and the company Prime Education to survey 817 LGBTQ+ cancer patients and 115 oncology providers.\n\nAbout 80% of patients said they hadn’t received appropriate preventative cancer screening, according to a study abstract. One of the most pernicious barriers was providers not mentioning taking a screening for cancer. The survey found that 28% of participants had no health provider. Less than a quarter of respondents said they felt at least moderately comfortable disclosing their gender identity or sexual orientation to a care provider. Just over a third of patients said their partners or caregivers felt welcome at appointments, and only 4% felt respected by their care team.\n\n“It harms people’s health to be silent, to be invisible, to not be their full selves when they’re facing something as life-changing as cancer,” said Dr. Shail Maingi, the study's lead author and an oncologist in Dana-Farber’s cancer care equity program.\n\nPride 2024:LGBTQ+ communities, allies around US taking steps to promote safety at Pride 2024 events\n\nIn another Dana-Farber study, 84% of doctors said they felt comfortable treating LBGTQ+ cancer patients, and close to two-thirds of providers thought the patients felt safe. The stark contrast appeared to show a disconnect between these patients and their providers.\n\nResearchers agreed that the dearth of data makes it difficult to adequately identify issues in improving cancer outcomes for LGBTQ+ people. The recent findings, they hope, will inspire health providers to push for more data so they can better identify health issues for patients.\n\n“Until we begin to have data that we can trust as far as incidence and outcomes, it’s going to be hard to intervene in a meaningful way,” Dahut, of the American Cancer Society, said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/health/longer-life-diet-wellness/index.html", "title": "Changing your diet could add up to 13 years to your life, study says ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChanging what you eat could add up to 13 years to your life, according to a newly published study, especially if you start when you are young.\n\nThe study created a model of what might happen to a man or woman’s longevity if they replaced a “typical Western diet” focused on red meat and processed foods with an “optimized diet” focused on eating less red and processed meat and more fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts.\n\nIf a woman began eating optimally at age 20, she could increase her lifespan by just over 10 years, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine. A man eating the healthier diet from age 20 could add 13 years to his life.\n\nFocusing on a healthier diet could also lengthen the lives of older adults, the study said. By starting at age 60, a woman could still increase her lifespan by eight years. Men starting a healthier diet at age 60 might add nearly nine years to their lives.\n\nA plant-based eating style could even benefit 80-year-olds, the study said: Men and women could gain about 3.5 years of extra life from dietary changes.\n\n“The notion that improving diet quality would reduce the risk of chronic disease and premature death is long established, and it only stands to reason that less chronic disease and premature death means more life expectancy,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\nKatz, the president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine, has published research on how to use food as preventive medicine.\n\n“What they define as an ‘optimal’ diet is not quite optimal; it’s just a whole lot better than ‘typical,’” Katz said, adding that he felt diet could be “further improved, conferring even greater benefits.”\n\n“My impression is that their ‘much improved’ diet still allowed for considerable doses of meat and dairy,” Katz said, adding that when his team scores diet quality objectively, “these elements are at quite low levels in the top tier.”\n\nA model of longer life\n\nTo model the future impact of a person’s change of diet, researchers from Norway used existing meta-analyses and data from the Global Burden of Disease study, a database that tracks 286 causes of death, 369 diseases and injuries, and 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories around the world.\n\nThe largest gains in longevity were found from eating more legumes, which include beans, peas and lentils; whole grains, which are the entire seed of a plant; and nuts such as walnuts, almonds, pecans and pistachios, the study found.\n\nIt may sound simple to add more plants and grains to your diet, but statistics show that Americans struggle to do so. A new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found few Americans eat close to their daily recommendations of fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe CDC study found that only 12% of adults consume 1½ to 2 cups of fruit each day, which is the amount recommended by the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Only 10% of Americans eat the recommended 2 to 3 cups of vegetables each day, including legumes.\n\nAbout 50% of grain consumption should be whole grains, yet over 95% of Americans fail to meet that goal, according to the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, instead eating processed grains, which have been milled to remove the grain, bran and many nutrients, including fiber.\n\nOver 50% of Americans fail to eat the 5 grams (about a teaspoon) of recommended nuts and seeds each day, the guidelines said.\n\nNuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains contain more than just protein. They include healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and antioxidant “phytochemicals” that have been associated with lower risk of chronic diseases.\n\nRed and processed meats\n\nEating less red and processed meat such as bacon, sausage and preserved deli meats was also linked to longer life.\n\nThat makes good sense: Red and processed meats have been linked to significant health risks, including coronary heart disease and bowel cancer.\n\n“There’s substantial evidence that processed meat can cause bowel cancer – so much so that the World Health Organization has classified it as carcinogenic since 2015,” Oxford University epidemiologist Tim Key, a member of the UK Department of Health’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, told CNN in a prior interview.\n\nReplacing red and processed meats with lean poultry, fish and plant proteins is one way to improve a diet quickly, experts say.\n\nPlant proteins include soybeans (edamame), chickpeas, lentils and other legumes, tofu, tempeh, nuts, seeds, and whole grains like quinoa. Some vegetables, like broccoli, also contain higher levels of protein.\n\nA 2020 study which tracked more than 37,000 middle-aged Americans found those who ate the most plant protein were 27% less likely to die of any cause and 29% less likely to die of coronary heart disease than people who ate the least amount of plant protein.\n\n“The benefit is more pronounced when red and processed meats are replaced by plant protein sources,” study coauthor Dr. Frank Hu, chair of the department of nutrition at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told CNN in a prior interview.\n\nHow to improve your diet\n\nOne way to incorporate more plants into your diet and consume less red meatis with the Mediterranean diet, which has won best diet five years in a row, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nTied for silver was the DASH diet, which stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension, and the Flexitarian diet, which encourages being a vegetarian most of the time. All of these diets focus on meals full of fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts and seeds.\n\nAn easy way to start eating the Mediterranean way is to cook one meal each week based on beans, whole grains and vegetables, using herbs and spices to add punch.

In Northern California's Butte County, Sheriff Kory Honea said at least 10 people have died, including seven more added to the death toll Thursday. Dozens are missing and hundreds of homes were feared destroyed by a series of blazes 125 miles northeast of San Francisco called the North Complex fires.\n\nSeveral people have been critically burned and thousands more homes were threatened. At least 20,000 people were under evacuation orders or warnings in Plumas, Yuba and Butte counties.\n\nJohn Sykes, a 50-year resident, fled with his car and some clothes. He watched the town of Berry Creek burn from about a mile away.\n\n“The school is gone, the fire department’s gone, the bar’s gone, the laundromat’s gone, the general store’s gone,” Sykes told the Sacramento Bee. “I’ll never go back. ... I never want to see California again.”\n\nThe fire also threatened Paradise, a town devastated in 2018 by the deadliest inferno in state history, the Camp Fire. More than 80 residents died and almost 20,000 buildings were destroyed in that blaze.\n\nCalifornia ablaze: Striking satellite imagery shows how the fires are unfolding\n\nIn the Sierra National Forest, authorities say it will likely be at least a week, and possibly a month, before the Creek Fire is controlled sufficiently to permit residents to return. The fire has displaced tens of thousands of Californians, and the Red Cross was helping evacuees find hotel rooms because many people prefer them to group shelters during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nFire officials have not yet released detailed maps of the fire damage but say at least 60 homes and 278 commercial-residential structures were destroyed. Rocky Alec, 22, and Kristen Kipp, 21, had to abandon their trailer home near Mammoth.\n\n\"You couldn’t really see anything. There was smoke everywhere. We were in too much smoke to see flames,\" Alec said. “At first we were like it was just another fire. Then it got real.”\n\nIn Southern California, fires burned in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. But severe Santa Ana winds forecast for the area were weaker than predicted.\n\nThe El Dorado Fire, which has burned about 20 square miles in San Bernardino County, was listed as 23% contained Thursday. Almost 1,000 firefighters were \"actively engaged in structure protection and successfully defended multiple structures,\" Cal Fire said.\n\nHomes have been lost, however, and damage-assessment teams were working to confirm the number of homes and businesses and their locations. Fire officials said the blaze was sparked by a pyrotechnic device used during a \"gender reveal\" event Saturday.\n\nWinds may die down, but smoke and fire threat will persist\n\nThe strong, gusty winds over the West weakened Thursday and should continue to do so over the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\n“We’re encouraged that the wind activity appears to be dying down,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. “The rest of the week looks a little more favorable.”\n\nThat is good news for a state where 14,000 firefighters remain on the line of 29 major wildfires. The last few weeks have been grueling, as has much of a year during which California has already endured six of the 20 largest wildfires in its history, including three of the top four.\n\nSince January, wildfires have burned almost 5,000 square miles in California, easily a record for the state. There have been 12 fatalities, and over 3,900 structures have been destroyed.\n\nAt least seven weeks remain in the prime fire season, and low humidity combined with warmer temperatures forecast in coming days will be enough for elevated fire concerns to remain, according to the Weather Service.\n\nIn addition, a stagnant air mass will likely keep areas of smoke in place across the Northwest, Great Basin, California and other areas across the West dealing with the wildfires, resulting in continued poor air quality, AccuWeather said.\n\nSome more substantial relief may be on the way for the Northwest by early next week as a storm system approaches the coast, potentially bringing some welcome rainfall, according to AccuWeather.\n\n'We could hear the trees exploding': At least 7 dead as wildfires rage across West\n\nOregon and Washington state also have struggled with historic blazes, and wind-driven fires were also burning in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.\n\nLargest amount of uncontained fire\n\nIn Oregon, a series of fires killed three people and forced residents to flee flames, smoke and destruction. Gov. Kate Brown said hundreds of residences have been destroyed. She said emergency responders were \"inundated\" and urged residents not to call 911 to report smoke or ash clouds. Evacuees poured into the state fairgrounds in the capital city of Salem, many bringing their animals.\n\nBrown said more than 900,000 acres have burned across the state in the last several days – nearly double the amount of scorched terrain in a typical year. More than 80,000 people have had to flee their homes, and the count may increase, she said.\n\n“We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state,” Brown said.\n\nThe Oregon Office of Emergency Management said 39 wildfires were burning in the state by Thursday morning, a number that shocked officials.\n\nJonathan Weir defied evacuation orders as flames 30 feet high shot from the trees in Phoenix, a town of 4,000 residents near the California border. His home was destroyed.\n\n“There were flames across the street from me, flames to the right of me, flames to the left of me. I just watched everything burn,” Weir said.\n\n'Looked like a war zone' along Interstate 5\n\nFires were burning in seven Oregon counties, and the Almeda Drive Fire in southern Oregon prompted evacuation orders in much of Medford, a city of about 80,000 residents.\n\nTruck driver Troy Wood said he was driving north on the I-5 and saw a path of destruction as he approached Ashland, a few miles southeast of Medford.\n\n\"It looked like a ... war zone,” Wood said. “You could see burned out gas stations and buildings on fire.”\n\nIn Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee toured the devastated farm town of Malden, about 35 miles south of Spokane, and said wildfires have charred nearly 937 square miles of terrain.\n\n“We’ve had this trauma all over Washington,” Inslee said, according to KHQ-TV. “But this is the place where the whole heart of the town was torn out.”\n\nInslee placed the blame for the rash of fires squarely on climate change. He promised \"steps to defeat\" the impact of global warming.\n\n\"We are not going to surrender the future of this state to climate change,\" he said. \"We are stronger, smarter and more resilient than that.

The fire had ravaged more than 359 square miles and is 10% contained.\n\nAnother large fire burning in California is the LNU Lightning Complex, which has burned a total of 342 square miles and is 7% contained.\n\nWhat is the air quality and why don't cloth face masks help?\n\nSmoke from the fires is making the air quality in parts of California some of the worst in the world. And people in the area might not be able to smell the dangerous pollutants in the air.\n\nAir quality experts measure the amount of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in the air. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, those particles come from a variety of sources, including fires.\n\nSmoke from fires can send large amounts of PM 2.5 into the air and over large areas.\n\n“Whenever things burn there’s a mixture of gases and particles,” said University of California, San Francisco pulmonologist Dr. John Balmes, an expert on the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of air pollutants.\n\nN95 or neck gaiter?:Check out how effective different kinds of masks are\n\n“When you smell smoke, you are smelling the gases in the air, not PM 2.5,” Balmes said. “They go hand-in-hand near the fire source, but the particulates travel in the upper atmosphere.”\n\nIt’s possible to have bad air — air high in PM 2.5 — without smelling gases.\n\nYour coronavirus mask may not protect you, unless you have a mask designed to filter PM 2.5, like an N95. Those masks are scarce worldwide because of the pandemic.\n\nHealth experts say limiting outdoor activities, remaining indoors with the windows and doors closed and turning on an air conditioner with a recirculation setting can help reduce your risk if you live in an affected area.\n\nContributing: Jessica Skropanic, Redding Record Searchlight; The Associated Press, Doyle Rice, Elinor Aspegren, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/09/02/caldor-fire-tahoe-updates-lighter-winds-offer-firefighters-hope/5693610001/", "title": "Caldor Fire updates: Lighter winds offer firefighters hope near Tahoe", "text": "Crews fighting the Caldor Fire in California, burning within miles of Lake Tahoe, were aided by better weather conditions Thursday after days of fierce wind gusts intensified the massive blaze.\n\nThough localized gusts were still likely, lighter winds and improved humidity levels were forecast for Thursday and Friday, allowing fire crews to increase containment of the fire and target troublesome areas, incident meteorologist Jim Dudley said Thursday.\n\n\"We lost the winds aloft,\" Dudley said. \"It’s a good day today to not have gusty winds up on the ridges.\"\n\nBut he added that firefighters would still have to face unpredictable \"terrain-driven winds\" that occur as the sun heats the ground, as well as dry conditions that may lead to spot fires and continue to threaten homes in the California-Nevada alpine region.\n\n“We’re battling what we can battle and waiting for those winds to subside,” said Stephen Vollmer, a fire behavior analyst for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe Caldor Fire, which has forced an unprecedented evacuation of all 22,000 residents of South Lake Tahoe and tens of thousands of tourists, has burned for almost three weeks, scorching hundreds of homes and vacation rentals along its trek toward Nevada's border. The fire was 25% contained as of Thursday morning and had surged to about 330 square miles, according to Cal Fire.\n\nAt Tahoe's Heavenly Mountain Resort, firefighters doused buildings using snow-making devices. Crews tried to steer flames away from urban areas. And thick smoke blanketed South Lake Tahoe, where at least 33,000 structures were still threatened. Meanwhile, casinos and stores began to close Wednesday morning in Nevada as the blaze approached.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a federal emergency declaration Wednesday ordering federal assistance to supplement the more than 15,000 firefighters and additional out-of-state crews battling more than a dozen active fires in California.\n\nOn Thursday, CalFire said wildfires have burned through 3,000 square miles in the state this year as the monstrous, weeks-old Dixie Fire continues to burn about 65 miles north of the Caldor Fire. The second-largest wildfire in state history, the Dixie Fire was 55% contained at about 1,340 square miles as of Thursday morning, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe Dixie Fire may have also drawn resources away from the Caldor Fire in its early days, preventing already stretched-thin fire crews from containing the Lake Tahoe-area fire before it ballooned in size.\n\n“I do think the Dixie and the way that it’s burned and its magnitude did impact the early response to the Caldor,” said Scott Stephens, a professor of wildland fire science at the University of California, Berkeley. “It really drew resources down so much that the Caldor got very few for the first couple days.”\n\nWhile 6,550 firefighters battled the Dixie Fire, about 240 headed to the Lake Tahoe area in the first few days of the Caldor Fire. Days later, additional fire engines and firefighters were diverted to the second blaze, tripling its resources, but only after the fire had already destroyed dozens of homes.\n\nClimate change and intense heat have fueled a dangerous and intense fire season this year.\n\n“We are moving resources around as needed, sharing among the incidents,” Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter told reporters on Aug. 18, acknowledging crews were \"having a very difficult time\" because resources were so stretched.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nContact News Now Reporter Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/california/2017/12/07/san-diego-area-lilac-fire-destroys-mobile-homes-retirement-park/933547001/", "title": "San Diego-area Lilac Fire destroys mobile homes in retirement park", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nSAN DIEGO – A brush fire driven by gusty winds that have plagued Southern California all week exploded rapidly Thursday north of San Diego, destroying dozens of trailer homes in a retirement community and killing race horses at an elite training facility.\n\nThe fire expanded to 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in a matter of hours and tore through the tightly packed Rancho Monserate Country Club community in the small city of Fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards and horse ranches. At least two people were hospitalized with burns.\n\nThe destructive blaze, known as the Lilac Fire, broke out as firefighters tried to corral the largest fire in the state that was burning around Ventura — 130 miles (209 kilometers) to the north — and destroyed 430 buildings as it grew to 180 square miles (466 square kilometers). Fire crews were also fighting large fires around Los Angeles, but they made enough progress to lift most evacuation orders.\n\nLike other fires that have broken out this week, Fallbrook has a history of destructive blazes. Ten years ago, as a series of fires raced across Southern California, a blaze in Fallbrook injured five people, destroyed 206 homes and burned 14 square miles (36 square kilometers).\n\nThursday’s fire prompted the closure of state Highway 76 in both directions and evacuations in an area near the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base. Evacuation centers were set up in schools and casinos.\n\nJim Peratt was in Las Vegas on business when his wife called and said she was rounding up their two horses and evacuating their property in Bonsall, a community of 4,000 amid the rolling hills of rural San Diego County.\n\n“She saw nothing but smoke and flames all around,” Peratt said. “I’m praying I’ll have a home when I get back. I’m just waiting to hear.”\n\nAs the flames approached the elite San Luis Rey Downs training facility for thoroughbreds, many of the more than 450 horses were cut loose to prevent them from being trapped in their stalls if barns caught fire, said Mac McBride of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.\n\nREAD MORE:The Thomas Fire is huge, but it's not California's largest wildfire\n\nHorse trainer Scott Hansen said he knows that some of his 30 horses at the facility died.\n\n“I don’t know how many are living and how many are dead,” he said. “I guess I’ll have to figure that out in the morning.”\n\nMost of the horses were saved, McBride said, and were being loaded to go to the Del Mar Fairgrounds.\n\nSome ranchers posted urgent pleas on Twitter for help moving horses, including Rawhide Ranch, well-known for running horse riding camps for children and teens.\n\nThe fire and a smaller one 12 miles (19 kilometers) north in the city of Murrieta -- the Liberty Fire -- broke out the day after state officials sent an unprecedented alert to cell phones across seven Southern California counties warning that strong Santa Ana winds could cause extreme fire danger. Although hurricane-force winds predicted did not materialize, firefighters faced gusts that fanned flames and put thousands of homes in jeopardy.\n\nREAD MORE:Liberty Fire: Fast-moving blaze threatening homes near Murrieta, evacuations ordered\n\nAlong the coast between Ventura and Santa Barbara, tiny beach communities were under siege as fire leapt from steep hillsides across U.S. Highway 101.\n\n“We drove through a wall of flames,” Wendy Frank said, describing her ordeal after evacuating her horses from Ojai on Wednesday night. “I didn’t know if we’d make it. I just put the accelerator down. I know we were going over 100 mph, we could have been going much more, and just hoped for the best.”\n\nFires flared up Thursday along the highway, forcing an evacuation of the dozens of homes at Faria Beach.\n\n“Anyone in your homes still, you need to leave now,” a California Highway Patrol officer said through a loudspeaker while driving down a smoke-shrouded street. “The fire is here, you need to leave.”\n\nJoseph Ruffner had left earlier in the week but returned and said he was staying put this time.\n\n“This morning there was a wall of fire back right over here,” he said. “I didn’t think it was no big deal, but it’s coming back to burn what it didn’t burn yesterday.”\n\nThe highway, which runs the length of the state and is a major commuter corridor to Los Angeles, was closed intermittently along the 28-mile (45-kilometer) stretch between Ventura and Santa Barbara.\n\nThe Ventura and LA-area fires have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure almost certain to rise.\n\nA woman was found dead in a wrecked car in an evacuation zone near the city of Santa Paula, where the Ventura County blaze began Monday night, but officials could not immediately say whether the accident was fire-related.\n\nThe massive fire threatened Ojai, a scenic mountain town dubbed “Shangri-La” and known for its boutique hotels and New Age spiritual retreats.\n\nMost of Ojai’s 7,000 residents were warned to clear out late Wednesday and patients unable to walk were moved from the Ojai Valley Community Hospital because of unprecedented, hurricane-force Santa Ana winds in the overnight forecast.\n\nAsh fell like snowflakes on citrus orchards scattered around town and on Spanish-style architecture as firefighters parked their trucks around houses in anticipation of winds picking back up.\n\nSome businesses were closed, but staples could be found at Pat’s Liquor, where Hank Cheyne-Garcia loaded up with supplies to fuel through another edgy night keeping sentry on the fire.\n\n“It got a little too intense yesterday with the wind kicking up,” he said. “There was just so much smoke.

Gavin Newsom said Friday.\n\nThe number of fires jumped from 376 a day ago to 560, Newsom said, with roughly two dozen major blazes that require significant resources. They cover a collective 771,000 acres — larger than the size of Rhode Island — and are tapping 96% of Cal Fire engines throughout the state, according to officials.\n\nAmong them are clusters of fires authorities have lumped together in order to consolidate information gathering. They are:\n\nLNU Lightning Complex: Burning near Vacaville, between San Francisco and Sacramento, this blaze was initially dubbed the Hennessey Fire, but there are so many fires burning in the area that firefighters have put them all under one incident — the LNU Lightning Complex. The fire was 7% contained and covered about 219,000 acres, Cal Fire officials said Friday.\n\nSCU Lightning Complex Fire: Another large blaze made up of 20 separate fires burning near San Jose. It had ravaged nearly 230,000 acres and was 10% contained on Friday morning, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCZU August Lightning Complex: The 62-square-mile fire in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties raced through Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California's oldest state park, Santa Cruz County officials confirmed Thursday. As of Friday morning, the fire was at 50,000 acres and 0% contained.\n\nCal Fire Unit Chief Shana Jones said while some progress has been made, there's still much more work to do and homes are being threatened.\n\nShe urged area residents to be prepared to leave and get ready to evacuate when necessary.\n\n\"First-responders have been stretched thin throughout the state, but they continue to work hard, they're getting little rest,\" she said.\n\nWhile more than 12,000 personnel are out fighting the largest of the blazes, officials in charge say some firefighters were working 72-hour shifts instead of the usual 24 hours.\n\nThe governor said he's continuing to utilize a mutual aid network across western states, and reaching out to others on the East Coast, to provide the much-needed backup.\n\n\"We have more people, but it's not enough,\" he said. \"That's why we need the support from our federal partners, and the extraordinary contributions that governors, regardless of their party, have contributed.\"\n\nThe state has requested 375 engines and crew from other states.\n\nTwenty-five engines from Oregon, 10 engines from Arizona, and five engines from Texas, Nevada and New Mexico are arriving in California at noon Friday, Newsom said. There's also surveillance aid coming from Washington state, Newsom said.\n\nNewsom said he is also talking to Canada and Australia about receiving resources and support.\n\nResources are also being shifted away from fires that are getting under control — such as the Apple Fire in Riverside County that is now 95% contained — to address blazes in northern parts of the state, Newsom said.\n\nThe resources are needed in spite of larger allocations for firefighting resources made as part of the state budget this year, including an $85.6 million increase for full-time support for Cal Fire, and a supplemental $72 million for 858 positions, 830 of which have been filled in the past several weeks, Newsom said.\n\nIt's a record amount of support in a state that's seeing a historic level of fires and associated damage.\n\nThe fires even made their way into Newsom's last-minute video recorded for the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night.\n\n“If you are in denial about climate change, come to California,” he said.\n\nTrack California fires:Map traces current fires burning across state in real-time\n\nCalifornia wildfires:See evacuation order map for Sonoma, Napa and Lake counties\n\nAt least 5 dead, 119,000 evacuated, 33 hurt\n\nThe impact of the blazes is widespread: More than 119,000 people have been evacuated statewide. At least five people have died, Newsom said Friday, and 33 are injured.\n\nSeparately, a Pacific Gas & Electric utility worker was found dead in a vehicle in the Vacaville area Wednesday.\n\nNewsom said that while the state has had to battle other large fires in the past and learned from those experiences, the recent blazes are unprecedented.\n\nTwo of the fires — the SCU Lightning Complex Fire and the LNU Lightning Complex Fire — are now the seventh and 10th largest fires in state history, having burned as much as 300 square miles each.\n\n\"We are not naïve by any stretch about how deadly this moment is,\" Newsom said.\n\nHe added that the state is entering a new agreement with the U.S. Forest Service for more forest management. It's going forward, he said, despite President Donald Trump claiming a day earlier that the rash of fires was caused by the state failing to properly maintain its forest.\n\nNewsom said he wasn't convinced Trump knew about the new agreement — and while the president may make public remarks, they have a working relationship in private.\n\n\"Had he been aware of that, I'm not sure he may have made that statement,\" he said.\n\nMore:How to stay safe under River Fire, Carmel Fire, Lightning Complex Fire smoke\n\nMore:California man uses Bud Light to put out fire near Vacaville home\n\nThe governor also praised the work and efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which announced Thursday that it will reimburse California 75% of whatever it spends on battling the LNU Lightning Complex Fire and the CZU Lightning Complex Fire.\n\nThe grants will \"help ensure the availability of vital resources\" while battling the fires, according to Newsom's office.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, a Democrat who represents Napa County and surrounding areas, said during Friday's news briefing that a letter is going out with 30 bipartisan signatures supporting Newsom's request for individual and public assistance.\n\nHe also has legislation prepared that would shift the local cost of the fire response for sheriff's departments from 25% to 10% if a natural disaster is declared.\n\n\"The federal government is here to do everything we possibly can,\" he said.\n\nAssemblymember Cecilia M. Aguiar-Curry said all of the counties in her Northern California district have fires raging. She has half a dozen friends who are without homes — and there's no quick solution, she said.\n\n\"For the past five years we’ve been experiencing this year after year,\" she said. \"I wish there was a real simple way to get around this, but there’s not.\"\n\nFirefighters to civilians: Don't help\n\nWith firefighting resources tight, homes in hard-to-get-to places burn unattended, prompting some residents to take action.\n\nBrothers Robert and Jesse Katz, who have a ranch in Morgan Hill, headed into the Santa Cruz mountains with their own fire truck. On Friday they worked side-by-side with a professional local crew, hosing down a burning redwood next to a popular hiking trail in Henry Cowell State Park.\n\n“The more civilians can do to pitch in, it really will take the burden off of them and it really can make the difference between saving a house or a property or a home, and finding ashes,” Robert Katz said.\n\nKatz said they’re working closely with crews.\n\n“You develop relationships with the people who are actually working the fire, and once you do that you can really work as a great team,” Katz said. “If we’re doing structure protection, they can take the lead and we can do mop up behind them. It frees them up to do areas of firefighting that otherwise would tie them up.”\n\nBut Cal Fire’s Olsen said civilians can put firefighters in danger.\n\n“They don’t have the training, the experience and the education we have about staying safe in fires,” he said.\n\nCalFire Chief Mark Brunton pleaded with residents to quit battling fires on their own, saying that just causes more problems for the professionals.\n\n“We had, last night, three separate rescues that pulled our vital, very few resources away,” he said Friday.\n\nBut Peter Koleckai credits a neighbor, not firefighters, with saving his home.\n\nOff a narrow road a mile from the Katzes, Koleckai wiped tears from his eyes after days of evacuating and re-evacuating his family as one community after another became endangered.\n\nWithin a few blocks, more than a dozen homes lay in ruins, most still smoldering. Summer gardens were roasted, hulls of cars were smoking, and in many homes the only recognizable feature was the chimney.\n\nKoleckai said he had been hosing his property, filming devastation and sharing it with neighbors.\n\n“We were here at about 3 o’clock in the morning and the fire department just left. They just left,” he said.\n\nKoleckai said he ran to a firefighter and told him a brush fire was erupting next to a house.\n\n“They never went up there and it engulfed the whole house, took the house out,” he said.\n\nKoleckai said a neighbor with a high pressure hose, firefighting equipment and a generator saved his home.\n\nNearby, brothers Jeremy and Justin Cote were guarding their parent’s home Friday in Bonny Doon, a forested community near Santa Cruz.\n\n“We got water, we got pumps, we got generators,” said Jeremy Cote, “but it’s gnarly.”\n\n“We’re very confused,” said Justin Cote, pulling up on a small motorcycle. “There’s a fire burning here. Where is everyone? Where are they? I know they need to fight other fires, but what about this one?”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nMelissa Daniels covers local business, hospitality, and economic development in the Coachella Valley.

There were melted street signs. Trees burned down to stumps. Power lines across the road. And everywhere she turned, choking, acrid smoke.\n\nSobbing behind the face mask she normally wears for her job as a hospital respiratory therapist helping coronavirus patients, Stevens, 31, video recorded herself earlier this week as she stumbled through the neighborhood, raw emotion in her voice, sometimes unable to form words, moaning in obvious pain.\n\n\"I think everything's gone,\" she says as the rising sun illuminates the destruction. \"This doesn’t do justice to how terrifying and horrific this is, seeing how devastated everything is. Our homes are gone. Our homes are completely gone.\"\n\nThe Almeda fire is one of more than 2,000 wildfires that have burned through the western United States in the past weeks, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes from Colorado to California and Oregon, and enveloping millions in choking, toxic smoke considered hazardous to breathe.\n\nIn Oregon, the fires have blazed through more than 1 million acres, and the National Weather Service issued a “red flag warning” Sunday, warning that winds of 40 mph could “likely contribute to a significant spread\" of fires in southern Oregon.\n\nWildfire conditions appeared to improve across northwest Oregon, however, as winds stayed mild and smoke cooled temperatures. Evacuation levels were reduced from Scotts Mills to the Portland Metro Area, and with rain in the forecast, there was hope the worst is behind the state even as the death count reached 10\n\nIn the Almeda, before the fire stopped burning, intense winds fanning the flames made the fire skip around, burning some neighborhoods to the ground and leaving other properties across the street untouched. Many of the destroyed homes were mobile homes or trailers housing some of the area's poorest residents. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated in the initial fire as authorities feared it would burn into Medford, one of the state's most populous cities with roughly 83,000 people.\n\n\"It is apocalyptic,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said Sunday on the ABC program “This Week.” “I drove 600 miles up and down the state, and I never escaped the smoke. We have thousands of people who have lost their homes.\"\n\nExperts say helping people left homeless by the fires will be complicated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and dramatic rise in unemployment. Four people are confirmed dead.\n\nA family loses everything. Diapers. Clothes. Food. Their home.\n\nFor families who have lived through the historic natural disaster, it has been a week of widespread loss.\n\nFor 15 agonizing hours last week, Stevens and her husband, Fred Andrews, had worried about the fate of their townhome in this suburb of Medford, Oregon, as the ferocious wind-driven Almeda wildfire raced toward their community.\n\nAt first, they figured the evacuation was just a precaution. Andrews assumed they'd be out for a few hours at most, and then they could return. That night, he fell asleep listening to the crackle of police radios on his iPhone, exhausted from trying to make sense of what he was hearing about a fire that was supposedly two towns away. While he slept, Stevens picked up an extra shift at the Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center, helping patients and filling in for colleagues who couldn’t get past roadblocks.\n\nShe got home just after 2 a.m., but was too anxious to sleep. Almost everything they owned was in that 1,600-square-foot blue-gray townhome and its garage, from their new SUV to baby Eleanor's birth certificate issued 23 months ago. Diapers. Clothes. Food. It was the first place they'd ever owned, a real home for their little family.\n\nFor hours, she worried about its fate, and what had happened to the neighbors who'd become friends, who'd brought over cookies and welcome gifts in the 11 months the family lived in the 18-unit complex. So she slid into her Birkenstock sandals, drove to the Home Depot near her home and started walking toward fire.\n\n“Not knowing was absolutely tearing me up,” says Stevens a few days later, reflecting on her dangerous decision to walk alone, in the middle of the night, into a disaster zone. “It wasn’t just my life. It was everyone else’s I was carrying. This was so devastating because I knew these people. It wasn’t just a neighborhood. It was a community. And I realized I had the responsibility to tell 17 other families they didn’t have a home, either.\"\n\nCause of fire remains unknown\n\nAuthorities say at least 600 homes were damaged or destroyed as the fire rampaged through Ashland, Talent and Phoenix before firefighters stopped it close to the Medford city limits. Although the main fire started around 11 a.m., on Tuesday near an Ashland skate park and began racing north, several other smaller fires broke out as the winds threw embers into neighborhoods and along Highway 99.\n\nPolice arrested a man they said started a fire around 5 p.m., about half a mile from Stevens' home, as the main fire approached. At least four people are confirmed dead, and the cause of the first fire remains under investigation.\n\nMedford-area evacuee Steven Ward, 29, left one of the area's homeless encampments just two days before the fire broke out and burned through the area.\n\n\"We had some friends at the camp who had to jump into the creek to escape,\" Ward says. \"It’s a story worthy of Hollywood what they went through.”\n\nOver the weekend, Ward was living in a broken-down RV parked at a local Walmart. Dozens of homeless evacuees had set up tents or parked campers at the store.\n\n“Everybody has lost something,\" says Ward.\n\nA community faces its greatest loss\n\nThe skies were still clogged with smoke Saturday and Sunday. Firefighters were patrolling the burn area and members of the Oregon National Guard were enforcing a closure order as police cruised the empty streets for possible looters.\n\nSaturday morning, Scott Coash kept a wary eye out for trespassers as he and his wife, Cindy, walked into their undamaged but largely deserted neighborhood a few blocks from where Stevens' home used to stand. Carrying a cooler of sandwiches and water in one hand, a gun on one hip and a bottle of hand sanitizer on the other, Coash counted himself lucky –-- the flames were diverted by a hill across the street from their home, and the fire burned away despite winds throwing burning embers into his yard.\n\nApproaching their home, Coash, 64, set down the cooler, unholstered his 9 mm Glock and chambered a round, the unmistakable \"click-clack\" echoing through the empty streets as he pulled out his keys and opened the door. Coash didn't want Cindy, 62, entering the house until he'd had a chance to make sure no one was lurking inside. Like many people forced to leave their homes during a wildfire, Coash was worried looters would sneak in the way they have in other areas, including after 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California.\n\n“This is our Katrina. This is our Paradise. You see it on TV but you can never understand unless you go through it,\" said Coash, a boiler plant operator at a local university. \"You don’t understand the full effect until you walk through it, smell it, see it.”\n\nStevens was struggling to understand the devastation. She found herself trying to help other fire victims with belongings she no longer owns. At one point, she offered up a portable air conditioner before realizing she didn't have it anymore.\n\n\"We woke up that morning wondering how we were going to survive,\" her husband says.\n\nAndrews says he hasn't watched the video his wife took of their home. \"I was basically not allowing myself to feel anything.\"\n\nHospital staff devastated by fire\n\nFire victim Noemi Alvarez, 42, was working as a housekeeper at the hospital as the flames consumed the three-bedroom home of 15 years she had shared with her husband, Jesus, and their five children.\n\n\"I couldn't think straight, calling my family constantly,\" she says. \"I was so worried. It was a hard day.\"\n\nJesus and the kids fled to his brother's house. Alvarez joined them after her shift. They prayed and offered thanks.\n\nThe family worries a different wildfire burning a few miles away might race toward them if the weather changes.\n\n\"Sometimes I think it's just a dream,\" says Jesus Alvarez, 46, who was home the day of the fire because he had badly cut his hand the week before while working as a carpenter. \"We lost a lot of things. But we will stay together. We are together. That makes the family strong.\"\n\nSheri Croy, who also works for the Asante health care system, fled the fire with her family. After stuffing their new puppy, a second dog and a bearded dragon lizard named Mushu into their car, Croy told her husband she wanted a few minutes to gather documents and mementoes.\n\n\"He looked outside at this black wall coming toward us and he's like, 'there's no time,'\" says Croy. \"There was definitely crying and screaming from me in the car.\"\n\nThe fire took a particular toll on workers at Asante, the region's largest employer, with at least 80 workers losing their homes in a single day. Now, the health care system's managers have set up food banks, laundry services and clothing drives to help its displaced employees, many of whom continued going to work because patients still need care. It has also launched a donation campaign to aid community members. The Red Cross is helping coordinate donations that will directly help other fire victims.\n\nFamily refuses to leave Oregon, looks to rebuild\n\nIn the first few hours after they learned their house had been destroyed, Stevens and Andrews contemplated leaving Jackson County entirely, maybe back to Portland or even to New York. Maybe this was a sign to give up, give in, head out.\n\nAndrews had spent the day on the phone, dealing with the mortgage and the car loan and their insurance. Like many who lost their homes, Andrews and Stevens don't yet know whether insurance would cover rebuilding, or what federal aid might be available. A relative established an online donation fund and friends quickly chipped in $700.\n\nExhausted, Stevens collapsed into bed. She woke up a few hours later to discover people had poured in more than $20,000 toward the fund. It's now over $25,000.\n\nThe display of support has convinced the family to stay and rebuild.\n\n\"We needed to see that we mattered to this community, and they've shown us that,\" Stevens says. \"It would be wrong to take their kindness and leave. We need to stay and pay it forward. These are people who are so-called to action -– they've dropped everything and ransacked their own homes to help us. And not just us. All the others. I have never been part of a community so willing to help. I don't think we could live anywhere else.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/09/wildfire-map-evacuations-california-oregon-washington/5755838002/", "title": "Fire map: California firefighters injured; Oregon wildfire evacuations", "text": "In Oregon, almost 100,000 homes and businesses were without power as crews battled large fires in Clackamas County, south of Portland.\n\nWashington state was seeing 'unprecedented' fires, with 500 square miles burning on Monday alone.\n\nIn Northern California, helicopters have rescued hundreds of people stranded in the Sierra National Forest, where the Creek Fire was burning.\n\nSHAVER LAKE, Calif. — Heavy winds sweeping across the West fueled fast-growing wildfires Wednesday and forced mass evacuations as firefighters battled gamely to protect lives, homes and businesses.\n\nMore than 90 major fires that have burned more than 5,300 square miles – almost the size of Connecticut – are raging in 13 Western states, according to a count by the National Fire Information Center. At least seven people are confirmed to have died, including three in Butte County, California, according to Sheriff Kory Honea. Another 12 people are missing in Butte County, the sheriff said.\n\nThe fires were also blamed for three deaths in Oregon, and one in Washington state.\n\nThick smoke completely blocked sunlight in some large areas, and distant flames turned the sky orange in others.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area woke up to an apocalyptic, orange-tinged sky that gave the impression the morning had not arrived, as street lights stayed on and both drivers and folks in their homes had to turn their lights on.

We could hear the trees exploding as this red glow came up over the hillside.\"\n\nNorthern and Central California were under siege as Diablo winds fanned the flames of roaring, historic fires burning virtually uncontrolled. The Creek Fire in the Sierra National Forest destroyed more than 350 structures and forced evacuation of over 30,000 people in Fresno and Madera counties, authorities said.\n\nThat includes scores of people evacuated by California National Guard and Navy pilots who completed eight trips to the wilderness, bringing dozens of people back each time, Fresno County Lt. Brandon Purcell said.\n\nIn Shaver Lake, the destruction included Cressman’s General Store, an iconic landmark dating back to 1904. Dozens of homes burned, the flames charring them down to foundations and chimneys and melting away tires and paint from vehicles parked alongside. But the devastation is not total: The fire spared the Pine Ridge Elementary School, although it burned a school bus parked nearby.\n\nWeather conditions favorable for fire spread are expected to last until Thursday, when calmer winds may bring firefighters some relief.\n\n\"We understand what you're going through,\" Incident Commander Marty Adell told evacuees. \"A lot of us come from fire-prone areas.

It was like driving through hell,\" Jody Evans told NewsChannel 21. \"Did you lose everything, or is the only thing you saved yourself?\"\n\nCalifornia: Rescues, burned homes in north; south awaits Santa Anas\n\nHelicopters have rescued hundreds of people stranded in the burning Sierra National Forest, where the Creek Fire that already destroyed 365 buildings threatened 5,000 more, fire officials said.\n\nIsaac Rodriguez of San Diego and a group of friends were backpacking above Shaver Lake and planned to camp. When things got hot, Rodriguez took refuge at Lake Edison's Vermilion Valley Resort and waited for help.\n\n\"The day we started backpacking, we didn't know there was a fire,\" Rodriguez said. \"They took care of us pretty well there. ... We knew we couldn't get out.\"\n\nAuthorities say it will likely be at least a week, and possibly as long as a month, before the Creek Fire is controlled enough to permit residents to return.\n\nHolly Brown, her mother and brother hope they don't have to wait that long. They are sleeping outside the Clovis Hills Community Church on blankets near their battered Toyota Tacoma pickups so they can stay close to their dogs. Brown pondered the fate of the family farm in the Tollhouse area burned by the Creek Fire.\n\n\"I’m anxious to go home. I know it would be scary to be up there but I want to be there,\" said Brown, 45, who works at a nearby gas station. \"We were really hesitant to go to a shelter. We’re private. It’s how we do it.\"\n\nThe church on Wednesday distributed free food and other supplies to evacuees, many of whom were unwilling to go into a nearby Red Cross shelter because their animals were unwelcome there.\n\nBrown's family fled their farm Sunday at 1 a.m, bundling heirloom quilts and their dogs into the trucks. They had to leave behind an older, blind horse and a cat. The horse will find leftover containers of dog food to eat if all the hay has burned, Brown said, and the cat will survive as it always has. The family has lived on the farm for 30 years, using propane, wood and solar electricity to stay off the grid.\n\nIn Southern California, fires burned in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties, and the forecast called for the arrival of the region’s notorious Santa Anas. The hot, dry winds could reach 50 mph at times, forecasters said.\n\nThe El Dorado Fire in San Bernardino County, sparked last week during a baby gender-reveal event, had spread across 18 square miles and was 19% contained. Almost 1,000 firefighters aided by six helicopters were battling the blaze.\n\n“The combination of gusty winds, very dry air, and dry vegetation will create critical fire danger,” the National Weather Service warned.\n\nOregon: Death, power outages and evacuations\n\nIn Oregon, wildfires powered by 50-mph wind gusts killed two people, destroyed hundreds of homes, forced harried evacuations and left almost 100,000 homes and businesses without power Wednesday. The state Office of Emergency Management said at least 35 fires were burning across Oregon.\n\nGov. Kate Brown warned of overwhelming devastation from blazes burning a large swath of Oregon and Washington state that rarely experiences such intense fire activity because of the Pacific Northwest’s cool and wet climate.\n\nKOIN-TV reported a 12-year-old boy and his grandmother died in the fire near Lyons, 24 miles southeast of the capital city of Salem, and the child's mother was hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nJackson County Sheriff Nathan Sickler confirmed another death at the origin point of a wildfire that started near Ashland, The Mail Tribune newspaper in Medford reported on Wednesday night.\n\nThe precise extent of damage was unclear because so many of the fire zones were too dangerous to survey, said Oregon Deputy State Fire Marshal Mariana Ruiz-Temple.\n\nVietnam veteran Lloyd Dean Holland initially resisted police advice to leave because the fire seemed distant from his home in Estacada, 23 miles southeast of Portland. Around 10 p.m., he said his landlord came pounding on the door screaming at him to go.\n\n“I’ve been through hell and high water but nothing like this,'' Holland said. \"I’ve been shot down and shot at, but this – last night, I’m still not over it.”\n\nIn Gates, a Marion County hamlet of about 500 people 35 miles east of Salem, acting Mayor John McCormick said it was difficult to track which homes were spared by the flames and which ones were destroyed.\n\n“We were happy and at home and everything was great. Within a few hours, everything changed for everybody,\" McCormick said. \"We weren’t even in evacuation stage until suddenly the fire was there. No step 1, 2, 3 and get out. It was ‘Get out!’ There was no warning whatsoever.”\n\nWashington: 'Unprecedented, heartbreaking event'\n\nFires continued to roar across parts of Washington state, claiming the life of a 1-year-old boy. Okanogan County Sheriff Tony Hawley said the boy's family was apparently overrun by flames while trying to flee a wildfire in the northeastern part of the state. The parents were found Wednesday in the area of the Cold Springs Fire and transported to a Seattle hospital with third-degree burns, Hawley said.\n\nHundreds of residents have been ordered to evacuate this week. More than 500 square miles burned Monday alone, Gov. Jay Inslee said. That’s more in a single day than 12 of the last 18 entire fire seasons, he said.\n\n“It’s an unprecedented and heartbreaking event,'' Inslee said. \"We’re living in a new world. This is not the old Washington.\"\n\nInslee said at least nine major fires were burning across the state. He blamed heat, high winds, low humidity – and climate change – for the explosive growth of fires.\n\n\"A fire that you might’ve seen that was going to be OK over time isn’t OK anymore because the conditions are so dry, they’re so hot, they’re so windy,\" Inslee said. \"The climate has changed.”\n\nMontana: 28 homes lost in Bridger Foothills Fire\n\nThe Bridger Foothills Fire near Bozeman, Montana, isn't large in comparison to some of the blazes exploding across the West, but it has been costly. Gallatin County Sheriff Brian Gootkin said 28 residences and an unknown number of other buildings have been damaged or destroyed by fire stretching over more than 7,000 acres – about 11 square miles.\n\n“There would have been a heck of a lot more (homes burned) than that if it weren’t for our firefighters,” Gootkin told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.\n\nPrecipitation over the fire area was helping, but the sheriff's office warned on its Facebook page that \"heavy fuels\" remain dry inside and continue to burn. A warming, drying trend was expected through week's end, adding to the fire concerns.\n\nIdaho: 13 homes burn near Orofino\n\nIn Idaho, the Idaho State Fire Marshal’s Office said on Facebook that 13 homes were destroyed along with 31 other structures and 26 vehicles near the north-central Idaho town of Orofino. The culprit was a fast-moving complex of smaller wildfires covering more than 1,600 acres.\n\nThe County Commissioners Office said a landslide along a local highway took out power lines, which may have sparked the fire. No official cause had been determined, however. No injuries or fatalities had been reported.\n\nBacon reported from Arlington, Virginia; Jorge L. Ortiz from San Francisco.

He will also be meeting Louisiana's Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, and other state and local leaders. About 900,000 people in Louisiana, including much of New Orleans, remained without power and tens of thousands had no water in the midst of a sultry stretch of summer Thursday. Efforts continued to drain flooded communities, and lines for gas stretched for blocks in many places from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. But there were also glimmers of hope. Commercial flights resumed in New Orleans and power returned to parts of the business district Thursday. Officials also reported a big drop late Thursday in the number of customers with no running water: 185,000, compared to more than 600,000 the day before.\n\nPrefer to listen?

Friday's forecast called for lighter winds but also extremely dry daytime weather, with a warming trend continuing through the weekend. The blaze has spanned over 330 square miles across two counties within miles of the popular tourist destination, forcing an unprecedented evacuation of all 22,000 residents of South Lake Tahoe, California, and tens of thousands of tourists. It has been burning since Aug. 14 and still threatens thousands of homes, businesses and other buildings ranging from cabins to ski resorts along its trek toward Nevada's border.\n\nEconomy added 235,000 jobs in August amid COVID surge\n\nHiring slowed sharply in August as employers added a disappointing 235,000 jobs, with COVID-19 surges dampening both consumer demand and Americans’ willingness to return to work. The unemployment rate, which is calculated from a different survey, fell from 5.4% to 5.2%, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists had estimated that 750,000 jobs were added last month, according to a Bloomberg survey.\n\nMarvel's long-awaited 'Shang-Chi' kicks into theaters\n\nAfter getting a head start preview before the holiday weekend Thursday night, \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\" opens in theaters Friday. In his ★★★ (out of four) review, USA TODAY film critic Brian Truitt writes \"Shang-Chi\" puts martial arts and Asian-influenced fantasy elements on display in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the first time.\" Starring Simu Liu, who Truitt says \"exudes likability, swagger and depth,\" the film follows Shang-Chi and his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who go from San Francisco hotel valets to global heroes as they try to foil the latest machinations of Shang-Chi's father Wenwu (Tony Leung), who wields 10 ancient mystical rings as the leader of a shadowy terrorist organization. In an interview with USA TODAY, Liu said he connected with his character's \"feeling of being constantly in between worlds and struggling to figure out what path he wants to take.\" Liu is the mega-franchise's first lead Asian superhero.\n\nDrake's new album debuted early Friday morning\n\nDrake (finally) released his sixth studio album, \"Certified Lover Boy\" at 2 a.m. ET on Friday. On Monday, a day after his rival Kanye West's long-delayed \"Donda\" hit streaming services, Drake announced \"CLB\" was coming Friday after previous push backs. Then the four-time Grammy winner and habitual chart-topper amped up the hype during the week by buying a series of billboards in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and Memphis to tease the album's collaborations. In New York, the billboard touted \"The GOAT is on CLB\" while another said \"Hey Houston the hometown hero is on CLB.\" Speaking of buzzy collaborations, Lady Gaga also releases a remix of her 2020 pop-homecoming album called \"Dawn of Chromatica\" Friday. New guest artists include Charli XCX, Rina Sawayama and Bree Runway.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/01/15/passaic-chemical-fire-11-alarm-qualco-contained-latest-updates/6539815001/", "title": "New Jersey chemical plant fire contained, building collapsed", "text": "PASSAIC, N.J.ersey – The billowing black smoke has disappeared from the sky over the 11-alarm chemical plant fire that burned in Passaic throughout the night.\n\n“The fire is contained. But I can’t say it’s under control because of the pockets of fire,” Passaic Mayor Hector Lora told NorthJersey.com Saturday morning. “The goal now is to make sure it doesn’t reach the main plant.”\n\nMore than 200 firefighters battled the 11-alarm chemical fire, which started at 8:16 p.m. at Majestic Industries on Passaic Street and soon spread to the nearby Qualco chemical plant, said Passaic Fire Chief Patrick Trentacost.\n\nIt has now been downgraded to a four-alarm fire, but 25 companies remain on-site, said Trentacost.\n\n“There’s fire in the basement underneath the roof,” he said. “It was a total collapse of a three-story building.”\n\nThe 300-foot by 400-foot building was vacant but being used to store plastics, pallets and some chlorine, Trentacost said. The overwhelming scent of smoke and chemicals was enough to make people's eyes water as far away as Wallington.\n\nFirefighters – who had to deal with frigid overnight conditions that froze hoses and hydrants and made walking on frozen ice treacherous – kept the fire from reaching an area where more chemicals were stored, said Lora.\n\n\"This fire could have reached the main chemical plant and we could have been looking at a potential mass evacuation if not for Chief Trentacost and the mutual aid,\" said Lora.\n\nThe chief described it as “a tough” night with firefighters battling both the elements and the massive fire that spewed enough smoke to be detected by weather radar.\n\nWhat's behind high-rise building fires:Why high-rise building fires keep happening and how closed doors could save lives\n\nDeadly Bronx fire:Many killed and injured including children\n\n“One firefighter was sent to the hospital with a laceration to the face,\" Trentacost said. \"He was treated and released. We had about 14 to 16 firefighters slip and fall with bruises, twisted ankles, all minor.”\n\nAnother challenge was that the Passaic Fire Department has recently been mired in its worst COVID-19 outbreak in recent memory.\n\n\"It’s unprecedented,\" Trentacost told NorthJersey.com earlier this month. He lost nearly half of his 106 firefighters to COVID-19 and spent Christmas quarantined in his basement following his own diagnosis. \"I never thought that in my time I would see something like this.”\n\nThe state Department of Environmental Protection will remain on-site to monitor air quality throughout the day.\n\n“As of this morning residents are able to come out and go to work,” the mayor said. “We are not requiring individuals to stay in their homes. The air quality is under levels that would create concern.”\n\nThe Qualco site housed as much as 3 million pounds of potentially hazardous substances on an average day, according to state data.\n\nQualco Inc., which makes pool treatment supplies, had about a dozen chemicals at its large Passaic Street plant, ranging from industrial disinfectants to bleaching agents, according to a 2020 inventory list sent to state regulators.\n\nThe Passaic Fire Department had used the Qualco facility in the 1990s as a training ground for dealing with large-scale chemical fires and spills.\n\nThe fire will need to be completely extinguished before officials can look for its cause, Lora said.\n\nDuring the height of the blaze, large embers were blowing from the site across the Passaic River south into Wallington.\n\n\"Last year around this same time we had one of the biggest fires in the city's history at the recycling plant,\" Lora said. \"This time of year always poses challenges. I encourage people to use caution when using space heaters or plugging things into outlets using extension cords.\"\n\nThe blaze was reminiscent of the infamous 1985 Labor Day fire that tore through about 20% of Passaic's industrial base. The fire incinerated 21 century-old factories and 17 apartment buildings as well as homes in the Lower Dundee area of the city.\n\nDespite the cold temperatures, January fires have ravaged North Jersey in recent years. A massive fire destroyed the Atlantic Coast Fibers recycling plant on Jan. 30 last year. In that case, firefighters braved the brutal cold overnight and into the next day to put out the fire, which engulfed an entire city block and veiled the city’s skyline with smoke. There were at least two explosions at the site.\n\nAnd two years earlier, on Jan. 30, 2019, the landscape of nearby Elmwood Park was changed forever when a 10-alarm blaze leveled the historic Marcal Paper Mill. By the end of the night, 30 of the 36 structures on the site were either damaged or destroyed. The Marcal sign that colored the Elmwood Park portion of Route 80 a tint of red for decades was famously destroyed as well.\n\nStaff writers Scott Fallon, Katie Sobko and Steve Janoski contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/960113/the-worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-in-2023", "title": "The world's most extreme weather events in 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Wildfires, floods and heatwaves have continued to make headlines as communities across the world have had their homes and lives threatened by deadly weather conditions.\n\nThis year already \"seems destined to be remembered as the year that extreme weather events left the Northern Hemisphere reeling\", said National Geographic.

She said it was important to her to take the time to honor a man like Carter.\n\n“I think people were just so impressed with his humanity, his love of the country. He cared about the people... Just a wonderful human being,” said Phyllis Sylvester, who voted for Carter in her twenties.\n\nAggie Heller, 68, was in Washington for Carter's 1977 Inaugural Parade. She returned almost 50 years later on Tuesday to watch his casket be brought to the Capitol and pay her respects in person.\n\n“I am here because he was such a good man,” she said. “Nobody can beat his loyalty to his country.”\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carterwill lie in repose in Georgia: Updates\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar and Christopher Cann\n\nServices for Carter began last week\n\nFuneral services for former President Jimmy Carter began Saturday as the U.S. pays respect to the 39th president who passed away last Sunday at 100 years old. The nation will honor Carter over six days of funeral events.\n\nA funeral motorcade started in the morning near Carter's farming hometown of Plains. The solemn sound of a bell ringing out 39 times broke the quiet of a chilly January morning at Carter’s boyhood home. (That same bell would ring an hour before daylight during Carter's boyhood, which was the name of his memoir about his early years.)\n\nThen, his remains were taken to the state capital in Atlanta, where he was honored in a moment of silence at the Capitol before a service at the Carter Center.\n\n'An unbelievable American story':Mourners line streets from Plains to honor Jimmy Carter\n\nWho was Jimmy Carter?\n\nThe son of a farmer and nurse, Carter was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, according to his official biography. He grew up in nearby Archery. He attended public schools, went to the U.S. Naval Academy and became a nuclear engineer, serving on the second nuclear submarine. He married Rosalynn Smith in 1946.\n\nWhen his father died, Carter returned home to his family farm and also operated a seed and farm supply company in Plains. He served in the Georgia Senate before becoming governor in 1971.\n\nIn 1976, he ran for president as a Democrat and won, beginning his term at 52 years old. Carter served a single term in the White House.\n\nAs president, Carter expanded diplomatic relations abroad, invested in the energy sector and increased national park space for Americans. However, he also oversaw inflation and an American hostage crisis that likely cost his re-election, losing to Ronald Reagan.\n\nCarter had a lengthy post-presidency with humanitarian work across the globe, including with preventable diseases. In 2002, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to \"find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\"\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2023, Rosalynn Carter died at their home in Plains.

That's a promise Biden is set to fulfill Thursday at Carter's state funeral at Washington National Cathedral, an occasion expected to draw all five living presidents and former presidents to the pews.\n\nTheir final conversation was in 2021, on Biden's 100th day in office, a milestone that can carry political meaning. Biden and first lady Jill Biden had flown to Plains, Georgia, to see Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, the first time any of Carter's successors had visited him in his hometown. It was a chance for the two men to say goodbye.\n\nTheir connection went back decades, to 1974, when Biden was in his first term as a senator from Delaware and Carter was in the final year of his only term as governor of Georgia. Biden, then 31, was in Atlanta to speak to a convention of the Jaycees, a leadership training organization then limited to men under 40.\n\nIn a meeting at the governor's mansion before Biden's speech, they hit it off. When Carter announced his long-shot bid for the presidency that December, Biden was the first politician outside Georgia to endorse him.\n\nTheir relationship would have its ups and downs. Biden even considered challenging Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1980. They were politicians of different stripes − Biden the legislative insider, a believer in the power of personal relationships, and Carter forever the outsider, seemingly suspicious of them.\n\nBut they remained friends, and they would share history. Both would turn out to be one-term presidents, their bids for reelection damaged by inflation and the accusation by critics that they weren't up to the job.\n\n\"Carter was a decent man,\" Biden said. \"I think Carter looked at the world not from here\" − he held his hand up high − \"but from here,\" moving his hand to the level of his heart, \"where everybody else lives.\"\n\nPreorder now:Celebrate Jimmy Carter's remarkable life and contributions with our new book\n\nCarter reminded Biden of his father. \"My dad used to talk about, 'Everybody's entitled to be treated with dignity no matter what, just an even chance.' And that was Carter.\"\n\nThen Biden leaned forward and dropped his voice, as though sharing an amazing secret. \"But think of this: He was a born-again Christian from Georgia leading the progressive movement of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nA White House photo from their final visit shows the Bidens kneeling next to the Carters' easy chairs.

Bush after his death in December 2018.\n\nThe tradition began in 1865 with a one-day government shutdown six weeks after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhile several presidents have been honored with a day of mourning in the subsequent years, others have been commemorated as well. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were each honored with a national day of mourning after they were assassinated in 1968.\n\nBiden orders flags to be flown at half-staff for 30 days\n\nPresident Biden, who will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, has also ordered for U.S. flags to fly at half-staff for Carter for 30 days following his death. The honor is one granted to all sitting or former presidents under a 1954 proclamation signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nFor Carter, flags will fly at half-staff – or half-mast, in the case of ships and naval stations – until Jan. 28. That means the flags will still be at half-staff during President-elect Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\nWhat is closed on a national day of mourning?\n\nBiden issued an executive order Dec. 30 that “all executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government shall be closed on Jan. 9,” except those necessary for “national security, defense, or other public need.” That means federal employees will have a paid day off.\n\nHere's a list of agencies and services that will briefly close for the day:\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

After he moved back to his hometown of Plains, Georgia, his decades of work on behalf of free elections, affordable housing and public health gave him the standing to say and do what he wanted.\n\nBeing awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 helped, too.\n\nCarter's \"enduring attribute\" was \"character, character, character,\" President Joe Biden declared in his eulogy, the 46th president saying goodbye to the 39th. \"Because of that, I believe character is destiny − destiny in our lives and quite frankly, destiny in the life of our nation.\"\n\nSitting in the front row of the vaulted cathedral were not only Biden but also Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump. It was the first time as many as five current or former occupants of the Oval Office had gathered in one place since the funeral in 2018 of George H.W. Bush, another dearly departed member of their exclusive ranks.\n\nTheir united presence presumably stemmed from their sense of obligation for the rituals that unite and define the nation, like state funerals and presidential inaugurations. But it also may reflect the advice often misattributed to Yogi Berra: \"Always go to other people's funerals; otherwise they won't go to yours.\"\n\nThere was a time when former presidents generally observed an implicit fraternity pledge to avoid publicly blasting their successors, even those they had battled in bitter campaigns. The elder Bush, denied a second term by Clinton, made a public commitment to stay out of the political to-and-fro, a promise he kept. He was \"not in the press conference or the op-ed business,\" he told USA TODAY in an interview in 2002.\n\nBut Carter regularly violated that political norm through the administrations of Republicans and fellow Democrats alike.\n\n\"Just as he was free with sometimes unsolicited advice for his presidential successors, the Lord of all creation should be ready for Jimmy's recommendations on how to make God's realm a more peaceful place,\" former Carter adviser Stuart Eisenstat said in his funeral remarks, drawing knowing laughter from Presidents' Row.\n\nCarter met with some foreign leaders when sitting presidents were trying to ostracize them, including Fidel Castro of Cuba and Hafez al-Assad of Syria. He traveled to North Korea to negotiate nuclear limits, then talked about the results on CNN before he had discussed them with then-President Clinton.\n\nHe made clear his contempt for Ronald Reagan and his policies, criticized Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky, called the younger Bush's administration \"the worst in history,\" and suggested that because of Russian interference Trump hadn't won the 2016 election fair and square.\n\nTrump responded by calling him a \"terrible president.\"\n\nYet Trump, 11 days away from being inaugurated for a second term, showed up at the funeral with his wife, Melania.\n\nIn a way, Trump's election in 2016 meant Carter was no longer the designated rogue. Biden, Obama and Clinton depicted Trump as a danger to democracy itself, a more consequential concern than anything ever leveled at Carter, who was honored for his work worldwide to strengthen democracies. Even George W. Bush, a lifelong Republican, didn't vote for Trump in 2020, instead writing in the name of his former secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice.\n\nTrump was seated next to Obama, the two men chatting and smiling. But neither Clinton nor Bush shook hands with Trump when they entered to be seated down the row from him, though Bush did give Obama a passing affectionate belly tap. Vice President Kamala Harris and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominees he defeated in 2024 and 2016, didn't make an effort to shake Trump's hand, either.\n\nIn an interview in 1997, Clinton offered USA TODAY an explanation for why it can be hard for presidents and former presidents to get along.\n\n\"When you have two strong-willed people and you've got a lot of things that happen over a long relationship, there will be from time to time when it's not just exactly like you'd like it to be,\" Clinton said for a story about his relationship with Carter.\n\nTheir history was fraught. As Arkansas governor, Clinton blamed then-President Carter for costing him a reelection bid. Carter's administration had housed Cuban refugees from the Mariel boatlift at Arkansas' Fort Chaffee, a damaging political move after riots there.\n\nCarter acknowledged the strains. \"We've been disappointed at times by a lack of easy communication and understanding with some of the people who work under President Clinton,\" he told USA TODAY in 1997.\n\nTwo years later, though, Clinton awarded Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nBiden was closer to Carter than any of the other living presidents. Then the junior senator from Delaware, Biden was the first Democratic official outside Georgia to endorse Carter's presidential run. He was the last president or former president to meet with Carter to say goodbye.\n\nOn the 100th day of his presidency, Biden flew to Plains for a final meeting with Carter, then 96 years old and in declining health. That was when Carter first broached the idea of Biden delivering his eulogy, whenever that time came.\n\n\"Granted, I had some disagreements with him, and some of them were published,\" Biden told USA TODAY in an interview Sunday. He had been sufficiently disgruntled with Carter's leadership in 1980 that he briefly considered joining Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy in challenging him for the Democratic nomination. \"But Carter was a decent man.\"\n\nIn his eulogy, Biden described his last meeting with Carter, in Plains. \"We saw Jimmy as he always was, at peace with a life fully lived − a good life, with purpose and meaning. Character, driven by destiny, and filled with the power of faith, hope and love.\n\n\"May God bless you, Jimmy Carter.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/04/george-h-w-bush-son-eulogy/2200246002/", "title": "George H.W.

What to know before January deadline", "text": "The fate of one of America's most used-social media platforms is in the balance of U.S. lawmakers arguing the Chinese-owned app poses a national security threat.\n\nThis Friday, representatives of TikTok's parent company ByteDance will plead to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the decision of a looming ban later this month.\n\nOn April 24, President Joe Biden signed legislation into law that will require ByteDance to sell the app by Jan. 19. If it fail to do so by the deadline, TikTok will no longer be available to download and internet service providers will be legally prohibited from allowing access on U.S. internet browsers.\n\nIt's also uncertain what President-elect Donald Trump's role in a potential ban will be when he takes office on Jan. 20. While he tried to ban the app during his first term, he has expressed a change of heart during his 2024 campaign.\n\nAt December Mar-a-Lago press conference, he admitted TikTok has a \"warm spot in my heart\" as he credited the app for a boost of support from young voters.\n\n\"It's a tough decision to make,\" Trump told CNBC in a March interview. \"Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok who love it.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the pending TikTok ultimatum.\n\nWhen would TikTok be banned?\n\nThe U.S. ban on TikTok would go into effect as soon as Jan. 19 if ByteDance does not sell the platform by then.\n\nWhat's true? What's false? Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter.\n\nWhen will Supreme Court review the TikTok ban?\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to review TikTok' arguments on Friday, Jan. 10, just over a week before the ban could be implemented.\n\nWhat is TikTok asking the Supreme Court to do?\n\nTikTok wants SCOTUS to overturn a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which states that the legislation's infringement of free speech rights is justified because of national security concerns.\n\nWhen could the TikTok ban go into place?\n\nThe ban will go into place on Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025, if ByteDance does not sell the platform by then.\n\nCould TikTok be bought?\n\nThough China has been vocal in the past about its opposition to selling TikTok, billionaire Frank McCourt has expressed his interest in purchasing the U.S. portion of the platform with a group of associates. McCourt, founder of Project Liberty and executive chairman of McCourt Global, said a consortium of associates has verbally pledged up to $20 billion for the purchase.\n\nHowever, if McCourt purchased TikTok, it would only be the U.S. portion and would not include TikTok's algorithm, which China sees as its intellectual property, McCourt told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" earlier this month.\n\nWill Donald Trump save TikTok?\n\nTrump's vision for TikTok when he takes office is unclear. Despite steps he took during his first term to ward off ByteDance, he has expressed different feelings for the app more recently.\n\nLast week, Trump said during a press conference that he has a \"warm spot\" for TikTok in his heart, as he believes the app helped him gain ground with young voters in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“TikTok had an impact, and so we're taking a look at it,” Trump said. “I have a little bit of a warm spot in my heart. I'll be honest.\"\n\nTrump's team did not respond to a USA TODAY request for comment.\n\nWhy did the government create the ban?\n\nConcerns about national security stem from worries that ByteDance, which is based in Beijing, has access to American data and is sharing it with the Chinese government.\n\nIn 2020, Trump issued an executive order regarding TikTok. As part of the order, Trump tried to ban TikTok in the U.S. and prohibit any transactions with the company, according to the Trump White House archival website. However, this ban never went into place.\n\nIn 2021, Biden revoked Trump's proposed ban and issued a new executive order regarding ByteDance, which said that the company \"continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States,\" a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit court opinion states. In 2022, Biden signed a bill that prohibited the use of TikTok on government devices.\n\nHow many Americans use TikTok?\n\nThere are over 170 million TikTok users based the U.S., an app spokesperson told USA TODAY last month.\n\nAt least a third of U.S. adults use TikTok, according to a November report by the Pew Research Center, with at least 59% of them being under 30. The center reported that 95% of adult users say their primary use of the app is entertainment.\n\nHow many US TikTok employees are there?\n\nTikTok has around 7,000 U.S. employees, according to Reuters. It is uncertain what will happen to those jobs if a U.S. ban were to go into effect.\n\nWhat is TikTok?\n\nTikTok is a social media application known for its short-form videos. Users can create, post and interact with videos on the app. TikTok is popular for its scrolling algorithm and allows users to post videos between three seconds and 10 minutes long. Users may add different filters, backgrounds, music and stickers to their videos.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe and Karissa Waddick\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

He will eventually make his way to the U.S. Capitol and the Washington National Cathedral, where a national funeral service will be held.\n\nFlags will also remain at half-staff for 30 days after his death, a timeline that overlaps Trump's inauguration.\n\nTikTok ban?\n\nThis spring, President Joe Biden passed legislation that would ban the hugely popular social media app TikTok in January if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, does not sell it. The legislation has been in the works for several years because of fears that TikTok compromises national security.\n\nIf ByteDance does not sell TikTok by Jan. 19, the app will be illegal for distribution through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Internet service providers also will be required to make the app inaccessible on U.S. internet browsers.\n\nIn a last-minute decision, however, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments from TikTok and its parent company about why a ban could be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court is set to review TikTok's arguments on Jan. 10, just over a week before the ban could be put in place.\n\nThough China has been vocal about its opposition to selling TikTok, billionaire Frank McCourt has expressed his interest in purchasing the U.S. portion of the platform with a group of associates. McCourt, founder of Project Liberty and executive chairman of McCourt Global, said a consortium of associates has verbally pledged up to $20 billion for the purchase.\n\nBut if McCourt purchased TikTok, it would be only the U.S. portion and would not include TikTok's algorithm, which China sees as its intellectual property, McCourt told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" earlier this month.\n\nPresidential inauguration of Donald Trump\n\nIn January, Trump will begin his second, nonconsecutive term as the 47th president of the United States.\n\nTrump will officially take over executive control of the country amid highly choreographed ceremonies on Jan. 20, which coincides with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nIt starts in the morning when Biden is expected to welcome Trump to the White House, as is custom. Around noon, the chief justice of the United States will administer the oath of office in a public ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Trump will then deliver his inaugural address.\n\nAfter the swearing-in, a traditional parade moves along Pennsylvania Avenue, featuring military bands, civic organizations and representatives from across the nation.\n\nThe day ends with inaugural balls and receptions.\n\nCriminal trials: Diddy, Luigi Mangione\n\nAmerican rapper and superstar Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will face the start of his federal sex crimes trial on May 5. He was indicted on sex trafficking and racketeering charges and faces claims from more than 100 accusers.\n\nCombs was arrested at a Manhattan hotel Sept. 16 and arraigned the next day. He has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty on all federal criminal charges, despite mounting civil lawsuits over the past year. He has been incarcerated in the Special Housing Unit at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center since his arrest.\n\nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the court the prosecution's case would last at least three weeks. The defense case is expected to take a week, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said.\n\nLuigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson to death on Dec 4, also faces a criminal trial in 2025. Mangione has been charged in federal court, Pennsylvania state court and New York state court.\n\nIn the New York case, Mangione faces 11 charges, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, two counts of second-degree murder, including one as an act of terrorism, and a slew of weapons charges. In Pennsylvania, he was charged with forgery and illegally possessing an unlicensed gun, among others, while his federal charges include murder and interstate stalking.\n\nThe federal charges could bring a death sentence if Mangione is convicted.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\n\n'Wicked' Part 2\n\nThe second part of the two-act release, called “Wicked: For Good,” is set for release on Nov. 21 − one year (minus a day) after the first installment.\n\n\"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: Part 2\" were shot back-to-back from December 2022 to January 2024, according to Forbes, which means the second installment of \"Wicked\" has already been filmed.\n\nThe third Avatar installment\n\nThe third installment of the \"Avatar\" series, \"Avatar: Fire and Ash,\" hits theaters Dec. 19, three years after \"Way of Water\" was released and just about 15 years after the original 2009 film.\n\nLike \"Way of Water,\" \"Fire and Ash\" will introduce viewers to a whole new tribe of Na'vi called \"The Ash People,\" according to multiple outlets, including Parade and Variety. As the name suggests, this tribe has a culture that revolves around fire, a direct contrast to the water tribe of the previous film.\n\n“You’ll see a lot more Pandora that you never saw before,” director James Cameron told Variety.\n\nStars include Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Kate Winslet and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nMore movie and TV releases\n\nThere is no shortage of media releases to anticipate in 2025, from revamps of classic shows to long-awaited new seasons and big-screen premiers.\n\nDates TBD: “Stranger Things,\" \"You,\" “Squid Game\" Season 3 (Season 2 arrived in December), \"Wednesday,\" \"Monster,\" \"The Last of Us,\" “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” “Welcome to Derry,\" “The Handmaid’s Tale,\" “What Not to Wear” reunion, “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" \"The Bear\" and “Welcome to Wrexham.\"\n\nJan. 2: A modern revamp of \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" will air on ABC.\n\nJan. 27: \"The Bachelor\" returns to ABC.\n\nFeb. 14: Season three of \"Yellowjackets\" comes to Parmount+ with Showtime.\n\nFeb 16: \"White Lotus\" returns to HBO.\n\nFeb 26: Season 48 of \"Survivor\" begins on CBS.\n\nApril 22: \"Andor\" Season 2 comes to Disney+.\n\nSpace exploration\n\nSpace agencies like NASA and SpaceX have some major missions planned for the upcoming year.\n\nElon Musk is pushing for SpaceX to significantly ramp up Starship test launches in 2025, a proposal that would quintuple the flight tests of the SpaceX megarocket from five demonstrations in 2024 to 25 next year. Musk's request would need approval from federal regulators.\n\nSpaceX envisions the powerful spacecraft being a fully reusable transportation system that can carry humans and cargo to Earth's orbit, the moon and even Mars. Though SpaceX is rapidly preparing for its flight test, the company has not yet announced a target date.\n\nAlso, a commercial lunar lander will soon be heading to the moon with a fleet of scientific instruments for a $93.3 million NASA mission to study the moon's environment before humans return.\n\nThe lander's instruments will examine the lunar subsurface and global navigation satellite abilities, among other questions. The data NASA hopes to collect also should provide insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect Earth.\n\nNASA's cutting-edge SPHEREx telescope is also on the cusp of launching on a mission to solve some of the universe's oldest mysteries – including how it came to be. The telescope, which has a $242 million price tag, was developed to survey more than 450 million galaxies and 100 million stars in our own Milky Way. Some galaxies it will observe are so distant that their light has taken 10 billion years to reach Earth.\n\nThe two-year mission will launch no earlier than late February.\n\nLikewise, the first step in establishing the world’s first commercial space station will come as early as August. Vast, a space company based in Long Beach, California, announced in 2023 that it plans to launch its space station, called Haven-1.\n\nThe mission will be quickly followed by Vast-1, the first human spaceflight mission to Haven-1. The four-person crew will ride a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to dock with the station for up to 30 days while orbiting Earth, according to Vast.\n\nBoeing Starliner astronauts to return on SpaceX vehicle\n\nNASA's Starliner astronauts will make their long-awaited homecoming to Earth as early as the end of March.\n\nSuni Williams and Butch Wilmore weren't supposed to be at the International Space Station beyond a few days in June when they reached the orbital outpost on the inaugural flight test for Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. But their return was delayed multiple times until NASA finally decided in August that the safest route would be to send the pair back to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon vehicle.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner undocked in September without the astronauts and landed in the New Mexico desert.\n\nThe Starliner astronauts were set to return in February with two spacefarers who are part of a SpaceX mission called Crew-9. But earlier in December, NASA opted to delay that return until late March to give time to ready the Dragon vehicle that will ferry their replacements to the space station.\n\nNo historic eclipse, but more space events to come\n\nThe year will begin with a \"planet parade\" during which Venus, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars all shine brightly every night after sunset in January and February. In January and February, look for Venus and Saturn in the southwestern sky and Jupiter and Mars toward the southeast.\n\nOn Jan. 13, a lunar occultation of Mars will be visible in the U.S. A lunar occultation occurs when the moon passes in front of a star or planet and blocks its light for about an hour before moving on its way around the Earth.\n\nMarch 13-14 will see the only total lunar eclipse visible from the United States in 2025. A total lunar eclipse occurs when Earth comes directly between the sun and full moon and casts a shadow onto the lunar surface.\n\nOn April 22-23 and Oct. 21-22, the annual Lyrid and Orionid meteor showers will appear in the night sky.\n\nThe year's lunar events will wrap on Nov. 5 with a supermoon.\n\nAward shows\n\nOne consistent we know we can look forward to every year without fail: awards season. This year's shows will play out on the following schedule:\n\nSunday, Jan. 5: 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 2: 67th Grammy Awards\n\nSaturday, Feb. 8: Director and Producer Guild of America Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 16: BAFTA Film Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 23: 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\nSunday, March 2: 97th Academy Awards\n\nSeptember (TBD): 77th Emmy Awards\n\nContributing: J.

Then suddenly, I started posting the content and living the dreams that I always prayed for. I'm able to have this type of life that I dreamed of — I am who I always wanted to be. If TikTok were to be banned, it would be such a defeat.\"\n\nAccording to the law, if TikTok does not transfer ownership of the app to a company without Chinese ties by Jan. 19, app stores will not be allowed to provide the app to U.S. customers, and U.S.-based servers will be banned from hosting the app.\n\nDespite facing a First Amendment lawsuit in June, filed by the nonprofit legal group Liberty Justice Center, the law was upheld in a Washington D.C. federal court in December. But on Dec. 16, the Liberty Justice Center joined a group of TikTok creators in filing an emergency petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was granted.\n\n“We believe the TikTok ban violates the free speech rights of the millions of Americans who use TikTok to share and hear ideas,” said Jacob Huebert, president of the Liberty Justice Center and a lead attorney on the case. “It shuts down an entire medium of communication, and really is unprecedented in how broadly it suppresses American speech.”\n\nThe potential ban troubles many Nashville residents, particularly young artists and entrepreneurs who make a substantial amount of their living based on the reach that TikTok provides them.\n\nIn a December amicus brief filed before the Supreme Court in support of TikTok, Nashville-based think tank The Future of Free Speech, along with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and several other civil liberties organizations, called the ban an “unprecedented departure” from the nation’s “longstanding commitment to free speech exceptionalism.”\n\n“For decades, the United States has been the global gold standard for free speech protections,” said Jacob Mchangama, executive director of The Future of Free Speech. “The unprecedented bipartisan push to effectively shut down TikTok — an online platform where millions exercise their right to free expression and access information — represents a troubling shift from this proud legacy.”\n\n'This is how I pay the bills'\n\nTapping her black embroidered cowgirl boots to the beat thumping through the stage, local musician Sheyna Gee carefully tuned her guitar before a performance at Dierks Bentley’s Whiskey Row bar on Dec. 19. In front of her feet lay rows of flashy business cards — emblazoned with the QR code to her website — that matched an even flashier banner standing behind her, allowing fans to connect with her on social media and follow her music.\n\n“I’m a musician first and content creator second — and TikTok has changed my life,” Gee said.\n\nGee, who moved here in 2015 from Los Angeles and is a full-time musician, struggled to gain traction in Nashville until she made a TikTok account. Now, her popularity has skyrocketed with over 235,000 followers, and she makes about $1,000 a month from TikTok, in addition to anywhere between $1,500-$5,000 a month in brand deals.\n\n“Before TikTok, in a good month I had maybe a thousand streams,” she said. “Now, I steadily have between 30,000 and 80,000 streams.”\n\nBut for Gee, it wasn’t just about the increased streams. It was about learning who she was as an artist.\n\n“TikTok validated what I wasn’t confident enough to do,” she said. “I kept listening to outside people telling me what they wanted me to be. They wanted me to be Joan Jett. The whole time, I should’ve been doing what I wanted to do, and I want to do sad country music.”\n\nWhile crossing Broadway recently, Gee was stopped by Shawn Walton, who wanted help filming a TikTok. Walton, a Nashville native traveling across the country for his full-time job creating lifestyle and travel content for his nearly 50,000 followers, said the potential ban was “dissatisfying.”\n\n“Hopefully it doesn’t get banned. I’m praying to God,” he said. “My TikTok is just starting to take off. And what other platform are we going to go to? There’s so much positivity there, and I don’t want to see it banned.”\n\nLea Bryant, a 24-year-old Nashville native, has exploded on TikTok over the past two years, with over 13,000 followers.\n\nAs a young Black content creator, Bryant dubs herself a Nashville Socialite, sharing videos of different social events in town, tips for Black women in Nashville, and event planning for her self-made She’s Social Club.\n\n“I love posting about my experiences in Nashville,” she said. “That’s why I started the social club. So many women were commenting, ‘I've lived here in Nashville for a long time,’ or ‘I just moved here and am having a hard time finding friends’ — and those things just laid on my heart.”\n\nThe first She’s Social Club gathering had just five members. Now, the club boasts over 500 members, giving Bryant the ability to hire a team of event planners to work alongside her.\n\n“Thanks to TikTok, there’s just so many different things that I've been able to accomplish,” she said. “I wanted to show what it looks like being a Black girl in Nashville. I think people think that Nashville is just cowboy hats and boots and country music. There's actually so much more culture.”\n\nBryant worries that if TikTok is banned, people will “lose access” to representation in Nashville.\n\n“It's important for Black Nashville to be shown, and TikTok has created this entire community online for it,\" she said. \"If TikTok were to be banned, I think that community would lose a lot of representation, especially for those creators who are up and coming.”\n\nThe worry is similar for established content creators as well. Lauren Paley, another fulltime Nashville TikTok creator, has amassed nearly 11 million followers on the platform and posts a mixture of lifestyle content, with a focus on her operatic singing and idyllic family videos.\n\nShe started her TikTok push from a garage in 2019.\n\n“I walked through our apartment garage stairwell one day and discovered it had amazing acoustics, so I started going in there and using it as my little space to sing so I wasn't disturbing anyone,” she said. “And then I posted a little clip singing in the stairwell one day, and it went viral on TikTok.”\n\nHer platform has only grown since. Last year, Paley made around $50,000 thanks to the app — not including sponsorship revenue.\n\n“If it wasn't for TikTok, I probably would not be pursuing music at all,” she said. “It kind of reignited this love and passion that I have. And maybe I'm not in New York on Broadway, pursuing it in that way, but now I get to stay home with my daughter and still make videos full time, and be with her while doing what I love. All because of TikTok.”\n\nPaley said a ban would be “the biggest blow.”\n\n“For me, this platform is something that I've been building, and I've done it all on my own for the past five years now. I can't even comprehend it disappearing,” she said. “It's not only a place that I love to post content and connect with my followers; I feel like we've created such a community.\"\n\nLawyers argue that TikTok ban would violate free speech, despite security concerns\n\nHuebert, president of the Liberty Justice Center, is the lead attorney for BASED Politics, a nonprofit educational political podcast on TikTok and one of the many plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the ban.\n\nHe said the Supreme Court needs to rule the law as unconstitutional because it would ban all speech on TikTok — even though nearly all of it is constitutionally protected.\n\n“We argue that this law violates the free speech rights of our client — and the 170 million other Americans who use TikTok — to hear and share speech,” Huebert said.\n\nThe government’s main argument for the ban concerns national security. In court filings, the government argued that ByteDance — which is headquartered in Beijing — is subject to the laws of the People’s Republic of China and can therefore provide the highly sensitive data that TikTok collects from users' phones to Chinese intelligence.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike have expressed worry over the national security implications of TikTok. Over the past year, for instance, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, both Tennessee Republicans, have emphasized their concerns over potential misuse of data by the Chinese government.\n\nBut Huebert said the security concerns do not amount to a level that requires the banning of the app, as the law needs to clear the legal hurdle of \"strict scrutiny\" — a common First Amendment legal concept that requires the government prove a compelling and immediate reason to violate or restrict the First Amendment.\n\n”The government tried to justify the law by invoking national security, and in particular, invoking the protection of Americans’ data privacy and the preventing of the Chinese government from making TikTok promote or suppress content in a way that would undermine the U.S. government's interests,\" he said.\n\nThat last part, Huebert said, is key to his argument that the law violates the First Amendment.\n\n“The First Amendment exists to prevent the government from enacting laws to suppress speech that it thinks goes against its interests,” he said. “It doesn't matter whether speech goes against the government's interest, it's protected just the same, and that even includes speech that directly attacks our very form of government and our institutions directly.”\n\nThe USA TODAY Network - Tennessee's coverage of First Amendment issues is funded through a collaboration between the Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.\n\nHave a story to tell?

President Joe Biden signed the legislation into law Wednesday.\n\nProponents of the policy say that the app poses a national security risk. Lawmakers, informed by Biden administration intelligence briefings, have raised concerns about the possibility of the Chinese government spying on Americans and spreading propaganda through the app. Around 170 million Americans use the platform.\n\n\"We are giving people a choice here: To improve this platform and have the opportunity for Americans to make sure that they are not being maligned by our foreign adversaries,\" said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, on the Senate floor Thursday.\n\nGrandpa, please don't ban TikTok:How pressure campaign hit close to home for some in Congress\n\nTikTok says the Chinese government hasn't requested American users' data, and that it would not hand it over if they did. They also argue that the legislation violates Americans' right to free speech, and that banning the app would harm small businesses who rely on the app for exposure.\n\nSo far, there has been no public evidence that the app is being used to spy on U.S. citizens, but reporting from multiple outlets have indicated TikTok's American operation has struggled to fully separate from its Chinese parent company.\n\nCourt and diplomatic battles ahead\n\nNow that Congress has approved the legislation, expect TikTok to fight it in court. That has worked in the past – former President Donald Trump also attempted to ban TikTok, which was blocked by a federal judge. More recently, a federal judge in Montana blocked a state ban, saying it \"likely violates the First Amendment.\"\n\nA TikTok spokesperson called the new law \"unconstitutional\" in a statement released Wednesday.\n\n\"Rest assured, we aren't going anywhere,\" TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video statement, pledging to mount a legal challenge. \"The facts and the Constitution are on our side, and we expect to prevail again.\"\n\nIf ByteDance is forced to comply, selling it would be complicated. TikTok is worth tens of billions of dollars, so only ultra-wealthy investors are likely able to afford it.\n\nInvestor groups and major tech giants like Microsoft, Apple and Oracle will consider bids, analysts say. Other big tech companies are likely to mull joint bids, though Google and Meta are not expected to attempt to buy it because of the Biden administration's aggressive antitrust stance.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also says he's organizing investors to bid on the app.\n\nBut the Chinese government would also likely block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, which would force a buyer to rebuild a crucial component of the app.\n\nA Pew Research poll released last December showed 38% of Americans supported banning TikTok compared to 27% who oppose and 35% who are unsure about the idea. That is down when compared to the 50% who said Congress should get rid of the app in March last year.\n\nThe survey also found those attitudes flip when U.S. adults under age 30 were asked. Among younger Americans, 41% oppose a ban versus 29% who support and 30% who remain unsure.\n\nThat's led some Democrats to raise concerns that the ban's passage could hurt their candidates in the general election this fall, especially with young people. But Democrats, including Biden, argue that the aim is not to ban the app but to get an American company to buy it.\n\n\"We just had 80 people vote for this of both parties, there's a strong concern about it,\" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., told USA TODAY shortly after the Senate held a procedural vote en route to the final passage of the legislation Tuesday.\n\n\"We need the programming on TikTok and it's certainly very creative and successful, and I really believe it needs to continue,\" Stabenow added. \"But it needs to continue in a way that does not jeopardize people's personal information as possibly being held by a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTrump, too, appears to see an opportunity in the legislation: Despite previously attempting to restrict the app under his own administration, he posted to Truth Social on Monday: \"Just so everyone knows, especially the young people, Crooked Joe Biden is responsible for banning TikTok.\"\n\nThe presumptive GOP presidential nominee told CNBC in March that he ultimately decided banning the social media site should be left up to Congress. \"It's a tough decision to make,\" he said. \"Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok who love it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/live-updates-biden-gop-congress-trump/11197850002/", "title": "Spy balloon flew over missile sites, Intelligence chair says: recap", "text": "President Joe Biden will try to convince a divided Congress that Democrats and Republicans must work together when he delivers his second State of the Union address tonight.

But he said the U.S. intelligence community is scheduled to brief him and other members of congressional leadership who comprise the Gang of Eight later this week on the balloon and efforts to gain any intelligence from the recovery of it.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\n‘I thought I would not make it alive’: Capitol Police officer assaulted on Jan. 6 testifies in Proud Boys trial\n\nA former U.S. Capitol Police officer described what he believed to be a near-death experience while protecting the Capitol from rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, in testimony during the Proud Boys sedition trial Tuesday.\n\nMark Ode, who was part of the Capitol Police’s civil disturbance unit on Jan. 6, testified that while attempting to hold a police line, rioters simultaneously pushed him to the ground and sprayed him with an “unknown chemical substance.\" He fell on his stomach and the rioters piled on top of him.\n\n“I was incapable of moving most of my limbs including my legs...I thought I would not make it alive out of that pile,” Ode said, adding that he struggled to breathe because his face mask had trapped the chemicals and the rioters were using his helmet strap to choke him.\n\nAn officer behind him urged him to “stand up” before grabbing his leg and pulling him out of the pile, he recalled.\n\n-- Ella Lee\n\nBiden administration to focus on youth online privacy, mental health in renewed agenda\n\nPresident Joe Biden is sharpening his focus on the internet’s effect on young people heading into the second half of his first term, the White House said Tuesday.\n\nAs part of his ongoing “unity agenda,” Biden will call for Congress to ban targeted online advertising for young people and enact “strong protections” for their online privacy, safety and mental health.\n\n“We know that too many Americans continue to struggle — especially young people, where mounting evidence indicates that social media and other tech or platforms can be harmful to mental health and well-being and developments,” said Christen Linke Young, deputy assistant to the president for health and veterans affairs.\n\nThe Biden administration’s fresh focus on technology’s impact on young people comes as Congress considers bipartisan legislation that would ban the social media app TikTok, which more than two-thirds of young people use.\n\n-- Ella Lee\n\nBiden to lay out `forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package deliver companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentany\n\nRepublicans have been hammering Biden over the amount of fentanyl coming into the country, calling it a failure of Biden’s ability to control the border.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nBlack Caucus bringing families impacted by police reform to the State of the Union\n\nMember of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests impacted by police violence to the State of the Union tonight.\n\nThe parents of Tyre Nichols, will attend the speech at the invitation of the Black Caucus. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer choking him. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., is bringing Michael Brown, Sr., father of Michael Brown, as her guest. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, invited Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, as her guest. Rep. Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, invited Samaria Rice, the mother of Tamir Rice, as her attendee.\n\nThe Black Caucus has pressed President Joe Biden to address police reform during his speech tonight. “It's imperative that we tackle this issue with legislative solutions, with executive actions and community-based results that work,” said Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., chairman of the CBC, during a press conference Tuesday morning. “That is how we put an end to the pattern of Black lives being taken at the hands of law enforcement.”\n\n-- Mabinty Quarshie\n\nBiden not doing annual presidential interview with network broadcasting the Super Bowl, Fox News\n\nJust like his predecessors, President Joe Biden in the past has taken advantage of the tradition of granting an exclusive interview to the network hosting the Super Bowl to speak directly to the 100 million-plus audience that watches the annual Sunday spectacle worldwide.\n\nBiden did such a sit-down with CBS in 2021 shortly after his inauguration, and with NBC last year, talking to anchor Lester Holt for a lengthy interview that was sliced and diced and used throughout the network’s news programming, including a few minutes during the pre-game show.\n\nBut this year, Biden isn’t doing one, apparently because the network broadcasting the Super Bowl is Fox News. Since taking office two years ago, Biden reportedly hasn’t done a formal interview with Fox, and his aides were said to be weighing the potential upsides and downsides of agreeing to an interview with a potentially hostile host. When the question was asked during this morning's call, the White House sidestepped it.\n\nWhite House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield mostly sidestepped the issue on MSNBC’s “The Last Word” Monday night, telling host Lawrence O’Donnell that Biden plans to say as much as possible in another widely viewed venue, tonight’s State of the Union address, which is expected to draw less than half of the Super Bowl audience.\n\n“Well, obviously, we wish as many people as are going to watch the Super Bowl (will) watch the State of the Union,” Kate Bedingfield told “The Last Word” host Lawrence O’Donnell Monday night. “But, you know, 11 percent of the country one night watching television is not insignificant.”\n\n-Josh Meyer and Maureen Groppe\n\nClashes over border security erupt before House hearing\n\nPartisan fireworks over border-security policy went off even before the start of a House Oversight and Accountability Committee that is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats on the panel tweeted the allegation that Republicans would use the hearing to amplify “white nationalist conspiracy theories” rather than a solution to protect borders. And Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, accused Republicans of “staging a political stunt” rather than addressing the border and fixing the immigration system.\n\nThe Republican chairman, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, said he aimed for productive fact-gathering about record levels of illegal immigration and drug seizures along the border. He called the tweet “very disturbing” and reminded lawmakers not to criticize each other’s personalities or motives.\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nHow the Supreme Court can make news at the State of the Union\n\nThey sit in the front row but the Supreme Court justices who show up to the annual State of the Union are not the focus of the address – until they are.\n\nGenerally low key and eager to keep the spotlight as far away as possible, the usually small contingent of Supreme Court justices who attend the president's speech have occasionally found themselves at the center of viral moments on the House floor.\n\n- John Fritze\n\nBiden to outline areas of possible bipartisan cooperation\n\nFacing a divided Congress for the first time in his presidency, President Joe Biden will emphasize areas that Democrats and Republicans can work together in his State of the Union speech, White House officials said in a call previewing the address.\n\nThose areas are: fighting the opioid epidemic, improving mental health, supporting veterans and cutting cancer death rates.\n\n“These are issues that affect all Americans, in red states and blue states,” said Kate Bedingfield, White House Communications Director, “and ones where the American people are counting on their elected officials, no matter their party, to come together and do big things.”\n\nBiden included all the items in the “unity agenda” he outlined in last year’s State of the Union address. The president will talk about progress that’s been made and additional actions he wants to take. That includes banning targeted online advertising for young people as well as “strong limits on targeted advertising and the personal data that companies collect on all Americans.”\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nOpinion:The Latino State of the Union: Biden has done a lot for us, but fails on immigration\n\nSatire:Biden should go 'Dark Brandon' in State of the Union speech\n\nJust 4 of 10 Americans say the state of the union is strong: poll\n\nAhead of President Joe Biden’s second State of the Union address, a majority of Americans don’t believe the state of the union is strong.\n\nFour in 10 Americans say the state of the union is strong, according to a new Monmouth University poll. Just 7% of Americans believe the state of the union is “very strong,” the poll found.\n\nOver the past five years, the share of Americans who view the state of the union as “at least somewhat strong” has declined 16%, according to the poll.\n\n-- Ella Lee\n\nPaul Pelosi to attend State of the Union after attack caught on video\n\nPaul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will be among the guests at the State of the Union.\n\nIt will be Paul Pelosi’s first appearance in a joint session of Congress since video was released weeks ago showing his brutal beating with a hammer in late October that required surgery on his head and hand, and a weeklong hospital stay.\n\nSuspect David DePape, 42, pleaded not guilty to all charges in San Francisco on Dec. 28. He is charged with attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse and is scheduled to appear in court again on Feb. 23.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nSantos to bring former 9/11 rescue firefighter to State of the Union\n\nRep. George Santos, R-N.Y., plans to bring a former volunteer firefighter, Michael Weinstock, as his guest to the State of The Union. Weinstock was at Ground Zero during the Sept. 11 attacks Santos previously faced backlash after falsely implying that his mother died that day after being trapped in the South Tower of the World Trade Center when it was struck.\n\nDuring a speech on the House floor Monday, Santos detailed Weinstock’s neuropathy diagnosis – a result of damage to the nerves near the brain and spinal cord – that has since been tied to 9/11 but has failed to be among the conditions covered by the World Trade Center Health Program despite past efforts to do so, the freshman lawmaker said.\n\n“Michael had been unloading medical equipment out of an ambulance when the south tower crumbled and nearly crushed Michael to death. Today Michael suffers from a painful and incurable disease, neuropathy,” Santos said. “Since the World Trade Center Health Program does not cover neuropathy, people like Michael must pay out of pocket for treatment, medications and other medical needs.”\n\n– Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nWho are lawmakers bringing to the State of the Union?\n\nPresidents and members of Congress traditionally invite guests to join them at the State of the Union to make a political point or draw attention to an issue that’s important to them.\n\nThe White House has announced the first lady's guests who will be joining her in her viewing box for the speech. Several lawmakers also have announced their guests.\n\nRoya Rahmani, the former Afghan ambassador to the United States, is attending as the guest of Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas. Dennis “Freedom” Horton, who along with his brother, Lee Horton, was incarcerated for nearly 28 years for a crime they did not commit, will join Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is inviting a mother who has experienced firsthand the challenges and setbacks of a lack of quality, affordable child care where she lives.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nBiden to suggest ways to lower prices for families\n\nA good chunk of Biden’s speech will be devoted to the economy.\n\nBiden will argue that the state of the economy is strong and, as evidence, will point to the fact that inflation is slowing, gas prices are down, and wages are up. Even so, 41% of Americans in an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday said they have become worse off financially since Biden took office two years ago.\n\nBiden will acknowledge there’s still work to be done and will outline specific ideas on how to keep lowering costs for things like prescription drugs, child care and caring for an elderly parent, said Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nA ‘Joe Biden’ State of the Union address\n\nBiden and his aides have been drafting his speech for weeks. The prep work continued over the weekend, when Biden huddled with senior aides at Camp David, the presidential retreat just outside of Washington. The speech will be polished and tweaked right up until the last minute, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\nThe White House declined to provide any insight into the writing process, but Jean-Pierre noted that this is hardly Biden’s first big address.\n\n“The president was a senator for 36 years, he was vice president for eight years, he has been president for two years,” she said. “He knows how the process works. He knows how important (the speech) is going to be.

The pair and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, were followed for more than two hours by half a dozen vehicles, according to their spokespeople. The pursuit \"resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers.\" The couple and Ragland eventually switched to a taxi cab and whisked away, photos show. The cab driver, Sukhcharn Singh, told The Associated Press he wouldn't call the incident a \"chase.\" Read more\n\nBefore the ''car chase,'' Duchess Meghan delivered an empowering speech about fighting for equity at a Women of Vision gala.\n\nBiden in Japan amid debt ceiling talks\n\nPresident Joe Biden will meet privately with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida Thursday before joining the Group of Seven gathering of major industrialized nations.

But If you’re wondering why America’s labor shortage persists nearly three years into the Covid pandemic, it’s in part because America doesn’t have enough immigrants.\n\nImmigrants are vital to the US economy and fill thousands of US jobs – jobs many Americas don’t want to do. In 2020, the processing of legal immigrant worker visas stopped and only picked up towards the end of 2021.\n\nAnd by the end of last year there were close to 2 million fewer working-age immigrants in the United States than there would have been if pre-pandemic immigration continued unchanged, according to new research from the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Part of the reason why there are so many vacancies and unfilled jobs in the US is that we are missing a whole lot of immigrants who regularly were coming before Covid,” said Giovanni Peri, the author of the UC Davis research and Director of the Global Migration Center.\n\nThe immigration debate has been reignited because of a surge at the US-Mexico Border. In March 2020, President Trump invoked Title 42 – a law enacted during the pandemic to prevent the spread of Covid – that has kept migrants and would-be asylum seekers out of the country.\n\nAsylum seekers are legally able to work in the United States while they await their asylum cases. During that waiting period, those seeking asylum can apply for work permits — a process that usually takes 180 days before they are authorized.\n\nBut the decrease in legal immigration over the last two years has hurt American businesses. Especially in industries that require lower skilled labor: construction, agriculture, and hospitality.\n\n“We don’t make up the losses unless we really change immigration laws and we allow more people every year to come in,” said Peri. “The way in which we are catching up is that we are processing visas at the speed that it was done before Covid. So for a while there will be this gap.”\n\nThe lack of available workers has pushed wages higher – fueling higher inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that in addition to an aging workforce there is a lack of foreign labor contributing to labor shortages.\n\n“The combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about one-and-a-half million missing workers,” said Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve last month.\n\nThe ‘big impact’\n\nThe biggest impact comes to industries like construction, agriculture, and especially hospitality – which are reliant on immigrant workers. Those types of industries had higher rates of unfilled jobs last year – adding to existing labor shortages, according to UC Davis research. There are currently 10.3 million open jobs in the US – 377,000 in construction and 1.6 million in hospitality. That number has been on the rise in recent months.\n\n“The hospitality [sector] was employing a very large number of immigrants, 30%- 40% of the labor force in that sector was foreign born. And so you’re missing a lot of them, and potentially that is a big impact,” said Peri.\n\nThe restaurant industry has borne the brunt of the downturn in immigration. Slower service, restaurants closed for lunch, higher prices – are all a result of labor shortages. And the restaurant industry is on track to grow by 14% in the next decade – while the US-born workforce is expected to grow by just 10%, according to the National Restaurant Association. There will be more restaurant jobs than the US workforce can fill. Sixty percent of restaurant operators are facing staffing shortages limiting their operating capacity, according to National Restaurant Association.\n\nBut a new piece of legislation, “The Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act,” was introduced in the House earlier this year. The law would create a new visa program for workers in industries like hospitality.\n\n“Immigration reform is an economic necessity for the restaurant industry,” said Sean Kennedy, EVP of Public Affairs at the National Restaurant Association. “Allowing more legal immigration would be a win-win for employers in desperate need of employees and individuals seeking new opportunity.”\n\n“Skilled” workers\n\nAbout 1 million of the 2 million potential immigrants who were lost during the pandemic were college educated, according to the UC Davis research. These workers would be considered “high-skilled workers,” potentially coming to the US on H-1B specialty visas.\n\nThose high-skilled workers are job multipliers. For each high-skilled worker – 2.5 additional jobs are created, according to a report by UC Berkeley.\n\n“High skilled immigration is incredibly important,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at the Economic Innovation Group. “We shouldn’t think of it as something that addresses short-term shortages – although it can help – but something that is really important for long run: innovation, productivity, growth, and health of the economy.”\n\nEarlier this month, the American Farm Bureau Federation, along with 350 other agricultural groups, called on the Senate to pass an agricultural reform bill already passed by the House to address the farm labor crisis. Skilled foreign farm workers are the backbone of US agriculture and are traditionally in the US on H-2A seasonal visas, which saw its highest ever utilization rate this year, according to the Farm Bureau. But many in agriculture says it’s not enough and they still can’t find workers.\n\n“The farm labor crisis is hindering production and contributing to food price inflation. We must address this workforce crisis threatening farms across the United States so our producers can continue to feed, clothe, and fuel our nation,” the letter to Senate leadership read.\n\nBut, according to the Department of Labor, 317,000 temporary H-2A jobs were certified last year, more than six times the number in 2005. But only 80% of those jobs certified resulted in a visa.", "authors": ["Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/03/02/californias-big-one-among-other-disasters/9111798002/", "title": "'It could happen tomorrow': Experts know disaster upon disaster ...", "text": "It's the elevators that worry earthquake engineering expert Keith Porter the most.\n\nScientists say a massive quake could strike the San Francisco Bay Area at any moment. And when it does, the city can expect to be slammed with a force equal to hundreds of atomic bombs.\n\nPorter said the shaking will quickly cut off power in many areas. That means unsuspecting people will be trapped between floors in elevators without backup power. At peak commute times, the number of those trapped could be in the thousands.\n\nTo escape, the survivors of the initial quake will need the help of firefighters with specialized training and tools.\n\nBut their rescuers won't come – at least not right away. Firefighters will be battling infernos that could outnumber the region's fire engines.\n\nRunning water will be in short supply. Cellphone service may not work at all. The aftershocks will keep coming.\n\nAnd the electricity could remain off for weeks.\n\n\"That means people are dead in those elevators,” Porter said.\n\n'Problems on the horizon'\n\nThe situation Porter described comes from his work on the HayWired Scenario, a detailed look at the cascading calamities that will occur when a major earthquake strikes the Bay Area's Hayward Fault, including the possibility of widespread power outages that will strand elevators.\n\nThe disaster remains theoretical for now. But the United States Geological Survey estimates a 51% chance that a quake as big as the one described in HayWired will occur in the region within three decades.\n\nIt's one of several West Coast disasters so likely that researchers have prepared painstakingly detailed scenarios in an attempt to ready themselves.\n\n'SUPERIONIC':Scientists discover the Earth's inner core isn't solid or liquid\n\nFACT? CHECKED. Make sure you have the real story with the Checking the Facts newsletter.\n\nThe experts who worked on the projects are highly confident the West Coast could at any moment face disasters with the destructive power to kill hundreds or thousands of people and forever change the lives of millions more. They also say there's more that can be done to keep individuals – and society – safer.\n\n\"We’re trying to have an earthquake without having one,” Anne Wein told USA TODAY. Wein is a USGS researcher who co-leads the HayWired earthquake scenario and has worked on several other similar projects.\n\nSuch disaster scenarios are massive undertakings that bring together experts from various fields who otherwise would have little reason to work together – seismologists, engineers, emergency responders and social scientists.\n\nThat's important because \"it's difficult to make new relationships in a crisis,\" Wein said.\n\nSimilar projects aimed at simulating a future disaster have turned out to be hauntingly accurate.\n\nThe Hurricane Pam scenario foretold many of the devastating consequences of a major hurricane striking New Orleans well before Hurricane Katrina hit the city.\n\nMore recently, in 2017, the authors of “The SPARS Pandemic” called their disaster scenario “futuristic.” But now the project now reads like a prophecy of COVID-19. Johns Hopkins University even issued a statement saying the 89-page document was not intended as a prediction of COVID-19.\n\n“The SPARS Pandemic” imagined a future where a deadly novel coronavirus spread around the world, often without symptoms, as disinformation and vaccine hesitancy constantly confounded experts’ efforts to keep people safe.\n\nThe “SPARS scenario, which is fiction, was meant to give public health communicators a leg up … Think through problems on the horizon,” author Monica Schoch-Spana told USA TODAY.\n\nAt the time that SPARS was written, a global pandemic was thought of in much the same way experts currently describe the HayWired earthquake: an imminent catastrophe that could arrive at any time.\n\n'It could happen tomorrow'\n\nDisaster scenario researchers each have their own way of describing how likely the apocalyptic futures they foresee are.\n\n\"The probability (of) this earthquake is 100%, if you give me enough time,\" seismologist Lucy Jones will often say.\n\nEarthquakes occurring along major faults are a certainty, but scientists can't predict exactly when earthquakes will happen – the underground forces that create them are too random and chaotic. But researchers know a lot about what will happen once the earth begins to shake.\n\nEarthquakes like HayWired are “worth planning for,\" Porter said. Because “it could happen tomorrow.”\n\n“We don’t know when,” Porter said. But \"it will happen.\"\n\nWein says we're “overdue for preparedness.” You might say we're also overdue for a major West Coast disaster.\n\nThe kind of earthquake described in HayWired historically occurs every 100-220 years. And it's been more than 153 years since the last one.\n\nFarther south in California, it's difficult to pin down exactly how at risk Los Angeles is for The Big One – the infamous theoretical earthquake along the San Andreas fault that will devastate the city. But a massive magnitude 7.5 earthquake has about a 1 in 3 chance of striking the Los Angeles area in the next 30 years, the United States Geological Survey estimates.\n\nA 2008 scenario said a magnitude 7.8 quake could cause nearly 2,000 deaths and more than $200 billion in economic losses. Big quakes in Los Angeles are particularly devastating because the soil holding up the city will turn into a \"bowl of jelly,\" according to a post published by catastrophe modeling company Temblor.\n\nAnother scenario warns that a stretch of coast in Oregon and Washington state is capable of producing an earthquake much more powerful than the ones California is bracing for. Parts of coastline would suddenly drop 6 feet, shattering critical bridges, destroying undersea communication cables and producing a tsunami.\n\nThousands are expected to die, but local leaders are considering projects that could give coastal residents a better chance at survival.\n\nIt too \"could happen at any time,\" the scenario says.\n\nEarthquake scenarios often focus on major coastal cities, but West Coast residents farther inland also have yet another disaster to brace for.\n\n\"Megastorms are California's other Big One,\" the ARkStorm scenario says. It warns of a statewide flood that will cause more than a million evacuations and devastate California's agriculture.\n\nMassive storms that dump rain on California for weeks on end historically happen every few hundred years. The last one hit around the time of the Civil War, when weeks of rain turned portions of the state \"into an inland sea.\"\n\n'Decades to rebuild'\n\nWhether the next disaster to strike the West Coast is a flood, an earthquake or something else, scenario experts warn that the impacts will reverberate for years or longer.\n\n\"It takes decades to rebuild,” Wein said. “You have to think about a decade at least.\"\n\nA major West Coast earthquake isn't just damaged buildings and cracked roads.\n\nIt's weeks or months without running water in areas with millions of people. It's mass migrations away from ruined communities. It's thousands of uninhabitable homes.\n\nDepending on the scenario, thousands of people are expected to die. Hundreds of thousands more could be left without shelter. And those impacts will be a disproportionately felt.\n\n'DYING ON THE STREETS':Homelessness crisis is top issue in Los Angeles mayoral race\n\n'SURREAL':Wildfire burning near iconic California coastal highway prompts evacuations\n\nCalifornia already has a housing and homelessness crisis, and Nnenia Campbell said the next disaster is set to magnify inequalities. Campbell is the deputy director of the William Averette Anderson Fund, which works to mitigate disasters for minority communities.\n\nCampbell doesn't talk about \"natural disasters\" because there's nothing natural about the way a major earthquake will harm vulnerable communities more than wealthy ones.\n\nHuman decisions such as redlining have led to many of the inequities in our society, she said. But humans can make decisions that will help make the response to the next disaster more equitable.\n\nMany of those choices need to be made by local leaders and emergency management planners. Investing in infrastructure programs that will make homes in minority communities less vulnerable to earthquakes. Understanding how important a library is to unhoused people. Making sure all schools are built to withstand a disaster. Keeping public spaces open, even during an emergency.\n\nBut individuals can make a difference as well, Campbell said. You can complete training that will prepare you to help your community in the event of an emergency. Or you can join a mutual aid network, a group where community members work together to help each other.\n\nCommunity support is a common theme among disaster experts: One of the best ways to prepare is to know and care about your neighbors.\n\nIf everyone only looks out for themselves in the next disaster, “we are going to have social breakdown,\" Jones said.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nExperts acknowledge you'll want to make sure you and your family are safe before being able to help others. Fortunately, many disaster preparedness precautions are inexpensive and will help in a wide range of emergency situations.\n\nBe prepared to have your access to electricity or water cut off for days or weeks.\n\nFor electricity, you'll at least want a flashlight and a way to charge your phone.\n\nWhile cell service will be jammed immediately after a major earthquake, communications will likely slowly come back online faster than other services, Wein said. (And when trying to use your phone, text – don't call. In a disaster, text messages are more reliable and strain cell networks less.)\n\nTo power your phone, you can cheaply buy a combination weather radio, flashlight and hand-crank charger to keep your cell running even without power for days.\n\nA cash reserve is good to have, too, Jones said. You'll want to be able to buy things, even if your credit card doesn't work for a time.\n\nPreparing for earthquakes specifically is important along the West Coast, too, experts said. Simple things like securing bookshelves can save lives. Downloading an early warning app can give you precious moments to protect yourself in the event of a big quake. Buying earthquake insurance can protect homeowners. And taking part in a yearly drill can help remind you about other easy steps you can take to prepare.\n\nThere's even more you could do to ready yourself for a catastrophe, but many disaster experts are hesitant to rely on individuals' ability to prepare themselves.\n\nJust as health experts have begged Americans to use masks and vaccines to help keep others safe during the pandemic, disaster scenario experts believe community members will need to look out for one another when the next disaster strikes.\n\nTelling people to prepare as if “nobody is coming to help you” is a self-fulfilling prophesy, Jones said.\n\nFor now, policymakers hold the real power in how prepared society will be for the next disaster. And there are many problems to fix, according to Porter, including upgrading city plumbing, because many aging and brittle water pipes will shatter in a major earthquake, cutting off water to communities for weeks or months.\n\n\"Shake it, and it breaks,” Porter said.\n\nGetting ready for the next big earthquake means mundane improvements like even stricter building codes, emergency water supply systems for firefighters and retrofitting elevators with emergency power.\n\nThe elevator change could prevent thousands of people from being trapped when the big San Francisco earthquake comes.\n\n“A lot of that suffering can be avoided,\" Porter said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/02"}]}

At Wednesday’s meeting, the commission voted 3-2 to direct special projects manager Scott Brylinsky to continue developing proposals on changing parts of the general code to define tiny houses and tiny houses on chassis. The idea is to allow them in mobile home parks and manufactured home parks. Brylinksy was hired to work on an action plan for tiny homes, among other projects. The informal action plan was proposed by the Sitka Assembly last year. The plan directed the Planning Commission review zoning codes to see which ones could be changed to enable tiny homes as a potential affordable housing option. Acting Chairman Darrell Windsor said he would like the full commission present before making recommendations for changes related to tiny homes.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Democratic U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has introduced a bill that would ban new mining claims around the Grand Canyon. The Obama administration put about 1,562 square miles outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park off-limits to new hard rock mining claims until 2032. The bill would make that permanent. Environmentalists and Native American tribes applauded Sinema’s introduction of the bill Thursday. They say mining in the Grand Canyon region, particularly for uranium, could contaminate a water source that serves millions of people. The bill isn’t expected to have an easy ride in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans who have opposed the effort. The House passed a similar bill introduced by Arizona Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva earlier this year. Meanwhile, the mining industry has been pushing President Donald Trump to boost demand for domestic supplies of uranium, tax breaks and other financial incentives.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Republican president pro tem of Arkansas’ Senate said Friday he won’t seek another term leading that chamber next year. Sen. Jim Hendren said he won’t run for another two-year term as the chamber’s president when senators meet at the end of next year’s fiscal session to select a new leader. Hendren’s term as Senate president runs through the end of 2020. Hendren said he’s still seeking re-election to the Senate next year. Hendren said he plans to decide after next year’s session whether to seek the Republican nomination for governor in 2022. Hendren said he didn’t want to serve as the chamber’s leader and run a statewide campaign if he does jump in the governor’s race. Republican Gov.

Shortly after 9 p.m., LAX Airport said on its Twitter account that “there is a significant fire emergency at the LAX-it lot. Emergency responders are on scene. More to come. No immediate reports of injuries.” KTLA and the CBS station in Los Angeles tweeted photos of the fire spewing smoke. At about 10 p.m., the airport said that the fire had been put out, and there were no injuries. The lot reopened, and ride-share services resumed.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Michelle Lindsay, a Zumba instructor and registered dental hygienist from Fort Collins, became the country’s first avalanche death of the season on Dec. 8. On her first run down the South Diamond Peak face, Lindsay was engulfed by an avalanche in a narrow gully. Despite efforts to save the 29-year-old, she died from asphyxiation after being buried. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center released its full report on the avalanche Thursday, which included details from interviews with Lindsay’s companion, a male who was not named in the report. According to the report, Lindsay was 150 feet below her companion, about 11,200 feet in elevation, when she triggered an avalanche midslope. Her partner watched the avalanche unfold around her but noted that it did not look very deep, maybe only up to the top of her boots. He continued to see Lindsay in the avalanche, but the visibility was poor and she disappeared into the white cloud.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Consumer Protection reminded residents that package stores must be closed on Christmas Day and on New Years Day, under state law. Connecticut law also requires bars to be closed by 3 a.m. on the morning of New Years Day. Consumer Protection Commissioner Michelle Seagull said her office encourages those who choose to drink alcohol “to make responsible decisions.” She reminded the public they must be over age 21 to make alcohol purchases. Connecticut lawmakers this year passed legislation updating the state’s liquor laws, in hopes of helping the state’s growing craft brewery industry. One change, which has taken effect, allows breweries to sell more beer to customers for consumption off-premises. The prior law limited craft breweries to selling only up to nine liters to a single individual within one day.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state has confirmed that 26 school-aged children have been infected through a salmonella outbreak that is potentially linked to recalled fruit. The state’s health department said in a statement Friday that evidence indicated that the fruit potentially came from a company in New Jersey. The firm had recently recalled some fruit mix, as well as cut honeydew, cut cantaloupe and cut pineapple. The fruit was distributed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware. It was sold for use in institutional food service establishments such as schools. The children who were infected with the bacteria in Delaware were in New Castle County. Officials said there is no ongoing risk to any students. The children affected are between the ages of 4 and 17. Salmonella are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness and fever. Most people develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps.

The no-pass entry will go through Dec. 30. After those dates, the museum will resume back to its regular schedule. Groups of 10 or more are still required to get passes to enter the museum. Since opening three years ago, more than 6 million people have visited the museum, the largest cultural destination showcasing the African American story and its impact on American and world history.\n\nFlorida\n\nYeehaw Junction: A semi-truck plowed into a historic inn south of Orlando early Sunday, causing major damage but no apparent injuries. The truck ran through the wall of the Desert Inn and a portion of the building collapsed around it. Lisa Mason, who ran the inn before it closed last year, confirmed the crash but said she didn’t know any details. She said she doesn’t believe anyone was injured. The Florida Highway Patrol did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. The inn is the centerpiece of Yeehaw Junction, a tiny respite off Florida’s Turnpike between South Florida and Orlando. According to a 2013 article in the Orlando Sentinel, the Desert Inn dates to 1889 when it was a barroom and brothel for cowboys and lumberjacks, and the look of the place hadn’t evolved much since. Through the years, the Desert Inn has been a trading post, gas station and dance hall. Until its closure, it served as a motel, restaurant and convenience store. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A family got a real hoot from its Christmas tree: More than a week after they bought it, they discovered an owl nestled among its branches. Katie McBride Newman said Friday that she and her daughter spotted the bird on Dec. 12. They had bought the 10-foot-tall tree from a Home Depot, brought it back to their Atlanta-area home and decorated it with lights and, coincidentally, owl ornaments. “It was surreal, but we weren’t really freaked out about it,” McBride Newman said. “We’re really outdoorsy people. We love the wilderness.” The family opened windows and doors near the tree hoping the owl would fly away, but it didn’t. So the family called a nonprofit nature center for help. The Chattahoochee Nature Center caught the bird and helped the family release it. McBride Newman said she believed the bird had been in the tree since they bought it but was hidden.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An illegal fishing net discovered in Oahu’s Kaneohe Bay was so large that a forklift was needed to move it, state officials said. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said the net was found by two boaters last week, Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday. The boaters discovered the net after their craft became entangled. They said that after they pulled the net out of the bay, the apparent owners chased them to retrieve the equipment. The boaters returned to the harbor and their pursuers fled, they said. State officials were not able to immediately measure the net, but the boaters said their measurement found 500 yards of netting. Rules adopted in 2007 to govern the use of gill nets left floating on top of the water to trap fish can be no longer than 125 feet. Lay nets are banned within 3 miles of the Oahu shoreline and in specific areas of the island including Kaneohe Bay, where the net was found, officials said. Maui has banned lay nets, which a land and natural resources department official said is the most regulated form of gill net fishing. A $5,000 fine can be levied for a first offense of catching threatened or endangered wildlife in the nets, with additional fines for each threatened or endangered wildlife taken, harmed or killed. A first-offense fine for illegal lay net fishing can cost up to $1,000.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Public Utilities Commission has rejected a proposal that would have slashed the incentive for the power generated from solar panels. The proposal to change net metering would have changed how much Idaho Power customers with solar panels can be reimbursed for the energy they harness that goes back into the power grid. The proposed settlement between Idaho Power, the Sierra Club, the city of Boise, Idaho Clean Energy Association, Idaho Irrigation Pumpers Association and others would have cut the rate from almost 10 cents per kilowatt produced to somewhere around 4.4 cents per kilowatt hour over the course of about 10 years. The PUC on Friday rejected that settlement, saying the public wasn’t adequately notified about the significant changes. The commission instead directed Idaho Power to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the solar panel program while also voting to permanently grandfather in the 4,000 existing Idaho Power customers so that their rates will not change.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Metra is buying hundreds of new rail cars and wants passengers to weigh in on what amenities they would like to see in them, from cup holders to power outlets, tray tables or wifi. The suburban Chicago commuter rail agency expects to spend almost $1.2billion over the next five years to buy and rehabilitate rail cars and locomotives. The funding comes from a capital bill Illinois lawmakers approved this year. Metra issued a request for proposals earlier this year for at least 200 new rail cars, with options for up to 300 more. Manufacturers were encouraged to submit proposals that increase capacity and optimize amenities. Now the agency is asking commuters to complete a survey about which amenities are most important to them. Options include tray tables and power, as well as head rests, interior and exterior information signs or lights that can be dimmed. Metra said it can’t guarantee everything commuters want will be incorporated into the new cars but said it will try to get the most amenities possible. The survey is available at metrarail.com through mid-January.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: Unusually large flocks of seagulls have descended on a western Indiana city, bringing the sounds of the beach to a local reservoir where the birds began gathering in late November. Residents near Hulman Lake on Terre Haute’s east side have seen hundreds of ring-billed seagulls in the skies over the reservoir since the birds began flocking around Thanksgiving. Peter Scott, a retired Indiana State University ecology professor who directs an annual Christmas Bird Count around Terre Haute, estimated that between 400 and 1,000 of the birds have congregated at the lake.He said ring-billed gulls aren’t uncommon in Indiana, but they prefer to winter around larger bodies of water like southern Indiana’s Lake Monroe. Scott said their appearance in large numbers at Hulman Lake is rare. Scott said the birds are most likely feeding on small fish in the lake. The Cornell University Lab of Ornithology described ring-billed seagulls as sociable creatures that feed together at coastal beaches but often head inland during winter to forage at golf courses, farm fields and garbage dumps.\n\nIowa\n\nDuncombe: After more than a century, a barn near this northern Iowa community is getting a new home and a new look. Matt and Libby Mitchell acquired the barn built in 1915 and watched nervously Thursday as it was moved about a mile over fields to a new location. Matt Mitchell prepared a path over fields by driving a blade over the land, smoothing out ruts. He now plans to restore the barn. Mitchell has restored two other barns and knows he’s in for a long process. Still, he said the structure is worth the restoration work. The Iowa Barn Foundation covered about half the moving expenses. The job was handled by Vote House Moving of Bradgate, in Humboldt County. Once the barn is restored to its original appearance, Libby Mitchell said she has plans for it. “We’ll put some cows and pigs in it,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Lawrence library is joining a growing number of libraries that are dropping fines for overdue books. The library’s board voted unanimously Tuesday to make the change, The Lawrence Journal-World reported. Library patrons still will be charged for lost or damaged items. Patrons also would be blocked from checking out additional books and materials once an item became two weeks overdue, but the return of the overdue item would immediately restore access. Among those expressing concerns was Michael Austin, who said the change could result in people keeping books for long periods of time, ultimately reducing access to those materials for everyone else. But Brad Allen, the library’s executive director, said eliminating overdue fines is in line with the stance of the American Library Association that library policies should not disadvantage low-income people. The ALA officially came out against charging fines earlier this year, citing concerns that fines create barriers to library materials and services.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Deeply affected by a Courier Journal series in August on child abuse and neglect, members of Christ Church United Methodist are collecting and displaying prayers on behalf of abused children in Kentucky, which has the highest rate of child maltreatment in the nation. Church member Bill Cooper, a retired lawyer who is active in social justice work at Christ Church, is working with others at the church, including Shelah Woodruff, director of outreach, and the Rev. Leanne Hadley, the children’s and youth minister. They came up with an idea: collect 1,000 prayers during the four-week Advent season before Christmas and display them. Christ Church also created a display that is open to the public with information about child abuse, how to report it, Kentucky’s sobering statistics and suggestions on how people can volunteer or get involved in efforts to fight the problem. People who view the display are invited to fill out a prayer card.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s recreational red snapper season likely will continue through 11:59 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. Surveys indicate that 98% of the state’s quota had been caught as of Dec. 8, with about 16,100 pounds remaining, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. If that’s all that is caught before Dec. 31, the season will end earlier. Louisiana’s recreational season opened May 24 and was weekends-only for most of the year. But in early November, Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet expanded it to all week, starting on Thanksgiving. At the time, 27,582 pounds were left in the quota. The popular sport and table fish is still recovering from nearly disastrous overfishing. Red snapper has been a hot issue in the Gulf of Mexico, with seasons getting shorter and shorter as fish got larger and more numerous. In 2017, the Trump administration extended a three-day season to 42 days, even though regulators said the extension could add up to six years to the time required for red snapper stocks to recover. Regulators agreed in 2018 on a two-year pilot program under which each state sets dates for and keeps tabs on the recreational red snapper catch in federal waters off its coast. If approved by the U.S. commerce secretary, this would become official policy. In April, the group that manages Gulf of Mexico fishing in federal waters said states can continue managing anglers’ catch of red snapper after this year.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A mapping and engineering company is donating about a million aerial images of New England to a University of Maine library. The university said Raymond H. Fogler Library has received 3,000 rolls of film from the James W. Sewall Co. of Old Town. The collection is made up of original aerial photography of Maine and other New England states, and it spans more than six decades. The archive of images will allow researchers and members of the public access to “a vast collection that details changes to Maine’s landscape over the past century,” the university said in a statement. The collection will be especially useful for forestry research, said Daniel Hayes, assistant professor in the university’s School of Forestry Resources.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Salvation Army leaders said a donor recently dropped thousands of dollars worth of jewelry in a red kettle. Capt. Ryan Vincent is commander of the Salvation Army in Annapolis. He told the Capital Gazette that everyone was shocked to find out the ring and two bracelets were real. One of the bracelets, a yellow-gold piece by Tiffany & Co., has been sold for $1,500. A gemologist will soon examine the ring and second bracelet that features diamonds and rubies to determine their value. Pearl Eldridge is the ringer who collected the donation. She called the donor a “quiet spirit,” and said the woman told her the pieces were sentimental but had been laying around. Other unusual donations have been reported in Salvation Army kettles across the country, including a gold bar in Kentucky and a more than century-old gold coin in North Carolina. Vincent said the Salvation Army has a policy for dealing with jewelry donations. Pieces found in a kettle are kept for 30 days, but if someone acknowledges leaving a piece with the bell ringer, it’s immediately considered donated. If big donations are found to be stolen, the charitable organization arranges them to be returned.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is using money it received from a nationwide settlement with Volkswagen to help electrify the state’s transportation sector and reduce air pollution. The state has designated a total of $7.5million toward 98 projects, including the purchase of electric cars, diesel-hybrid electric waste collection trucks, liquid-propane-gas school buses, cleaner-diesel trucks and ferry engines, and a marine shore-power installation. The money for the grant program comes from a settlement with Volkswagen over the company’s illegal tampering of vehicle emission control equipment. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said the money will be used on projects to put 32 heavy-duty vehicles, eight medium-duty vehicles, 17 buses, two marine engines, 35 pieces of airport ground-support equipment and three pieces of cargo-handling equipment into operation and install one new marine shore-power site. The new equipment will replace pre-2010 diesel counterparts. Baker said three-quarters of the funding will go towards areas where there are high populations of minority, low-income, or low English proficiency residents\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:A nonprofit distributed nearly 50 bicycles to children after a dozen volunteers spent several weeks cleaning and repairing them. The Lansing Bike Co-op staged the giveaway last weekend, offering the 49 used bikes to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis, the Lansing State Journal reported. There were no rules or requirements, but the co-op teaches cyclists, many financially struggling, how to keep their rides in good working order. Every bike came with a red, green or blue helmet. Among those claiming bikes was Ciera Bonilla, who secured two for her daughter, 6, and son, 3. She said her son has autism and she hopes his first two-wheeler will help him gain independence and physical skills. Co-op President Aaron Fields said he believes a bike is “an essential part of childhood.” The organization launched in 2015 and is raising money to pay the mortgage for the east-side property it bought in July.\n\nMinnesota\n\nProsper: Authorities said four people were injured, including one critically, in separate vehicle crashes involving horses on the same southeastern Minnesota highway. The crashes happened within an hour of each other Friday night on state highway 44, the Star Tribune reported. The State Patrol said a 12-year-old boy was critically injured when a car struck a horse and buggy carrying the boy and five others. It happened about 7 p.m. just outside Prosper, on the Iowa border. The boy was airlifted to a hospital in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Two others on the buggy suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. The driver of the car and his passenger were not injured. About 45 minutes later, a pickup truck hit a horse that was loose on the highway about 13 miles east of the first crash. The driver was taken to a hospital with noncritical injuries.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Teachers and staff at two northern Mississippi schools are receiving more than $370,000 in bonuses because their schools have improved under a state grading system. Columbus Municipal School District trustees voted in 2018 to adopt a Teacher Incentive Pay Plan to provide bonuses for faculty and staff members of improving and high-performing schools. The plan also includes bonus incentives for math and science teachers. The first checks arrived this month, and the Commercial Dispatch reported that a celebration was held Tuesday at an elementary school. Superintendent Cherie Labat credited the trustees for showing employees how much their achievements are valued. Stokes-Beard Elementary School and Columbus High School improved this year in accountability ratings from the state Department of Education. Faculty and staff members at the schools received a combined $181,354. The district’s 54 math and science teachers, 15 of whom are new hires, received $189,000 total. The Columbus district has maintained a D overall rating for the last two years. However, during the 2018-19 school year, Columbus High improved from a C to a B, and Stokes-Beard jumped from an F to a B.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Mayor Lyda Krewson is pulling the plug on an airport privatization effort because of a lack of support. Krewson said Friday she’s determined that there is “very little support for moving forward with a private operator” for St. Louis Lambert International Airport after listening to members of the public, business leaders and other political leaders. She said she is sending a letter to members of the Airport Advisory Working Group, asking that her representative, Linda Martinez, not support or vote to move forward with issuing a request for proposals, St. Louis Public Radio reported. Krewson has been in favor of exploring the process to see if it could result in a good deal for the city – canceling nearly $600million in airport debt and bringing in up to $2billion in net proceeds.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A natural gas leak caused an explosion at an apartment complex that sent two people to the hospital with severe burns, officials said Saturday. Billings Deputy Fire Marshal Jeff McCullough said the explosion at about 9:45p.m. Friday caused an estimated $250,000 in damages. The Battleship Apartments building was cleared of residents, and an adult male and adult female were taken to a hospital. Residents of the building told The Billings Gazette that the blast sent glass from a door shooting into the road and that it sounded like a tree hitting the roof. Montana-Dakota Utilities was called to turn off gas to the building.\n\nNebraska\n\nColumbus: Consumers who get electricity from the Loup Public Power District in eastern Nebraska won’t see an increase in their electricity rates this year. The Columbus-based power district said the rates will hold steady for the third year in a row because of the district’s financial performance this year and its budget and expenses, according to the Columbus Telegram. District CEO Neal Suess said the company’s internal costs generally determine whether customer rates get raised. Jim Donoghue, chairman of Loup’s Rates Committee, said in a statement that company representatives have been working to make sure that customer’s rates do not increase next year.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Washoe County Roads has begun posting a snowplow monitoring system featuring an interactive map showing where trucks are operating in Incline Village and Crystal Bay in nearly real-time. County Community Services Operations chief Eric Crump said one of the most frequent questions officials get from the public is, “Where are the plows?” He said that by equipping trucks with automated vehicle locator technology, people can see for themselves which areas have recently been plowed. Officials said they hope they will be able to expand the “Where’s My Plow?” interactive map to other snowy high-elevation areas near Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlaistow: Firefighters said they got to work when a woman arrived in the lobby and announced she was having a baby. Firefighters told WMUR-TV that the woman was put on a stretcher, and the fire station training room became a delivery room Friday night. Seven minutes later, a baby boy was born. Firefighter and EMT Derek Travers said the episode was his first “field birth” in 23 years. “It meant a lot to me to see the beginning of life, not the end of life that we see a lot of times,” he said. Firefighters said they’re happy everything went smoothly. An ambulance transported mother and baby to a hospital.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Two Florida companies failed to comply with subpoenas to turn over records to New Jersey regarding the sale of outlawed large-capacity gun magazines, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Friday in a suit against the firms. Elite Aluminum, of Holly Hill, Florida, and 22Mods4All, of Longwood, Florida, refused to turn over documents showing information about large-capacity magazine sales into the state, Grewal said in a statement. Messages seeking comment have been left with both companies. New Jersey sent both firms cease-and-desist letters earlier this year after they sold the outlawed magazines to an undercover state investigator, said Grewal, a Democrat. The firms complied, but then failed to hand over more information about earlier sales despite subpoenas. New Jersey law caps magazines at 10 rounds, down from 15 before 2018, when Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation limiting magazine size. The suits were filed in state Superior Court in Essex County.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said people shouldn’t expect any major administrative changes with White Sands National Monument becoming the state’s first national park since 1930. But he cited a study that said the park could see an increase of 100,000 visitors annually with the change in status. Heinrich told the Albuquerque Journal that such an increase would be a boom for the local economies with an additional $7.5million in tourist spending in the area a year. He said national park status will open White Sands to more exposure from national travel and outdoors publications. Heinrich has also introduced legislation that would designate Bandelier National Monument in northern New Mexico a national park.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday he will push legislation banning gender-based price disparities for similar goods and services. Cuomo, a Democrat, cited research that indicated women often end up with a larger bill for items like toys, clothing and personal care products. The proposal, rolled out as part of Cuomo’s State of the State agenda, would require certain service providers to post price lists for standard services. Businesses that don’t comply could be hit with civil penalties. A 2015 study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs found that 42% of the products targeted at women were more expensive than those marketed to men. Products aimed at women cost an average of 7% more than similar items for men and personal care products for women were priced 13% higher than men’s products, according to the study. In 2016, New York banned taxes on menstrual products and last year enacted laws mandating equal pay and barring companies from asking about salary history.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nManteo: Cold weather is causing a problem for some sea turtles off the North Carolina coast, and an aquarium has taken in dozens of them for treatment. WVEC-TV reported that 96 turtles were taken to the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island after a drop in temperatures on Thursday and Friday. More are expected to be treated there in the coming days. Dropping water temperatures can cause cold-stunning, a condition similar to hypothermia that makes turtles unable to swim properly. The recovery process involves gradually warming the turtles up over a few days. According to the TV station, the center will be closed to the public beginning Sunday to accommodate all the turtles.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Bismarck Park Board has voted to create a formal process for renaming city parks after some residents pushed to have a park stripped of its name because of the “historical trauma” they said is associated with its namesake, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. Rather than immediately change the name of Custer Park, the board voted Thursday to develop guidelines for renaming parks. A draft of those guidelines will be considered by the board in February. A member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, M. Angel Moniz, told the board that to some, Custer is a reminder of violence and genocide, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Custer served during the Civil War and fought against Native Americans on the Great Plains in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, he launched an attack on Chief Black Kettle’s Southern Cheyenne Village near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, in which Native American women were raped and killed in an assault known as the Washita Massacre. Custer spent several years stationed at Fort Abraham Lincoln in Mandan before his death.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens: The Ohio school district where Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow played football has named its high school stadium in his honor. The Athens City School District Board of Education in southeast Ohio posted a proclamation about the naming this week on Facebook. The proclamation details Burrow’s accomplishments as quarterback for Athens High School, where he was named Ohio Mr. Football in 2014, and at Louisiana State University, where he’s the quarterback for the undefeated Tigers. LSU faces the University of Oklahoma on Dec. 28 in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff. Burrow endeared himself to many by discussing the poverty endemic to the Appalachian region where he grew up in his Heisman acceptance speech. His comments prompted a campaign that has raised more than $400,000 for the Athens County Food Bank, the Athens High School Boosters, the county’s Children’s Services agency and other nonprofits. The proclamation directs Athens school district officials to plan a ceremony in Burrow’s honor.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Officials said a privately owned cemetery is blocking efforts to find the remains of black Tulsa residents killed nearly 100 years ago in a race riot. But an attorney for the cemetery said his client submitted a proposal in November that would allow the city to search under certain conditions. Mayor G.T. Bynum has insisted that the city would do everything it could to find possible mass graves with victims of one of the worst race-related massacres in U.S. history. The 1921 violence left as many as 300 dead on Tulsa’s Black Wall Street. Bynum said the city has been unable to investigate whether Rolling Oaks Cemetery in south Tulsa contains unmarked graves, the Tulsa World reported. However, Timothy Studebaker, a Tulsa attorney representing Rolling Oaks, said the cemetery is not opposed to scanning its grounds. Bynum said the city will look at possible legal action if an agreement can’t be reached.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Oregon is renowned for its craft beer and increasingly for its high-grade marijuana, but the state is keeping the two apart – for now. In a new ruling, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which regulates alcoholic products and recreational marijuana, said beer and other alcoholic drinks as of Jan. 1 cannot contain either THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, or CBD, the nonpsychoactive part that is said to relieve stress and pain. Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the agency, cited concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug of potential liver damage from CBD, also known as cannabidiol. One prominent CBD-infused beer, Two Flowers IPA, was popular in The EastBurn, a Portland pub, according to Michael Fritz, one of the owners. The website of the brewery that made the beer, Coalition Brewing of Portland, said the CBD’s “bitter grassiness augments the hop bitterness, while the citrusy terpenes in the CBD mirror the aromatics and hop flavors.” Coalition Brewing recently went out of business. Pettinger said he didn’t know of any other Oregon brewery that makes CBD-infused beer.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Businesses that manufacture frames that can be built into working firearms sued Pennsylvania’s attorney general on Friday, five days after he issued a legal opinion classifying the products as guns under state law. The Commonwealth Court lawsuit asks a state judge to stop the state police from implementing any new policy, including background checks, based on a legal opinion the agency received Monday from Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Shapiro told state police to treat unassembled “ghost guns,” gun frames also referred to as 80% receivers, as firearms. The plaintiffs said the opinion does not give fair notice to people regarding what is legal and what is not, said Joshua Prince, who filed the petition.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers are unveiling bills they plan to pursue in the new legislative session that begins Jan. 7. Democratic Reps. June Speakman of Warren and Terri Cortvriend of Portsmouth said they will introduce legislation establishing a state-level process to set maximum contaminate levels for toxins, including a family of industrial chemicals turning up in public water supplies across the country. Democratic Sen. Leonidas Raptakis of Coventry said he will reintroduce legislation that stalled in past years to establish an inspector general’s office to identify fraud and waste in public spending. Raptakis will also again propose allowing voters to vote on a constitutional amendment to give the governor the power to veto parts of the state budget. Most states allow governors to strike individual budget items without having to veto an entire appropriations bill. Democratic Rep. Joseph Solomon of Warwick said Thursday he has prefiled legislation to cap the amount health insurance providers can charge for insulin co-pays. Solomon said he’s concerned about rising costs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A unique, dome-shaped house on the South Carolina coast dubbed “Eye of the Storm,” has recently been sold for $4million. The Post and Courier reported that according to Charleston County land records, a firm called ITAC 433 LLC that lists a Chapel Hill address, bought the 3,384-square-foot house in early October. The distinctive house features a white shell that resembles a Storm Trooper helmet from the movie “Star Wars.” It was built in the early 1990s by Huiet and Helen Paul after their beachfront home was destroyed in 1989 by Hurricane Hugo. The house is made of concrete and steel and weighs 1.3million pounds. It includes an elevator, wet bar, skylight, an 889-square-foot deck and a bank vault room. The seller was a trust associated with the late couple. The property was marketed as hurricane-resistant because its design doesn’t have seams for strong winds to hook onto, the newspaper reported. The design is also intended to allow storm surge to pass through several openings on the lower level. The house’s unique architecture in comparison to the more antebellum homes often seen on the island attracts curious onlookers. But even at a $4million price tag, the dome house isn’t the most expensive to be sold on the island. Last summer a 5,000-square-foot, three-story house fetched $7.35million.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Tribes in South Dakota are trying again to gain state legislative support to repeal an archaic law that bans them from Minnesota. The State-Tribal Relations Committee voted this week to introduce a resolution during the 2020 legislative session requesting that Congress repeal the 1863 Dakota Removal Act. The law forced Native Americans onto South Dakota reservations following an 1862 conflict that included the mass hanging of 38 Dakota men. Minnesota passed a resolution supporting its repeal in 2009. The South Dakota Senate State Affairs Committee, without any discussion, failed to pass the same resolution during the 2019 session. Republican Rep. Tamara St. John, a historian for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, said she’s concerned that repealing it could impact legal precedents based on the act, specifically a lawsuit involving Mdewakanton Sioux members in Minnesota that has not been resolved.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee has landed a $5.3million federal grant that aims to address opioid misuse among expectant mothers and improve care for their affected children, the Division of TennCare announced Thursday. TennCare plans to partner with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to focus on the issue in 26 rural and urban counties. Tennessee is one of 10 states to receive the Maternal Opioid Misuse Model grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Tennessee’s initiative will focus on expectant mothers and their children beginning in pregnancy and extending to one year postpartum. The money covers a five-year performance period beginning in January. The program aims to get the women engaged in treatment before and after pregnancy, use therapies to maximize the time they aren’t using illicit substances, reduce infant hospital stays to keep them with their biological mothers as much as possible and connect to early intervention services for the children.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Police said one woman was killed and another was injured after they were attacked by three pit bulls. Authorities said a man called 911 just before 6 a.m. Saturday to report that his wife had been attacked by dogs in a north Houston neighborhood. At the scene, police found the woman had been bitten multiple times. She was taken to a hospital and was expected to survive her injuries. Soon after arriving at the scene, police received another call, this one from the dogs’ owner. The owner reported his dogs had attacked a woman and her body was in a ditch in front of his home. The three dogs were taken away by authorities. Police said the case will be referred to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office to determine if any charges could be filed against the dogs’ owner.\n\nUtah\n\nHyrum: A northern Utah bank is dismantling and rebuilding a historic small-town grain elevator for its new “Scandinavian-modern” building in Hyrum. The tall wood structure, now weathered with age, was first built in 1918 by the Holley-Globe and Milling Company, the Herald Journal reported. It has been a fixture in the small town for a century, but soon it will get a new life: front and center into Cache Valley Bank’s new location. Workers began lifting sections of the structure with a crane this week. The bank wanted a building that was creative and embodied the town. Board member Peter Daines said his grandfather, a high school shop teacher and Hyrum native, informed their decision to incorporate the rustic appeal of the historic wood on the agricultural storage structure. Bank CEO George Daines remembered seeing the big tower when while visiting his grandparents as a child, though it wasn’t in operation even then. Visitors to the new bank building, though, will be able to reach the top through a spiral staircase. It will also have a new all-glass observation deck.\n\nVermont\n\nMonkton: A general in Monkton is going to close its doors by the end of the month. The Alderman family, which has managed the store for more than 12 years, said the costs of operating the business are “just too much,” MyNBC5 reported. The closing comes less than a year after the Aldermans announced they were struggling to pay back approximately $20,000 in delinquent state taxes. An online fundraising campaign brought in nearly $9,000 over the course of eight months. In a social media post, the Aldermans said they appreciated the community’s support and expressed their sadness in having to close.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health officials are mounting an effort to identify people who might have recently been exposed to a person with measles. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release Saturday that the person visited Richmond International Airport on Tuesday night and a doctor’s office in suburban Richmond on Thursday afternoon. The department posted detailed instructions online about what to do if you were at either of the locations during certain time frames. The directions depend on whether you have been vaccinated against measles. Based on the date of exposure, the health department said people infected could develop symptoms as late as Jan. 11. Measles is a highly contagious illness spread through coughing, sneezing and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of an infected person. Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough, followed by a rash that begins on the face and spreads all over the body.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials are warning about the Asian giant hornet, a new invasive species found in the state that can pack a powerful sting and be a threat to honeybees. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said the bug was found in early December in Blaine, near the Canadian border. The state’s agriculture and health officials are now warning people in the area to be on the lookout and avoid the hornets, which are typically 1.5 inches long with large yellow heads. The species is not usually interested in humans or animals but might sting if they or their ground nests are disturbed or threatened. The health department said humans should take preventative measures by covering food and garbage and also avoid swatting at the hornets. Winter is the dormant season for the bugs, which are more often seen from July through October.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nElkins: The U.S. Forest Service has halted a logging project in Monongahela National Forest to protect an endangered fish. The Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of Blackwater submitted objections in July to the project to protect the endangered candy darter. The Center for Biological Diversity said in a news release the project would likely have caused significant erosion and sent sediment into rivers and streams, threatening the rare fish. The candy darter was listed as endangered in November 2018.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A judge has reinstated a felony count against a Milwaukee man who was living in an underground bunker that contained a stash of weapons, generator and various power tools. Geoffrey Graff, 41, was originally charged with two felonies after police discovered the bunker while investigating a report that he fired a shot into the nearby Milwaukee River. A court commissioner earlier this month dismissed one of the charges, for recklessly endangering safety. Milwaukee Circuit Judge David Borowski reinstated the charge on Thursday, the Journal Sentinel reported. Graff is facing a separate felony charge of possessing a short-barreled shotgun. Graff told authorities he had been using the bunker for at least seven years.\n\nWyoming\n\nSaratoga: The U.S. Forest Service has bought the last piece of private land within a wilderness area in central Wyoming. The 80-acre purchase in Carbon County will allow members of the public to roam the Huston Park Wilderness without the worry of crossing into private land, Forest Service officials said Friday. The land is located just north of Colorado-Wyoming state line and is part of the Medicine Bow National Forest in the Sierra Madre mountain range. Congress designated the 31,000-acre Huston Park Wilderness in 1984 and officials have since been seeking to buy up private lands inside its boundaries. The purchase price for the 80-acre parcel was not released. Officials said they worked with the Daley family and the Daley Basin Land Company to complete the deal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/25/guitar-hotel-creepy-dolls-slime-museum-news-around-states/40414979/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nParrish: Alabama Power Company has agreed to pay about $222,000 to settle a chemical spill and fish kill. News outlets reported the amount includes a civil penalty and compensation. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said more than 500 fish were found dead in March, days after about 700 gallons of flame retardant spilled into Baker Creek near the company’s coal-fired plant in Parrish. The state agency said its investigators were ordered by Alabama Power personnel to leave the plant on March 29 because they weren’t carrying official state identification. The investigators said many fish had been removed from the water when they returned a few hours later. AL.com reported Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said the company removed some dead fish after the spill.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A rule change will allow electronically assisted bikes anywhere that traditional bicycles are permitted in Denali National Park and Reserve. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported that the National Park Service issued the e-bike directive at the end of August. The park service said the policy aimed at expanding recreational opportunities and accessibility allows the motorized vehicles on the entire length of the Denali Park Road. An official said that beyond the 92 miles of the road, e-bikes can travel on a single trail of Denali’s front country and into the backcountry via a limited number of access points. The park service maintains a strict definition of an e-bike as a \"low-speed electric bicycle” with a motor under 750 watts, which is 1 horsepower.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale:White Castle is open for business in Arizona. The 98-year-old family run business opened Wednesday near Scottsdale, the first franchise in the state and the largest free-standing one in the world. The excitement among residents was so great that a company official estimated the wait to get the famous mini-burgers and a variety of other menu items was running about 31/ 2 hours just after 8 p.m. The 4,589-square-foot restaurant, which can accommodate more than 200 guests, has televisions, free WiFi, and a kitchen that’s entirely visible from the dining room. It also pays homage to rock musician Alice Cooper, a longtime White Castle fan and a member of its “Cravers Hall of Fame,” with a large photo of Cooper in a corner of the restaurant. The Scottsdale-area resident attended the groundbreaking of the restaurant in April and was the first to dine with his family in his namesake booth at a preopening event Sunday night. The restaurant will serve alcohol every day from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. There will be beers and wines available on tap, plus White Claw hard seltzer in mango and black cherry flavors.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:Underage vaping took center stage at a roundtable discussion held by state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Monday at the Donald W. Reynolds Library. Rutledge, who is holding roundtable discussions with local leaders in all 75 counties, spent several hours in Mountain Home after holding a similar meeting earlier Monday for Marion County officials in Yellville. The attorney general also held an afternoon roundtable in Melbourne with Izard County leaders later that day. The Baxter County roundtable touched on the potential impacts of medical marijuana and the state’s involvement in several pending lawsuits filed against opioid manufacturers and distributors, but all avenues of conversation seemed to lead back to underage vaping. Vaping’s low-key nature and whimsical flavors have made the devices a popular target of abuse among children. Forty percent of Mountain Home students in grades 8 through 12 are either vaping or have tried it, Mountain Home Superintendent Dr. Jake Long said. The Attorney General’s Office has sued three online vaping retailers, Rutledge said. Her office has also mailed hundreds of warnings to other online retailers warning that it is illegal to ship tobacco into the state for sale. Parents need as much education about the devices as their children do, Rutledge said. Some devices are manufactured to resemble a more innocuous item in passing, she said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nEl Centro: The Imperial County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted unanimously to declare a local state of emergency at the Salton Sea. The measure, which will be sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom, will help officials break through 14 years of bureaucratic wrangling and red tape to get dust suppression and habitat projects underway. if the state recognizes the emergency, Newsom can appeal to the Trump administration, and work could begin immediately, rather than waiting until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other entities complete lengthy environmental permitting reviews. Federal and state disaster relief funds could also be freed up. Newsom did not respond to requests for comment. In addition to the action on the state's largest lake, supervisors said they will likely seek another emergency declaration on the badly polluted New River, which flows into the Salton Sea, in two weeks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A giraffe has died unexpectedly at the Denver Zoo because of complications following a routine medical procedure. KCNC-TV reported the zoo announced on social media that the giraffe named “Kazi” died Tuesday. Zoo officials said the 2-year-old male arrived in Denver from the Milwaukee Zoo in September to become a companion to a female giraffe in its herd. Officials said a castration procedure was successful, but the giraffe experienced trouble breathing while recovering from anesthesia and then stopped breathing completely. The zoo said staff members tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the animal by intubating it and performing CPR. Officials said the castration performed by the zoo’s medical staff is a common procedure used to decrease the competitive, aggressive nature of male giraffes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: The president of Wesleyan University said the school has decided not to pursue the proposed idea of opening a college in China. President Michael Roth wrote in a campuswide email Thursday that he met with those involved in the potential venture during a trip to Asia and it became clear that their “respective goals could not be sufficiently aligned.” Roth said there also were unresolved questions around issues of academic freedom. A Chinese corporation, the Hengdian Group, had invited the private liberal arts school to consider teaming up to open a campus in China. Meetings that had been planned for next week with Wesleyan faculty and students to discuss the proposal have been canceled.\n\nDelaware\n\nTownsend:A crash Wednesday night on Del. 1 near the U.S. 13 overpass near Townsend shut down the highway during the overnight hours, an official said. The crash happened just before 9:40 p.m. and involved two tractor-trailers, said an official with the Delaware State Police. One driver sustained nonlife threatening injuries in the crash, the official said. Del. 1 was closed at exit 119 and at exit 114, according to DelDOT's website. Traffic was diverted onto U.S. 13 north, which also was closed for a time, leading to backups. Some of the debris from the wreck ended up on U.S. 13 north, affecting traffic on that road, said an official with DelDOT's Traffic Management Center. All north Del. 1 lanes were reopened at about 6:45 a.m. By 8 a.m., DelDOT tweeted that U.S. 13 was cleared.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A judge has denied an injunction request that would have blocked the District of Columbia from moving forward on its $215 million no-bid sports gambling contract. News outlets reported Judge John Campbell denied the request Friday, stating the D.C. Council didn’t act illegally in issuing the single-source contract to Intralot. Sports-betting technology developer Dylan Carragher filed an injunction last month claiming the contract violated the procurement laws. D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said through a spokesperson that his office is pleased with the decision. Carragher’s attorney, Donald Temple, said he plans to appeal. Carragher also filed a lawsuit against the District claiming the contract illegally bars him and other vendors from participating in the “potentially lucrative enterprise.” The lawsuit is pending.\n\nFlorida\n\nHollywood: It looks like a rock ‘n’ roll guitar. But this one is 450 feet tall and is a light-beam hotel that the Seminole Tribe wants to become South Florida’s latest tourist destination. The Guitar Hotel’s grand opening was Thursday on the tribe’s land in Hollywood. It’s the latest step in the Seminole Hard Rock empire, which includes naming rights on the Miami-area stadium where the 2020 Super Bowl will be played. It’s a unique addition to South Florida’s tourist landscape and no hotel is like it in the world. It has more than 600 rooms and at night, beams of light will mimic the strings of the guitar. The $1.5 billion project also has a refurbished venue for concerts and other events, starting with Maroon 5 on Friday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCordele: A Canadian company said it will lay off 45 workers at a south Georgia wood panel mill as it cuts production. Toronto-based Norbord said it will stop making oriented strand board on one of its two lines at its Cordele plant. The company announced Monday that the cutback will take place in mid-November. Norbord said it’s cutting back because demand is poor, especially in the southeast. The line that’s being closed had been running on a reduced schedule. It will be closed indefinitely, while a second line continues to run a full schedule. The cutback represents 6% of Norbord’s North American capacity. Norbord said it will write down the value of the Cordele mill by $10 million before taxes as part of its third-quarter earnings.\n\nHawaii\n\nLahaina: Roads and an airport have reopened as firefighters continue to fight a west Maui brush fire. Maui officials said the fire above Kahana ridge was 45% contained Wednesday. About 1.5-square miles burned, threatening some homes, prompting evacuations, and forcing the closure of the Kapalua Airport. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said the small airport reopened Wednesday morning for normal operations. Maui County spokesman Brian Perry said officials are checking to assess damage and looking into unconfirmed reports of burned or singed roofs. County officials said about six people checked into a shelter at the Lahaina Civic Center on Tuesday, but no one stayed overnight. The shelter was closed Wednesday. There are no reports of injuries.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A black bear cub that was illegally taken from the wild by a Boise man is heading to a rehabilitation sanctuary. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said a “well-meaning” Boise hunter took the cub last Saturday. The department confiscated the bear two days later, and State Veterinarian Dr. Mark Drew has treated the animal for an abscess, infection, abrasions and dehydration. Fish and Game regional supervisor Brad Compton said the bear was not habituated to humans, and it will likely continue to try to avoid humans in the wild. The bear will spend the winter at the Snowdon Wildlife Sanctuary near McCall and will likely be released to the wild next spring, when it is 1, Compton said. Fish and Game spokesperson Evin Oneale said the man who took the bear from the wild thought it was sick and wanted to help it but had no veterinarian training and no authorization from the state. The man kept the bear in a dog kennel in his garage until it was confiscated. Oneale said people who see an injured wild animal can take note of where the animal was seen and then report that location to the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s police oversight agency has recommended only a 30-day suspension for an officer who fatally shot a fleeing teenager in 2011, concluding it missed the five-year deadline for firing him under state law. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability also recommended Macario Chavez be put on desk duty indefinitely. A police spokesman said Tuesday that Chavez already has served the suspension. The office found Chavez showed a “reckless disregard for human life” as he fired 31 times at Calvin Cross with a high-powered rifle. Two other officers fired 14 times at the 19-year-old. The officers reported Cross shot at them. However, records show the only gun found at the scene was so clogged with grime it could not fire. Chavez and the others were initially cleared of wrongdoing in 2013.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Authorities said the man and woman who died when their SUV plunged from the fourth floor of a downtown parking garage came from Illinois. The Marion County Coroner’s Office on Thursday identified the couple as 70-year-old Iristeen Hunt and 73-year-old Charles Hunt of University Park, Illinois. The car plowed through the wall of the Market Square Center Garage just before 10 a.m. Wednesday, tumbling four floors before landing on its roof in an alley behind the City Market. The couple died at the scene and a man who witnessed the plunge was treated for shock. Fire Department Battalion Chief Rita Reith has said the woman was driving.\n\nIowa\n\nMason City: Members of a veterans group will dedicate monuments depicting male and female soldiers. The Globe Gazette reported the monuments will be dedicated Saturday at the All Vets Center. They have been added to a display that includes a Howitzer and flagpole. The monuments were obtained and repaired after a fundraising effort that included rummage sales and dances. One statue shows a female soldier who carries her helmet and has an M-4 rifle slung over her shoulder. The other shows an infantryman from the Vietnam War.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A wayward squirrel is being blamed for a power outage in Topeka. KSNT-TV reported that about 3,000 Evergy customers were without electricity when the power went out around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Crews had the lights back on within about a half-hour. The electric company said a squirrel made contact with equipment, causing the outage. Among those impacted were businesses, Topeka West High School and several traffic lights.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: The McCracken County Humane Society is struggling after taking in 65 dogs in two days. The Paducah Sun reported it started on Sunday with the report of a pit bull puppy in bad shape. The puppy later died, and on Monday 10 dogs, most of them pit bulls, were removed from the residence. One of them immediately gave birth to a litter of 11. Then on Tuesday, McCracken deputies learned that jail inmate Jennifer Campbell had dogs in her home that had not been taken care of since her arrest the previous Friday. Campbell would not consent to an animal welfare check, so they had to obtain a search warrant. Animal Control found more than 40 Chihuahuas in the home in extremely poor conditions, including some that had died. Forty-four Chihuahuas made it to the shelter on Tuesday. Because all 65 dogs are part of court cases, the shelter cannot immediately put them up for adoption. Vannerson said the situation is difficult. Before this week, the largest number of animals the shelter had taken in at once was 27 cats a few years ago. Despite the difficulty of suddenly caring for so many animals, Vannerson has been heartened by the public’s support. The phones are constantly ringing with people wanting to know when the dogs can be adopted. Donations of food and money have come in, too. Vannerson said she was moved to tears when one man showed up with a $1,000 donation Wednesday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s farmers could start growing industrial hemp by the spring if federal and state agriculture agencies keep their regulatory work on track, Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain said. Strain outlined to state lawmakers Monday the regulations his department has drafted for industrial hemp production, rules that will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval. Lawmakers earlier this year agreed to legalize hemp production in Louisiana, saying that would help farmers diversify their crops. The law is in line with what’s allowed under the 2018 federal Farm Bill, which removed hemp from the list of federally controlled substances. Hemp is a member of the cannabis plant family but contains only traces of the THC chemical compound that causes a high for marijuana users. Hemp is used for textiles, fuels, rope and chemical absorbents, among other products. The state law required a hemp growing and production regulatory plan to be submitted to the USDA by Nov. 1. Strain estimated 100 to 200 farmers will plant hemp across as many as 80,000 acres of Louisiana soil in 2020. He warned that the expense from cultivating the plant and the strict regulations could keep some smaller farming operations from producing the plant. Growing hemp for individual use is prohibited.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The University of Maine is getting more federal funding for a floating platform to support up to a 12-megawatt wind turbine. The grant, announced Wednesday, is expected to be worth about $5 million for UMaine’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center. The center already has developed smaller floating hulls to support 6-megawatt turbines to be placed off the coast of Monhegan Island. That pilot project, dubbed Aqua Ventus, is viewed as a major test for floating wind turbine technology. The new funding announcement was made Wednesday during the American Wind Energy Association Offshore WINDPOWER Conference in Boston. Offshore wind power projects stalled under former Republican Gov. Paul LePage. But Democratic Gov. Janet Mills directed the Maine Public Utilities Commission to approve a contract to get the project back on track.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: After a 10-month investigation, Cameron Coke of Towson, Maryland, has been charged with theft and fourth-degree burglary in connection with the taking of a baby Jesus statue from an Ocean City church's outdoor nativity, according to police. The theft occurred just after 6 a.m. on Dec. 31, 2018, according to a January Facebook post from the police department. In that post, police also released images of the suspects and their vehicle, which had been captured on surveillance cameras. Charging documents show the break in the case came when a tip was called into the police department after a local news station aired a story about the theft featuring those surveillance images. The police department posted an update on the investigation to Facebook on Wednesday announcing that Coke, the main suspect in the theft, had been identified and charged.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nFramingham: The North Hall dormitory at Framingham State University will soon be renamed in honor of abolitionist and journalist Mary Miles Bibb, the school’s first African American woman to graduate. In 1843, Bibb graduated from the Lexington Normal School, which later became Framingham State University. She then became one of the first African American female teachers in the country. The university’s board of trustees agreed to the plan after receiving a petition from students in 2018. Details of the official renaming ceremony have not been confirmed.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:A 100-year-old World War II veteran from Michigan has been honored for guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Jack Eaton is the oldest living sentinel of the monument, which he protected from January 1938 to December 1939. Eaton viewed his plaque for the first time at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on Wednesday. The Detroit Free Press reports that Eaton said he has wanted the plaque for a while. His stepdaughter, Brenda Warburton, said Eaton got a little choked up on seeing the plaque, noting that’s unusual for him. The Burton resident realized he didn’t have a plaque after touring the guard barracks of the tomb in 2017, where plaques of every living guard are displayed. A plaque was erected after he inquired about it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: The History Center of Olmsted County has posted photos and videos of its miniature dolls on social media, taking votes for the most nightmarish one. Curator Dan Nowakowski told Minnesota Public Radio that for a lot of the dolls, the freakiness is all in the eyes. Some have movable eyelids that snap open when you lift the dolls up. The paint has chipped off the face of another contender, leaving it looking like a mummy. Nowakowski said the dolls weren’t intended to be frightening when they were made, but damage from play and the passage of time have turned them creepy. The winner and runner-up will be displayed over Halloween.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A retired police chief appointed to act as the temporary city manager of Pascagoula has announced he’s leaving the role after less than a month. The Sun Herald reported Kenny Johnson announced his Oct. 31 retirement less than two weeks after city leaders appointed him to the role. The former Pascagoula police chief said he notified officials about his impending retirement Monday after meeting with the state public employee’s retirement system. Councilwoman-at-large Jennifer Colmer said the city planned to hire a new manager by Oct. 30, so Johnson’s announcement wasn’t surprising. Johnson was appointed after the city’s attorney and manager, Ryan Frederic, abruptly announced he was going on medical leave. Officials have since separated the roles, so Johnson would only serve as the attorney upon his return.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo said that Rani, a 23-year-old Asian elephant, is pregnant and due to give birth next summer. The zoo’s bull elephant, 26-year-old Raja, is the father. Raja is among the most popular animals at the zoo. He was the first Asian elephant born there, in 1992. The calf will be his fifth offspring. The zoo said elephant pregnancy lasts about 22 months. A newborn calf weighs up to 350 pounds. The gender of the calf is unknown.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a Missoula city ordinance requiring background checks on all gun sales in the city, ruling that it goes against a state law prohibiting restrictions on gun sales. The five-justice panel ruled unanimously that the ordinance, the first of its kind in Montana, is barred by a law that says local governments are not allowed to exercise any power that “affects the right to keep or bear arms.” The decision overturns a ruling by a district judge who said the ordinance complies with another section of state law that allows local governments to enact rules to keep felons, the mentally ill, minors and people illegally in the U.S. from possessing weapons. The high court ruled the Missoula ordinance went too far by subjecting every private gun sale to a background check. Federal law requires background checks on gun purchases from licensed sellers, such as gun stores, but not on private sales. The ruling upholds a previous opinion by Attorney General Tim Fox, who said in a statement that he was confident his position would be vindicated.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The name of the top candidate for the University of Nebraska system presidency could be publicly disclosed at the Board of Regents’ meeting Friday. The Board of Regents agenda was amended Tuesday to include what the notice said is the “potential designation of a priority candidate” for the position. Hank Bounds announced in March that he was leaving the post and state and has since become a professor at the University of South Alabama. The system president is its overall administrative leader, and the chancellors oversee the operations of the campuses in Kearney, Lincoln and Omaha. A 23-member committee worked with a search firm to identify candidates and forward the names of some to the regents. If regents were to vote for a priority candidate Friday, he or she would then undergo 30 days of vetting by students, faculty, staff and others before the regents could make a final decision.\n\nNevada\n\nBoulder City: State wildlife officials have ordered a quarantine on a Boulder City horse facility after multiple horses contracted a contagious virus before being euthanized. The state Department of Agriculture said lab results confirmed animals at the Horseman’s Association Property tested positive for horse herpes. Department officials said the quarantine is a precautionary measure to avoid the spread of Equine Herpesvirus-1 among the 500 horses on the southwest Nevada property. Officials said the virus is a highly transferrable disease between horses, or between horses and humans. Horse owners said signs of the disease appear to be fever, cough or runny nose.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLandaff: A group of friends, family and fellow soldiers recently gathered at the Landaff Cemetery to mark the 15th anniversary of the death of Army Spc. Alan Burgess. Serving with the New Hampshire National Guard in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, Burgess was killed when a car bomb detonated near his vehicle on Oct. 15, 2004. He was 24. More than two dozen showed up, many of them soldiers who served alongside Burgess. They spent hours recalling his humor and his humanity, trading stories that often ended with laughter. Serving in the 2nd Battalion, 197th Field Artillery Forward, Burgess’ unit was often used for transport assignments, and as a joke, he bought and mounted a taxi light for the top of his Humvee. The fare for his ‘taxi’ was a bottle of nonalcoholic beer.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic Highlands: A man said he and his hiking companion were rescued after they fell off a cliff because the impact spurred his smartwatch to call 911. James Prudenciano and Paige Paruso were hiking in Hartshorne Woods Park last week when they got lost in the woods. They eventually tumbled down a steep cliff as darkness set in. Prudenciano had bought the watch two days earlier and chose to activate the “fall detection” feature, which alerts the owner’s emergency contacts and calls 911 when it detects that its user has fallen. Rescuers were able to reach the couple, who were taken ashore by a boat. They were treated at a hospital for undisclosed injuries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: City officials have announced plans to sell a $150,000 property the city acquired from the federal government. The Roswell Daily Record reported Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Interior built the industrial site in 1962 or 1963 and used it as a saline water testing plant before its 1984 closure. Roswell Mayor Dennis Kintigh said the city decided to sell because of maintenance issues and intentions to subject the land to property tax. Officials said the site is leased by Wisconsin-based international manufacturer A.O. Smith for about $9,000 a year. The City Council approved a request to search for bidders Oct. 10. Bids are due by Nov. 26. Officials said a completed sale is expected by March if a bidder comes forward and city and state officials approve the contract.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: An immersive, 8,000-square-foot museum dedicated to all things slime opens Friday for a nearly six-month celebration complete with a sticky barefoot lake walk and DIY bar. There’s also the opportunity to don goggles and a poncho and get doused in the stuff that has a big following but a questionable impact when it comes to disposal and the environment. The brainchild of Karen Robinovitz, Sara Schiller and Toni Ko, the so-called Sloomoo Institute is the latest in Instagram-friendly pop-ups to hit New York and then travel to other locales. The idea, the co-founders said during a preopening tour, is simple: To spread slime’s powers of rejuvenation and relaxation. Technically speaking, slime is a cross-linked polymer scientifically known as a “non-Newtonian fluid.” Its history stretches back to the 1830s, when polymer science originated and Nathaniel Hayward and Friedrich Ludersdorf concluded that adding sulfur to raw, natural rubber prevented it from getting sticky.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A state House panel supports a $660 million fix for cash-flow problems at the Department of Transportation attributed to disaster recovery spending and litigation losses. But the chamber’s top budget-writers aren’t expected to support it. WRAL-TV reported the measure approved on Wednesday by a transportation spending subcommittee would give $360 million to DOT to cover legal awards after courts struck down a law that previously kept land costs for highways low. The state government also would loan $300 million to DOT, with full repayment by 2025 through federal disaster reimbursements. Low cash levels forced DOT this year to suspend hundreds of projects. House budget chairman Rep. Chuck McGrady opposes the measure – especially the cash advance – and expects colleagues will, too. McGrady said a separate proposal is being assembled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum has announced his plans to seek reelection in 2020. In a video announcement posted on YouTube on Thursday, Burgum highlights accomplishments since he and Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford took office three years ago. Burgum said they are “reinventing government with modern business efficiencies” and have “turned a budget shortfall into a budget surplus and cut government spending without raising taxes.” The 63-year-old Republican said North Dakota is headed in the right direction with increased employment and higher wages. Burgum defeated Democrat Marvin Nelson and Libertarian Marty Riske in the November 2016 gubernatorial election.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Legislation dubbed Tyler’s Law would place a professional engineer on the Ohio Advisory Council on Amusement Ride Safety. The panel makes recommendations to the state’s agriculture director about safety matters, including monitoring and inspecting rides. The measure is named for Tyler Jarrell, an 18-year-old Marine recruit killed when the “Fireball” ride malfunctioned and broke apart on the opening day of the 2017 Ohio State Fair. Seven others were injured in the accident later blamed on excessive corrosion in a steel support beam. The bill heads to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine after receiving unanimous approval Wednesday in the Senate. It cleared the House in June.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: One of the nation’s top rating agencies is upgrading the state’s economic outlook from “stable” to “positive” in large part because of the 2018 passage of tax hikes that have resulted in budget surpluses and increased reserves. Moody’s Investors Service announced Wednesday it was also affirming the state’s Aa2 rating, the agency’s third-highest rating. The agency’s positive outlook indicates it expects strong fiscal management and a commitment to increasing reserves. The agency also cited the state’s relatively low state debt and pension burden. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt has said he wants the state to set aside $2 billion in reserves to help better prepare the state for its next economic downturn.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: An invasion of purple sea urchins that destroyed underwater kelp forests off the California coast is now hitting Oregon. Numbers released by Oregon’s wildlife agency show 350 million of the urchins on one reef in southern Oregon alone – a 10,450% increase since 2014. The purple urchins have devoured all the kelp, killing off important fisheries for red abalone and red sea urchins in California and Oregon. A coalition of scientists, ecologists and private business interests is trying to harvest the unwanted urchins and transfer them to sea urchin “ranches.” The urchins are fattened up at the ranches for sale to a global seafood market.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJonestown: The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it rescued 83 cats and 10 dogs from unsafe conditions at a self-proclaimed rescue facility. WHTM-TV reported that the animals were removed from the Jonestown property on Wednesday. Authorities say many of the cats were suffering from respiratory infections and eye conditions and several dogs were very thin. Most of the animals were living in enclosures with feces and urine that had accumulated over several days. Five dead cats were found in one enclosure. One cat’s remains could not be removed because it had decomposed so much. All the rescued animals were given to the SPCA. They are expected to be up for adoption once they receive medical treatment. An investigation is ongoing and charges are pending.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: Construction of an artificial reef off the coast of East Providence is expected to take place this week. The Providence Journal reported that the reef will be installed off Sabin Point. The reef is intended to become a habitat for fish that live in Narragansett Bay, including tautog, black sea bass and scup. It will be made of precast concrete balls with holes in them. The $47,000 project is being funded through the federal Sports Fish Restoration Program and a grant from the Rhode Island Saltwater Anglers Association. The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council approved the project in June.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: An Atlanta-based timber company is ending production at two rural South Carolina wood product plants that employ 240 workers. The Post and Courier reported Tuesday that Georgia-Pacific said declining conditions in the U.S. home building industry are forcing it to idle its McCormick and Allendale sites by the year’s end. The company said all employees will be let go, except for crews needed to manage inventory and maintain the properties. In a written statement obtained by the newspaper, the company said it will continue production for up to 60 days, after which the sites will be closed but maintained in case market conditions improve enough to resume production. The company said it will hold employment fairs to help workers find new jobs. The displaced workers will be eligible for unemployment benefits.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHot Springs: Some bison cows at Wind Cave National Park are being monitored with collars that communicate with satellites. The Rapid City Journal reported the collars will be affixed on 10 bison during roundups, which occurs every other year. Greg Schoreder, the park’s chief of Resource Management, said the collars will allow park officials to see how the bison use the park’s resources, specifically water resources. It could help officials determine if more watering areas are needed to prevent overuse and damage of existing water supply. Schroeder said collars will transmit daily from four locations and will be sent to park officials’ emails. The nonprofit organization Black Hills Parks & Forests Association raised money for the collars. The park hopes to show the bison’s movements to guests in the visitor center.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Nashville’s sheriff said there’s proof that Johnny Cash was granted law enforcement authority four decades ago. At the Johnny Cash Museum this week, Sheriff Daron Hall unveiled a blown-up image of the late musician’s September 1979 deputy sheriff commission card, issued by then-Davidson County Sheriff Fate Thomas, featuring Cash’s headshot, fingerprint and signature. Hall said one of his photographers discovered the card in a box. The card authorized Cash to “execute any and all processes that may come into his hands and to maintain the peace and dignity of the State, and arrest any and all persons violating the Criminal laws of the State of Tennessee.” Hall said he doesn’t have evidence of what the deputy work entailed, but Cash believed in prison reform and criminal justice reform\n\nTexas\n\nDoma: Work crews in South Texas are laying steel along the U.S.-Mexico border in preparation for the installation of new segments of border wall. The U.S. Border Patrol said workers were installing steel rebar at a site south of Donna, a small city in the Rio Grande Valley. The rebar will reinforce concrete panels that will, in turn, be topped with 18-foot steel bollards. Crews will also clear vegetation 150 feet in front of the wall. Environmental advocates and opponents of the wall have warned that construction will destroy critical habitat and require the seizure of land from potentially hundreds of people in South Texas. The Border Patrol said a wall will deter drug and human smuggling. The ongoing construction was funded by Congress last year.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zions Bancorporation, a Utah-based bank, has announced plans to lay off hundreds of employees and close branches across multiple states in the coming months. Zions Bancorporation started notifying employees Tuesday of a 5% workforce reduction. The company employs about 10,000 people in 11 western states. Executives said about 30% of the layoffs would be employees dealing directly with the public, and the remaining would be in enterprise activities and behind the scenes. Company executives said the cuts are necessary after declining revenue. Executives said banks across the country are losing money because of lower interest rates. Executives said the company would close or relocate a small number of branches, but only one in Utah previously announced would shut down. Some executives said they took a pay cut to trim expenses.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: A haunted house in Chittenden County garnered attention for a plotline that some Vermonters considered offensive. Nightmare Vermont changed programming that referenced a school shooting after community members spoke out in protest. The attraction is set to put on performances until Saturday at the Champlain Valley Exposition. The haunted house, in operation since 2004, issued a Facebook apology on Tuesday to the community. The post indicated “any reference to current events or plotlines involving students and weapons” will not factor into the production. The post received a few comments from Facebook users who felt the haunted house’s response was an unnecessary adjustment. The backlash to the storyline came largely from the Slate Valley Unified Union School District, as Superintendent Brooke Olsen-Farrell said many felt the opening plot referenced a firearm in a school setting, according to reporting by the Rutland Herald. The performance mentioned Parkland, Florida and included a reference to Fair Haven Union High School, which had a school shooting scare in 2018. The group’s director, Jana Beagley, clarified that the intention of the plot “was against school violence” and assured that the program “cut all references and plotlines entirely out of respect for the feedback we received,” according to the Herald.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: Roanoke County has reversed a ban on sleeping in cars overnight. The Roanoke Times reported the Wednesday reversal comes after months of backlash over the February ordinance. The newspaper said the ordinance was decried by people who said it infringed on personal liberties and created additional hardships for those without stable housing. Officials have said the ordinance was meant to allow the county to intervene in unsafe situations. Hollins District Supervisor Phil North echoed that Wednesday, adding that authorities never planned to punish offenders with the fine specified in the ordinance. No one was charged under the ordinance. North said there’s no point in defending an ordinance the county didn’t intend to apply. County Attorney Peter Lubeck said the public’s opinion influenced the reversal.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A divided state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that birthdates of state employees are public records that are subject to disclosure. In a 5-4 ruling , the court said there was no statutory or constitutional allowance that would preclude the release of such information. The decision reversed a Court of Appeals ruling and reinstated a lower court ruling that denied a motion to permanently enjoin the release of state employee names, birthdates, and email addresses. The case stems from a 2016 request from the Freedom Foundation, a conservative group that had been seeking disclosure of records of union-represented employees, so it could contact them as part of its effort to reduce the size and influence of public-sector unions. Several unions sought to stop the release of the records.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice wants to expand the state’s winemaking industry. The Republican governor on Wednesday said he’s asking officials in the state’s commerce and agricultural agencies to look into growing the wine business in the eastern panhandle. Justice said having more vineyards and wineries in West Virginia will boost tourism and local economies. He noted that Virginia has benefited from promoting its winemaking industry where the state borders West Virginia’s eastern panhandle. Justice said he wants agriculture officials to evaluate winemaking conditions in the eastern panhandle. He wants commerce officials to investigate the market for vineyards.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A group from Wisconsin is in South Burlington, Vermont, to learn more about how the area is dealing with the arrival of the F-35 fighter planes being flown by the Vermont Air National Guard. State Rep. Chris Taylor, a Democrat, told MyChamplainValley.com that people in the Madison area are “really struggling to know what this means.” Last month, the first two of what are to be 20 F-35s arrived at the Burlington International Airport. The arrival of the jets, which are louder than their F-16 predecessors, followed years of concern, and opposition from some, about the noise. The Air Force has named Truax Field in Madison a preferred alternative to receive 20 of the jets. Earlier this month, the Wisconsin Assembly passed a resolution supporting the F-35s.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A pizzeria in Gillette is stocking up ahead of a jump in the cost of Parmesan cheese from Italy. Pizza Carrello usually orders one big wheel of Parmesan at a time but recently bought five. Restaurant co-owner Ariane Jimison told the Gillette News-Record she expects the price of Parmesan to go up because of a 25% tariff on European Union products including wine, olive oil and cheese. President Donald Trump’s administration imposed the tariffs in response to EU subsidies for European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Each Parmesan wheel Jimison orders sells for $900. Jimison said she would have bought more but only five were available. Parmesan cheese comes from northern Italy, where it is aged for two years at room temperature.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/16/fugitive-pig-proverb-library-sodium-warnings-news-around-states/40155777/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nGuntersville: People in a rural area are raising concerns about the use of “chicken sludge” as fertilizer on farm fields as the state considers new rules on how such products can be used. Julie Lay says the sludge from a poultry processing plant created an overpowering stench when it was applied to a neighbor’s farm fields. Lay says flies also invaded her property in Marshall County. Al.com reports she says the material had a “crust” and chicken feathers. Lay was among several residents who spoke out recently at an Alabama Department of Environmental Management public hearing. The agency is considering new rules on how biosolids – solid material left over from wastewater treatment operations and chicken processing plants – can be used as a fertilizer.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: Two young harbor seals are back where they belong after being rehabilitated through the Alaska SeaLife Center’s Wildlife Response Program and released into Kachemak Bay. Dozens of people gathered at Bishop’s Beach on Sept. 5 to watch as the two seals – Ugashik “Uggy” and Charley Fritz – were released into the waters of Kachemak Bay in Homer by SeaLife Center staff and volunteers, the Homer News reports. Uggy was found neglected by her mother May 29 on a beach near McNeil Canyon, and Fritz was found neglected by his mother on a beach near Homer on May 12, according to an information sheet provided by the SeaLife Center. At that time, both were estimated to be only a week to two weeks old, says Jane Belovarac, curator for the Wildlife Response Program.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Residents with overdue library books might want to wait a bit before bringing back their borrowed copies of the current bestsellers. Starting in November, Phoenix’s public library system will join a growing number of libraries around the United States that have dropped overdue book fees, becoming the nation’s largest metropolis to dump the fines. Phoenix City Librarian Rita Hamilton said the unanimous City Council decision would allow the system comprised of 17 libraries to ensure “that access to our resources is as equitable as possible.” The Phoenix system has been charging 20 cents per item per day, which can add up quickly into dollars owed, an extra expense some families cannot afford. Phoenix’s move is part of a worldwide trend by libraries to eliminate fines the American Library Association considers “a form of social inequality.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s attorney general is seeking to move lawsuits challenging a measure giving the prison director authority to determine an inmate’s competency to be executed to federal court. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Thursday filed notice to move the lawsuits by death row inmates Bruce Ward and Jack Greene from Jefferson County Circuit Court. The state Supreme Court in November struck down an earlier version of the mental competency law. Legislators this year approved a reworked version of the law, and the inmates are seeking to have it overturned. Rutledge’s filing says federal courts have jurisdiction because the inmates argue the new law violates the U.S. Constitution. Arkansas has no executions scheduled and lacks the drugs needed for its lethal injection process.\n\nCalifornia\n\nFresno: California authorities have captured an emu after the flightless fugitive led officers down a highway. The Fresno Bee reported Friday that the bird was apprehended following a brief pursuit by California Highway Patrol officers. Authorities say officers responded to a report that an ostrich was wandering along the right-hand shoulder of U.S. Highway 99 northwest of Fresno. Authorities say Madera County Animal Services took the bird into custody uninjured. Officers say they do not know whether the emu escaped a nearby farm or a moving vehicle. Animal experts say the flightless native Australian birds can sprint at up to 30 mph and trot quickly for longer distances. Emus are the second-largest birds in the world behind ostriches.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 40 boats gathered at Inlet Bay Marina on Friday and linked together to form a circle, planning on remaining in formation until Sunday. The event, known as the “Ships Wheel,” is a yearly tradition for the boaters of Horsetooth Reservoir to celebrate the end of summer together. The event was created by Inlet Bay Marina owners Glen and Nancy Werth. “It’s an end-of-year celebration. It’s definitely the highlight of the year,” says Anthony Robbins, a Ships Wheel participant. Robbins says those participating strive to create a safe, positive and family-friendly atmosphere in the reservoir, which he says hasn’t always had the best reputation. During the event, those in the wheel hang out on their boats all weekend, eating and sleeping.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A group of prison inmates has asked a federal judge for bottled drinking water, alleging the tap water at the Osborn Correctional Institution is tainted with bacteria found in sewage. The inmates are seeking a temporary injunction as part of a larger lawsuit that accuses the state of exposing them to hazardous materials such as PCBs and asbestos. They allege numerous inmates have become ill with bacteria known as helicobacter pylori, which is typically water-borne and caused by sewage entering the water supply. Affidavits filed by 38 inmates and former inmates at Osborn described discolored water that smells of feces and contains floating particles. They also say prison staff routinely bring in bottled water to drink and provide to therapy dogs. The state denies the allegations.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Three fatal shootings in less than 12 hours in the state’s largest city mean it has already surpassed its number of dead or injured shooting victims for all of 2018. Wilmington Police report two men ages 24 and 26 were shot Friday morning in a residential area and later died. Police say earlier Friday a 36-year-old woman also was shot and died. Their names haven’t been released, and the deaths are under investigation. The woman was the 78th shooting victim of the year, matching the number recorded in all of last year. The total was exceeded with the shootings later Friday. This year 16 people have been killed in Wilmington shootings, compared to 19 in all of 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who helped spark a youth-driven push for climate change, has come to Washington. On Friday, Thunberg and about 1,500 protesters, many of them schoolchildren, marched and chanted near the White House. Thunberg, who is 16, gained international attention by inspiring protests and school strikes demanding immediate actions to avert environmental catastrophe. Her activism has drawn a passionate following of children essentially challenging their elders to take action. Last month, Thunberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a solar-powered boat, landing in New York City on Aug. 28. She is in Washington for several days of rallies and lobbying efforts in advance of a global climate strike declared for Sept. 20.\n\nFlorida\n\nWellington: It took 22 years, but a missing man’s remains were finally found thanks to someone who zoomed in on his former neighborhood with Google satellite images and noticed a car submerged in a lake. Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Teri Barbera says the skeletal remains were of William Moldt, who went missing in 1997. Barbera says a previous resident of Wellington was checking his former neighborhood on Google Earth when he saw what looked like a car in the lake. The former resident contacted a current homeowner, who used a drone to confirm it was a white car. Deputies then found the remains. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System says Moldt went to a nightclub in November 1997 but didn’t appear intoxicated when he left alone.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson says he’s demanding answers from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs after a woman says her father was bitten more than 100 times by ants at a veterans’ home in Decatur. Isakson says he was horrified and “downright maddened” after Laquna Ross told WSB-TV she found her father, Joel Marrable, with swollen, red bumps all over his body when she visited him at the nursing home near Atlanta last week before his death. Marrable, an Air Force veteran, had cancer. The Atlanta Veterans Affairs Health Care System said in a statement that it was told the ants were affecting patients. It said all of the bedrooms at the Eagle’s Nest Community Living Center have been cleaned, and a pest control company is monitoring conditions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige says he and other state employees received death threats amid the heated debate over building a giant telescope on the state’s highest peak. Ige disclosed the threats as he and his Cabinet members held a news conference Friday asking people on all sides of the issue to be careful with their language. Attorney General Clare Connors played a voicemail recording in which an unidentified man told a state employee, “I hope you die.” She showed reporters a social media post offering a $5,000 reward for the identity of a law enforcement officer involved in last week’s demolition and removal of a small wooden house built by demonstrators near the camp where they are blocking the telescope’s construction. “I hope that we can all agree that putting a bounty on the head of law enforcement officer is disturbing and deeply concerning,” Connors said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A panel of lawmakers formed to monitor how federal laws affect the state’s sovereignty and report back to the Legislature has created three subcommittees to examine federal lands, education, and health and welfare. Republican Rep. Jason Monks, co-chair of the Committee on Federalism, says the federal lands subcommittee is not a repeat of an interim committee from several years ago that ran up big attorney fees while trying to find a way for the state to take control of federal lands. He says the purpose of the Committee on Federalism created by the Legislature earlier this year is to find ways for the state to work more effectively with the federal government, and the breadth of that challenge is better met by forming subcommittees.\n\nIllinois\n\nOregon: The first steps in repairing a century-old landmark known as the Black Hawk statue are finally underway. Workers began erecting scaffolding last Monday around the 48-foot-tall statue in Lowden State Park in northern Illinois’ Ogle County. Sauk Valley Media reports Quality Restorations Inc. of Wood Dale was scheduled to begin the repair work last spring, but cold, wet weather thwarted that work. The 108-year-old monument has spent most of the past five years beneath a plastic covering to protect it from harsh weather. State budget troubles delayed a promised $350,000 matching state grant for the repairs, but that funding was finally secured over a year ago. The Black Restoration team obtained the remaining $225,000 needed for the project. The cost of repairs will approach $1 million.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is getting a $2.1 million federal grant to explore ways of reducing its high rate of pregnancy-related deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide the State Department of Health with more than $420,000 a year for five years to improve Indiana’s ability to collect data about pregnancy-related deaths and devise ways to combat them. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports the state has the nation’s third-highest rate of deaths of women while pregnant or within one year of their pregnancy’s end. The national maternal-mortality rate is 20.7 deaths per 100,000 births, but Indiana’s rate is 41.4 deaths per 100,000 births, according to the United Health Foundation. Only two other states scored worse: Georgia and Louisiana.\n\nIowa\n\nRed Oak: The Coyote Johnson Muscle Car Auction at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds on Saturday marked the event of the summer in southwestern Iowa, the big reveal of a storied collection of cars the public had long awaited. The massive event saw an entire community come out to witness a newly minted legend and see up close the treasure trove of classic American machines that Bill “Coyote” Johnson had kept hidden away for decades. The existence of Johnson’s hoard, more than a hundred in total, was revealed in April. Its existence was a revelation, a previously unknown monument to mid-century auto engineering. VanDerBrink Auctions sold off nearly 100 vehicles in about three hours.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: The Kansas State Fair will reevaluate its gun policy this fall because concert security concerns could conflict with state law that allows gun owners to carry their weapons openly. The Wichita Eagle reports that the fair had to screen concertgoers at the Sept. 7 Billy Currington performance because he required it in his contract, and the show was delayed while everyone and their bags were checked. Fair Manager Robin Jennison says the fair will likely have to employ that kind of security more often if it wants to continue booking top acts because such requirements are becoming common.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s chief justice says the drug court program has failed to keep up with surging demand for its treatment services while the state struggles with addiction woes. Chief Justice John D. Minton Jr. told lawmakers Friday that he’ll seek funding to expand drug courts. He told a legislative panel that drug courts and similar specialty courts are serving fewer than 2,500 people at a time when Kentucky faces its worst drug epidemic in history. Minton says that’s not even “scratching the surface of the need.” Drug courts provide court-supervised treatment so people can stay out of jail. Participants take part in counseling and education programs and must undergo drug tests.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two Swiss women have recreated Homer Simpson’s gourmandizing tour of the Big Easy, snarf for snarf, finger-wiggle for finger-wiggle. Biz New Orleans reports it took Janine Wiget, of Zurich, and Katrin von Niederhausern, who now lives in Stockholm, a week to duplicate the segment, which covers 54 restaurants in 1 minute, 27 seconds. The side-by-side video created by the 30-year-old illustrators and graphic designers has attracted more than 1 million views since it was uploaded Aug. 23. The women duplicate every action and camera angle in the sequence from “Lisa Gets the Blues,” which first aired April 22, 2018. Tourism officials are delighted. New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corp. president and CEO Mark Romig says it’s priceless publicity.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A man who caused a standoff that ended with him being shot three times and his home destroyed by a police explosive has sued law enforcement officials. Dixmont resident Michael Grendell argued police didn’t wait for a negotiator trained to handle mental health crises and failed to obtain a proper warrant to use a bomb. The Bangor Daily News reports 62-year-old Grendell sued Wednesday in federal court in Bangor. Eighteen state police members and one member of the attorney general’s office are defendants. A spokesman for the attorney general’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit. Grendell filed a notice in December saying he would seek $120 million in damages. Last year, he was sentenced to probation and a suspended jail term on charges including criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state panel on school construction has approved more than $13 million for portable air conditioning systems in Baltimore County schools. The money approved by the Interagency Committee on School Construction on Thursday will bring portable air conditioning systems to four of the county’s seven schools that still don’t have air conditioning: Dulaney High School, Lansdowne High School, Bedford Elementary School and Catonsville Center for Alternative Studies. Comptroller Peter Franchot, who has pushed for years as a member of the Board of Public Works to bring air conditioning to schools that don’t have it, says there’s finally some good news, on a day when some schools were closed in the Baltimore area due to excessive heat.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: The state has received more than half a million dollars in federal grant money to help workers at the now-shuttered Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station find new jobs. U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and U.S. Rep. William Keating, all Democrats, said the grant will help the state provide services like career planning, comprehensive assessments, resume writing and job placement to workers who were laid off earlier this year. The Plymouth plant, which produced electricity for 46 years, employed about 580 people in May. That number is expected to be about 270 by March 2020, according to plant operators. Last month the plant was sold to a private company for decommissioning. It was the state’s last nuclear power plant.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Tidal streaming service has selected five Motor City-based artists as the first winners of a million-dollar grant program to boost music careers. The platform announced Friday that Tidal Unplugged’s inaugural group consists of Emma Guzman, Laurie Love, Olivia Millerschin, Raye Williams and Sam Austins. They were chosen among thousands of applicants. The winners will get, among other things, a monthly stipend, professional training, access to recording and creative resources, and promotional support. They also will produce three songs each that will premiere on the streaming service and perform at a showcase later this year. Tidal officials say they aim to expand the program to other areas of the country.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Authorities say a fire that destroyed a historic synagogue doesn’t appear to have been a hate crime. Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken said Sunday that 36-year-old Matthew James Amiot, of Duluth, was arrested Friday in the fire last week at the Adas Israel Congregation, in the city’s downtown. Tusken says he has no reason to believe the fire was a hate crime, although the investigation is ongoing. Police are recommending that prosecutors charge Amiot with first-degree arson. Duluth fire Chief Shawn Krizaj says the blaze started outside the synagogue and spread into the building. No accelerants were found. According to its website, the Adas Israel Congregation is an Orthodox/High Conservative Jewish congregation with 75 members. Eight of 14 Torah scrolls, the holy books of Judaism, that were in the synagogue were saved.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: The wood-frame home where a washerwoman lived as she scrimped to create a scholarship fund has been moved to a museum district honoring African American accomplishments. The Hattiesburg home of the late Oseola McCarty was placed in a tax sale in 2017. The Hattiesburg American reports the local convention commission bought it. Late last month, the home was moved a few blocks from its original site. It will be restored and turned into a museum. McCarty attended school until the sixth grade and washed clothes for a living, saving money to help students needing financial assistance. She was 91 when she died in 1999. She left about $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi, and the Oseola McCarty Endowed Scholarship was created.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: A worker has found what’s believed to be a Civil War cannonball lodged in a Kansas City area tree that he was hired to take down. KMBC-TV reports the small cannonball fell out as the worker was chopping the diseased tree on the grounds of the Overfelt-Johnston house. The house was used as a hospital during the First Battle of Independence, which was fought across the street in 1862. Fourteen people were killed and 18 wounded as nearly 800 mounted Confederates overpowered the 350 men of the town’s federal garrison. Property owner Randall Pratt says a cannonball also was found when the property was restored in 1980. That cannonball, which had been shot into a wall, is in a county museum. Pratt plans to keep the latest find at the home.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The state’s greater sage grouse population has fallen more than 40% over the past three years, mirroring recent declines across the U.S. West for the bird species for which federal officials rejected protections in 2015. State wildlife officials estimate there were about 44,000 ground-dwelling sage grouse in Montana this spring. Sage grouse once numbered in the millions but have seen their range that stretches across portions of 11 states diminished by oil and gas drilling, wildfires, grazing and other pressures. Weather can affect populations from year to year, and wildlife officials say those short-term cycles are most directly responsible for the recent declines. Montana’s drop from almost 78,000 grouse in 2016 was traced to an extreme drought in eastern parts of the state in 2017, says Catherine Wightman with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government collected more tax revenue than expected in August. The Department of Revenue announced Friday that the state received a net total of $462 million last month, which is nearly 5% higher than its official forecast of $441 million. The department says net sales-and-use and miscellaneous taxes came in higher than expected, as did net corporate and individual income taxes. Net tax collections are also higher than expected in the current fiscal year that began July 1. The forecast was set in April by the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board. The board’s projections help lawmakers and the governor determine how much money they have available for the state budget.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An innkeeper selling tickets for campers this week in a tiny desert town is being threatened with legal action by the originator of the “Storm Area 51” internet hoax over the “Alienstock” name. A Las Vegas attorney representing 20-year-old Matty Roberts sent a cease-and-desist letter Thursday telling Little A’Le’Inn owner Connie West to pull the plug on events West says she’s still planning for Thursday through Sunday. West didn’t immediately respond Friday to telephone and email messages. She told the Las Vegas Review-Journal she’s still “full steam ahead” with vendors, merchandise and musical acts. Roberts broke with West last week and says he’ll appear at a party venue in downtown Las Vegas on Thursday – the night before the Life is Beautiful music and art festival begins a few blocks away.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State education officials are moving ahead with Gov. Chris Sununu’s plan to help students earn high school diplomas and college degrees at the same time, at no cost to their families. Sununu, a Republican, first announced his goal for the New Hampshire Career Academy program in January. Modeled after a privately funded partnership between Great Bay Community College and Spaulding High School in Rochester, the new statewide program also provides participants with guaranteed job interviews. Sununu signed an agreement Friday with the state’s education commissioner and chancellor of the community college system to set up the program. Commissioner Frank Edelblut said the program creates a new pathway for students, who will get career-ready educations and a head start in the job market.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The governor has signed a bill allowing the Golden Nugget casino to accept bets on most National Basketball Association games. Texas billionaire Tilman Fertitta owns the casino – and also owns the NBA’s Houston Rockets. When New Jersey lawmakers legalized sports betting last year, a provision in the law banned team owners from placing or accepting bets on any games involving their sport. It was directly aimed at the Golden Nugget and enacted over protests that Nevada regulators allow Fertitta’s casinos to take bets on pro basketball games as long as they don’t involve the Rockets. The bill Murphy signed Friday brings New Jersey in line with regulations in Nevada and Mississippi, which also allow Fertitta’s casinos to handle NBA bets that don’t involve the Rockets.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Health officials say the state had more suicides in 2018 than any other year in at least two decades. According to data provided by the state’s Department of Health, 535 people died by suicide last year. That a rate of 24.8 per 100,000 residents and represents a 6.7% increase over the state’s 2017 suicide rate. Mental health experts told the Albuquerque Journal the 2018 numbers represent the highest suicide rate on record in New Mexico since the state began consistently keeping track in 1999. According to an analysis released by the Violence Policy Center, New Mexico had the fourth-highest suicide rate in the nation in 2017 at 23.51 per 100,000 people. Authorities say there’s an association with firearm ownership and firearms use and deaths connected to suicide.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo says a multimillion-dollar initiative will restore aquatic habitats around the state. Cuomo announced the program Saturday as officials released thousands of juvenile shellfish at New York City’s Hudson River Park. The governor says the “Revive Mother Nature” initiative is the most aggressive in the country and will reintroduce millions of oysters to New York waterways. Cuomo also announced $2.8 million to restore marine habitat in New York Harbor and to expand the Soundview Park oyster reef in the Bronx River. Saturday’s event was part of an effort to create 4 acres of enhanced habitat off the Hudson River Park for 5 million to 10 million oysters. Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul says the program is designed to combat climate change and advance the state as a world-class fishing destination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPittsboro: Police officers and barricades were in place as people for and against the removal of a Confederate monument stood on opposite sides of the street Saturday. Media outlets reported demonstrations were helds near the Chatham County Courthouse, where the monument has stood for more than a century. Chatham’s commissioners voted 4-1 in August to ask a United Daughters of the Confederacy chapter to have a plan by Oct. 1 to remove the statute. The county let the UDC install the statute in 1907. Without a plan, the county will declare it a public trespass by Nov. 1, making it eligible for removal. Monument supporter Barry Isenhour said the statue respects American veterans, but opponent Robert Finch said it was installed to intimidate the black community.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A highly publicized North Dakota Air National Guard flight to bring an infant’s heart to a waiting transplant patient in California more than 30 years ago is set to be showcased. The flight of the F-4 Phantom, a supersonic fighter, took place in December 1986 after a Lear jet flown from California to Fargo to pick up the heart broke down in cold weather. The flight took place on emergency orders from North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, who died last year. The pilot, current North Dakota Air National Guard Brig. Gen. Bob Becklund, flew the golf ball-sized organ to Stanford Medical Center. KFGO radio reports that the heart recipient, now 33, lives in the San Francisco area. The “Heart Flight” display will be unveiled this month at the Fargo Air Museum.\n\nOhio\n\nSandusky: The state’s U.S. senators want Congress to rename a NASA research facility after astronaut Neil Armstrong. Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown introduced legislation Thursday to honor the Ohio native by renaming the NASA Plum Brook Station in Sandusky. Portman says he raised the idea with Armstrong in 2012, a year before the astronaut’s death. The senator says Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, wasn’t comfortable with the attention it would bring. Portman says he has since spoken with NASA and Armstrong’s family, and they support renaming the facility. Brown says it would be a fitting tribute given Armstrong’s contributions as a test pilot and astronaut.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: A public memorial is planned at Oklahoma State University to honor the late T. Boone Pickens, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to his alma mater during his lifetime. Pickens died Wednesday in Dallas at age 91. OSU says the university will honor Pickens on Sept. 25 at Gallagher-Iba Arena in Stillwater. Pickens said last month in his annual letter to Oklahoma State fans that he checked with the school and learned he had donated $652 million over the years, with much of it going to athletic facilities. The school’s football stadium was named for Pickens in 2003 after he made a $70 million donation, which included $20 million set aside for a stadium expansion. A funeral service is also planned for Thursday in Dallas, where Pickens lived.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The 2020 election season is officially underway in the state. Thursday marked the first day for major party or nonpartisan candidates to file declarations of candidacy with the secretary of state’s office. One of the top state races is for that role, secretary of state, the second-highest statewide office after the governor and currently held by a Republican. Filing their papers as Democratic candidates were Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who in 2018 unsuccessfully tried to unseat Rep. Greg Walden, who is from a U.S. congressional district that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016; and state Sen. Mark Hass. Secretary of State Bev Clarno urged Oregonians to run for an office. Her office said there have been few candidates in recent elections, which means voters have not had many options.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A new rule has gone into effect in the city requiring chain restaurants to post warning labels next to menu items that are high in salt. Warnings will be shown for any menu item that has more than 2,300 milligrams, which is the recommended sodium total for an entire day. Restaurants with 15 or more locations were required to post the warnings under the new regulation by Saturday. The legislation was signed by Mayor Jim Kenney last fall after City Council passed the requirement in 2018. Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley says the labels can help customers make healthier food choices. Officials say Philadelphia has one of the highest rates of hypertension and premature deaths due to heart disease. Eating too much sodium plays a big factor.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s congressional delegation says a federal infrastructure grant will help replace and upgrade 11 bridges on a busy stretch of Interstate 95. The delegation visited the Northbound Providence Viaduct on Friday to celebrate the $60.3 million from the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Grant Program. U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee member, helped design the program to meet Rhode Island’s need for funding for large infrastructure investments. The Rhode Island Democrat says a 55-year-old viaduct will be transformed into modern throughway. It carries about 220,000 vehicles daily. Construction is scheduled for late next year. Financing will come from several federal and state sources.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: This little piggy should have stayed home. The State reports that for the fourth time, Leroy – a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig – wandered over to Brennan Elementary School in Columbia, leading officials to slap McGregor Wallace with citations for owning a pig within city limits and having a fugitive pet. Wallace is scheduled for a court appearance in October. Wallace says Leroy is his emotional support animal meant to help him deal with PTSD from domestic trauma. Wallace says he got Leroy several months ago to replace a standard pig that grew too big. He says Leroy is clever and knows how to open the home’s gate when Wallace isn’t home. The pig also can open the refrigerator. The 7-month-old swine is now at Columbia’s animal shelter.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: An organization promoting the separation of church and state is putting up billboards in three cities to protest the state’s new law that requires all public schools to post the motto “In God We Trust” in a prominent location. The billboards from the Freedom From Religion Foundation show “In God We Trust” carved into Mount Rushmore and the four presidents saying, “There goes the neighborhood.” The drawing is from Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Steve Benson. The billboards will be up for a month in Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Pierre. The foundation’s president, Annie Gaylor, says its members are concerned about the law, which she says is misguided. Gaylor says the motto, adopted during the Cold War, is outdated and divisive.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The University of Tennessee’s marching band is jumping on the anti-bullying bandwagon. The band briefly wore a T-shirt based on a design by a boy who was teased at school over the design and then offered a scholarship at the university. On Thursday, Tennessee officials offered the fourth grader a four-year scholarship beginning in the fall of 2028 if he chooses to attend Tennessee and meets admission requirements. The boy’s story went viral last week after his teacher posted on Facebook that the student’s peers mocked a T-shirt he designed for his school’s “college colors” day. After the post gained attention, the University of Tennessee’s VolShop website created its own Tennessee shirt featuring the boy’s design. School officials say over 50,000 shirts have been presold. Proceeds benefit STOMP Out Bullying.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A federal judge has approved an agreement that will require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a recommendation by May 2021 on whether the lesser prairie chicken should be federally protected as a threatened or endangered species. The agreement was reached Thursday between the federal agency and three conservations groups: the Defenders of Wildlife, the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians. The groups sued the federal government in June to force it to make a designation for the lesser prairie chicken and its habitats. Once a designation is proposed, there will then be a public comment period followed by a final determination made later by Fish and Wildlife. The agency also could decide that no federal protections should be provided for the bird, which listed as threatened in 2014, but a federal court overturned the designation.\n\nUtah\n\nLayton: State Republican leaders refused Saturday to erase a bylaw to deny ballot spots for candidates who collect voter signatures instead of winning approval from the party’s caucus-convention system. The State Central Committee voted 68-40 to erase the bylaw, short of the two-thirds majority required for a bylaw change. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the bylaw threatened to keep Republican candidates off the 2018 ballot because of a state law allowing both paths. Then-Party Chairman Rob Anderson responded by declaring the bylaw illegal and refusing to oust any candidate, and Republican Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox had said then he’d certify candidates who used either qualifying method. Current party Chairman said Saturday that he won’t ignore the bylaw but that the party will do what’s necessary to get on the 2020 ballot.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Proverbs have been developed for centuries around the world, from “Strike while the iron is hot” to “Been there, done that.” They’re spread by writings, word of mouth and, nowadays, social media. The vast amount of them is evident in a new, unique library at the University of Vermont. It’s the collection of UVM Professor Wolfgang Mieder, thought to be the world’s premiere paroemiologist. The extensive library of nearly 9,000 volumes ranges from proverb collections including German, Chinese, Turkish and Hungarian to thousands of books and dissertations and includes Mieder’s own writings. Among his favorite proverbs is “Different strokes for different folks” because he says that “it tells you to realize that people have different priorities, different thoughts, different ideas.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia’s attorney general says couples planning to get married in the state will not have to disclose their race on their marriage application. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports clerks were notified of the change in an email late Friday, about a week after three couples filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state requirement. Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring wrote that circuit court clerks must ask people seeking a marriage license their race, but couples can decline to answer the question. Herring says clerks should issue a marriage license regardless of whether an applicant answers the question. The lawsuit says one county provided a list of more than 200 potential races to a couple who questioned the requirement. It included “American,” “Aryan,” “Moor” and “Mulatto.”\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state may seem ultraliberal, but voters in one of its deeply conservative areas have re-elected a Republican six times who thinks communists and atheists will destroy the U.S. Now Matt Shea faces a legislative investigation and calls for his resignation following media reports he was in a chat group discussing surveillance on progressives. Shea is also a major proponent of splitting Washington into two states, with Eastern Washington becoming the state of Liberty. The Army veteran hosts a weekly “Patriot Radio” show on the American Christian Network and on Facebook Live in 2017 complimented members of Team Rugged, a group that one member said provides special forces-type gun training for young men so they can “be effective in Christian warfare.” Shea didn’t respond to interview requests.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Education officials say they’ve found a problem with the state’s school system – many students aren’t showing up to class. The West Virginia Department of Education released a report Thursday saying that more than 38% of schools did not meet attendance standards in the 2018-2019 school year. In a statement, schools superintendent Steven Paine didn’t give a reason for the high level of absences but said he looks forward to working with counties and local school boards to address the problem. The report also says a fifth of students statewide are considered chronically absent, meaning they missed 18 or more days of the school year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A media company that owns television stations in the state is partnering with a longtime farm charity on a live 18-hour telethon to raise money for struggling farmers. Quincy Media and Farm Aid have scheduled the event for Friday. It will include anchors and reporters from WKOW in Madison, WAOW in Wausau, WXOW in La Crosse, WQOW in Eau Claire and KBJR in Superior. A news release says volunteers will be answering phones throughout the day collecting donations to provide support, emergency relief and other resources for family farmers in the region. Farm Aid’s annual music festival is scheduled for Saturday at Alpine Valley Theatre in East Troy. The lineup includes Willie Nelson & Family, Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds, Neil Young, John Mellencamp and Bonnie Raitt, among others.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Fifty years after 14 black football players were kicked off the University of Wyoming football team for considering a protest, eight of them returned to campus to commemorate the anniversary as the school takes another step toward reconciliation. University officials unveiled a plaque Friday at War Memorial Stadium commemorating the so-called Black 14. The event capped five days of ceremonies and discussions about the infamous dismissal of all the university’s black players in 1969. The players wanted to protest racism, but head coach Lloyd Eaton would have none of the idea – and was backed up by the university’s board of trustees and Gov. Stan Hathaway. He lit into them about coming from fatherless families and said they would only be accepted by traditionally black colleges if they weren’t at Wyoming, they said. The healing and reconciliation is not complete for some of the men who came back to campus this week. Some say they struggled for years after they were labeled as members of the Black 14.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/19/hospital-concert-serial-revisited-green-chile-pile-news-around-states/50753003/", "title": "Hospital concert, Serial revisited: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An inmate who authorities say escaped with the help of a jail supervisor who later killed herself shared nearly 1,000 phone calls with the woman before the breakout, news outlets report. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Casey White and Vicky White, who were not related, may have planned his escape over the phone, but authorities must listen to each of 949 calls before making a determination. Authorities have said the two were in a romantic relationship, and Singleton said at least some of the calls were sexual in nature. The phone calls occurred after Casey White was transferred from the Lauderdale County Jail to a state prison where he was held until being returned to Lauderdale County before the escape, the sheriff said. Casey White walked out of the jail in handcuffs in April accompanied by Vicky White, the assistant corrections director, prompting an 11-day search for the pair. On the day of the escape, Vicky White, 56, told co-workers she was driving the inmate to a mental health evaluation. The two were eventually discovered in Indiana, where Casey White was captured. Vicky White shot herself in the head moments before the man was arrested, authorities said. Casey White was charged with escape and murder in her death. The defense has filed documents suggesting Vicky White was in charge of the escape.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A powerful storm sweeping north through the Bering Strait on Saturday caused widespread flooding in several western Alaska coastal communities, knocking out power and sending residents fleeing for higher ground. The force of the water moved some homes off their foundations, and one house in Nome floated down a river until it got caught at a bridge. The potent storm – what remains of Typhoon Merbok – has been influencing weather patterns as far away as California. In Alaska, no injuries or deaths were immediately reported, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Officials had warned that some places could see their worst flooding in 50 years and that the high waters could take up to 14 hours to recede. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration during the day. The nearly 1,000-mile storm front has damaged roads and potentially other infrastructure, Dunleavy said at a Saturday evening news conference. Officials will evaluate any effects on water and sewer systems, seawalls, fuel storage areas, airports, and ports. Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives were already in Alaska before the storm, and Dunleavy said they will stay to help assess damage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Republican leaders of the Arizona Legislature will not try to defend a new law limiting up-close filming of police that has been blocked by a federal judge, a decision that essentially ends the fight over the contentious proposal. Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers both said they would not intervene in the case by the Friday deadline set by the federal judge when he temporarily blocked the new law from taking effect last week on First Amendment grounds. And the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. John Kavanagh, said Friday that he has been unable to find an outside group to defend the law, which was challenged by news media organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups will now ask that the law, which was set to take effect next week, be permanently blocked. Kavanagh said he will review U.S. District Judge John J. Tuchi’s ruling and see if he can craft a law that passes constitutional muster. He said the law is needed to keep people from distracting police trying to make an arrest, but Tuchi agreed with the challengers that it runs afoul of precedents that say the public and press have a right to film police doing their jobs. Tuchi noted there are already Arizona laws barring interfering with police and said singling out people for taking videos appears to be unconstitutional on its face.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, a Republican who is running for governor, was released from a hospital Saturday after undergoing surgery for thyroid cancer. “Following successful surgery on Friday to remove her thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes and in consultation with her physician, Sarah was discharged from an Arkansas hospital cancer-free,” said Sanders spokesperson Judd Deere. “She will spend the remaining portion of her recovery at home.” Deere told the Associated Press that Sanders, 40, planned to resume campaigning “soon,” but it was not known precisely when she would return. Sanders said Friday when announcing the surgery that a biopsy earlier this month revealed she had thyroid cancer. Dr. John R. Sims, a surgeon at CARTI Cancer Center in Little Rock who is one of Sanders’ doctors, said her cancer was a stage 1 papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer, and said she has an “excellent” prognosis. Sims said Sanders will need adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine and long-term continuing care. Sanders, who served as ex-President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman until 2019, is running against Democratic nominee Chris Jones. She is the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A new state law will help military service members who were discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies because of their sexual or gender identities to reestablish their eligibility for Veterans Affairs benefits, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday. “For decades, our bravest heroes, men and women who wore the uniforms of the armed services had to hide who they really were, and many were other than honorably discharged if their sexuality was discovered,” Newsom said in a statement after announcing he had signed the bill. Gays and lesbians were banned in the military until the 1993 approval of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the policy that allowed them to serve only if they did not openly acknowledge their sexual orientation. Rather than helping, advocates say, it created more problems. Repeal of the law was approved by Congress and then-President Barack Obama in late 2010 and took effect nine months later, allowing lesbian, gay and bisexual people to serve openly. The Department of Defense subsequently created a path for veterans who had been discharged under the policy to receive the full range of veterans’ benefits. “But many veterans sadly don’t know or can’t even access this important process,” Newsom said, adding that some have had to hire expensive legal counsel to navigate the process. “We’re taking steps to fix this.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Stricter air quality regulations are coming for northern Colorado businesses after the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday downgraded the area to a category for “severe” violators of ozone standards. Drivers may have to pay higher gas prices, too, because the reclassification prohibits the sale of conventional gasoline within one year. State environmental officials, however, believe they can achieve better air quality without needing to switch to the reformulated blend of gasoline the EPA requires, Colorado Air Pollution Control Division spokesperson Leah Schleifer said in a news release. Colorado has asked the EPA to reassess that requirement and consider the state’s alternative plan. The gasoline blend would raise gas prices 20-30 cents per gallon, AAA estimates, according to the Denver Post. The area includes a large swath of northern Colorado including Denver, Boulder, Greeley, Fort Collins and Loveland. Colorado estimates it will issue more stringent permits for 600 oil and gas facilities and about 100 more industrial sites, the news release said. The Colorado area was one of six areas to get downgraded by the EPA along with the Chicago area; Texas’ Dallas-Forth Worth and Houston areas; parts of Connecticut and the New York-New Jersey-Long Island area; and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians in Southern California.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who is on trial in Connecticut for calling the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre a hoax, continued Friday to describe the proceedings as a “kangaroo court” from his Infowars studio in Texas. Jones’ commentary became a focus of testimony on the fourth day of the trial, with a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families questioning a corporate representative for Jones’ Infowars brand about how seriously the company was taking the trial. The lawyer, Christopher Mattei, showed the jury a photo he said was of an Infowars webpage, depicting the judge in the trial with lasers shooting out of her eyes. “On a scale of one to 10, how seriously is Infowars taking this trial?” Mattei asked the corporate representative, Brittany Paz. “Ten. It’s serious to me,” Paz responded. The exchange occurred as Jones prepares to attend the trial in Waterbury this week and as the judge, Barbara Bellis, considers a request by the families’ lawyers to limit what Jones and his lawyer can say and argue in court. Jones is expected to testify, but it’s not clear yet when. “They are pretending to the world that it’s an actual trial, but I’m guilty when I get there, and I can’t say I’m innocent,” Jones said on his Infowars web show Friday. “Everybody fundamentally knows that’s a fraud.”\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: In future summers, the edges of the city’s boardwalk could have a new, larger look. Multiple plans are in the works to build hotels in Rehoboth Beach, one of Delaware’s most popular destinations that keeps getting busier. In the coming years, when beachgoers look back on the avenue from the sand, there will likely be more oceanfront balconies and windows than one-story shops. Two projects could shake up the end of the boardwalk. The longtime owner of the Candy Kitchen corner wants to build a 100-plus room building there in the image of a mid-20th-century hotel. Across the avenue, Grotto Pizza is taking over the former Dolle’s with plans for a restaurant and hotel. Elsewhere on Rehoboth Avenue, a motel is being renovated into a boutique hotel. A court battle will decide whether an office strip is replaced by another hotel.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local officials will consider legislation Tuesday to support migrants bused into the district from Texas and Arizona, WUSA-TV reports. The DC Council plans to vote on an emergency bill introduced by Councilmember Brianne Nadeau at the request of Mayor Muriel Bowser. The measure calls for the establishment of welcome and reception services and the provision of food, clothing, medical services, cash assistance and other necessities for migrants. But the proposal has some residents worried about unintended consequences. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless called the legislation a “poison apple” Thursday. LegalAidDC tweeted Friday that the council should reject the bill in its current form, saying it “will weaken basic protections that all unhoused individuals & families deserve when they seek help in the District.” The group also said in a statement that it is concerned about the “unchecked” powers it would give the mayor. The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network has repeatedly taken issue with Bowser’s claims that the overwhelming majority of migrants do not want to stay in D.C. once they arrive, saying that takes focus off the need to support those migrants who do want to stay in the capital. Local nonprofits say almost all the people arriving are asylum-seekers with pending immigration cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Attorneys for school shooter Nikolas Cruz asked for the judge in his murder case to remove herself Friday, two days after she scolded them when they abruptly rested their case after calling only a fraction of their expected witnesses. The Broward Public Defender’s Office said in a motion that Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer held a long-standing animosity toward lead defense lawyer Melisa McNeill. The motion cited Florida’s Judicial Code of Conduct that states a judge shall disqualify himself or herself if the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party’s lawyer. Defense attorneys said Scherer’s repeated improper and unjustified attacks on the defense counsel undermine the public’s confidence in the judicial system and have also caused Cruz to fear that he will not receive a fair trial. Prosecutors said in a response that Scherer has been respectful to both sides. Cruz’s attorneys had told the judge and prosecutors they would be calling 80 witnesses but surprisingly rested at the start of Wednesday’s court session after calling only about 25 of them. Scherer called the decision without warning to her or the prosecution “the most uncalled for, unprofessional way to try a case.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor, is launching an intensive effort to get out the vote by urging potential supporters to cast in-person ballots the first week of early voting as she tries to navigate the state’s new election laws. The strategy, outlined to the Associated Press by Abrams’ top aides, is a shift from 2018, when she spent generously in her first gubernatorial bid to encourage voters to use mail ballots. It also moves away from Democrats’ pandemic-era emphasis on mail voting, a push that delivered Georgia’s electoral votes to President Joe Biden and helped Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff win concurrent U.S. Senate runoffs to give Democrats control of Capitol Hill. Republicans, including Abrams’ opponent, Gov. Brian Kemp, answered in 2021 with sweeping election changes that, among other provisions, dramatically curtailed drop boxes for mail ballots, added wrinkles to mail ballot applications and ballot return forms, and made it easier to challenge an individual voter’s eligibility. But it also expanded in-person voting. “It’s self-evident we have to have a big early vote in-person,” said Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo, arguing the new mail ballot procedures make it risky for Democrats to rely too heavily on that option. “What’s not self-evident,” Groh-Wargo said, “is how the hell you do that.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A business owner and a Maui County official have been charged with bribery and public corruption involving more than $2 million in cash and gifts, federal court documents unsealed Thursday showed. Milton Choy, the owner of a Honolulu company that provides wastewater services and supplies, is accused of bribing Stewart Olani Stant, who was a wastewater manager and then director of the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. Choy provided Stant with cash deposited directly to Stant’s bank accounts, plus gambling chips and trips to Las Vegas, U.S. Attorney for Hawaii Clare Connors said at a news conference. In return, prosecutors said Choy received upward of $19 million in business contracts from the county. Messages left for Stant on various social media sites were not immediately returned. Listed phone numbers had been disconnected. Choy took responsibility for his actions and admitted everything he did to federal investigators, said his attorney Michael Green. “He gave unprotected statements – that’s where you don’t ask for a lawyer, and you you sit down with the agents and tell them what you did. And he did that,” Green said. The two will be arraigned in federal court Monday.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Huckleberries are highly sought after, but the coveted mountain fruit was difficult to find across much of northern Idaho and eastern Washington this year. Pickers were able to locate some productive plants and patches, but they frequently encountered healthy bushes that had few berries or none at all, The Lewiston Tribune reports. “In general terms, this is not a very good year,” said Wayne Kasworm, a grizzly bear biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who tracks huckleberry production in the Selkirk, Cabinet and Yaak mountain ranges. With a changing climate, scientists like him increasingly are tracking huckleberries that are an important food source for grizzly bears and other wildlife and coveted by people as well. Native Americans have harvested huckleberries for thousands of years and continue to do so today. The small berries with a pleasant mix of sweet and tart are targeted by recreational and commercial pickers as well. They are used to make pies, ice cream and other desserts, as well as being added to pancakes, milkshakes and smoothies. Grizzlies depend on the berries as a key food source. “The other thing I’ve learned in the process of doing this work is just how many other species rely on huckleberries. It’s really a keystone species,” said Tabitah Graves, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Two police officers face felony charges for allegedly shooting and seriously wounding an unarmed man during a July shootout on the city’s southwest side that also wounded a second man, authorities said Friday. Sgt. Christopher Liakopoulos, 43, and Officer Ruben Reynoso, 42, of the Chicago Police Department, have been charged with one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated discharge of a firearm and official misconduct, said Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. She said the officers were relieved of their police powers Thursday before they turned themselves in to authorities. Foxx said both officers “are being charged with having fired their shots” that wounded an unarmed 23-year-old man – identified separately Friday through a civil court filing as Miguel Medina – on July 22 in the city’s Pilsen neighborhood. That man has since recovered and is cooperating with the investigation, she said. “The victim who was shot and injured in this incident was not in possession of a weapon, nor did he fire a weapon at these two officers,” Foxx said during a news conference. The officers were heading to a morning training course and were in plain clothes at the time of the shooting. They weren’t wearing their police body cameras because they were going to training, Assistant State’s Attorney Alyssa Janicki said. Prosecutors later obtained surveillance video from the area.\n\nIndiana\n\nElkhart: A staffer for U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski was trying to pass a flatbed truck on a northern Indiana highway last month when the SUV in which they were traveling crashed into an oncoming car, killing Walorski and three other people, police said Friday. A witness traveling behind the SUV told investigators it sped up, crossed the centerline of the two-lane highway as it neared the truck, and pulled into the path of the other car when the crash happened about 12:30 p.m. Aug. 3, according to the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office. Airbag control module data from the SUV driven by Zachery Potts, 27, who was Walorski’s district director, showed it was going 77 mph at the time of the crash on a rural stretch of Indiana 19 near the town of Wakarusa, the office said. “All of the evidence and information gathered is consistent with someone attempting to pass another vehicle on a two-lane roadway,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Walorski, 58, was a Republican first elected in 2012 and was seeking reelection this year to a sixth term. The sheriff’s office released statements from the county coroner ruling the deaths of Walorski and the others as accidental from injuries suffered in the crash. Investigators blamed the crash on Potts for “driving left of center with a contributing factor of excessive speed.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Iowa Confluence Water Trails project received a big boost Friday when Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will allocate $7million in federal funding for its construction. Though backers of the project aim to develop outdoor attractions across 150 miles of waterways in central Iowa, the governor allocated the latest round of funding to one of the project’s focal points: the Scott Avenue dam development at the confluence of the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers in downtown Des Moines. Developers plan to turn the low-head dam into two whitewater features for rafting, kayaking, canoeing, tubing and surfing. They also expect to add trails, a plaza and fishing areas. The latest grant represents about 13% of the $53.5 million budget for the development. The water trails comprise one of two Des Moines projects that received federal money through the state’s Destination Iowa program Friday, with the governor allocating $1 million to renovation of the Val Air Ballroom in West Des Moines. Reynolds also awarded Council Bluffs and the Southwest Iowa Nonprofit for Collaborative Impact $4.9 million for a joint plan to redevelop a stretch of that city’s Missouri River frontage.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hundreds of thousands of dollars of COVID-19 relief funds spent by state and local governments could have violated federal rules or were ill-advised, a report released Wednesday by the Legislature’s nonpartisan auditing office showed. The audit comes as state officials are still grappling with how to spend millions in federal pandemic relief, with the process to dole out the money coming under fire over transparency concerns. Of the $18 million in expenditures by county governments, nonprofits and businesses reviewed by the Division of Legislative Post Audit, officials flagged $1.1 million in spending as ill-advised, with an additional $264,000 considered wasteful or excessive. And while 85% of funding was considered to be clearly allowable under federal guidelines, it was unclear whether $2.7 million in spending was acceptable. Another $48,000 was deemed to likely not be allowed. Potentially problematic expenditures ranged from a recipient of a small-business grant who conducted a festival to the purchase of electronic signs, sports equipment and office supplies by local governments. In Bourbon County, officials gave a vendor $450,000 to start a grocery store in a part of Fort Scott considered to be a food desert – only to see the store close after a few months.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: When 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on his fellow students during a morning prayer meeting in 1997, school shootings were not yet a part of the national consciousness. The carnage that left three students dead and five more injured at Heath High School, near Paducah, ended when Carneal put down his weapon, and the principal walked him to the school office – a scene that seems unimaginable today. Also stretching today’s imagination: Carneal’s life sentence guaranteed an opportunity for parole after 25 years, the maximum sentence permissible at the time given his age. A quarter-century later, Carneal is 39 with a parole hearing this week that comes at a very different time in American life – after Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Parkland, after Uvalde. Today, police officers and metal detectors are an accepted presence in many schools, and even kindergartners are drilled to prepare for active shooters. “Twenty-five years seemed like so long, so far away,” Missy Jenkins Smith recalls thinking at the time of the sentencing. Jenkins Smith was 15 when she was shot by Carneal, someone she considered a friend. The bullet left her paralyzed, and she uses a wheelchair to get around. The shooting at Heath High School took place Dec. 1, 1997, less than four months before a shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Carneal’s parole hearing is scheduled to start Monday with testimony from those injured in the shooting and close relatives of those who were killed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families and businesses in Tangipahoa Parish are a step closer to getting paid for flood damages in 1983 caused by the construction of Interstate 12. A $95 million payment was approved Friday by the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, The Advocate reports. The committee’s action allows the money to be moved to an escrow account and eventually to the 1,246 victims, 400 families and 96 businesses harmed. “This is the single final payment that resolves the entirety of the lawsuit,” Commissioner of Administration Jay Dardenne said. When those payments will be made is unclear. The state earlier put $6 million into an account for the plaintiffs, which means the total settlement is $101 million, the newspaper reports. Dardenne said he is confident a district judge will approve the payment, which will then allow a special master to decide how much individuals and businesses are owed. Rains on April 6, 1983, flooded about 6,000 homes in the Baton Rouge area. In Tangipahoa Parish, east of Baton Rouge, the newly opened I-12 acted like a large levee and resulted in water from the Tangipahoa River being diverted into homes and businesses. In 1999, a jury decided that the I-12 bridge over the river did not change elevation crossing the river as it should have and awarded plaintiffs in $92 million. However, nothing happened for years while the state Department of Transportation and Development appealed, and the Legislature declined to approve the award.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Wild blueberries were smaller this summer in the barrens of Maine, where the sweet crop expanse dominates treeless plains of sandy soil. Some of the lowbush berries started shriveling or ripened too quickly, hitting the dry ground before harvest season began. The drought-stressed plants were speeding up their production process. Lobster and blueberries go hand-in-hand when people think of Maine. The state’s iconic wild blueberries are one of only three fruits native to North America, and they’re loaded with twice the antioxidants of their ordinary crop equivalent. There are 36,000 acres of commercial wild blueberry land in the state, and the crop’s total value reaches tens of millions of dollars each year. But climate change-induced drought is threatening the superfood fruit, particularly the native lowbush species in Maine where irrigation systems are few and far between. With climate change creating a world of extremes in New England – longer and more frequent dry spells punctuated by deluges of rain within shorter periods of time – the region’s blueberry farmers face the task of adapting. “In every season, there are all of these different weather events that can happen that can increase or decrease the crop,” said Lily Calderwood, extension wild blueberry specialist and assistant professor of horticulture at the University of Maine. “Every year is a new adventure. And because of climate change, we have seasonal droughts that occur more frequently now.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A court hearing has been set for Monday to consider a request from prosecutors to vacate the 2000 murder conviction of Adnan Syed, whose case was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.” Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn scheduled the hearing for 2 p.m., The Baltimore Sun reports. The development comes after Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion Wednesday saying a lengthy investigation conducted with the defense had uncovered new evidence that could undermine the conviction of Syed. He has served more than 20 years in prison for the strangling of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, who was 18 when she was killed in 1999. Her body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed, 42, has maintained his innocence for decades and captured the attention of millions in 2014 when the debut season of the “Serial” podcast focused on the case and raised doubts about some of the evidence, including cellphone tower data. Prosecutors said in their motion that they weren’t asserting that Syed is innocent but that they lacked confidence “in the integrity of the conviction” and recommended he be released on his own recognizance or bail. “We believe that keeping Mr. Syed detained as we continue to investigate the case with everything that we know now, when we do not have confidence in results of the first trial, would be unjust,” State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Taxpayers can look forward to seeing a return of some of their tax dollars this year, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. The announcement came after the state auditor’s office certified that tax revenues exceeded allowable revenues under a little-noticed 1986 law that kicked in due to the state’s soaring tax collections. As a result, taxpayers are on tap to claim a share of more than $2.9 billion dollars. Those eligible will receive refunds automatically as a check sent through the mail or via direct deposit. Distribution of refunds is expected to begin in November. In general, eligible taxpayers will receive a credit in the form of a refund that is approximately 13% of their Massachusetts Tax Year 2021 personal income tax liability, officials said. To be eligible, individuals must have filed a 2021 state tax return on or before Oct. 17, 2022. An individual’s credit may be reduced due to unpaid taxes, unpaid child support or certain other debts.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Friday signed off on a fund for more than 1,000 people who said they were sexually assaulted by a University of Michigan doctor – an order that allows victims to start collecting a portion of a $490 million settlement negotiated with the school. “The University of Michigan offers its heartfelt apology for the abuse perpetrated by the late Robert Anderson. We hope this settlement helps the healing process for survivors,” said Paul Brown, chairman of the school’s governing board. Anderson died in 2008 after working at the university for nearly 40 years. He was director of the campus Health Service and a physician for multiple sports teams, including football. Former athletes, students and others who had no connection to the university – mostly men – said they were molested by Anderson during routine physicals or other visits. The settlement was announced in January, but the final details took months to wrap up. The university said the deal recently got approval from 98% of claimants. “It’s been a long road,” said Richard Schulte, a lead negotiator for Anderson’s victims. “I’m very happy for the survivors and glad I could get it across the finish line.” Six percent, or $30 million, of the settlement will be set aside for people who step forward later with claims.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Democratic Gov. Tim Walz agreed Saturday to two additional debates against Scott Jensen, following complaints from the Republican challenger that Walz is ducking him. The candidates will meet for an Oct. 18 debate sponsored by a group of television stations that includes KEYC in Mankato, KTTC in Rochester, KBJR in Duluth and KXJB in Fargo, North Dakota. Another debate is scheduled for Oct. 28 on Minnesota Public Radio. Jensen called Walz’s announcement “a classic case of too little, too late” because early voting begins this week. Jensen, a former state senator, and Walz previously debated at Farmfest, a yearly agricultural expo near Redwood Falls. The Walz campaign said that holding three debates matches the number of forums “that were held in the U.S. Senate elections won by Amy Klobuchar in 2018 and Tina Smith in both 2018 and 2020.” Both debates will be streamed online, according to Walz’s campaign.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city’s water crisis isn’t over, even if its boil-water advisory was lifted Thursday. While the state stopped handing out free bottled water at sites around Jackson on Saturday night, the city said water pressure still hasn’t been fully restored, and state health officials said lead in some pipes remains so worrisome that pregnant women and young children should still use bottled water. “The water that’s coming out of my kitchen sink smells like fresh sewage … as soon as you turn it on, it hits you right in the face. It’s horrible,” resident and mother Carey Wooten said earlier this month. “I’ve tried to give one of my dogs the water, but when she smells it, she won’t even touch it. She walks away from it.” Wooten said Friday that the liquid flowing into her kitchen sink still smells like sewage, but not as bad as before, and she’s glad she won’t have to run to distribution sites before their bottled water supplies run out each day. Other residents said Friday that their water remains too discolored to count on, so now they’ll have to rely on water distribution by community-run charities or buy water again themselves, adding insult to injury. Residents, politicians, experts and activists say systemic racism is the root cause of the crisis. White flight that began accelerating around 1980, a decade after the city’s schools began integrating, left less revenue to maintain infrastructure. Middle-class Black people then moved out to escape urban decay and rising crime. State and federal spending never made up the difference.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A convicted felon accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people while dressed as Batman villain the Joker was sentenced Friday to 60 days in jail, with credit for several months served after his arrest. Jeremy Garnier, 51, of University City, was sentenced after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of making a terrorist threat. Prosecutors reduced the charge from a felony for the March 2020 incident. Garnier told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he never intended to make a threat and pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor to avoid many more months in jail. “I was talking like the Joker,” Garnier said Saturday in an interview. “I was in character. Everybody knew that it was a joke and that I had no intentions of following through with a threat.” Garnier told the Post-Dispatch he served more than 20 years in federal and state prison for robbing a credit union in the 1980s and for other felonies in order to support his crack habit. He said he is now sober and wants to use his platform to raise awareness about the opioid epidemic. He said he has learned another hard lesson. “Think before you act,” he said. “Your actions have repercussions. No matter how trivial and joking I thought it was, people took it seriously.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has determined three laws passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature to regulate activities on university campuses are unconstitutional, including one that sought to ban transgender women from participating on female collegiate sports teams. Montana’s Constitution gives the state board of regents full authority to govern public college campuses and precludes state lawmakers from imposing their own rules, District Court Judge Rienne McElyea said in a ruling issued Wednesday that was emailed to attorneys in the case Friday. Her ruling noted that the Montana Supreme Court recently affirmed the same conclusion in a challenge to a bill that sought to allow more people to carry guns on campuses. The ruling was the second judicial setback of the week on laws passed by Montana’s 2021 Legislature that affected transgender residents. A different state judge on Thursday clarified that he temporarily blocked health officials from enforcing a state rule that would prevent transgender people from changing the gender on their birth certificate. In response, the Republican-run state on Thursday said it would defy the order. The ruling comes amid a heated national debate over whether transgender women should be allowed to participate in female sports at the high school and collegiate level.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by two Omaha women who sought to have both their names listed as parents on their children’s birth certificates, saying the request conflicts with state law. Lancaster County District Judge Ryan Post said in his ruling last month dismissing the lawsuit that state law requires birth certificates to acknowledge paternity. Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services policy also requires that parents listed on birth certificates be the biological parents of the child, he said. The Nebraska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state last year on behalf of Erin Porterfield and Kristin Williams. They said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services repeatedly denied their request to amend one son’s birth certificate in their effort to get full legal recognition as parents of both their sons – one born to each woman conceived through a sperm donor. Porterfield and Williams were in a romantic partnership from 2000 to 2013 – two years before same-sex marriage was legalized in Nebraska. Porterfield gave birth to their first son in 2002, and Williams gave birth to their second son in 2005 before their romantic relationship ended in 2013. But both women continue to share parenting duties. In their lawsuit, the women said that state officials treat unmarried, same-sex couples differently than unmarried, opposite-sex couples, violating their due process and equal protection rights.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The GOP’s nominee for governor said Thursday that he would fight against a national abortion ban if Congress were to pass one. “It’s the vote of the people within the state of Nevada, and I will support that,” Joe Lombardo, who is generally anti-abortion, told reporters while campaigning. “That is an issue that doesn’t need to be in politics.” Nevada voters codified the right to abortion up to 24 weeks into pregnancy into law in a 1990 referendum. Any order to further restrict abortion would have to come from a vote of the people, not the Legislature, unlike in many other states. Last week U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., proposed a near-total abortion ban after 15 weeks. The legislation undermined many GOP candidates’ arguments this summer that the future of abortion rights in the U.S. would be decided by individual states. Lombardo, who is the Clark County sheriff, has long maintained that as governor he would respect the 1990 vote, though he is Catholic and holds anti-abortion views. Still, a nationwide abortion ban would supersede Nevada law, and it is unclear how Lombardo could fight one. Republican April Becker, a candidate in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, opposes abortion except for instances of rape and incest. But she told NBC News last week that she would vote against a nationwide abortion ban, calling it unconstitutional for Congress to regulate abortion.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legislator on Friday proposed extending the March deadline to close the state’s troubled youth detention center amid concerns that the current timeline would endanger public safety. Debate over the future of the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester began years ago but has come to a boil amid horrific sexual abuse allegations. Frustrated with spending $13 million a year to operate a 144-bed facility for about a dozen teens, lawmakers set a mandatory March 1 closing date. But the center’s fate remains unclear after lawmakers were unable to agree this year on how to replace it. Rep. Jess Edwards, R-Auburn, said Friday that he plans to introduce two bills for the legislative session that starts in January: one to extend the deadline by three months and another calling for a new 12- to 14-bed facility, with room for 18 if necessary. He told Deputy Health Commissioner Lori Weaver he is concerned about what will happen March 1 without such measures. “The Legislature let you down,” he said. “We just could not reach agreement, so we gave you nothing to go on in terms of money to plan and design it.” Weaver said she can’t predict the center’s population six months in advance, but based on the current situation, “there would be a definite impact on public safety” if the deadline arrived without further guidance.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Township: In 2020, as saxophonist Steve Barlotta was recovering from a near-fatal bout with COVID-19 that included 24 days on a ventilator, the Jackson resident made a promise to everyone who treated him at CentraState Medical Center. “He was like, ‘I’m going to play a concert out in the parking lot for everyone,” said Shannon Lenahan, a neurologic clinical specialist who helped Barlotta bounce back from near-total paralysis. “We were like, ‘OK,’ People say stuff like that all the time, and they go home and get sidetracked.” Barlotta did not get sidetracked. On Wednesday, he and his band Sensational Soul Cruisers performed a 90-minute concert on the hospital’s campus as a thank-you to the doctors, nurses and rehab therapists who saved his life and restored his health. “To see it actually happen and come to fruition was really special,” Lenahan said. “He didn’t forget. He was a little emotional, and it was a little emotional for us to be able to say, ‘This is why we did it.’ ” Barlotta, who has played alongside Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Gary U.S. Bonds and the Monkees, capped the show with two numbers that came straight from the heart: “You’re All I Need to Get By” and “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” both made famous by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s green chile season is in full swing as the aroma of fresh roasted peppers permeates the air, but growers and exporters in Mexico are just as busy, and that’s causing a crunch at the international border. Authorities said last Monday that agricultural inspectors with U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been processing dozens of chile imports daily at the port of entry in Columbus, New Mexico. They’re looking for any pests in the shipments that could affect domestic production in the state where green chile is a signature crop and a cultural icon. “Chile is a huge crop for farmers in New Mexico, so it is important that CBP agriculture specialists identify and stop any dangerous pests from making it into the state and potentially spreading,” acting Columbus Port Director Sam Jimenez said in a statement. As part of “Operation Hot Chile,” Jimenez said agricultural inspectors are being assigned to Columbus from other locations to help with the increased traffic. The inspectors will process around 100 chile shipments a day during the busiest part of the season. Imports have grown significantly each season, with inspectors seeing a nearly 25% jump since 2016. Officials are expecting continued growth this year. Despite more imports, New Mexico farmers are seeing higher yields from their crops, and the state’s reputation for growing what many have anointed as “the best green chile in the world” is expanding, said Travis Day, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Yeshiva University has abruptly suspended student club activity in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last week that ordered the school to recognize – for now – an LGBTQ student group. In an email to students, university officials said Friday that the school would “hold off on all undergraduate club activities while it immediately takes steps to follow the roadmap provided by the U.S. Supreme Court to protect YU’s religious freedom.” On Wednesday, the high court cleared the way for the LGBTQ group, YU Pride Alliance, to gain official recognition from the Jewish university in New York. The undergraduate group describes itself as “a supportive space for all students, of all sexual orientations and gender identities, to feel respected, visible, and represented.” By a 5-4 vote Wednesday, the justices lifted a temporary hold on a court order that requires Yeshiva University to recognize the group, even as a legal fight continues in New York courts. Two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, sided with the court’s three liberal justices to form a majority. The disagreement among the justices appears to be mostly about procedure, and the case is being closely watched by other faith-based institutions.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s hospitals and hospital systems on Friday unveiled an offer that could shake up stalled negotiations to pass legislation that would expand Medicaid to cover hundreds of thousands of low-income adults. The North Carolina Healthcare Association said the offer sent to Republican legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper also contained reforms to some state laws that require regulatory approval before certain medical buildings can be constructed or services offered in a region. Senate leader Phil Berger this summer accused the association of refusing to compromise on “certificate of need” rules. Changes to these rules were contained in the Senate version of an expansion measure approved in June. Berger said they were needed to increase the supply of medical services that would be needed to treat the growing Medicaid population. Cooper, a big expansion proponent, told reporters last week that it would make sense for hospitals to negotiate with Berger on those rules, which hospitals contend help community facilities that disproportionately serve the uninsured or underinsured remain open. “Our board of trustees has made the difficult decision to propose certificate of need law reforms,” board chair Dr. Roxie Wells said in a news release.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state would spend up to $80 million over the next two years to address child care under a proposal pitched Tuesday by Gov. Doug Burgum. The GOP-led Legislature meets again in January and will consider the plan that also includes a child care tax credit for low- to middle-income families, expansion of child care assistance, and matching money for businesses that offer their employees child care. The second-term Republican governor said the lack of available and affordable child care for families contributes to workforce shortages that have hamstrung the state’s economy. Adequate and affordable child care helps attract and retain companies in the state, he said. North Dakota has “tens of thousands” of unfilled jobs, and many families “have to make a choice to work and pay for child care or not work at all,” Burgum said. North Dakota has more than 64,000 children under the age of 5 in some 45,000 households across the state, Burgum said. The state’s more than 800 licensed child care providers employ more than 6,000 people, he said. “In spite of that … working families are experiencing a child care crisis,” Burgum said. “There are more children than there are slots.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s efforts to curb gerrymandering are not working, and voters must once again amend the Ohio Constitution to take politics completely out of the process, the retiring chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Thursday. The current redistricting commission, created by constitutional amendment in 2015, has had no discernible effect on gerrymandering, and as a result voters this fall will elect candidates based on unconstitutional legislative districts, Republican Maureen O’Connor said in her annual and final state of the judiciary speech. A new amendment must create a commission that restricts partisan politics by prohibiting elected officials from serving, O’Connor said. The current Ohio Redistricting Commission consists of elected lawmakers and state officeholders, including the governor, and has a 5-2 Republican majority. Instead, commission members must consist of “sensible people who are not driven by politics but rather by what’s fair,” O’Connor said. “Fair representation and justice.” O’Connor’s remarks echoed the position she took in January when the court first ruled – in a 4-3 decision with O’Connor in the majority – that initial maps drawn by the commission were unconstitutional. The court made similar rulings four more times before a federal court ordered Ohio to use the third set of Statehouse maps approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission, maps the state Supreme Court had also found unconstitutional.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An embattled jail is facing even more criticism after an inmate was able to leave the booking area unsupervised and raped a handcuffed female inmate who was awaiting release, according to charges filed Thursday. The victim “was handcuffed to a bar attached to a wall in the receiving area of the Oklahoma County jail and unable to escape” when Donta Ramone Thomas, 44, was able to remove her pants and rape her July 19, according to charging documents submitted by District Attorney David Prater. Jail surveillance video of the incident showed Thomas ignored orders to stand with his back to the wall and wait for other inmates to be processed after he was booked into jail on assault charges. “Thomas disregarded these instructions and walked away from the area,” according to an affidavit. “He walked down the hallway toward the old medical screening area, where (the victim) was sitting, handcuffed to a bar.” The incident is the latest at the jail, where a nine-member trust took over the jail from the sheriff’s office in 2020, tasked with managing its operation and finances. Oklahoma County’s Board of Commissioners unanimously approved of the trust the previous year. “This is another example of the jail trust failing to protect those who they are responsible to care for,” Prater said.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A 23-acre property near Willamette Falls has a new name, based on its old name. Formerly known as the Blue Heron Paper Mill, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde has renamed the site Tumwata Village in recognition of the native name for the falls, tumwata, and the ancestors who called the site home. “As a name, Tumwata Village represents the Grand Ronde tribe’s connection to the falls, as well as the sacred lands and practices of our ancestors,” said Cheryle A. Kennedy, chairwoman of the Grand Ronde tribe and descendant of the Clackamas people. The Grand Ronde tribe’s connection to the falls goes back to creation, Kennedy said. Pre-European contact, the land was home to her ancestors, including the village of the Clowewalla– the Willamette band of Tumwaters. It was also the Kosh-Huk-shix Village of Clackamas people. They lived and used the area to hunt and fish before the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 led to the forcible removal of the tribal populations from the falls area to the Grand Ronde reservation. Even after removal, people still went back to fish and gather at the falls. “The connection has remained,” Kennedy said. The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde began the process of acquiring the land around the falls at least two decades ago, Kennedy said. The purchase was finalized in 2019.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More than 1.7 million public and private school students in the state will be able to get breakfast for free under a plan that will begin next month and run through the school year, officials announced. The $21.5 million plan will be paid for with money from the previous year’s School Food Services General Fund appropriation. Schools that participate in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs will receive support from the program. The pandemic-era federal aid that made school meals available for free to all public school students ended this past school year, despite a push in Congress to extend it. In Pennsylvania, officials say breakfast consumption under the free meals program increased by 16%, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Nationwide, other states have adopted legislation to provide free meals regardless of income level.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Short-term rentals such as those offered through websites like Airbnb and VRBO could be severely restricted as town officials contemplate an ordinance to limit them to owner-occupied units in just a few zoning districts. The Warwick Planning Board, in front of a nearly empty meeting room Wednesday night, voted to ask the planning staff who helped draft the ordinance to make a recommendation to the City Council, with instructions to ensure that rules around accessory dwelling units conform to a new state law. Planner Tom Kravitz said he was directed to get an opinion on the ordinance from the board. However, aside from asking Kravitz to issue a recommendation and worries about the state law change to accessory dwelling units, the Planning Board members did not discuss the regulation. Kravitz said the owner-occupied regulation should reduce the chances for complaints around parking and noise, citing the example of Newport, which now requires owners to occupy the units they are renting. Making the owner live in or adjacent to the property being rented provides oversight over guests, he said. The proposed zoning change cites short-term rentals as a source of “noise, congestion, pollution and disorderly behavior” and of generally disturbing the peace.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Lawsuits filed to stop the removal of memorials to Confederate leaders and a pro-slavery congressman have been dropped. The Post and Courier reports that the American Heritage Association helped fund one of the lawsuits. It had been filed by descendants of John C. Calhoun, a former congressman and vice president who died before the Civil War, opposing the city of Charleston’s removal of Calhoun’s statue. The association also had filed a lawsuit opposing the removal of a Robert E. Lee Memorial Highway marker from the campus of a charter school in Charleston and the renaming of an auditorium that had been named after Christopher Memminger, a treasury secretary of the Confederacy. The stone-and-metal monument to Lee was removed in July 2021 and placed in storage. The city made a deal with the South Carolina State Museum to take the statue of Calhoun. Both suits had been filed in state court. The highway marker and auditorium lawsuit was dropped Sept. 13. The Calhoun lawsuit was dropped Sept. 15, the newspaper reports. AHA President Brett Barry declined to comment on the status of the Calhoun case, despite the descendants’ request for dismissal. “Charleston monuments are an integral part of the city’s historical and artistic American landscape,” Barry told The Post and Courier.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s corn harvest may not have much juice this year. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service’s latest crop production report, the state’s crop yield is estimated at 138 bushels per acre – a number nowhere near the record-breaking harvest of 2020, when farmers gathered a staggering 162 bushels per acre. In the northeastern counties, springtime floods and incessant rainfall oversaturated the region with moisture. The precipitation flooded some fields, preventing producers from being able to plant their seeds during a critical planting window. “Things did turn drier up in the northeast corner over the last two weeks, but, really, the question is whether that corn actually got planted,” said DaNita Murray, executive director of South Dakota Corn Growers Association. John Horter is one producer who received a mixed bag from the wet spring. On his farm in western Day County, he called the rains “timely” and the weather conditions “almost perfect.” The past two weeks of heat, he said, are drying out his fields just in time for the harvest. But there’s a lot of lost potential: The corn in his fields looks good, he said, but the rains flooded what’s traditionally his highest yielding areas of the farm, which kept him from being able to plant those acres.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The police officers who fatally shot a man walking on an interstate will not face criminal charges, a district attorney announced Friday. A lawsuit filed last week by the widow of Landon Eastep alleges that law enforcement used excessive force and should be liable for his death in Nashville. Chelesy Eastep argued it was unfair to expect her husband to act reasonably with multiple guns pointed at him. However, Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk said in a statement that after reviewing the case, Eastep’s actions “were designed to cause officers to perceive an immediate threat.” Eastep’s encounter with police began with a state trooper checking on him as he sat on a guardrail along Interstate 65 the afternoon of Jan. 27. After a brief interaction, Eastep pulled a box cutter, and the trooper called for backup, police said. Many other officers arrived, blocking traffic along the normally bustling travel corridor in both directions as a helicopter circle overhead. Authorities pleaded with Eastep, 37, to surrender while they kept their guns drawn. “During this encounter with law enforcement officers, Mr. Eastep became emotional, began sobbing, and reportedly started cutting his wrists a few times with a box cutter from his pocket,” Chelesy Eastep’s lawsuit says.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge on Friday expanded her order blocking the state from investigating families of transgender youth who have received gender-affirming medical care. Judge Amy Clark Meachum issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from investigating members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over the medical care. The group has more than 600 members in Texas. Meachum in July issued an order blocking the investigations against two families of transgender children who had sued the state. Meachum’s order Friday also blocked the state from investigating the family of another teen who had sued, though the family said after the lawsuit was filed that they learned the investigation against them had been dropped. Meachum wrote that without the order, the families would “suffer probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim.” The ruling was the latest against the state’s efforts to label gender-affirming care as child abuse. The Texas Supreme Court in May allowed the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse while also ruling in favor of one family who was among the first contacted by child welfare officials following the order by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Gov. Spencer Cox took to Twitter on Saturday night to call out the behavior of University of Oregon fans during a game against Brigham Young University. UO’s student section, The Pit Crew, has since issued a public apology, as have university officials. In a video posted to Twitter, Oregon fans in the school’s student section can be seen chanting “(expletive) the Mormons.” BYU is a private university sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Cox retweeted the video, calling it “religious bigotry alive and celebrated in Oregon.” Other videos and photos of attendees who also allegedly participated in the chanting were posted on Twitter. The Pit Crew on Twitter issued an apology Saturday night, saying its members “do not condone or support any hateful speech directed towards one’s religion and are ashamed of those who participated.” In contrast, BYU kicked off the game by honoring former Oregon tight end Spencer Webb before the game, running onto the field with a flag bearing Webb’s No. 18. Webb, who would’ve been a junior this season, died in July during an outing at Triangle Lake.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Labor is getting involved after finding some businesses in the state have failed to protect teenage workers. There has been a national trend of increased child-labor law violations, which had been steadily decreasing until 2015, when the numbers began to tick up again. The Department of Labor’s Northern New England office said it “has taken strong enforcement actions” including conducting investigations and engaging in outreach in order to decrease federal labor violations at businesses across the region. A news release from the labor department cited examples of violations in the food service industry this year at McDonald’s and Dunkin’ franchises. At nine New England McDonald’s locations run by Coughlin Inc., 142 workers ages 14 and 15 worked more hours than federal law permits. And an investigation found 18 workers ages 14 and 15 illegally operated an oven or a fryer without a device to automatically raise and lower the basket. Two minors were burned, and the company paid $109,125 in penalties. Vermont Donut Enterprises LLC and related companies running 12 Dunkin’ franchise locations were also cited for not adhering to restrictions on 14- and 15-year-old workers. There were 44 violations involving hours worked and 17 violations for operating high-speed ovens. A 16-year-old was illegally allowed to drive a vehicle between two locations. Six minors received burns, and the company was fined $15,737 in civil penalties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has rewritten the state’s model policies for the treatment of transgender students, issuing guidance for school divisions that would roll back some accommodations and tighten parental notification requirements. The new model policies from the Virginia Department of Education, which were posted online Friday, say students’ participation in certain school programming and use of school facilities like bathrooms or locker rooms should be based on their biological sex, with modifications offered only to the extent required under federal law. The policies also say that students who are minors must be referred to by the name and pronouns in their official records, unless a parent approves the use of something else. Regarding parental notification, the guidelines say school divisions may not encourage teachers to conceal information about a student’s gender from his or her parents. And they say parents must be given an opportunity to object before counseling services pertaining to gender are offered. The guidance is subject to a 30-day public comment period that opens later this month. Then, in accordance with a 2020 state law, local school boards must adopt policies that are “consistent with” the department’s but may be “more comprehensive,” the document says.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: After 21/ 2 years of inspection and repair work, authorities have reopened the West Seattle Bridge, the main route between the peninsula of West Seattle and the rest of the city. The Seattle Department of Transportation announced that the bridge had reopened Saturday night, even as crews continued removing some barricades and detour signs. Officials closed the span in March 2020 after cracks were found to be growing rapidly. The repair work included 60 miles of steel cables that form the new backbone of the bridge. Each of the cables was anchored into new specialized concrete blocks woven into the structure. The department said crews also installed a network of reinforced carbon fiber sheets wrapped inside and outside the bridge walls and injected 240 gallons of epoxy into cracked concrete. Authorities say the bridge is now much stronger and more resilient to seasonal temperature changes and will last for decades to come. Engineers will continue to monitor the bridge using cameras, sensors and inspections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Friday signed into law a ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, making West Virginia the second state to enact a law prohibiting the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court’s June ruling overturning its constitutional protection. The bill will go into effect immediately, except for the criminal penalties, which will go into effect in 90 days, Justice said. He described the legislation on Twitter as “a bill that protects life.” “I said from the beginning that if WV legislators brought me a bill that protected life and included reasonable and logical exceptions I would sign it, and that’s what I did today,” he said. The ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest victims until eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for those under the age of 18. Victims must report their assault to law enforcement 48 hours before the procedure. Minors can report to the police or a doctor, who then must tell police. The bill requires abortions to be performed by a physician at a hospital – a provision that at least two Republican lawmakers have said was intended to shut down abortions at the Women’s Health Center, which has provided the procedure since 1976 and was the state’s sole abortion clinic. Providers who perform illegal abortions can face up to 10 years in prison.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A local alderman whose name appears on the membership rolls of a far-right extremist group has resigned, citing safety concerns for his family. Madison Alderman Gary Halverson was among hundreds of elected officials, military members and law enforcement officers who were on a leaked list of Oath Keepers members, the group that’s accused of playing a key role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Halverson said his resignation follows some vandalism at his house, which he said has triggered symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder for his wife. “For anyone who has PTSD, or lived with someone who does, knows that when something happens that is triggering, it is absolutely terrifying, and that terror can last for days or weeks or longer,” Halverson said in a statement. He did not specify what damage was done to his property or how it might be linked to his Oath Keepers membership. Halverson was elected in April 2021 and had one year left in his term. He said he joined the Oath Keepers in mid-2020 without vetting the organization. “I thought I joined an organization that welcomed veterans who cared about our democracy,” Halverson said earlier this month. “I was misled and I terminated the membership two months later in Aug 2020.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State transportation officials have asked the Biden administration to ease proposed federal requirements to receive funding toward a network of electric vehicle chargers. EVs account for 0.1% of vehicle registrations in Wyoming, and state Department of Transportation Director Luke Reiner told federal officials that it would be “irresponsible and illogical” to spend now on requirements that include four charging ports at stations every 50 miles. It will be more than 20 years before there’s enough EV adoption in the state to worry about lines at a four-port station, Reiner said. So instead of concentrating solely on major highway corridors, Reiner said, the federal money should also be used in areas away from interstates that attract lots of tourists, such as Yellowstone National Park. “Most of our EVs will be tourist traffic,” Reiner said Wednesday. “The idea is if you’re a nice lady from Iowa with an electric car, and you want to get to Yellowstone, we want to get you there. ... We want to make sure these stations are in populated areas so there’s more chance of success.” Wyoming asked for exceptions from the mileage requirement for 11 stretches of highway. Federal officials have not yet responded, Reiner said, and the state’s plan is still pending.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/21/starving-manatees-referee-protections-alligator-float-news-around-states/119069454/", "title": "Starving manatees, referee protections, alligator float: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state plans to be the third to carry out an execution during the COVID-19 pandemic and the only prison system to reduce the number of news media witnesses to a single reporter. The Alabama Department of Corrections said because of COVID-19 precautions, only one reporter, a representative of the Associated Press, will be allowed to witness Thursday’s lethal injection of Willie B. Smith. The state in the past allowed five media witnesses, although the number of outlets sending reporters is sometimes less than that. Only the federal government, Texas and Missouri have carried out executions since the pandemic began last year. None reduced the number of media witnesses to a single reporter. There have been 19 executions carried out since April 2020, according to a database maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center. All of them were attended by multiple reporters, with the exception of one lethal injection in Texas, where the prison system neglected to notify reporters it was time to carry out the punishment. Paige Windsor, the executive editor of the Montgomery Advertiser, said the news organization disagreed “that the press restrictions were necessary for COVID mitigation, especially once a vaccine was available.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state lawmaker was cited for driving with an open can of beer in his vehicle that another lawmaker said was actually his. Republican Sen. Josh Revak plans to challenge the $220 ticket, which was issued in August, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks, said the beer was his. Revak, R-Republican, said he used alcohol heavily after returning injured from the Iraq War but hasn’t had alcohol in seven years. He has helped others in recovery programs and said he is proud of his sobriety. A citation “could cause harm to me because I’m in programs of recovery. I’ve been in recovery a long time trying to help other people. Having a violation like this might discredit me, and especially in my job, it certainly doesn’t help, so I felt like it was kind of an injustice,” Revak said. Kawasaki was riding with Revak from Anchorage to a fishing event on the Kenai Peninsula on Aug. 18. Kawasaki the night before had stayed at the home of another legislator and in the morning left with a partially full can of beer. “I didn’t want to waste it, didn’t want to dump it,” Kawasaki said. Both said Revak didn’t realize it was a beer rather than another beverage. Revak is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 27. But the trooper who wrote the citation was recently arrested on child sexual abuse charges.\n\nArizona\n\nChandler: The Gila River Indian Community’s gambling operation has begun construction of its fourth casino in metro Phoenix. Gila River Hotels & Casinos on Monday held a groundbreaking ceremony for the planned Santan Mountain casino, which will be located in the Chandler area near Gilbert Road and Hunt Highway. The 160-acre, $150 million project will feature more than 850 slots and table games, a BetMGM Sportsbook and multiple dining options for guests. New games will include mini baccarat, craps and roulette. Two of the tribe’s current casinos also are located in the Chandler area. The other is on the metro area’s southwestern rim. The tribe announced the new casino project last summer after signing a revised gambling compact with the state. Gambling expansion legislation approved by state lawmakers at Gov. Doug Ducey’s behest included provisions allowing tribes to increase their gambling offerings, both in number of casinos and types of gambling games. Arizona currently has 24 tribal casinos statewide, including seven in metro Phoenix. The legislation will allow up to 11 more statewide, include four in metro Phoenix and one in the Tucson area.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday backed off plans to call the Legislature back to the Capitol next week to take up income tax cuts as he continued negotiating with lawmakers on how much to reduce. The Republican governor delayed the special session he expected to call for the tax cut proposal, which he said would cost the state $321 million a year once fully implemented in 2023. Hutchinson did not say when he planned to convene the majority-Republican Legislature, though he said hoped to do so before Thanksgiving. “We need more time,” he told reporters. Hutchinson’s proposal calls for reducing the state’s top income tax rate from 5.9% to 5.3% by 2023. It also calls for increasing a tax credit for those making less than $22,900 and for combining the low- and middle-income tax tables. But Hutchinson has faced calls from some fellow Republicans to go further with his tax cut plans and to also include reductions in the corporate income tax rate. Legislative leaders said delaying the special session will give lawmakers the governor more time to work out a deal. Hutchinson ran on a promise to cut income taxes and is pushing for the reduction as the state’s revenue has beat expectations despite the COVID-19 pandemic. But Democrats caution about going too far with reductions.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The city will give out cash awards of up to $100,000 for information about the ringleaders of high-level auto burglaries, in yet another push to battle crime in a city marked by attention-grabbing vehicle smash-and-grabs, home break-ins and retail theft. The cash rewards would come from private donors in the tourism and hospitality industry, Mayor London Breed said at a Tuesday news conference where she was joined by San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott. The fund has about $225,000 so far and will pay for information leading to the arrest and conviction of “high-level leaders of organized auto burglary fencing operations,” according to a statement from Breed’s office. Authorities have said they believe fewer than a dozen auto burglary crews are responsible for most of the smash-and-grabs in the San Francisco Bay Area. But news reports and viral video of break-ins have reinforced the perception of San Francisco as lawless and lenient. Last month, Breed and Scott announced the city would dedicate more police to combat retail shoplifting and make reporting of shoplifting cases easier. Breed’s office said auto burglaries reported to police have declined since 2017, when the city recorded about 31,400. More than 15,000 auto burglaries have been reported this year, but 2021 is on track to fall below the nearly 26,000 in 2019.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state judge was removed from his leadership position after being charged with felony menacing Saturday. Judge Mark Thompson, chief judge for the 5th Judicial District, is accused of using a real or simulated weapon in the alleged July 25 menacing incident, which was investigated by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, according to limited online court records. The case was listed as suppressed from public view, and documents detailing the allegations against Thompson were not available. In a court filing, prosecutors requested the secrecy because Thompson is a public official and “prominent member” of the community, The Denver Post reports. “The release at this time of any of the documents of record in this matter could result in disclosure of information that could result in destruction, or secreting evidence and tampering with identified and unidentified witnesses, which could jeopardize the ongoing investigation and/or interfere with the rights of the defendant, including irreversible harm to reputation, and the defendant’s and the People’s right to a fair trial,” the prosecutors wrote. Judge Paul Dunkelman granted the request in a one-line order Saturday. Thompson is on planned paid time off and will resume his duties as a judge when he returns, judicial branch spokesperson Rob McCallum said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A state legislator who works as an aide to the West Haven City Council was arrested Tuesday by the FBI amid scrutiny of the city’s spending of federal pandemic relief money, officials said. The arrest of Rep. Michael DiMassa, a Democrat, was confirmed by Tom Carson, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Connecticut. DiMassa’s arrest affidavit was sealed. Last week, Mayor Nancy Rossi posted a video on the city’s YouTube page saying she had come across several large expenditures that might be fraudulent and had requested a forensic investigation of the city’s spending of federal pandemic relief funds. West Haven’s share of the $2.2 trillion in funding from the CARES Act has been more than $1.15 million so far, according to the state Office of Policy and Management. Rossi, who is also a certified public accountant, last week acknowledged using some relief funding to pay City Hall employees overtime for working on pandemic-related tasks but said that is a proper use of the money. A message was left seeking comment with the mayor. Upon the news of DiMassa’s arrest, Speaker of the House Matt Ritter and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas announced they were immediately removing DiMassa from all committee and leadership assignments.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Prosecutors want a judge to make state Auditor Kathy McGuiness accept a public defender or pay for her own defense against criminal corruption charges, according to a Monday filing in New Castle County Superior Court. The filing is a response to McGuiness’ Friday request that a judge allow her private attorney, McCarter & English partner Steve Wood, to represent her at rate of $550 an hour paid for by the public. It sets up in a conflict in which Superior Court President Judge Jan Jurden will need to decide whether to allow Wood to continue to represent McGuiness at private law firm rates paid by the state or whether McGuiness must accept representation from the public defender’s office if she does not want to pay a private attorney. Having pleaded not guilty, McGuiness is in the early stages of defending herself against two felony and multiple public corruption misdemeanors charged by prosecutors in the Delaware Department of Justice – a locally unprecedented indictment of a sitting, statewide-elected official that accuses McGuiness of rigging state contracts to avoid scrutiny and hiring her daughter in a do-nothing job. A Democrat, former Rehoboth Beach commissioner and pharmacist, McGuiness is paid $112,000 a year as auditor and, as a private citizen, likely would not qualify for representation paid for by the public. But Delaware law allows public officials sued or criminally indicted on charges related to their state work to be represented in court by a state-provided attorney.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and manufacturer Kawasaki have known for years about problems with the wheel assemblies in the transit system’s newest $2 million rail cars, WUSA-TV reports. One of those 7000 series rail cars came off the track Oct. 12, and while no one was killed or critically injured, the National Transportation Safety Board said the incident in the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, could have been “catastrophic.” “We are fortunate that no fatalities or serious injuries occurred as a result of any of these derailments, but the potential for fatalities and serious injuries, was significant,” NTSB Board Chairman Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference Monday morning at the safety agency’s Washington headquarters. “This could have resulted in a catastrophic event.” The D.C. Metrorail Safety Commission ordered Metro to pull nearly 60% of its rail fleet from service Monday after its safety oversight board found a recurring problem with the axles on the Metro’s newest railcars, the agency said. WMATA said the remaining 40 Metro trains would run every 30 minutes. In a release Monday, WMATA said reduced service is expected to last through at least Sunday. Passengers reported waits of as long as an hour during Monday morning’s rush.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Manatees have starved to death by the hundreds along Florida’s eastern coast because algae blooms and contaminants are killing the seagrass the beloved sea mammals eat, a wildlife official told a state House committee Tuesday. Seagrass has been decimated in the 156-mile-long Indian River Lagoon and neighboring areas. The aquatic plant thrives in clear, sandy water, but murkier water because of the algae and pollutants has made it harder for seagrass to survive, said Melissa Tucker, director of the Division of Habitat and Species Conservation at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Our statewide death count from all sources has been higher than it’s ever been reported before,” Tucker told the House State Affairs Committee. “This is a starvation issue. There’s not enough seagrasses that are available to the manatees.” Officials noticed a sharp rise in manatee deaths from December through May, when the sea cows congregate in warm waters. During that period, 677 manatees died, when typically only 156 die, Tucker said. While manatee mortality leveled out after May, when the mammals extend their range in summer and fall, the state has already recorded 968 manatee deaths in 2021, with more than two months left in the year. The previous annual high was 830 deaths in 2013, Tucker said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCovington: One worker was killed and two seriously injured when part of a bridge collapsed into a river during early demolition work, officials said. The three workers fell into the river Tuesday evening from the Access Road bridge on Interstate 20 in Newton County, east of Atlanta, news outlets report. About 21/ 2 hours after the accident, the Newton County Sheriff’s Office reported that one worker had died. The subcontractors were sawing when the accident occurred, the Georgia Department of Transportation said. A 500-ton crane began removing a truck, excavator and other equipment from the Yellow River accident site Wednesday morning, the Transportation Department said on Facebook. Work started Monday, and authorities had said they expected it to take nine months.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Police officers and officials with the state’s public school system discriminated against a disabled Black child by handcuffing, arresting and interrogating the 10-year-old girl for a “run-of-the-mill” dispute between children, the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii said. The ACLU sent a letter Monday to the Honolulu Police Department, the state Department of Education and the state attorney general’s office demanding the statewide school district make policy changes, including forbidding staff from calling police on a student unless the student presents an imminent threat of significant harm to someone. Honowai Elementary officials called police to the Waipahu school in 2020 because the girl allegedly drew an offensive sketch of a student who was bullying her, according to the ACLU letter. The parent of another child wanted to press charges. The girl’s mother went to the school and was falsely imprisoned when school staff and police prevented her leaving two rooms to which she was confined, the letter said. The mother “expressed some concern about being African American in an encounter with the police” and was worried about her daughter’s safety “in light of the police presence given the high rate of police violence against Black people, and the discriminatory disciplining of Black girls in schools,” the letter said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials on Tuesday rejected a plan to raise grazing fees on state-managed land, costing K-12 public schools more than $530,000 annually. The Idaho Land Board voted 2-2 to defeat the proposal, with Republican Superintendent of Public Instruction Sherri Ybarra voting against the plan, citing concerns by ranchers who said drought was hurting their businesses. “I think, like in education, teachers are the experts, and I believe ranchers are the experts,” Ybarra said. The move to stick with the current grazing fee formula appears to call into question whether the state’s top statewide elected officials are meeting their constitutional mandate as Land Board members to maximize profit from state lands over the long term. The current grazing rate formula not only doesn’t raise fees but also cuts them. The formula has been in place since 1993, leading to concern that it’s outdated and that ranchers aren’t paying their fair share. Grazing rates on private land in the state have nearly doubled since then, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Rates on state-owned land have lagged, dropping from about 50% of what private landowners charge to about 38%. The new grazing formula would have put it back to 50%, while the existing formula drops it to about 37%.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Metra is restoring service on all train lines to pre-pandemic levels and won’t raise fares next year in hopes more and more riders will return to using the suburban Chicago commuter rail service. Metra approved a new, $900 million operating budget for 2022 on Wednesday. It assumes Metra will start 2022 with ridership at about 25% of pre-pandemic levels and will grow to about 35% by the end of the year. “After nearly two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about how and when things will return to normal,” said Metra CEO and Executive Director Jim Derwinski. He said the most responsible approach is to use cautious assumptions about the growth in ridership while simultaneously ramping up service so Metra is ready when passengers are. The budget projects Metra will bring in about $146 million from fares and other system-generated revenue. The agency also is using about $300 million in federal pandemic relief funding. Metra is introducing a new $6 day pass, which will give passengers unlimited travel among any three zones. It will be sold as part of a one-year pilot program and will replace the current $10 day pass, which provides unlimited travel across all zones.\n\nIndiana\n\nHammond: A Gary man is suing northwest Indiana police more than a year after he alleged that officers pepper-sprayed and knelt on him when they encountered him near a protest over George Floyd’s death. Randall Smith’s lawsuit, filed Sept. 21 in U.S. District Court in Hammond, names Lake County Sheriff Oscar Martinez and county police Officer Jay Cruz as defendants and seeks damages “for deprivation of his civil rights.” The federal lawsuit comes more than a year after Smith filed a tort claim notice in July 2020 seeking $700,000 in damages from the Lake County Sheriff’s Department and the county’s commissioners. That claim, a precursor to a possible lawsuit, said Smith was watching a protest May 31, 2020, near Southlake Mall in Merrillville that was spurred by George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody when some officers “forced demonstrators” from a parking lot. Smith’s attorney, James Hortsman, said Smith did not participate in the protest. An officer then “aggressively approached” Smith and “got in his face telling him to leave,” the tort claim states. But as Smith turned to leave, the same officer “pushed him from behind, and several officers took him to the ground,” even though he wasn’t resisting, leaving him with a chipped tooth and other injuries, it alleges.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s privatized Medicaid system has illegally denied services or care to program recipients, and both private insurance companies managing the system have violated terms of their contracts with the state, according to a state audit released Wednesday. Auditor Rob Sand released a report from his investigation that examined a six-year period from 2013 through 2019. He said his investigators found a massive increase in illegal denials of care by managed care organizations under the system. “What this means is that privatized Medicaid is less likely to treat Iowans in accordance with the law. It means that the Medicaid MCO’s that we have contracted with are not upholding their end of the bargain,” Sand said. The head of Iowa’s Medicaid program responded within minutes of the audit’s release, rejecting its conclusions and arguing Sand was making an “apples to oranges comparison” that mischaracterized the program. Former Republican Gov. Terry Branstad in 2016 abruptly shifted Iowa’s Medicaid program from management by the Iowa Department of Human Services to private insurers. His successor, current GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds, has continued to support privatization amid complaints that service has suffered, that payments to service providers have been delayed at times and that promised savings never materialized.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Real estate values in the capital city have been appreciating “at their fastest pace ever,” a report says. Home prices in Topeka are anticipated to end this year having increased by 8.3% and rise by 4.5% next year, according to the 2022 Kansas Housing Markets Forecast Series published this month by the Wichita State University Center for Real Estate. Appreciation figures are even stronger statewide, with anticipated increases of 10.5% this year and 7.6% next year, the study said. “The supply of homes available for sale remains near historic lows,” Stan Longhofer, the center’s director, said in a news release. “Although bidding wars may not be as intense as they were earlier this year, it will continue to be a sellers’ market across most market segments.” Still, longtime Topeka Realtor Helen Crow questioned Tuesday whether the figures used to reach those conclusions may have been skewed by factors brought about by COVID-19. The pandemic has created a situation in which “the wealthier people are buying homes, and the people who are not as wealthy are not,” she said. A disproportionate number of upper-value homes have consequently been sold in the city since early last year, perhaps artificially inflating the median sales value of homes in this community, Crow said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A convicted drug dealer who was a target of the police raids that brought officers to Breonna Taylor’s home has been offered probation for a long list of drug crimes. Louisville police secured a slew of no-knock warrants on the night of March 13, 2020, aimed at breaking up a drug-dealing operation involving Jamarcus Glover. One of the five warrants sent police to the home of Taylor, Glover’s former girlfriend. Officers went to her home, broke down the door and opened fire after Taylor’s boyfriend fired a shot at them. The fatal shooting of the 26-year-old Black woman sparked months of national protests and prompted the city of Louisville to pay Taylor’s family $12 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit. Louisville prosecutors recently recommended probation for Glover, who was facing a litany of drug-related charges, WDRB-TV reports. He will also be allowed to move out of state. Sam Aguiar, an attorney who represented Taylor’s family in the wrongful death lawsuit, said the plea deal “validates” that Glover was not a drug kingpin requiring several late-night police raids. Last year, Glover was offered a plea deal by prosecutors that would have forced him to implicate Taylor in criminal activity. That offer listed Taylor as a co-defendant in illegal activities. Glover declined the offer.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will introduce an alligator-themed float celebrating its music, food and culture at the 95th Annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, who oversees state tourism efforts, announced the float plans Tuesday. “When it comes to parading, there is one thing Louisiana knows how to do and that’s throwing a party on wheels aboard the biggest float we can build,” Nungesser, a Republican, said in a statement. The Thanksgiving Day parade, scheduled for Nov. 25, airs live across the country from 9 a.m. to noon. Nungesser said the float will be used to promote Louisiana and encourage travelers to visit the state. The “Celebration Gator” float includes a multicolored replication of a French Quarter street view and will include people dressed in baby gator costumes and a team of stilt walkers. “The Macy’s Parade is thrilled to welcome this awe-inspiring and colorful float to our lineup,” Jordan Dabby, producer of the parade, said in the statement released by Nungesser’s office.\n\nMaine\n\nFalmouth: A police department is destroying a cache of weapons that’s going to be melted down to be transformed into peaceful products. Several dozen guns that were seized or turned in were rendered inoperable in the parking lot of the Falmouth Police Department on Saturday. They’ll be melted down and converted into a trademarked steel called Humanium Metal. “Every unwanted gun that we permanently remove from circulation is a win,” Falmouth Police Chief John Kilbride said in a statement. “That’s one less tragedy for a person, family and community.” The event marked the U.S. launch by a Swedish development partner that’s marketing Humanium Metal. The product is being used in a number of products including watches, jewelry and art. Over the next year, the Swedish organization IM aims to partner in at least five major cities with local law enforcement, gun-safety advocacy groups and others seeking to address gun-related violence.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Conservation efforts for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed have been bolstered by a $10million grant. According to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the 49 individual grants will generate $12 million in matching contributions for a total conservation impact of more than $22 million. “The Chesapeake Bay is a natural treasure for Maryland, the country and the world,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. “It’s also a fact the health of the economy and our overall public health depends on a healthy bay. The awards cover different areas and differ in size and scope, but all of them are essential to protecting our bay.” Van Hollen added that federal resources were key to multiplying the initial amount awarded to the various organizations. The grant is from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Environmental Protection Agency and the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city declared addiction and homelessness a public health emergency Tuesday – a move that will help it clear a sprawling homeless camp at the epicenter of the city’s opioid crisis. Officials said they will get those dependent on opioids into treatment and permanent shelter after removing about 150 tents at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, an area commonly known as Mass and Cass, said the city’s chief of health and human services, Marty Martinez. The area, home to numerous methadone clinics and social services, has long been a haven for crime and illegal drug sales and use, often in the open. The tents will not disappear overnight, acting Mayor Kim Janey said. “Folks are looking for a magic moment where, ‘poof,’ everything is gone,” she said. “That is not how addiction works. It requires ongoing outreach to individuals. It requires work between the city, the state, and other partners to make sure that there are alternatives.” Officials stressed that the city is not criminalizing homelessness, and no one will be forcibly removed. They said people who live in tents will be given advanced notice and offered treatment or a shelter bed.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The operator of an oil pipeline said it temporarily shut down Line 5 on Tuesday after protesters warned the company that they planned to turn an emergency valve. Video posted on social media showed someone with a hard hat and a wrench inside a fenced area in Tuscola County, 90 miles north of Detroit. A man outside the fence sang and played an electric guitar. A sign warned against trespassing and said the property belonged to Enbridge Energy. “We respect the rights of others to express their views on the energy we all use, but today’s pipeline tampering incident involving Enbridge was not a lawful protest. It was a criminal activity that put people and the environment at risk,” said Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy. He said the pipeline’s flow was temporarily stopped from a control center “out of an abundance of caution to protect communities, first responders and the protesters.” Line 5 moves about 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily between Wisconsin and Ontario, traversing parts of northern Michigan and Wisconsin. A roughly 4-mile segment divides into two pipes that cross the Straits of Mackinac, which connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats, say Line 5 is a threat to the Great Lakes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state will offer $200 gift cards and a shot at five $100,000 scholarships as incentives for students ages 12-17 to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday. Young people who start and complete their vaccine series over the next six weeks will be eligible for the Visa gift cards. But all Minnesotans ages 12-17 who’ve completed their vaccine series anytime by mid-December are eligible for the scholarships, which will be good at any public or private nonprofit school in the state. The five drawings will be conducted weekly starting Nov. 15. “We’re launching this program to help reward teens for doing their part by getting fully vaccinated and keeping our schools, community, and state safe,” Walz said in a statement. Registration opens Nov. 9 on the state’s Kids Deserve a Shot website. The state is trying to drive up vaccination rates among adolescents, who are the state’s least-vaccinated eligible age group. Only 50% of Minnesotans ages 12-15 and less than 60% of those ages 16-17 are fully vaccinated. But the coronavirus is spreading fastest in Minnesota among young people. The federal government is preparing to authorize vaccines for children as young as 5.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The capital city dumped more than 6 billion gallons of partly treated sewage into a river in 2020, seven years after signing a federal court agreement to clean up its act, court records show. The records also show sewer overflows in Jackson released more than 523,000 gallons of untreated waste into the environment last year, WLBT-TV reports. The city had made “only limited progress” toward some requirements in a 2013 agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and had not begun work toward other “crucial” goals, according to an August status report. Jackson has a deadline of late 2030 to meet terms of the consent decree, which was announced in November 2012 and became final in March 2013. Jackson is negotiating with the EPA to amend the order, with EPA and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality to assess the city’s financial condition and evaluate its proposed changes, the station reports. The city, which agreed to spend about $400 million to comply with state and federal water laws, now will need nearly $960 million to do so, it said in the report. The untreated sewage in 2020 came from 376 overflows throughout the collection system. Eleven forbidden bypasses at a wastewater treatment plant discharged partly treated wastewater into the Pearl River.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Help for roughly 100,000 teachers whose Social Security numbers were made vulnerable in a massive state data breach could cost Missouri as much as $50 million, the governor’s office confirmed Tuesday. The estimate includes the cost of credit monitoring and a call center to help affected teachers. Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s spokeswoman on Tuesday confirmed reports from state House budget officials that explained the $50 million price tag. The information was publicized by Democratic House lawmakers. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch broke the news about the security flaw last week. The newspaper said it discovered the vulnerability in a web application that allowed the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. Parson, who has deflected his administration’s responsibility for the breach and instead cast blame on the newspaper for identifying the issue and warning the education department about it, last week said the breach “may cost Missouri taxpayers as much as $50 million and divert workers and resources from other state agencies.” Parson declined to answer questions after slamming the Post-Dispatch in a livestreamed press conference last week.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Three public officials threatened hospital doctors after they refused to treat a COVID-19 patient with ivermectin, a drug to treat parasites that is not federally approved for use in battling the respiratory disease, officials of St. Peter’s Health said. “These officials have no medical training or experience, yet they were insisting our providers give treatment for COVID-19 that are not authorized, clinically approved or within the guidelines established by the FDA and the CDC,” hospital spokesperson Andrea Groom wrote in an email to the Montana State News Bureau on Monday. “In addition, they threatened to use their position of power to force our doctors and nurses to provide this care.” The hospital did not name the elected officials, but Republican Attorney General Austin Knudsen’s office confirmed that he participated in a conference call with hospital executives last week after having sent a Montana Highway Patrol trooper to the hospital to talk with the family of the patient. The event unfolded when a Helena woman in her 80s was hospitalized and wanted to be treated with ivermectin. It has been used in other countries, including India and Brazil, and some studies on its effectiveness are underway. Its manufacturer, Merck, has said there is no indication the drug is safe or effective against COVID-19.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific and its labor unions are suing each other to determine whether the railroad has the authority to require its employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The unions argue the Omaha-based railroad should have negotiated with them before announcing it would require all employees to get the shots. The railroad contends in its own lawsuit that it believes it has the authority to require the vaccines under its existing contracts because it can set standards for when employees are fit for duty. Union Pacific announced this month that it would require all employees to be vaccinated by Dec. 8 to comply with an executive order President Joe Biden issued requiring all federal contractors to have their employees vaccinated. The railroad is also offering its union employees a $300 bonus if they get the shots. Nonunion employees at the railroad are being offered a half-day of vacation if they get vaccinated. On the same day the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division union filed its lawsuit against the railroad, Union Pacific filed its own lawsuit Friday against SMART-TD and two other unions that objected to the vaccination mandate to force the issue.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Officials say enough money has been raised through donations to start work to rename the city’s main airport after former U.S. Sen. Harry Reid. The Clark County Commission earlier this year approved the renaming of McCarran International Airport to Harry Reid International Airport but with the stipulation that no taxpayer money be used. Donations for the renaming have passed the $4.2 million threshold needed to carry out the first phase, which largely consists of signage outside the airport and approaching it, officials said Monday. However, no actual timetable was announced for the start of work, and officials will next meet with various government agencies to firm up plans. “It allows us to change the name officially,” Commissioner Tick Segerblom said. An additional $2.8 million is needed for two remaining phases for signage inside the airport and for other changes such as stationery, letterhead, business cards and concessionaire-related needs. Reid, a Democrat and the former Senate majority leader, retired from the Senate in 2016 after serving 30 years. The renaming was spurred by the late Sen. Patrick Pat McCarran’s anti-immigrant and antisemitic views.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group of 25 health providers and advocacy organizations is asking legislative leaders to once again allow remote public access to the Legislature during the upcoming 2022 session. “As you often remind us, the State House is the people’s house, and public input and the right to know are critical components of New Hampshire’s legislative process,” the organizations wrote in a letter sent Monday to House Speaker Sherman Packard and Senate President Chuck Morse. “Yet, with the COVID-19 pandemic still raging throughout our state, individuals would have to put their own health, and that of their families, friends, neighbors, and communities, at risk in order to attend and testify in-person at legislative committee hearings, meetings, and sessions.” The groups said the last legislative session showed videoconferencing “effectively provides safe and secure access to legislative proceedings to citizens, health care providers and advocates all across New Hampshire.” Among the signers of the letter are the Disability Rights Center-N.H.; NAMI New Hampshire (the National Alliance on Mental Illness); New Futures; New Hampshire Legal Assistance; the New Hampshire Medical Society; and the New Hampshire Public Health Association.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday ordered that all new state contracts include language requiring workers to get COVID-19 vaccines or undergo regular coronavirus testing. Murphy, a Democrat seeking reelection this year, said the order will be prospective and affect only new contracts, extensions or renewals. He said he couldn’t specify how many state contractors would be affected but estimated it would be in the “hundreds or thousands.” “We must ensure that everyone providing service to the people of New Jersey – whether they are direct or contracted employees – is being held to the same public health and safety standards,” he said. The order mirrors other executive orders Murphy has signed requiring shots or tests for state workers and school employees. The requirement comes just days after a deadline for school and state workers to be vaccinated or undergo coronavirus testing kicked in, but Murphy said he didn’t have details about how many chose which option.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Local governments across the state are seeking to renew property taxes to pay for school buildings, computers and air ventilation systems even as school districts are slated to receive $900 million in federal pandemic aid. Ventilation upgrades are on virtually all lists after state authorities mandated upgraded systems better able to pull tiny virus particles out of the air. They often require new machinery. Due to recent changes in state law, all money raised by local school funding ballot initiatives will go to funding to local schools. Until this year, about 75% of operational funds in mill levies was deducted from state funds, meaning only 25% of local property taxes for schools actually went directly to that district. The legislation benefits districts such as Santa Fe where there’s a strong local tax base, as well as districts serving Gallup, in northwestern New Mexico, where federal funds offset the nontaxable federal and tribal land surrounding it. A few school districts with both low property values and no federal land will likely lose out in the long term under the new formula. But the losses won’t be felt any time soon because of federal pandemic relief.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s Board of Health on Monday passed a resolution that names racism as a public health crisis, joining the growing list of state and local governments around the country that have done so in recent years. The resolution calls on the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to take steps including reviewing the city’s health code to look for structural racism and find ways to make changes as necessary. “To build a healthier New York City, we must confront racism as a public health crisis,” Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi said in a statement. Since 2019, when Milwaukee County in Wisconsin was the first to call out racism as a public health issue, dozens of places around the country have followed suit. Supporters have said it’s an important step in addressing problems, while some have questioned whether the declarations will lead to real change.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A federal judge has ruled that the state’s flagship public university can continue to consider race as a factor in its undergraduate admissions, rebuffing a conservative group’s argument that affirmative action disadvantages white and Asian students. U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs ruled late Monday that the University of North Carolina has shown that it has a compelling reason to pursue a diverse student body and has demonstrated that measurable benefits come from that goal. “In sum, the Court concludes that UNC has met its burden in demonstrating that it has a genuine and compelling interest in achieving the educational benefits of diversity,” Biggs wrote. Students for Fair Admissions sued UNC in 2014, arguing that using race and ethnicity as a factor in college admissions violates the equal protection cause of the Constitution and federal civil rights law. The group contended that UNC had gone too far in using race as a factor in admissions and had thus “intentionally discriminated against certain of (its) members on the basis of their race, color, or ethnicity.” The group’s president, Edward Blum, said it would appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. His group already appealed a denial in a similar lawsuit against Harvard University. Blum said he hopes both cases get bundled together so that the U.S. Supreme Court rules simultaneously on private and public universities.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state can continue to pursue reimbursement from the federal government for the millions of dollars spent policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline, a judge has ruled. U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor on Tuesday denied the federal government’s motion to dismiss North Dakota’s attempt to recover more than $38 million from the months­long pipeline protests five years ago. The federal government argued North Dakota’s emergency response expenses are not “money damages” for “injury or loss of property.” Traynor, who is based in Bismarck and was nominated for the judgeship by former President Donald Trump, ruled the state’s claim of damages is permissible. The state filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 2019. North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem has long argued that the Corps allowed and sometimes encouraged protesters to illegally camp without a federal permit. The Corps has said protesters weren’t evicted due to free speech reasons. The $3.8 billion pipeline has been moving oil from the Dakotas through Iowa to Illinois since 2017. Thousands of opponents gathered in southern North Dakota in 2016 and early 2017, camping on federal land and often clashing with police. Hundreds were arrested over six months.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Assaulting a referee would become a crime punishable by a fine and community service hours under pending legislation in the General Assembly. The bill would make an assault on referees before, during or after a sporting event, or in retaliation for their decisions, a first-degree misdemeanor with an automatic fine of $1,500 and 40 hours of community service. A second conviction could lead to a felony charge that could include prison time if the assault was committed with a weapon or caused serious harm. More than 2 in 3 sports officials quit during their first three years because of spectator abuse, said state Rep. Bill Roemer, R-Richfield, a longtime youth baseball coach. “Sports officials deserve to be safe from undue harm on the job, not just for their safety but for the integrity of sports at large,” Roemer told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. The Ohio House passed the legislation in June by a wide margin. Lawmakers considered but failed to pass a similar bill in the last General Assembly.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A national advocacy group for women on Monday blasted the sentencing of a 21-year-old woman to prison for a manslaughter conviction after she suffered a miscarriage while using methamphetamine. Brittney Poolaw, of Lawton, Oklahoma, was sentenced to four years in prison this month after a jury convicted her of first-degree manslaughter. An autopsy of Poolaw’s fetus showed it tested positive for methamphetamine. But there was no evidence that her meth use caused the miscarriage, which the autopsy indicated could have been caused by factors including a congenital abnormality and placental abruption, a complication in which the placenta detaches from the womb, said Lynn Paltrow, executive director of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women. According to the medical examiner’s report, the fetus was between 15 and 17 weeks old, which means it wouldn’t have been able to viably survive outside the womb yet. “This prosecution went forward against somebody who had a pregnancy loss before the fetus was considered viable,” Paltrow said. “In this case, you not only have a miscarriage rather than a stillbirth early in pregnancy, but the medical examiner’s report doesn’t even claim that methamphetamine was the cause.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state’s central administrative agency inadvertently released the COVID-19 vaccination status of more than 40,000 state employees to two media outlets. A spreadsheet sent to The Oregonian/OregonLive and the Salem Statesman Journal was supposed to contain the latest vaccination rates and vaccine exemption rates for each executive branch agency overseen by Gov. Kate Brown. Brown issued an executive order in August requiring all executive branch employees – along with individuals working in educational and health care settings – to be fully vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus by Monday at midnight. Instead, Oregon Department of Administrative Services External Relations Director Adam Crawford emailed a file to the outlets Monday containing vaccination status by employee name. Crawford took the blame for the data release and asked that the personal information not be reported. “It’s a mistake on my part,” he said. Ben Morris, a spokesperson for SEIU 503, said the release violates an agreement the union signed with the state that required individuals’ vaccination information to be confidential. Morris said that “more concerning is that one of the main things that we heard from members who were vaccine hesitant is they were concerned about their privacy in this situation.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Prosecutors pursuing the case against a man accused of raping a woman on a commuter train last week don’t anticipate charging fellow passengers for not intervening, a spokesperson for the suburban Philadelphia district attorney said. “It’s still an open investigation, but there is no expectation at this time that we will charge passengers,” said Margie McAboy, spokeswoman for the Delaware County District Attorney’s office. Authorities continue to investigate the Oct. 13 attack, in which a woman was repeatedly touched and groped over the course of a 40-minute ride despite trying to push 35-year-old Fiston Ngoy away, according to an arrest affidavit that detailed the surveillance footage from the train. Investigators say Ngoy ripped the woman’s pants off and proceeded to rape her for somewhere between 6 and 8 minutes before officers boarded the train and detained him. Requests by the Associated Press for surveillance video from the attack on the Market-Frankford line have been denied, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. Police declined to say how many passengers may have witnessed the assault but have said it appeared some held their phones up in the direction of the assault, seemingly to film the attack. Police have declined to say whether investigators have found any photos or videos of the attack posted online.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: The median price of a single-family home in the state continued to rise in the third quarter, even though the number of sales slowed down, the Rhode Island Association of Realtors said Wednesday. The median price of single-family homes sold in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was a record-high $385,000, a 15% increase over the third quarter of 2020. However, the number of closed sales was down 8.4% year-over-year, according to association data. “The single-family home market has been incredibly competitive and the properties that are available for sale are put under contract so quickly, that it appears some prospective buyers took a break,” association President Leann D’Ettore said in a statement. “Also, the spread of the delta variant affected the market last quarter, keeping some buyers at home and making some prospective sellers think twice about listing their home.” Sales of multifamily homes, on the other hand, showed no signs of slowing. The median price soared 21% to $375,000 in the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2020, while closings increased 43%. The condominium sector had modest gains in both median price and closed sales. Out-of-state buyers accounted for nearly a quarter of all residential sales during the quarter.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A prominent civil rights attorney on Tuesday demanded that a prosecutor revisit a case and criminally charge the two jail employees who stunned a mentally ill Black man 10 times and kneeled on his back until he stopped breathing. Ninth Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson announced in July that the Charleston County jail deputies who were seen on surveillance video restraining Jamal Sutherland wouldn’t face charges. Wilson called the deputies’ actions “damning” but said she couldn’t prove the guards intended to kill Sutherland, who at the time was refusing to go to his bond hearing. Attorney Ben Crump joined Sutherland’s relatives outside Wilson’s office to call on the solicitor to reconsider her decision, arguing she had gathered enough evidence throughout her months­long investigation to charge the former deputies with involuntary manslaughter. “We all know what the truth is – that they unjustly killed a young Black man who was having a mental health crisis,” Crump said. “He had committed no crime. It wasn’t like he was a hardened criminal. This was a child who needed a helping hand.” Sutherland, 31, had been booked into the jail the day before his death on a misdemeanor charge. Officers arrested him while investigating a fight at the mental health and substance abuse center where he was receiving treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. His death drew national attention after county officials released video of the incident months later.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers on Tuesday advanced a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana use for adults while repealing much of the state’s new medical marijuana law. The Adult-Use Marijuana Study Subcommittee, which has been studying the issue since June, voted to recommend a bill that would allow people over 21 to purchase up to 1 ounce of cannabis for recreational use. It would repeal most aspects of the medical marijuana law that voters passed last year but still contain provisions for people under 21 to use marijuana for medical purposes. The bill would still need to be cleared by a pair of legislative committees, the full Legislature next year and the governor to become law. But lawmakers’ willingness to advance the issue showed a growing acknowledgment in the Republican-controlled Statehouse that recreational marijuana legalization has popular support. “Do we want to step forward and regulate it and put forward a good plan?” Republican Rep. Tim Goodwin asked the committee. “Or do we want to go against the will of the people who voted in the last election?” The bill would ban public pot consumption and eliminate criminal charges for possessing any amount up to 4 ounces.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Lawmakers on Wednesday committed to spending nearly $900 million on state incentives, infrastructure upgrades and more as part of a sweeping plan with Ford Motor Co. to build an electric vehicle and battery plant near Memphis. It took the Republican-led General Assembly just three days to sign off on the economic package after Gov. Bill Lee called them back to the Capitol for a special legislative session that was supposed to focus solely on the Ford deal. Despite the governor’s directive, some Republicans attempted to jam a number of measures that would undermine protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. Those attempts were ultimately unsuccessful after Senate leaders announced the bills would not receive a hearing. The push won’t be dead for long, though, because Republicans mustered enough support to bring the Legislature back in Nashville next week to consider a slew of changes in opposition to COVID-19 requirements. About 10 lawmakers voted against or abstained from voting on the Ford bills. The massive investment in the western Tennessee site sparked praise among Democratic lawmakers, who noted the area containing the state’s largest Black population had been long ignored by Tennessee’s leaders.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state is poised to become the latest and most populous to tighten restrictions on transgender athletes in public high school sports. State lawmakers on Sunday approved a measure that requires transgender athletes to play on teams that align with the gender listed on their original birth certificate, not their current gender identity. The bill pushed by the Legislature’s Republican majority now goes to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it into law. Texas would join at least five other states that have passed similar measures in recent months, and the bill may yet face legal challenges. Activists for transgender athletes and LGBTQ issues have called the bill mean-spirited and discriminatory. “This cruel and grotesque ban puts a target on the backs of transgender children and adults, erases intersex people, and sends a clear message that transgender and intersex people aren’t welcome or safe in Texas,” said Ricardo Martinez, chief executive officer of Equality Texas. But supporters of the bill said it is needed to protect girls from athletes who might be bigger, faster and stronger. “We have the opportunity today to stand up for our daughters, our granddaughters and all our Texas girls,” Republican state Rep. Valoree Swanson said before the bill passed in the state House last week.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The opening of affordable apartments in a six-story building made out of recycled shipping containers will be delayed because of a shortage of materials. Eco Box Fabricators owner Rod Newman said a delay in getting roofing materials and an elevator have pushed back the opening to the end of the year. The project called Box 500 had been scheduled to open over the summer in Salt Lake City with affordable rents. The coronavirus pandemic has caused global supply change problems, and the shipping container apartments are not the only housing development facing delays in Salt Lake City. “In the (housing) market, we’re seeing shortages across the board,” Orion Goff, deputy director of the Department of Community and Neighborhoods, told The Salt Lake Tribune. The shipping container building, when completed, will have 48 studio apartments, 18 one-bedroom units and 17 two-bedroom apartments. Studios are 320 square feet, while one- and two-bedrooms are about 640 square feet. Amanda Best, a specialist with the city’s housing development program, said rents will range from $829 to $1,204 a month based on income.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott on Monday extended emergency motel housing for some of the homeless population through the end of the year and urged the Legislature to fully fund his $249 million housing recovery plan that he said includes historic funding for permanent housing for the homeless. In July, the state extended the hotel voucher program for families with children, the disabled, pregnant women and other vulnerable people, and it gave $2,500 checks to those no longer eligible. Scott later moved to keep the program running for those people another 30 days, until Oct. 21. “Those in GA Emergency Housing currently are some of the most vulnerable, including Vermonters with disabilities, families with children, and households who have faced chronic housing instability,” Scott, a Republican, said in a statement. “Demand for emergency housing and shelter is a symptom of Vermont’s current housing crisis. Ultimately, permanent housing solutions, not simply emergency housing and shelters, are needed.” As of last week, the Department of Children and Families was serving 950 families, representing 1,100 adults and 402 children, the administration said. Before the pandemic, the program provided emergency housing to about 2,500 Vermonters a year, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The leading candidates for governor have gone quiet on commitments both previously made to disclose at least some information from recent tax returns before the Nov. 2 election. Neither the campaign of Democrat Terry McAuliffe nor that of Republican Glenn Youngkin has responded to recent inquiries from the Associated Press about plans to share the information with voters. While it is not required for Virginia gubernatorial candidates to disclose their returns, there is some limited precedent for doing so. The complete documents could give a more nuanced look at a candidate’s income, deductions and philanthropy than the state’s mandatory disclosures do. In July, in response to questions from the AP, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said the former private equity executive and first-time candidate would release information from recent years’ tax returns before November. Christina Freundlich, a spokeswoman for McAuliffe, said the former governor would share a summary of recent years’ returns before the election. Also on the ballot for governor next month is third-party candidate Princess Blanding, an activist and educator who did not respond to the AP’s initial inquiry about whether she intended to release any tax return information.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Lawmakers and legislative employees in the state House must prove they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to access House facilities through early January, under a rule adopted by a House committee late last month. The policy took effect Monday, the same day a statewide COVID-19 vaccine mandate deadline passed for many state workers and others to provide proof of vaccination – or an accommodated exemption – in order to keep their jobs. More than 1,800 state workers were fired, resigned or retired due to the mandate. Legislative staff and lawmakers are not covered by Gov. Jay Inslee’s vaccination requirement, so policy for the House and Senate facilities is left up to leaders within each chamber. In the House, the Executive Rules Committee – which handles chamber policies – is composed of four Democrats and three Republicans. Bernard Dean, the chief clerk of the House, said that the change in facility access is only for the 2021 legislative interim and that no decisions have yet been made on whether to extend the policy to the legislative session that begins Jan. 10. Secretary of the Senate Brad Hendrickson said the chamber has not adopted a similar interim policy, but decisions on building access and what format the session will take in January are expected soon.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Officials are moving forward with initiatives in response to an ongoing HIV outbreak in Kanawha County. The new initiatives shared Tuesday at a meeting of the county’s HIV Task Force include training sessions for stakeholders and doctors and hiring more disease intervention specialists, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The initiatives are in response to an August report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Kanawha County’s HIV crisis. The findings recommended that people who inject drugs in West Virginia’s largest county should have expanded access to sterile syringes, testing and treatment. The recommendations came in response to one of the nation’s highest spikes of HIV cases. An increase in sterile syringe access for people who inject drugs wasn’t among items discussed Tuesday. “The state is currently trying to prioritize our efforts in response to the CDC recommendations and is fully supportive in working with community partners and local health departments to support current programs that would be in alignment with our current law,” state epidemiologist Shannon McBee said. State lawmakers added new requirements this spring for syringe service programs, leading many organizations to stop offering them.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Creating a state hunting season for sandhill cranes drew support at a legislative hearing, with backers of the Republican proposal saying it could be properly managed and help farmers who say the birds are overpopulated and hurting their crops. The bill is one of 13 hunting-related measures introduced by Republicans and supported by the pro-hunting group Hunter Nation that are working their way through the Legislature. Conservation groups complained at a Senate committee hearing Tuesday that they weren’t consulted on the package. Republicans say the goal of the bills, including the sandhill crane proposal, is to make hunting, fishing and trapping more accessible. The bills include stocking more pheasants and brook trout, simplifying turkey hunting seasons, and reducing Department of Natural Resources regulations for hunting, trapping and fishing. Another measure in the package would allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit, but that was not up for a public hearing Tuesday. Hunting sandhill cranes was last proposed in 2011, but the measure never made it out of committee. Rich Beilfuss, president and CEO of the International Crane Foundation, highlighted how the U.S. almost hunted the birds to extinction in the 1800s, requiring them to be protected since the early 1900s. “Hunting is not a solution for crop damage,” he said. “But there are solutions. ... we’re trying to find non-lethal solutions.”\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Rangers in Grand Teton National Park have resumed using body-worn video cameras after a three-year hiatus. Grand Teton rangers stopped using the cameras in 2018 amid problems with aging equipment and being able to store data, park officials said in a statement. Only commissioned law enforcement rangers will use body-worn cameras and only while gathering information during enforcement of laws. Cameras won’t be turned on during other conversations with park visitors, such as when rangers are sharing information, park officials said. In nearby Yellowstone National Park, 90% of commissioned law enforcement rangers, including all field staff, already wear body cameras, according to Yellowstone officials. Yellowstone law enforcement ranger supervisors will be issued cameras in coming weeks.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/25/new-orleans-revelry-overwhelming-stink-right-food-news-around-states/119081162/", "title": "New Orleans revelry, overwhelming stink: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Plagued by a shortage of stadium workers and complaints about long concession lines at home football games during the pandemic, the University of Alabama has contracted with an online app. It also made other changes in hopes of speeding up service during Saturday’s homecoming game against Tennessee. With a capacity crowd of more than 101,000 expected, Alabama said fans could use the Waitr phone system to order food and drinks in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Fans using the system are notified when an order is ready and can then pick up items at windows in the stadium. The Alabama deal is Waitr’s first for a football stadium, although baseball fans have used the app in Louisiana and Mississippi, company spokesman Dean Turcol said. Alabama received complaints about long concession lines after its home game against the University of Mississippi on Oct. 2. Athletics director Greg Byrne said part of the problem was the difficulty finding workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Similar to staffing issues at the gates, an average of 40% of people who were supposed to work concessions on game days end up not showing up leaving them short-handed,” he wrote in a weekly email to supporters at the time. The athletic department said it is also streamlining menus and adding ordering technology to speed up sales.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A woman known for 37 years only as Horseshoe Harriet, one of a dozen or so victims of a notorious Alaska serial killer, has been identified through genetic genealogy and a DNA match, authorities said Friday. The victim was identified Friday as Robin Pelkey, who was 19 and living on the streets of Anchorage when she was killed by Robert Hansen in the early 1980s, the Alaska Bureau of Investigation’s Cold Case Investigation Unit said. “I would like to thank all of the troopers, investigators, and analysts that have diligently worked on this case over the last 37 years. Without their hard work and tenacity, the identity of Ms. Pelkey may have never been known,” Alaska Department of Public Safety Commissioner James Cockrell said in a statement. Hansen, who owned a bakery, gained the nickname “Butcher Baker” for abducting and hunting down women – many of them sex workers – in the wilderness just north of Anchorage through the early 1980s, when the state’s largest city was booming because of construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline. Construction of the 800-mile pipeline offered well-paying jobs for workers, but it also attracted those looking for fast money and left as quickly as they came. Exotic dancers traveled a circuit along West Coast cities, making sudden disappearances commonplace.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An attorney for members of the San Carlos Apache tribe on Friday asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to back a nonprofit group’s efforts to keep a copper mining company from gaining federal Arizona land that the Apaches consider sacred. “We are talking about the survival of the Apache people,” attorney Luke Goodrich told the panel, arguing that an end to religious activities on the land known as Oak Flat would help spell an end to the tribe. Joan Pepin, an attorney for the U.S. government, argued the land transfer must go ahead because it was part of legislation approved by Congress. The land has been set to be transferred to Resolution Copper, as part of a provision in a must-pass 2014 defense bill, once the final environmental impact statement is published. The three-member panel did not immediately release a ruling. The judges will now confer in private and write a decision that may not be issued for as long as three months. Goodrich said the group could take the case to the Supreme Court if the appeals court sides with the U.S. Forest Service, the agency that has planned the land transfer. Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit organization representing tribe members, sued the federal government in Phoenix federal court in January to block the pending transfer of the land near the community of Superior.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A prison transport driver convicted last year of sexually assaulting two female inmates was sentenced Thursday to life in prison plus five years. U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall handed down the sentence to Eric Scott Kindley, 53, for the assaults and knowingly possessing a firearm to further a violent crime. Kindley sexually assaulted the women in 2014 and 2017 while transporting them between lockups on warrants. Kindley operated his own private prisoner transport company that contracted with local jails throughout the country to transport individuals arrested on out-of-state warrants. The federal investigation into Kindley began when two women, housed together at a small jail in Arizona, reported that he sexually assaulted them during two separate trips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Levels of wretched-smelling hydrogen sulfide gas that have plagued south Los Angeles County communities for weeks are declining as authorities use various mitigation methods in a flood control channel emitting the gross odors, authorities said Friday in an online news conference. The problem was reported Oct. 7 and traced to the 15-mile-long Dominguez Channel, which flows into the Los Angeles harbor. The smell has chiefly affected the city of Carson and several other Los Angeles suburbs. The gas is being created by a natural phenomenon called anaerobic digestion, which occurs when bacteria break down vegetation when there’s a lack of oxygen in the water, said Mark Pestrella, the county’s public works director and chief engineer of the flood control district. In addition, the investigation revealed the presence of chemicals that are contributing to the problem. Pestrella did not identify those chemicals and said he could not comment further because it may involve criminal or civil actions. Public works is spraying the channel with a biodegradable odor neutralizer called Epoleon, which converts hydrogen sulfide to a salt. Daily tides are being relied on to spread the neutralizer, and Pestrella said drones are being considered to help that process. A system of bubblers is being installed in the channel to oxygenate the water, he said.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A day care owner convicted of keeping 26 children hidden in the basement of her business two years ago has been sentenced to six years in prison after parents said some of the children still suffer trauma including sleeping problems and anxiety. A judge issued the sentence to Carla Faith on Thursday following her August conviction of more than two dozen misdemeanor child abuse charges and other crimes. Faith was only licensed to care for up to six children at her private day care, and only two were allowed to be under age 2. But police who went to her Mountain Play Place day care in November 2019 found 25 kids in the basement, including 12 under 2 years old, prosecutors said. There were two adult employees supervising them in the basement, and one accepted a plea deal and testified at Faith’s trial, KRDO-TV reports. A 26th child was picked up by a parent while police were on site, authorities said. Many of the children had soiled or wet diapers and were sweaty and thirsty, according to an arrest affidavit. When police arrived, Faith repeatedly told an officer that no children were there and that the home did not have a basement, but the officer heard children’s music and a child’s cry from the basement, the affidavit said. Another officer discovered a false wall and moved it to reveal the basement staircase, the affidavit said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Employees in the state’s prison system make up more than 32% of state workers who have failed to comply with Gov. Ned Lamont’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, according to figures released Friday by the governor’s office. Of Connecticut’s 30,623 state workers 1,482 – about 5% – have not been vaccinated or submitted to weekly coronavirus testing as required by the mandate, according to the report. Those include 483 workers at the state Department of Correction, which has about 5,400 employees. The governor’s office had given workers until Oct. 4 to comply with the order. But the state has so far fired just 22 workers and placed an additional 29 on unpaid leave. Officials are in the process of suspending or terminating an additional 70 workers, the governor’s office said. “The majority of employees who are currently out of compliance are working with the state to come into compliance and anticipate coming into compliance in the coming days,” Lamont spokesperson David Bednarz said. The department confirmed Friday that it has seen a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases in several prisons, including the Hartford Correctional Center, the New Haven Correctional Center and the Carl Robinson Correctional Center. Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said most of those are asymptomatic cases among inmates.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Nearly every beach town along the state’s coast made more money from parking permits and meters this past summer than in 2020, and most also beat pre-pandemic revenue in 2019. In Lewes, the total parking revenue in 2021, including fees collected from parking tickets, reached just over $1 million – a 17% increase from 2019 and about a 27% jump from 2020. In Dewey Beach and Bethany Beach, this summer’s total parking revenues increased by just over 20% each compared to summer 2019. Their recovery from 2020 revenue was even greater. Dewey Beach’s accounting clerk clarified that the collections from parking fines during a given year may not perfectly reflect how many tickets were issued that year. But even without the revenue from parking citations, Dewey made a huge comeback: Revenue from parking permits and meters alone increased by about a third since 2019. Even as crowds returned to the boardwalks and beaches, though, some signs of the pandemic remained. Rehoboth Beach, for example, maintained its Meterless Mondays – free parking from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. every Monday – and several parking spots were taken up by outdoor dining and reserved spaces for carryout orders. Even so, Rehoboth Beach only fell below its pre-pandemic revenue by $80,000.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Area commuters will face longer waits for Metro trains through at least the end of the month and probably longer, as more than half the fleet of train cars will remain out of service over safety issues. Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld told reporters Friday that there was no timeline for the return of the transit authority’s 7000-series train cars, which were abruptly pulled from service last week after a derailing revealed a chronic problem with the wheels and axles. Those 748 cars are the newest and constitute more than 60% of the fleet. The derailing is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, and Wiedefeld said he couldn’t comment on it while the investigation was ongoing. In the meantime, Wiedefeld said Metro engineers were working to bring older retired cars back into service. But he said the older cars were undergoing rigorous inspections, and he didn’t expect them back in service until early November. Until then, riders can expect longer delays between trains across the system, whose six lines crisscross the city and stretch deep into the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. The transit authority currently has 268 rail cars in service. There are 180 cars from the older 6000-series trains that may be brought back if they pass inspections. Currently only 22 of them are available for service.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The state’s top health official was asked to leave a meeting after refusing to wear a mask at the office of a state senator who told him she had a serious medical condition, officials have confirmed. Florida Senate leader Wilton Simpson, a Republican, sent a memo to senators Saturday regarding the incident at the office of Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky, asking visitors at the building to be respectful with social interactions. Polsky, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, had not yet made public her breast cancer diagnosis. Polsky told the Associated Press about the tense exchange with state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo that was first reported by news site Florida Politics. She said Ladapo and two aides were offered masks and were asked to wear them when they arrived for the Wednesday meeting. She did not tell him she had breast cancer but said she had a serious condition. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cancer patients are at a higher risk to get severely ill from COVID-19 and may not build the same immunity to vaccines. Ladapo had asked to meet her in Tallahassee as he seeks confirmation in the Senate after being named to the post by Gov. Ron DeSantis last month. Polsky said she asked whether there was a reason why he couldn’t wear a mask, but he wouldn’t answer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge is throwing out ethics charges against former Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, saying state officials waited too long to pursue action. Oxendine was accused of illegally using campaign funds from his failed 2010 gubernatorial campaign to buy a house and lease cars. He was also accused of accepting campaign contributions 10 times above the legal limit from insurance companies. Local news outlets report administrative law judge Ronit Walker ruled last week that the statute of limitations on misconduct had passed when ethics officials began to pursue Oxendine in 2015. Walker also ruled that the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission can’t pursue Oxendine for accepting $120,000 in bundled contributions from two insurance companies. “No matter how patently obvious it may be that corporations are ‘affiliated,’ the legislature has chosen only to penalize the donor,” Walker wrote in dismissing the illegal contributions case against Oxendine, citing state law. The ethics complaint against the insurers was dismissed in 2014 because commission staff had made little progress. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2016 that Oxendine kept $500,000 in leftover funds from his gubernatorial campaign and kept contributions for a runoff and general election he never saw.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The number of students enrolled at the University of Hawaii’s 10 campuses increased this fall for the first time in a decade. The school’s flagship Manoa campus led the way with a 6% increase, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The university’s first-year class is its largest ever. Overall, the institution’s enrollment is the highest it’s been since 2014. Enrollment at the Hilo campus is up 2.5%. Leeward Community College and Windward Community College posted gains of 0.8% and 3.8%, respectively. Overall enrollment at UH’s seven community colleges, however, is down 3.2%. Manoa enrollment, officials said, was up in nearly every category, including resident, continental U.S, transfer and international students. UH-Manoa Provost Michael Bruno credited the university for spreading the word about the benefits of a Manoa education. The perception that Hawaii and the Manoa campus in particular have managed the coronavirus pandemic better than most places may have played a role, he said. Hawaii Pacific University had been expecting an enrollment boost before the fall semester began. It was expecting to have 4,000 students this fall, its most ever. Its first-year class was expected to climb from about 500 to more than 800.\n\nIdaho\n\nHailey: The city is asking a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit brought by an anti-mask group, arguing the group’s members can’t show they’ve actually been harmed by a local face-covering mandate. Hailey and other central Idaho towns surrounding the popular Sun Valley ski resort were at the epicenter of the state’s first major coronavirus outbreak in March 2020. The city enacted its mask mandate – requiring most people to wear masks in public when indoors or outside when social distancing is impossible – in July 2020, and a version of the order has remained in place ever since. Idaho remains one of the least-vaccinated states in the nation, and unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have overwhelmed hospitals. A month ago, state public health leaders enacted “crisis standards of care,” allowing hospitals to ration health care as needed to deal with the flood of patients. About a week after the state entered crisis standards of care, an anti-mask organization based hundreds of miles away in the northern Idaho city of Sandpoint sued Hailey on behalf of its members who live in and near the central Idaho town. In the lawsuit, the group said the mask mandate amounted to a “mandatory human experiment” that violates their fundamental human rights.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The mayor has helped launch the installation of new signs renaming the city’s picturesque Lake Shore Drive after a Black man recognized as a key settler of the city. Mayor Lori Lightfoot gathered Thursday with political and community leaders at Buckingham Fountain to kick off the installation of 12 large highway signs declaring the thoroughfare “Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable Lake Shore Drive.” More than 80 smaller street signs that will mark the roadway along the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline read simply: “DuSable Lake Shore Drive,” the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Lightfoot, who had initially opposed renaming Lake Shore Drive, said the $500,000 cost is “worth it” to honor a man who was “forgotten in the annals” of Chicago history. “We needed to find a way to honor our founder,” Lightfoot said. Chicago’s City Council approved the name change in June. DuSable, a native of Haiti, is considered Chicago’s first permanent, non-Indigenous settler. He had a successful trading post in the late 1700s. He died in 1818. Chicago was incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city four years later. Alderman Donald Moore initially proposed changing the name of the ribbon of concrete along Lake Michigan to DuSable Drive two years ago after a riverboat tour of the city in which he said DuSable’s name wasn’t mentioned.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Twitter suspended a congressman’s official account after removing a post about a transgender woman over violation of the social media company’s rules. Twitter’s action Saturday came after Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Banks posted tweets last week regarding Dr. Rachel Levine becoming the first openly transgender four-star officer in the U.S. uniformed services. Banks had responded to the U.S. surgeon general congratulating Levine on her promotion in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by writing: “The title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man.” Now-retired Army Gen. Ann Dunwoody was the first woman in the U.S. military to attain a four-star rank. Banks’ post was removed with a reference to Twitter rules that include a ban on “targeted misgendering” of transgender people. Banks’ official Twitter account remained online Sunday, but he wasn’t allowed to add new posts. His personal account with fewer followers remained active. Banks, whose district covers Fort Wayne and surrounding northeastern Indiana, has frequently drawn attention with right-wing social media comments. He stood by his post about Levine. “My tweet was a statement of fact,” Banks said in a statement. “Big Tech doesn’t have to agree with me, but they shouldn’t be able to cancel me.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Doctors accused of doing something dangerous or inappropriate could keep the allegations private until a regulatory board makes a final determination and issues a report under a state Supreme Court decision issued Friday. In its unanimous decision, the court said the Iowa Board of Medicine should not have publicly disclosed information about a doctor under investigation, as was standard for the agency. Its ruling likely will lead to changes in how dozens of other boards handle complaints. “Read in its entirety, we do not believe the statute is ambiguous. Investigative information cannot be released to the public prior to a final decision in a disciplinary proceeding,” Justice Edward Mansfield wrote. Iowa Freedom of Information Council Executive Director Randy Evans called the decision disappointing and said he hopes the Legislature revises the statute. “Those facts and circumstances need full and timely disclosure to patients and consumers so they can make an informed selection of a treating physician,” he said. The court ruled in the case of Dr. Domenico Calcaterra, a cardiothoracic surgeon who formerly practiced in Iowa City but now practices in another state. He has long denied allegations of disruptive behavior and unethical or unprofessional misconduct.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: The Overland Park Police Department plans to expand its team that responds to calls involving mental health crises, with a goal of defusing the situations while keeping everyone safe. The new Overland Park Crisis Action Team will have 12 members and six co-responders, though most of the positions haven’t started yet. Currently, it has two crisis intervention specialists and three co-responders, The Kansas City Star reports. When the team responds to a mental health call, it will be accompanied by a clinician from Johnson County Mental Health. A therapy dog will also join the team. “Our whole goal is to bring them in and let them do their job, and (officers are) there to make sure everybody’s safe,” said police Sgt. Stewart Brought. In September, the Overland Park City Council raised property taxes to create the expanded unit. OPCAT also received a nearly $250,000 grant from the Department of Justice. “This OPCAT unit, it will save lives,” said Sheila Albers, who has fought for police reforms since her 17-year-old son, John Albers, was killed by an Overland Park officer during a welfare check in January 2018.\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Striking workers at one of the world’s largest bourbon producers voted to ratify a new contract Saturday, a day after announcing a tentative agreement with Heaven Hill. About 420 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23D went on strike about six weeks ago, forming picket lines at the company’s operations in Bardstown after rejecting a previous contract proposal. The tentative agreement came just days after the company signaled it intended to start hiring permanent replacement employees for bottling and warehouse operations. The workers then voted to ratify the five-year agreement Saturday, according to a statement from Heaven Hill. “We look forward to welcoming our team members as we transition back to normal operations,” company spokesperson Josh Hafer said in the statement. The dispute revolved around health care and scheduling, the latter a sign of the bourbon industry’s growing pains as it tries to keep up with global demand. Family-owned and operated Heaven Hill produces Evan Williams, one of the world’s top-selling bourbons. The spirits company’s other brands include Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny and Parker’s Heritage Collection.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The high school bands played, the costumed marching groups danced, and float riders threw Moon Pies and beads to the thousands of people who turned out Saturday for the city’s first big parade since the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic put the brakes on New Orleans’ signature brand of frivolity. The streets were lined with thousands of residents and tourists who came to watch the Krewe of Boo parade – the first float parade since Mardi Gras 2020. The Halloween-themed parade stretches from the city’s Marigny neighborhood through the French Quarter and into the Warehouse District. Riders on the floats dress up in Halloween-themed outfits and throw ghoulish and fun trinkets and beads to crowds that pack the streets. “This is one of the best feelings in a very long time,” said Jordan Philebar, a New Orleans resident who was dressed as Wednesday Addams from “The Addams Family” as she rode a float along with four members of her family. “It’s lovely to feel slightly normal again.” Mardi Gras 2020 was largely credited with contributing to the city becoming an early hot spot for the coronavirus. As the extent and seriousness of the pandemic became apparent, parades and music festivals were canceled.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed “right to food” constitutional amendment is on the ballot for the state’s voters in the Nov. 2 election. Some say it would simply put people in charge of how and what they eat, while others worry it would endanger animals and food supplies and turn urban neighborhoods into cattle pastures. For supporters, the language is short and to the point, ensuring the right to grow vegetables and raise livestock in an era when corporatization threatens local ownership of the food supply – a constitutional experiment that has never been tried in any state. For opponents and skeptics, it’s deceptively vague, representing a threat to food safety and animal welfare, and could embolden residents to raise cows in their backyards in cities like Portland and Bangor. Voters will be asked if they favor an amendment to the Maine Constitution “to declare that all individuals have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.” The proposal is an outgrowth of the right-to-food movement, sometimes called the food sovereignty movement. Maine enacted the nation’s first food sovereignty law in 2017, allowing local governments to OK small food producers selling directly to customers on site. The law was especially popular with sellers of raw milk, which can be legally sold in Maine but is more restricted in many other states.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state’s highest court has disbarred retired Harford County State’s Attorney Joseph Cassilly for withholding exculpatory evidence that surfaced in a 1981 double-murder case and lying about it over the years. The Baltimore Sun reports Cassilly learned of the court’s decision Friday in a phone call from the newspaper. “Oh, whatever. I’m retired anyway,” he reportedly told the Sun. The Maryland Court of Appeals found the former prosecutor lied about documents that undermined the credibility of an FBI agent on the case. The judges noted Cassilly, a Republican, served 36 years as Harford County’s top prosecutor and retired in 2019. The judges wrote that disbarring him would prevent his possible return to the courtroom and send a message. Cassilly maintains that he did nothing wrong but rather “fell into the whole anti-criminal justice movement, where the cops are the bad guys and the prosecutors are the bad guys.” “I’m disappointed, but the real answer is: Do I care? I don’t give a damn,” he said. “I wouldn’t do anything to engage in the practice of law right now because it’s such a screwed-up obscenity.” John Norman Huffington, who was released from prison in 2008 after serving 27 years of a life sentence, has said he would have won his freedom years earlier had Cassilly disclosed key records.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State lawmakers are considering whether to begin allowing electric bicycles in bike lanes. Currently, electric bikes are prohibited on bike paths because they’re categorized as mopeds, though advocates for bicyclists say the law is largely unenforced. The Boston Globe reports some state lawmakers are now pushing a bill to bring Massachusetts in line with 46 other states and Washington, D.C., in regulating electric bikes as bikes. “What’s abundantly clear, whatever the law, is people are riding e-bikes in bike lanes and bike paths, as they should – they are bikes,” said state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, D-Democrat, who is sponsoring the bill in the House. A similar bill is pending in the state Senate. The House chairman of the Legislature’s Transportation Committee, however, questioned whether it’s safe to allow bikes traveling at 20 mph or more on the paths. “These are pretty fast speeds,” said Rep. William Straus, D-Mattapoisett. “I want to be really cautious in terms of the safety issues.”\n\nMichigan\n\nHamtramck: Another Michigan city is giving filters to residents as a result of high lead results in some drinking water samples. Hamtramck, in the Detroit area, is a 2-square-mile city with 28,000 residents, many of them immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen and other countries. Seven hundred filters were passed out Thursday, and another 900 will be distributed this week, said City Manager Kathleen Angerer. “The water itself is fine. The issue is the outdated lead services lines that in some cases are leaching lead into the water into individual homes,” Mayor Karen Majewski said. She said not every home is affected. “People don’t need to panic,” Angerer said. LaTonya Hatcher, 49, was in line Thursday. “I want to get a filter for the sink,” she said. “I live in a newer neighborhood, and the pipes might be fine, but I was walking by and saw they were giving out filters, so I thought I should ask if I need one.” Across the state in Benton Harbor, residents have been urged to use only bottled water for cooking and drinking due to elevated lead levels. The problem in both communities, according to officials, is old lines that need to be replaced. Majewski said Hamtramck has replaced 260 lead lines over the past year but needs money to remove more.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Native Americans have contracted COVID-19 at two to three times the rate of white Minnesotans over the past month, according to state health officials. There are large pockets of unvaccinated people in the 18-to-49 age range in Minnesota’s tribal communities and across the country, according to Mary Owen, director of the Center for American Indian and Minority Health at the University of Minnesota medical school. “We have some folks who are not getting vaccinated, whether it’s because they’re resisting it or because they’re not able to get access. Not quite sure. It’s probably a combination of those. But that’s impacting us again, significantly,” said Owen, who is also president of the Association of American Indian Physicians. Owen said that’s especially concerning because Native Americans have high rates of health disparities, such as diabetes, that put them at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “We have some very frail people in our communities that cannot afford to get infected. We have to protect them,” Owen said. “So please, do what’s right for our communities, not just for us as individuals.” The Leech Lake reservation has recorded its highest numbers of positive COVID-19 cases over the past month since the pandemic began.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Prison employees will conduct once-a-week rehearsals as the state prepares for its first execution since 2012, according to Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain. He said Friday that the rehearsals for a lethal injection are usually done once a month at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, following a protocol that’s about 20 pages long. “Very, very detailed,” Cain said. The Mississippi Supreme on Thursday set a Nov. 17 execution date for David Neal Cox, who pleaded guilty in 2012 to killing his wife, Kim, in 2010 in the northern Mississippi town of Shannon. Cox withdrew his appeals and once filed court papers calling himself “worthy of death.” Mississippi has not had an execution since 2012, and it had six that year. Cain confirmed Mississippi has obtained lethal injection drugs, but he declined to say how. “I’m not supposed to talk about the drugs too much,” Cain said. Mississippi is still facing a lawsuit filed in 2015 by the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center on behalf of two inmates. The suit argues Mississippi’s lethal injection protocol is inhumane.\n\nMissouri\n\nBates City: A small-town mayor resigned ahead of a scheduled impeachment hearing called after he was allegedly recorded uttering a racial slur. Shawn Fox offered his resignation last Monday to the Bates City Board of Aldermen, ahead of an impeachment hearing scheduled Wednesday, television station WDAF reports. Instead of the hearing, the board accepted Fox’s resignation Wednesday. Mayor Pro-Tem Roy Trussell said Fox’s resignation came after the city had concluded its investigation, which included a leaked recording of someone believed to be Fox uttering a racial slur, as well as allegations of sexual harassment. It was unclear when or where the recording was made or who had leaked it. Fox’s resignation was the latest in a recent exodus of city government officials amid mounting allegations of a hostile work environment. Alderman Donnie Hammond resigned Tuesday, and the city’s collector and a court clerk both recently stepped down. Bates City is a town of nearly 220 about 28 miles east of Kansas City.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: The Blackfeet Nation honored Chief Earl Old Person with a weeklong memorial, ending with a funeral service Friday in the Browning High School gym. The gym smelled of sage, many women wore ribbon skirts, and some men wore headdresses as they remembered the life of Old Person, who was the tribe’s chief for 43 years. He died of cancer Oct. 13 in Browning. He was 92. Hundreds of people gathered in the gym as Old Person was remembered for his tireless advocacy for Native Americans and their culture, his strength of character, and his humility. He served on the tribal council for more than 60 years and was chairman of the tribal business council for over 50 years. He traveled the world, meeting Queen Elizabeth, the shah of Iran, and every U.S. president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama in advocating for the Blackfeet Tribe. He also worked to preserve the Blackfeet language, songs and culture. But tribal members remember his constant presence on the reservation and his care and concern for the Blackfeet people. He would attend basketball games, community events and graduations. He served as a mentor and even a father figure to tribal members. “We’re putting one of our last chiefs to rest,” Jay St. Goddard said. “It’s not just a private event; it’s not just a Montana event – this is a national event.”\n\nNebraska\n\nSuperior: An employee who returned fire after a gunman killed two people at a grain elevator likely prevented more deaths, a Nebraska State Patrol official said Friday. The employee, who was not named, retrieved a weapon and shot Max Hoskinson, 61, after Hoskinson began shooting at the Agrex Elevator in Superior on Thursday. Hoskinson, of Superior, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Authorities said he had been fired earlier Thursday and returned that afternoon with a gun and began shooting in an office area. The victims were identified as Sandra Nelson, 60, of Formoso, Kansas, and 53-year-old Darin Koepke, of Hadar, Nebraska. The third person shot by Hoskinson was treated at a hospital and released. Patrol Sgt. Jeff Roby said during the news conference that authorities do not anticipate filing any charges against the employee who shot Hoskinson. “In fact, it’s likely that the employee’s actions may have prevented much further loss of life in this tragedy,” Roby said. He said he could not comment on whether Hoskinson targeted the victims, who were all Agrex employees. He said several other employees were on site when the shooting occurred.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Lawmakers have decided motorists who want refunds of a $1-per-transaction surcharge that courts decided was unconstitutionally authorized in 2020 will have to go in person to state Department of Motor Vehicles offices. The Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee signed off Thursday on the refund program, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The move aims to comply with a Nevada Supreme Court ruling last May that said the surcharge was unconstitutionally authorized by the Legislature because the state constitution requires revenue measures to be approved by two-thirds majorities in both chambers. Senate Republicans opposed extending the DMV fee along with a tax on businesses in 2019 and filed suit after Democrats approved them. The DMV said it was collecting about $7 million per year from the fee but would provide refunds after the court ruling. The Review-Journal reports five other refund options were dismissed as more complex and costly than the amount collected, including mailing checks to all DMV customers. The rule that lawmakers adopted says people will have to present receipts in person at a DMV office for refunds. Business customers, with a larger volume of transactions, can receive checks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legislative committee on Friday approved a proposal from the state Department of Health and Human Services to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The last-minute proposal from Gov. Chris Sununu and Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette came last week after she withdrew the requests for the acceptance of $27 million in federal COVID-19 vaccination funding that was rejected by the Executive Council the week prior. Approval for the $27 million was needed by both the council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, which tabled the funds last month. Republican members expressed deep concern that accepting the funds would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19, including “quarantine and isolation.” Attorney General John Formella said that wasn’t the case. Sununu thanked the committee for its vote, saying that “we are committed to finding alternative sources of funds to ensure our vaccine distribution can move full steam ahead, and today’s vote allows us to do so.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Bucking a practice used by most law enforcement agencies in the state, the Newark Police Department, New Jersey’s largest municipal force, will stop posting the mug shots of people arrested for minor offenses. The city’s public safety department announced the change in a Facebook post Wednesday. The reason, public safety director Brian O’Hara said, is to help “safeguard individuals from marginalized communities from abuse.” In the post, O’Hara cited a spike in negative comments on a 2017 social media post regarding a prostitution arrest. “The incendiary comments fundamentally indicate that members of marginalized communities – including the transgender community – can become targets of cyber-bullying, which can lead to hate crimes and violence, simply because their photos were published online,” O’Hara said. After the spike in comments, he had the post taken down and changed the department’s policy on mug shots. From now on, the department will only publish mug shots that serve “a specific law enforcement purpose, such as locating a wanted or missing person.” Publishing mug shots can have detrimental consequences to people arrested, said Sarah E. Lageson, an associate professor at the Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice who has a doctorate in sociology.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Federal water managers warned Wednesday that like other basins across the western U.S., the Pecos River Basin is likely to experience growing water shortages as temperatures continue to rise over the next century. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation discussed the findings of a recently completed study on the basin during a virtual briefing, saying the goal of the work was to better understand the threats to water supplies in the region due to climate change. Officials also looked at what tools could be used to stretch resources to help sustain viable agriculture over the coming century as challenges grow. Reclamation Study Manager Dagmar Llewellyn said those challenges are significant. She described the Pecos basin as arid with a limited and highly variable water supply. “Drought and climate change-induced aridification is ongoing already in the basin,” she said. “We’ve been seeing less snowfall in the headwaters and more winter precipitation falling as rain. We’ve also been seeing higher consumption rates within the agricultural system.” The peak flow of snowmelt runoff into Santa Rosa Reservoir, located at the top of the system, amounted to only a trickle of about 5 cubic feet per second this year. Total volume during the runoff period was about 700 acre-feet, or 56 times less than the historical average. That meant less water for downstream users.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and two other U.S. lawmakers reintroduced a bill in the House on Friday to put immigrants who cleared debris after the Sept. 11 attacks on a fast track to legal immigration status in the United States. The 9/11 Immigrant Worker Freedom Act is a revised version of a bill that former Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York introduced in 2017 that did not advance in the House. Ocasio-Cortez defeated Crowley in a 2018 Democratic primary, winning the seat representing parts of the Bronx and Queens. Immigrants in New York, many of whom are Spanish-speaking cleanup workers, have long asked to obtain legal immigration status in the U.S. as compensation for their work and the subsequent health problems they suffered after the attacks. Hired informally by cleaning companies, the workers cleared debris, asbestos and dust inside lower Manhattan buildings for months without adequate protective gear. But 20 years after 9/11, only several dozen are still participating in protests and making the request, while others have abandoned that fight. Rep. Adriano Espaillat and Rep. Grace Meng, both from New York, are lead co-sponsors of the bill.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The soon-to-be successor to a state House member who died this month said Friday that he was outside the U.S. Capitol in January as an insurrection occurred. Donnie Loftis, who was chosen by Gaston County Republican activists last week to succeed the late Rep. Dana Bumgardner, confirmed his attendance at the Jan. 6 event to WRAL-TV. Loftis, a former Gaston County commissioner, said his involvement in what turned into a riot was strictly peaceful. On Jan. 6, “while I peacefully exercised my first amendment rights in front of the US Capitol, I was surprised and disappointed to watch others storm the entrance as violence ensued,” he wrote by text message to the station. “I had absolutely zero involvement in the rioting and categorically condemn the storming of our Capitol building that day.” Hundreds of Donald Trump’s supporters battered their way past police, injured dozens of officers and interrupted the electoral count inside the Capitol certifying President Joe Biden’s victory. In January, Loftis had posted a picture of himself to Facebook before the rally saying he was on a bus headed to Washington, according to WRAL. “I got gassed three times and was at the entrance when they breached the door,” Loftis, an Army veteran, posted at the time, according to a screenshot. “I spoke to many service members, and we all agreed that we didn’t want to be there, but we had no other choice. They don’t get it that they work for us. And I mean that in a respectful way.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is working to extend its contract with Hollywood actor Josh Duhamel to promote tourism in his home state. The top tourism official in one of the least-visited states in the nation said the 48-year-old star of several “Transformers” movies has been effective in attracting visitors to North Dakota, better known for its brutal cold weather than as a vacation destination. “He has helped expand our image and awareness of our state,” said Sara Otte Coleman, who heads the state’s tourism agency. Duhamel, a native of Minot, has been the face of North Dakota and its pitchman since 2013. He has been paid more than $1 million from the state since then. “He’s a great ambassador for our state and cares about where he comes from,” Otte Coleman said. Duhamel was the honorary chairman of a fund that raised millions of dollars for victims of a 2011 flood in his hometown that swamped more than 4,000 homes and businesses. About 11,000 people were forced to evacuate. The home where Duhamel grew up and his sister’s family’s home were both severely damaged. He appealed to his fans on social media and on TV appearances to help the victims of the flood. His current two-year tourism deal expires in December. Otte Coleman said she expects Duhamel to sign an extension.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s debut of its new license plate failed to take off because a banner depicted on the plate was attached to the wrong end of the Wright Brothers’ historic first plane, the Wright Flyer. The new license plate illustrates rays of sunlight beaming into the sky, with a banner that reads “Birthplace of Aviation” draped across the horizon. But the banner, which should have been trailing behind the plane, was attached to its front. After the unveiling, Ohio officials said in a statement that they were aware of the mishap and that it would be corrected to show the banner trailing the plane before Ohioans upgrade their plates. Ohio isn’t the only entity to make this flighty error. The front of the Wright Flyer can easily be mistaken for its back because the plane’s propellers were located at the back, instead of the front. The plates are expected to land on the market Dec. 29.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye unexpectedly resigned from the post Friday, effective immediately, the state health department said. Department spokesperson Rachel Klein said Frye “felt it was time to move on” from leading the agency. His departure came a day after state Republican leaders, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, expressed outrage upon learning the health department in May issued a birth certificate with a nonbinary gender designation. The birth certificate was issued as part of a settlement with an Oklahoma-born Oregon resident. The settlement was reached under the administration of former state Attorney General Mike Hunter, Frye said. In a statement released by the department Friday, Frye lauded “the dedication, resilience and tenacity of the OSDH team.” “They have worked tirelessly over the last two years to ensure Oklahomans had access to not only COVID-19 testing, vaccinations and critical information, but to other life-saving services,” he said in the statement. Deputy Health Commissioner Keith Reed has been named interim commissioner of health, according to Kevin Corbett, state Secretary of Health and Mental Health.\n\nOregon\n\nThe Dalles: The massive Google data centers on the edge of this Columbia River town are triggering concerns about water usage. Now a critical part of modern computing, data centers help people stream movies, conduct transactions, post updates on social media, store trillions of photos and more. But a single facility can also churn through millions of gallons of water per day to keep hot-running equipment cool. Google wants to build at least two more data centers in The Dalles, worrying some residents who fear there eventually won’t be enough water for everyone – including for area farms and fruit orchards, which are by far the biggest users. The Dalles is the seat of Wasco County, which is suffering extreme and exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The region last summer endured its hottest days on record, reaching 118 degrees Fahrenheit in The Dalles. The new data centers wouldn’t be able to use Columbia River water and instead would take it from rivers and groundwater that has gone through the city’s water treatment plant. However, the snowpack in the nearby Cascade Range that feeds the aquifers varies wildly year-to-year, and glaciers are melting. Adding to the unease: The 15,000 town residents don’t know how much water the proposed data centers will use because Google calls it a trade secret.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The School District of Philadelphia is working to repatriate Native American skeletal remains found in a high school classroom closet this summer. A letter sent to parents of Central High School students Friday said the “human skeletal item” was previously used as a teaching aid and dated back to the 1850s. The district consulted with the Department of Interior, Temple University and other experts about how to handle the remains, Evelyn Nunez, the district’s chief of schools, wrote in the letter to parents. “The District is also working with these partners to return this person, who has been identified as a male Native American, to his home tribe,” she said. Central High School, founded in 1836, is the second-oldest continuously operating public high school in the country, but it is not alone in its history of using skeletal remains as learning tools. In a statement Friday, the district said the remains were likely used in teaching through the mid-1900s at the latest, but the district’s schools have not used skeletal remains in classrooms for more than a decade. The district has launched a search of inventories at all of its schools to make sure any other skeletal remains are identified, treated with respect and also repatriated if possible.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Legislature has created a website to post the proposals it’s receiving for spending federal funds to help the state recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Rhode Island was allocated $1.1 billion in American Rescue Plan funds. Democratic Gov. Dan McKee is urging the Legislature to start spending, saying Rhode Island is the only state in the Northeast that has not used any of its federal pandemic relief funding yet. The General Assembly created a section on its website for residents to see all of the ideas that are being suggested. The goal is to increase transparency. “With such a large infusion of federal funding, it is critical that the process of allocating these funds is done in a transparent manner that allows the public to access the information being shared with legislators,” House Speaker Joe Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement. “We encourage the public to be engaged so we use this money to its maximum benefit for Rhode Islanders.” Submitting a recommendation to the portal should not be viewed as a formal request for funding, and it does not guarantee a response, public hearing or appropriation from the General Assembly, the Legislature said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMount Pleasant: A widow is suing Charleston County two years after her husband died following a ketamine injection he received during an arrest. The complaint filed by Tabitha Eileen Britt earlier this month says the two paramedics who injected her husband, James Britt, with the sedative drug after he was handcuffed by Mount Pleasant police in 2019 weren’t authorized to do so under state law. The Post and Courier reports Tabitha Britt wants a judge to stop county paramedics from using ketamine to aid law enforcement without a medical reason. A police report says Mount Pleasant officers were dispatched Sept. 30, 2019, for a man urinating on the roadway. According to the lawsuit, one officer initially stopped to help James Britt change a car tire before she said she would arrest him for public intoxication. According to the complaint, police forced James Britt to the ground in a prone position, where he repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe. One paramedic who arrived at the scene then injected James Britt with 500 mg of ketamine, the maximum dose under county guidelines. The suit says James Britt stopped breathing minutes later; although he was resuscitated in the ambulance, he never regained consciousness and died less than three weeks later in the hospital.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nLead: A study that focuses on ways to cool streams during the hottest times of the year in an effort to preserve the trout population is yielding positive results, officials from the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks say. Jeremy Kientz, a fisheries biologist with the agency, has been working to discover ways to cool the waters, in a study that specifically focuses on French Creek in Custer State Park. He said it’s one of a few trout streams in the Black Hills that can reach temperatures up to 80 degrees for several hours a day, increasing the chances of trout mortality. “We’ve had a couple instances here in the Black Hills where we’ve had trout fish kills because of temperatures that are too high in the summertime,” Kientz said. “When the water temperature hits 80 degrees, and it stays there for a little while, the trout will die. Even at 75 degrees, trout shut down, and they don’t eat. So now you not only have a survival issue but a growth issue.” But working on ways to cool the streams is not easy, Kientz said. Building shade takes time, and dams have become unpopular, not to mention expensive. So Kientz said he has been working with mechanical engineers from North Dakota State University to build small pockets of cooled water where trout can seek refuge when temperatures rise, the Black Hills Pioneer reports.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: An area school district can continue requiring students to wear masks in school after a federal judge on Friday extended a ruling blocking an opt-out provision. The ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by the families of two children with disabilities who attend Williamson County schools. They claim Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order allowing parents to opt their children out of school mask mandates puts their children at risk and violates their educational rights. In the Friday opinion, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw found that “disabled students are at a significantly higher risk for severe infection and are exposed at a higher rate following” following Lee’s executive order. He called that “an irreparable harm” that justifies continuing to block the order. “The record before the Court establishes that temporary universal mask mandates adopted by the Williamson County and Franklin school systems have been, and likely would continue to be, effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19,” Crenshaw wrote. “Executive Order No. 84 violates federal law and must yield.” The ruling mirrors those by federal judges in Memphis and Knoxville, where Lee’s order is also blocked. As a result, school districts in Shelby, Williamson and Knox counties can continue to enforce universal mask policies.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Supreme Court is allowing the state law that bans most abortions to remain in place but has agreed to hear arguments in the case in early November. The justices said Friday that they will decide whether the Justice Department and abortion providers can sue in federal court over a law that Justice Sonia Sotomayor said was “enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of women seeking abortion care in Texas.” Answering that question will help determine whether the law should be blocked while legal challenges continue. The court is moving at an unusually fast pace that suggests it plans to make a decision quickly. Arguments are set for Nov. 1. The court’s action leaves in place for the time being a law that clinics say has led to an 80% reduction in abortions in the nation’s second-largest state. The justices said in their order that they were deferring action on a request from the Justice Department to put the law on hold. Sotomayor wrote that she would have blocked the law now. “The promise of future adjudication offers cold comfort, however, for Texas women seeking abortion care, who are entitled to relief now,” Sotomayor wrote. It takes just four justices to decide to hear a case.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A federal civil rights investigation released Thursday found widespread racial harassment of Black and Asian American students at a school district, including hundreds of documented uses of the N-word and other racial epithets over the past five years. The probe also found physical assaults, derogatory racial comments and harsher discipline for students of color at Davis School District, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. The district has agreed to take several steps as part of a settlement agreement, including a new department to handle complaints, more training and data collection. Black students throughout the district told investigators about similar experiences of white and non-Black students calling them the N-word, referring to them as monkeys or apes, and saying their skin was dirty or looked like feces, according to the department’s findings. Students also made monkey noises at their Black peers, repeatedly referenced slavery and lynching, and told Black students to “go pick cotton,” and “you are my slave.” The investigation found Black students were also disciplined more harshly than their white peers for similar behavior and were denied the ability to form student groups while supporting similar requests by other students.\n\nVermont\n\nGuilford: The state has erected a historical marker recognizing the life of Lucy Terry Prince, an African American poet who wrote what is thought to be the oldest known poem by an African American. The marker was unveiled this week at the Interstate 91 welcome center in Guilford. Prince and her husband lived in Guilford in the late 1700s. As a child, Lucy Terry was stolen from Africa and enslaved in Deerfield, Massachusetts, the marker says. Her poem “Bars Fight” tells the story of the 1746 attack on Deerfield settlers. The poem “endured in oral tradition for over 100 years before appearing on the front page of the Springfield Daily Republican in 1854,” the marker says. She became free after marrying Abijah Prince in 1756, and the couple settled on 100 acres in Guilford in 1769, according to the marker.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The city’s schools will close for the entire first week of November, including two days “in the interest” of workers’ mental health, the superintendent announced. Richmond Public Schools Superintendent Jason Kamras announced the change Wednesday, noting the stress schools employees are under, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. “Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve heard directly from dozens of teachers, principals, and support staff about how stressful this year has been,” Kamras said in a letter. “Many have shared that they’re on the brink of burning out – even leaving – and it’s only October.” Richmond schools were already set to be closed three days that week, for Election Day, Diwali and parent-teacher conferences. Kamras also announced changes to address three major stressors: doing too much, not enough time, and students “exhibiting significant trauma from the past 20 months.” There will be no new programs, initiatives or curricula, and the system is adding 100 lunch monitors to help free up teachers at lunch time, Kamras said. He also authorized principles to make changes needed to “hold independent teacher planning time more sacred.” Kamras said he aims to reallocate $3 million of federal relief funding to boost student mental health support.\n\nWashington\n\nPort Angeles: About 40 shipping containers tumbled into the Pacific Ocean in rough seas west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca entrance Friday, authorities said. The ship then caught fire Saturday as a result of powdered chemicals that had been spilled, The Seattle Times reports. The U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Northwest said on Twitter on Friday afternoon that the ship lost the containers when it listed to its side. A Coast Guard helicopter from Port Angeles was sent to the area, and the crew was monitoring 35 floating containers as they moved north. The ship was headed to Canada when the incident happened, officials said. Photos from the helicopter captured containers, with one group of three linked together, floating in the water, a Coast Guard Twitter post showed. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is located northwest of Seattle. “The ship is on fire and expelling toxic gas,” a navigation warning sent to area ships said, according to the Times. “Two fallen containers are floating in the vicinity of the vessel.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Top state officials on Friday said they would welcome three Maryland counties that inquired about becoming part of the Mountain State, even though the likelihood of the union is almost nonexistent. “We’re absolutely standing here with open arms,” West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said during a news conference that included state Senate President Craig Blair and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who also offered their support. Justice offered to call state lawmakers back for a special session to vote on a resolution that would add about 250,000 people in Garrett, Allegany and Washington counties in Maryland to West Virginia. Maryland officials representing the counties wrote letters dated Oct. 14 to Blair and Hanshaw expressing interest in joining West Virginia, news outlets report. The letters were signed by Maryland state Sen. George Edwards and Dels. Wendell Beitzel, Jason Buckel, Mike McKay and William Wivell. “The western areas of the state feel they’re being shortchanged in a lot of respects, and we had a lot of constituents approaching us … saying, ‘Why can’t we just join West Virginia?’ It’s just that simple,” Beitzel told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Friday halted the state’s fall wolf season two weeks before hunters were set to take to the woods, siding with wildlife advocacy groups who argued that holding the hunt would be unconstitutional. Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost issued a temporary injunction halting the season, which was set to begin Nov. 6. The order comes as part of a lawsuit that a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups filed in August seeking to stop the hunt and invalidate a state law authorizing annual seasons. Among other things, the coalition argued that the season is illegal because the Department of Natural Resources hasn’t updated its regulations setting up season parameters and has been relying on an emergency rule put in place shortly after then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a law in 2012 authorizing annual seasons and a wolf management plan that hasn’t been updated since 2007. Frost said the law creating the wolf season is constitutional on its face, but the DNR failed to create permanent regulations enacting it. The law gives the DNR great leeway in setting kill limits, hunting zone hours and the number of licenses, making it all the more important that the agency follow the regulatory process to ensure it doesn’t violate the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: COVID-19 has hospitalized more residents than at any point in the COVID-19 pandemic, with one public health officer saying the situation is “like a war zone” at one of the state’s biggest hospitals. Wyoming hospitals had 249 COVID-19 patients Thursday, topping the previous high of 247 in November. The vast majority weren’t vaccinated. Unvaccinated people have accounted for 98% of all new cases in Wyoming since May 1, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Wyoming’s surge coincides with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., currently about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower for COVID-19 inoculation. The strain on Wyoming hospitals, meanwhile, has been more prolonged than previously. Last fall and winter, hospitalizations stayed above 200 for about three weeks. This year, they have hovered around 200 since early September. Wyoming Medical Center in Casper has been treating about 30% of Wyoming’s COVID-19 patients but lately has been denying transfer requests. “It’s like a war zone,” the Casper area’s health officer, Dr. Mark Dowell, told a county health board Thursday. “The ICU is overrun, and there are a lot of patients being admitted.” Five Wyoming hospitals have at some point gone into crisis standards of care during the current surge.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/05/eel-powered-tree-skateboard-safety-red-light-herring-news-around-states/40764539/", "title": "Eel-powered tree, skateboard safety, red light on herring: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: Officials say a major project to repair the University of North Alabama Planetarium and Observatory should be complete by Jan. 1. The TimesDaily reports the landmark dome that covers the facility has been removed so crews can repair the concrete structure that supports its weight. Michael Gautney, assistant vice president of facilities administration and planning at UNA, says the repairs are needed because the concrete that supported the dome had cracked. Mel Blake, the planetarium-observatory director, says there were also problems with the original dome: It leaked, so the telescope had to be covered when it rains. Gautney says a new $33,000 dome was manufactured and assembled in Illinois to make sure everything worked, then taken apart and shipped to Alabama.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: An Alaska Native community airport has been unable to receive night flights or medevac flights because of disabled runway lights, officials say. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports officials noticed Quinhagak’s runway lights were not working properly in September. The damage to the lights became obvious when the nights became longer, officials said. “There are some that are pulled out or have popped out,” Quinhagak Tribal Administrator Patrick Cleveland says. Quinhagak has closed the airport to all night flights until the end of the month and possibly longer, officials say. The state Department of Transportation promised to supply the airport with emergency lights so medevac flights can land, Quinhagak Native Tribal Council President Darren Cleveland said in a social media post.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An appeals court says state law doesn’t permit judges to deny name-change requests made only because the requesting person wants the new name to reflect a gender transition. The Court of Appeals made that ruling Tuesday in a decision that overturned a Yuma County Superior Court judge’s denial of a name-change petition. The judge had ruled without elaborating that the requesting person hadn’t shown so-called good cause for the name-change request, and Court of Appeals said the judge’s stated reason for denying the request didn’t track with state law. The appellate court said Arizona’s law on changing names doesn’t require a showing of good cause. It also said the requester satisfied the law’s disclosure requirements related to any financial commitments, felony convictions, pending charges or criminal intentions.\n\nArkansas\n\nJonesboro: Officials have voted to rename a street in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. following months of spirited debate. The Jonesboro City Council on Monday approved converting Commercial Drive to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. The vote comes after the council formed a committee in June to address the issue after some council members opposed renaming Johnson Avenue after the civil rights leader. NAACP Craig County Chapter President Emma Agnew said the gesture is about the idea of inclusion and about honoring someone who gave people hope. The Arkansas Department of Transportation is planning a $32.2 million expansion of Commercial Drive from a two-lane road. The project calls for turning the street into a major arterial route that will link Johnson Avenue to Interstate 555.\n\nCalifornia\n\nIndio: The Indio International Tamale Festival returns Saturday and Sunday, bringing six stages with live entertainment, four beer and wine gardens, carnival rides, games, a farmers market, a food truck park and a kid’s zone with free crafts. Metalachi, the “world’s first and only” heavy metal mariachi band, will perform. The festival began in 1992 as a half-day event, with about 15 vendors and an estimated attendance of 2,500. It’s now hosted over two days and has been recognized globally, making it into the Guinness Book of World Records twice – for the World’s Largest Tamale in 1999 and for World’s Largest Tamale Festival in 2000, according to the festival website. At least 125,000 people are expected to attend the festival, which has earned its place on numerous best-of lists, including Food Network’s Top 10 list of “All-American Food Festivals” in 2002.\n\nColorado\n\nGrand Junction: The Bureau of Land Management has proposed transferring federal lands to the state to pay off a government debt dating back more than a century and is now seeking comment on the proposal. The Daily Sentinel reports BLM has proposed giving 28 square miles of federal lands and minerals and another 9 square miles of federal mineral estate to the state. Officials from the state Board of Land Commissioners say a petition was filed for land and mineral estate in lieu of land never previously received. Officials say the land proposed for exchange wouldn’t affect access to public lands for recreation. They say existing oil and gas leases would also remain in effect. Federal officials say the transfer would satisfy the debt it owed the state in 1876 after it joined the union. Officials say the state never got those lands because they were included in an Indian reservation or forest reserve or national forest.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has set Jan. 14 as the date to hold special elections to fill two vacancies in the Connecticut House of Representatives. One will fill the 48th Assembly District seat, which consists of portions of Colchester, Lebanon, Mansfield and Windham. The seat was most recently held by Linda Orange, who died Nov. 20. The other special election will fill the 132nd Assembly District seat, which consists of portions of Fairfield. The seat was most recently held by Brenda Kupchick, who resigned Nov. 22. By law, the governor is required to issue a writ of special election within ten days of a vacancy in the General Assembly. Those special elections must be held exactly 46 days after the date the writ was issued.\n\nDelaware\n\nSeaford: Dan Brissey, serving his fourth overseas tour with the National Guard, had a request for help: He’d made friends with a stray cat while serving in Afghanistan and felt he couldn’t leave her there, but the cost to bring the cat home to Delaware was steep at $3,000. The response was overwhelming. In just two days, donations to get Sully the kitten to Brissey’s home in Seaford burst past that $3,000 goal for a single cat, reaching nearly $8,000 by early Wednesday. The kitten is being cared for by Nowzad, in Kabul, Afghanistan’s only animal rescue. A portion of the donations made on Fundrazr.com are earmarked for Sully’s care and transportation. Extra funds will help the clinic’s operations and transportation for other military pet adoptees.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In an unprecedented move, the D.C. Council wants to expel a member over ethics violations. News outlets report an ad hoc committee made of 12 of the 13 council members voted Tuesday to recommend Jack Evans’ expulsion. The 13th member, Evans, was absent. He had been invited to speak on his behalf and call any witnesses. The Washington Post reports this is the first time the council has moved to eject a member. The push for Evans’ ousting comes after a third-party investigation determined he used his office to benefit private clients. Chairman Phil Mendelson says extreme circumstances are required for the council to intervene, noting that Evans’ conduct has shattered the public’s trust. He says the full council will receive the committee report this month, and an expulsion vote will follow.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State education officials and advocates say about 200,000 students could become ineligible for automatic free school lunches under a Trump administration proposal expected to reduce the number of food-stamp enrollees. News outlets that reported the figures this week say a finalized rule could come as soon as the end of the month. Children automatically qualify for free lunches if their families receive food stamps, but in July the Trump administration proposed tightening eligibility for what was formerly called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The U.S. Agriculture Department released an analysis in October showing nearly 1 million students nationwide could be affected. News outlets say affected Florida households would still be eligible for free- and reduced-price meals if they individually file an application for the National School Lunch Program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: The music studio that fused blues, country and other sounds into Southern rock is being reborn. Capricorn Sound Studios helped propel the Allman Brothers Band and other groups to stardom in the 1970s. Capricorn’s historic Studio A is reopening this month, after years of work by Mercer University and other supporters to restore and equip it with state-of-the-art technology. Mercer President William Underwood says he hopes the renovated studio will help preserve Macon’s place among cities that forged the nation’s music history. Macon-area officials hope the restoration – funded with help from two charitable foundations and other private donors – will help spur downtown redevelopment. The Capricorn Music Incubator will also provide 12 rehearsal rooms for musicians to hone their craft. “One day hopefully the next Otis Redding will come out of that incubator,” Underwood says.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A new county financing tool could be used to raise millions of dollars for a project to restore part of the Maui coastline damaged by erosion, officials say. The Maui County Planning Department and the Kahana Bay Steering Committee want to establish a community facilities district, The Maui News reports. The district would help fund the erosion project through a special tax on property owners within its boundaries, officials say. The plan was presented Monday to a Maui County Council committee, which did not take immediate action. The Kahana Bay coastline has been eroded by rising sea levels, frequent storms and seawalls built to protect condominiums, officials say. The beach revitalization project is projected to cost $19 million to $30 million, officials say.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Democratic state House Minority Leader Mat Erpelding announced Wednesday that he will resign Friday. The Boise lawmaker said in a resignation letter to Republican Gov. Brad Little and Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke that he’s joining the Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce. Democrats will offer three possible replacements for Little to choose from to serve the rest of Erpelding’s term in the next legislative session that begins in early January. Erpelding began representing Boise’s north end in 2012 and became House minority leader in 2017. Republicans hold super-majorities in the Idaho House and Senate. Erpelding, an articulate spokesman for his side, found areas where he could work with Republicans but did not shy from confrontations. This year he used House rules requiring every bill to be read in full when he felt Republicans were trying to rush through a redistricting bill.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The interim police superintendent has demoted a commander whom the city’s inspector general accused of directing on-duty officers under him to babysit his son with special needs. Interim Superintendent Charlie Beck’s demotion of Commander Anthony Escamilla to captain Tuesday is one of the first moves by Beck after Mayor Lori Lightfoot made her stunning announcement Monday that she was firing Superintendent Eddie Johnson because she said he lied to her about his behavior the night in October when he was found asleep in his running vehicle. The Chicago Tribune reports that the demotion comes nearly a year after Inspector General Joseph Ferguson’s office recommended the possible firing of Escamilla. At the time, Johnson chose instead to suspend Escamilla for seven days.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University plans to study the safety of electric skateboards and scooters in response to a rash of serious injuries on campus. Purdue President Mitch Daniels says the study would look at “the extreme safety issues” posed by electric skateboards, scooters and other personal electric vehicles. He says one student recently suffered a near-fatal accident while using an electric skateboard. Daniels says a task force will propose new policies for electric vehicles and study whether those should also include traditional, human-powered skateboards and bicycles. The panel is expected to look at possible speed limits, restrictions on hours of operation and helmet requirements. Purdue says campus police have received more than a dozen reports of serious personal injury accidents since the school year started.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A 20-year-old Iowa State University student has become the youngest woman elected to office in state history by winning election to the Ames City Council. Rachel Junck defeated incumbent businessman Chris Nelson in Tuesday’s runoff. Nelson, 47, was seeking his third term on the council. Junck, who is studying chemical engineering, has said it would be an honor to make Iowa history. “But being able to represent a whole different generation of people on the council would be, I think, a bigger honor,” she said before the election. Junck, the daughter of two Ames schoolteachers, grew up in the city that is home to Iowa State University. She received 712 votes to Nelson’s 587 votes Tuesday. The election results will have to be certified by Story County before the outcome is official.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A prisoner rights group says the Kansas Department of Corrections unfairly censors publications even with the adoption of a new policy and the elimination of a banned book list. The Human Rights Defense Center has cited a list of more than 200 books and magazines that administrators have recently blocked, including Richard Powers’ Pulitzer Prize winner “The Overstory.” In May, the center revealed that the prison system maintained a list of 7,000 banned books. Corrections Secretary Jeff Zmuda abolished the list after his arrival in July. He adopted a policy that allows for the review and appeal of confiscated publications earlier this year. Department spokesman Randy Bowman says the policy is based on the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on obscenity.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Knox: About 350 free Christmas trees are being offered to active military service members and their families after a tree lighting ceremony at an Army post this week. The Trees for Troops program is providing the trees to be distributed Thursday at Fort Knox. The tree lighting is set for 5:30 p.m. the same day at the Post Gazebo across from Brooks Parade Field. Fort Knox says units, organizations and schools as well as area businesses and municipalities also have provided 4-by-8-foot holiday cards surrounding Brooks Field. The trees will be distributed until 8 p.m. The event is free and open to the public. Free hot chocolate and cookies will be available.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLogansport: A 122-year-old hardware and department store that once saw a visit from Bonnie and Clyde is closing in northwest Louisiana. N.J. Caraway & Co. has been serving customers in Logansport since 1897. The DeSoto Parish store nestled on the bank of the Sabine River sells an eclectic collection of hardware, antiques, clothing, candles and much more. Store owner Janet Palmer tells KSLA-TV she’s ready to retire. She’s having health issues, and her husband died nine years ago. The couple had run the store for nearly 40 years. N.J. Caraway & Co. survived two fires and even received a visit from the notorious duo Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, looking to buy ammunition, which the store didn’t sell. The store’s final day of operations will be Dec. 28.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Federal fishing regulators are limiting the amount of herring that fishermen can catch off New England until the end of the year. Atlantic herring are the subject of a large fishing industry in the Northeast. They’re used for bait and food. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says it’s implementing a 2,000-pound herring possession limit per trip in the inshore Gulf of Maine until Dec. 31. The agency says it’s taking the step because 92% of the catch limit in the area has been harvested. NOAA says no herring fishing is allowed in the area from Jan. 1 to May 31, so the fishery won’t be able to fully resume in the inshore gulf until June. Herring are economically important in New England because they’re used as lobster bait.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby says she’s concerned about the integrity and credibility of about 305 city police officers, most of whom the department stands by. News outlets report Mosby on Tuesday presented a list of the officers to a state policing commission formed to identify department issues that fostered a corrupt police unit. She says the integrity concerns essentially mean those officers won’t be able to testify in court. The deputy commissioner of the department’s bureau that oversees misconduct investigations told the commission that most of the listed officers don’t have credibility issues. Brian Nadeau said the list mostly serves as a prosecutorial tool but agreed 22 of the listed officers shouldn’t be called to testify. Only two of those 22 officers remain at the department.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Young adults who had been in the custody of the state will maintain health insurance coverage until their 26th birthday under a new law. MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid program, will provide the coverage for the former foster youth. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker on Tuesday signed the bill that also seeks to improve the accuracy of health insurance provider directories. Supporters of the law say out-of-date and inaccurate directories make it difficult for people – especially individuals with behavioral health conditions – to find timely care. Health Care For All Executive Director Amy Rosenthal says maintaining health coverage is particularly challenging for young adults formerly involved with the Department of Children and Families. The new law is also designed to help families with children facing complex medical challenges.\n\nMichigan\n\nHoughton: Scientists say gray wolves relocated to Isle Royale National Park are adjusting nicely to their new surroundings and finding plenty of prey. Officials released findings Monday from observations of wolves that were captured on the mainland and taken to the Lake Superior park in the past year. Plans call for moving 20 to 30 wolves to Isle Royale to restore a population that had nearly disappeared because of inbreeding. The park’s current total is 17. The radio-collared wolves were monitored over the summer by park staffers and researchers with the State University of New York. They studied remains of animals the wolves had eaten and concluded that more than half of the prey were moose. But the wolves also feasted on beavers and snowshoe hares. Natural resources chief Mark Romanski says the prey study is part of an effort to determine how wolf restoration will affect the park’s ecosystems.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: An environmental group has put the state Department of Natural Resources on notice that it plans to sue the agency for failing to protect Canada lynx from trappers. The Center for Biological Diversity filed a 60-day notice Wednesday as required by federal law before it can file a lawsuit to try to force the state to follow the Endangered Species Act. The notice says Minnesota has failed to comply with a 2008 federal court order meant to protect lynx from being caught by trappers seeking other species. The group says state and federal agencies have documented captures of 16 lynx over the past decade in traps that were set for other species in northern Minnesota, including six that resulted in deaths of the rare cats. The center cites a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report that puts Minnesota’s lynx population at between 50 and 200.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: A statue of slain civil rights leader Vernon Dahmer now sits outside the Forrest County Courthouse. The bronze sculpture, created by artists Vixon Sullivan and Ben Watts, was commissioned in 2018 by the Forrest County Board of Supervisors to honor Dahmer, who was killed for trying to get black people registered to vote. Dahmer was a farmer and NAACP leader who was killed when Ku Klux Klan members firebombed his home after Klansmen learned residents could pay their poll taxes at the Dahmer family grocery store next to their home. His widow, Ellie Dahmer, who was at the courthouse in Hattiesburg on Tuesday surrounded by family, said she was impressed by the statue’s likeness to her late husband and appreciated its placement at the courthouse. The sculpture now sits atop a wall that bears Vernon Dahmer’s motto: “If you don’t vote, you don’t count.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The state became a focal point for officer-involved shootings after Michael Brown’s killing in Ferguson in 2014, yet only a few of the state’s police agencies submit data to an FBI program that tracks those shootings. A St. Louis Post-Dispatch analysis has found that the voluntary National Use-of-Force Data Collection effort has been slow to catch on, even among St. Louis-area police departments. The program gathers information on fatal and nonfatal shootings and records instances when officers fire their weapons but strike no one. Proponents say the data collection is essential in understanding how officers make life-and-death decisions. They say the information also can inform police leaders about how to better train officers. The FBI says only 13 of about 600 agencies in Missouri had submitted a report through Nov. 22.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: This year marked the city’s snowiest fall on record, according to the National Weather Service. The meteorological fall begins Sept. 1 and ends Nov. 30. In 2019, Great Falls received 60.4 inches of snow in that span, more than four times the normal of 13.4 inches and shattering the 1985 record of 29.1 inches, according to the weather service. Atmospheric conditions lined up perfectly at the right time and right place for a snowy fall, says Francis Kredensor, a meteorologist with NWS. Winter storms walloped north-central Montana in September and October. Icing on the cake came over Thanksgiving, when 17.2 inches fell between Tuesday, Nov. 26, and Saturday, Nov. 30. Great Falls finished with 24.1 inches of snow in November, the second-snowiest November on record and just shy of the 2005 record of 24.9 inches.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Leaders of this Omaha suburb have voted down a measure that would have allowed the firing of elected officials for engaging in misconduct or leaking information from closed-door meetings. The Bellevue City Council on Tuesday voted 5-1 to approve an ordinance defining punishments for the city’s mayor and council members if his or her conduct was “severe or egregious,” the Omaha World-Herald reports. Those punishments include reprimands and the loss of an official’s seat on a committee or task force. But the council voted 4-2 to withdraw a previously floated proposal that could have removed offending elected officials from office. That proposal had drawn criticism from residents who said voters should determine who serves or is removed from elected office.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A mother says she received a $3,000 bill after doctors removed a plastic doll shoe stuck in her 3-year-old daughter’s nose. KTNV-TV reports Lucy Branson stuck two pink Polly Pocket plastic doll shoes up her nose – one in each nostril. Her mother, Katy Branson, says she was able to remove one of the shoes, but even urgent care couldn’t reach the second shoe. Branson says she then took her daughter to Dignity Health St. Rose Dominican Siena Campus in Henderson, where physicians used a tweezer-like tool to successfully remove the shoe in seconds. The Branson family says they initially received a bill for $3,000, but the charge was reduced to $1,700 because of a high-deductible medical policy.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has signed an executive order preparing the state for future offshore wind development. The order signed Tuesday establishes four advisory boards focused on fisheries and endangered species, workforce and economic development, offshore industries, and infrastructure. “New Hampshire recognizes the tremendous potential that offshore wind power has to offer,” Sununu said in a statement. The boards will report to a a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Offshore Renewable Task Force, which has its first meeting Dec. 12 at the University of New Hampshire. The order also instructs several government agencies to study and report on greenhouse gas reduction potential of offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine and opportunities for New Hampshire to attract offshore wind supply chain operations.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal issued a handful of new directives Wednesday to law enforcement, aimed at overhauling how police and prosecutors handle investigations, including the release of video from incidents involving officers. Grewal unveiled the directives in Newark alongside State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan, other law enforcement officers and prosecutors. Among the changes are a presumption in favor of publicly releasing any video recordings that show “serious” use of force by authorities. The new rule also includes the release of third-party footage captured by surveillance cameras or a smartphone. The change is aimed at promoting transparency and trust with the public, Grewal said. The directives stemmed in part from requests for clarity from stakeholders across the state, Grewal said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city is taking more heat for flaws in its crime statistics. The Albuquerque Journal reports the numbers released in July and at the end of 2018 have been revised dramatically to include hundreds – and in some cases thousands – more incidents than were reported initially. The city blames a lack of staffing at the records unit that prepared the data and a software glitch. Reasons for the inaccuracies come two months after the Associated Press reported that the city amended many of its midyear statistics, noting that several categories of crimes had declined by far lesser percentages than originally touted by city officials. The corrected figures showed aggravated assaults declined by just 7.5%, not 33%. Rape decreased 3%, not 29%, and auto theft decreased 22%, not 39%.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The mayor signed a bill Wednesday that transfers control of the nation’s largest public burial ground from the correction department to the parks department. More than 1 million people are buried on Hart’s Island just off the Bronx. The island has until now been controlled by the Department of Correction, with graves dug by prisoners of the nearby Rikers Island jail. Family members who have identified loved ones buried there have complained that getting there by an occasional ferry has been difficult. But city officials promise to ease the trip in the future. The council voted last month to transfer control of the potter’s field.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPittsboro: The United Daughters of the Confederacy has lost a bid to put a Confederate monument back on the grounds of a courthouse after county officials removed it. WRAL reports Superior Court Judge Susan Bray issued the ruling Monday, more than a week after the monument was removed from the Chatham County Courthouse grounds. The UDC had tried to block the removal, saying a 2015 state law mandates that the statue be returned. The local chapter donated the monument to Chatham County in 1907. The removal came months after Winston-Salem officials removed a Confederate statue from land there that had passed into private hands. Protesters have also torn down monuments at a Durham courthouse and on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: A brigadier general and retired dean at the Air Force Academy will be the next president at the University of North Dakota. The state Board of Higher Education on Tuesday named Andrew Armacost to take over for Mark Kennedy, a former Minnesota congressman who earlier this year was named president at the University of Colorado. Armacost served more than 30 years on active duty and spent 20 years both a professor and executive at the Air Force Academy, including stints as dean of faculty and chief academic officer. Armacost is the 13th president of the university, all of whom have been men. The other finalists were Laurie Stenberg Nichols, former president at University of Wyoming, and David Rosowsky, former provost at the University of Vermont.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A proposal aimed at outlawing abortions would present some doctors in the state with a choice between facing potential criminal prosecution or attempting a procedure considered medically impossible – the reimplantation of an ectopic pregnancy. A doctor who terminates a pregnancy could face murder charges under the Republican-sponsored bill unless it is done to save a woman’s life. Even then, the proposal says doctors could be prosecuted unless they do whatever they can to save the “unborn child” as well, including trying to move an ectopic pregnancy into the woman’s uterus. Such a pregnancy involves a fertilized egg implanted outside the uterus, which can lead to life-threatening complications for the woman. Reimplantation in such pregnancies isn’t physiologically possible, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt says he opposes a proposed state question that would restrict prosecutors from using previous felony convictions to enhance sentences in certain criminal cases. In a speech Tuesday to the Urban League of Greater Oklahoma City, Stitt said that while he supports criminal justice reforms, he’s concerned about enshrining the changes in the state Constitution, The Oklahoman reports. A bipartisan group of business, religious and political leaders called Oklahomans for Sentencing Reform launched the initiative last month, saying they’ve seen years of legislative inaction on the issue, largely because of strong opposition from Oklahoma prosecutors. Once the initiative is approved, supporters must gather nearly 178,000 signatures in a 90-day window for the proposal to appear on the ballot as State Question 805.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: State Police failed to reveal DNA evidence that could have exonerated a man who has spent nine years in prison for the killing of his girlfriend, a judge ruled in overturning the conviction. Nicholas McGuffin has consistently maintained his innocence in the death of Leah Freeman, who was 15 when she disappeared from her hometown of Coquille, Oregon, in 2000. Her body was found in the woods five weeks later. McGuffin was convicted by a 10-2 jury verdict of manslaughter in 2011, even though there were no witnesses and no evidence tying McGuffin to the crime. “Mr. McGuffin’s case proves the importance of understanding forensic evidence and the need to get it right,” said Janis Puracal, lead attorney in McGuffin’s post-conviction team. She said McGuffin has spent nine years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Slot play is such big business in the state that it helps to subsidize horse racing. A USA TODAY Network investigation revealed that Pennsylvania is not alone in subsidizing the U.S. horse racing industry, keeping it alive while thousands of horses die gruesome deaths on the nation’s tracks. But the Keystone State does push it the most money. Since 2010, the state’s Pari-Mutuel Benchmark Reports show horse racing has been given an average of $228 million annually, with $242 million coming in 2019. That subsidy doesn’t come from tax dollars but from slot play. Helping to save the horse racing industry was so important that when legislators came up with the law to approve casinos, it was written into the name. Pennsylvania’s Race Horse Development and Gaming Act stipulates that a percentage of slot money must go toward horse racing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A self-driving shuttle service has taken more than 25,000 trips during its first six months of operating in the state, according to the Department of Transportation. The Boston Globe reports transportation officials released data for the first six months of Providence’s “Little Roady” one-year pilot program, with an average of 146 free shuttle trips daily in November. That’s up from an average of 137 trips daily in October and 125 in June. An agency spokesman says officials are waiting to see data over a longer period of time before reaching any conclusions but are pleased that people are using it. The free service, the first of its kind in the state, operates daily on a roughly 5-mile route between Olneyville Square and Providence Station. There’s no public transit along the full route.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A record number of animals were killed during takeoffs and landings at the area’s airport last year. Data from the Federal Aviation Administration shows 30 animal strikes happened at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in 2018, three times more than the average of nine wildlife strikes reported per year over the past two decades at the airport. Airport officials say the higher numbers reflect better reporting. The airport ranks fourth in the state for wildlife strikes and is the second-busiest air traffic hub in South Carolina. Charleston International, the busiest airport in the state, has had the most documented strikes since 1999. Birds, deer and coyotes are among the animals killed in the incidents. Only one human fatality has been documented during such accidents in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday offered her budget proposals for the next year while acknowledging that money is tight and instructing state agencies to reduce spending. While delivering her budget address, the Republican governor told legislators to brace for slower economic growth amid disaster recovery from storms, uncertainty amid the 2020 election and lower farm spending during a trade war with China. In just a few weeks, legislators will be in session to take up her proposals and hear from state agencies as they craft a final budget for the fiscal year that starts in July. Noem said that 2019 has been a “difficult year” with “the largest natural disasters in our state’s history,” including tornadoes, blizzards and floods. State revenue is running nearly $6 million behind projections this fiscal year. The state will also lose about $20 million in revenue when an internet tax comes to an end next year.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Visitors to the Tennessee Aquarium may be shocked to learn that an electric eel named Miguel Wattson is lighting up a Christmas tree. A special system connected to Miguel’s tank enables his shocks to power strands of lights on a nearby tree, according to a news release. Miguel releases low-voltage blips of electricity when he is trying to find food, aquarist Kimberly Hurt says. That translates to a rapid, dim blinking of the Christmas lights. When he is eating or excited, he emits higher voltage shocks, which cause bigger flashes. Wattson has his own Twitter account where he shares tweets generated by his sparky self, courtesy of coding by Tennessee Tech University’s iCube center. The aquarium hopes the Christmas tree will spark love and appreciation for the unusual freshwater fish.\n\nTexas\n\nEdinburg: A local judge in South Texas has ordered supporters of President Donald Trump not to build their planned private border wall on a section of land near the Rio Grande. State District Judge Keno Vasquez on Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order against We Build the Wall, which raised $25 million after promising to build its own private barrier. Vasquez set a Dec. 17 hearing for We Build the Wall and its founder, Brian Kolfage, to appear in court in Edinburg. We Build the Wall announced on Facebook last month that it was starting construction on private land next to the Rio Grande, the river that separates the U.S. and Mexico in Texas. It posted videos that showed a construction foreman describing plans to install posts a short distance from the riverbank. The announcement drew immediate criticism.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is reaffirming its support for refugees and encouraging members to create welcoming communities for the newcomers. The Utah-based faith said in a statement posted online that it has “great concern and compassion” for people around the world “who have fled their homes seeking relief from violence, war, or religious persecution.” The embrace of refugees by the religion has roots in the history of the faith, which counted many immigrants among its early members. Mormons also reflect back on their own ancestors, pioneers who crossed the country looking for a place to settle and practice their beliefs. The support for refugees from the church as well as Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, comes as President Donald Trump has limited the number of refugees entering the U.S.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state saw a record year for nesting loons in 2019, with the 101 pairs being the most since the state began tracking loons in 1978, the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife said Wednesday. Seventy-five of the pairs produced 115 chicks, said Eric Hanson of the Vermont Center for Ecostudies, which has been working with the state on loon recovery. Of those chicks, 87 survived through August, ahead of the five-year survival average of 73%, he said. Loons, known for their eerie calls, were removed from the state’s endangered species list in 2005 following decades of recovery efforts. Biologists say one of the main threats still facing loons as they continue to recover is human disturbance during the breeding season. Morin said that many lakes where loons nest are surrounded by signs asking people to give them space. Morin is also asking people to avoid lead fishing tackle.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: City officials have rebuffed pleas by gun advocates asking it to declare Roanoke a so-called Second Amendment sanctuary. Mayor Sherman Lea on Monday announced at a packed City Council meeting that he sees no benefit in validating what the U.S. Constitution already guarantees. The declaration to a room mostly filled with people wearing stickers claiming “guns save lives” was met with shouted comments, including “we will not comply.” Gun advocates across Virginia have pushed localities to declare themselves gun rights sanctuaries after November’s elections put Democrats in control of the Statehouse, news outlets report. More than two dozen counties have passed such resolutions, including Roanoke County.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state’s commissioner of public lands has released a proposal Monday to raise some $63 million each year to prevent and fight wildfires. Money for the fund will come from a surcharge of $5 per year on each policy sold by property and casualty insurance companies across the state. Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz estimated it will cost the average household just over $1 per month, based on one homeowner’s policy and two auto policies. “That’s cheaper than a Bud Light,” Franz said. “By sharing the burden, we acknowledge that wildfire effects all of us and minimize the cost to each household.” The bill would be the largest investment Washington has ever made to expand its wildfire team and restore the health of forests, Franz said. The bill is designed to “reclaim the clear, blue summer skies we know and love,” Franz said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWellsburg: The state has received a $1 million federal grant for a flood control project in the city. The West Virginia Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management announced the Federal Emergency Management Agency grant Tuesday. Officials say the project will expand the capacity of the city’s sewer lines to better reroute water and debris to a nearby river. The plan is to reduce future flood damage in Wellsburg and allow other post-disaster resources to be directed elsewhere, state emergency management Director Mike Todorovich said. The funding comes as part of a presidential disaster declaration after a 2016 flood killed 23 people and damaged hundreds of buildings in the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A new sampling of a batch of wells in southwestern Wisconsin found a majority contaminated with fecal matter from people, pigs and cows. Scientists tested 34 private wells in Grant, Iowa and Lafayette counties in mid-August and found 25, or 73%, were contaminated with human or livestock manure. The wells are a subset of 840 wells sampled in November 2018 and April 2019. About 32% showed evidence of bacterial or nitrate pollution. Researchers have begun testing smaller subsets of those wells to gather more details. Tests on an initial 35-well subset in April showed 91% were contaminated with human or livestock manure. Lafayette County officials in November accused media outlets of reporting 91% of the entire region’s wells were contaminated. They threatened to prosecute journalists who reported on the second round of tests without quoting a county news release verbatim but later backed off amid a firestorm of criticism.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Legislators have released a report saying state lawmakers and their staff have handled increasingly intensive workloads in the past few years. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the state Legislative Service Office staff released the report Monday saying legislative committees work about 327 days of the year, with less than 20% of that during the actual 59-day legislative session. Officials say only New Mexico meets more often out-of-session. Officials say the report builds on conversations about increasing compensation as workloads also increase. Officials say Wyoming lawmakers are some of the lowest-paid in the country, but the Legislature has said rates should remain low in the spirit of public service. Officials say staffing has also increased but not in pace with time spent on legislative activities by Wyoming legislators.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/05"}]}

The Alabama Department of Public Health said child care facilities will be allowed to open but must keep the number of children in any room or other enclosed space below 12. The change followed an order Thursday that prohibited gatherings of 25 people or more and mandated closing child day care centers, preschools, schools and senior citizen centers. Dining in restaurants and bars also was prohibited, with only takeout ordering allowed. Health officials said the goal of slowing disease transmission is to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday clarified that limits on public gatherings did not apply to work and workplace events.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The mayor has announced his third emergency order in response to the coronavirus pandemic as more cases of COVID-19 are confirmed in the state and the city’s supply of swabs needed to test for the disease runs low. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz issued the “hunker down” order Friday, telling residents to stay at home as much as possible, KTVA-TV reports. The order is effective from Sunday evening until March 31. On Saturday, the mayors of Ketchikan, Saxman and the Ketchikan Gateway Borough in southeast Alaska issued a joint proclamation telling residents to stay at home as much as possible. As in Anchorage, grocery stores and other essential businesses will remain open. As of Saturday night, the state has 15 cases of people with the coronavirus, according to the John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. “I’m asking people to do the right thing,” Berkowitz said at a news conference Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A second person stricken with the coronavirus has died in the state, which now has 152 confirmed cases, authorities said Sunday. The Arizona Department of Health Services and Maricopa County Department of Public Health said the latest man who died was in his 70s and had underlying health conditions. The state’s first reported death from COVID-19 was announced Friday. Authorities said that man was a city of Phoenix employee in his 50s who also had underlying health conditions. “As testing increases, we expect the number of positive cases to continue rising,” Gov. Doug Ducey said in a Twitter post Sunday. “It’s important that everyone takes this seriously.” Ducey announced a series of executive orders Thursday including shutting down bars and dine-in options in counties with confirmed cases, designed to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state rose by nearly 50, including more than 40 residents and staff of nursing homes, officials said Sunday. The state Department of Health reported that 165 people have tested positive for the illness caused by the coronavirus, up from 118 on Saturday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said at a news conference that this was the largest daily increase in diagnosed cases in the state and comes as testing is ramping up. The vast majority of people who contract the virus recover within weeks. It causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but it can lead to more severe illness, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems. Dr. Nathaniel Smith, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health, said 19 people have been hospitalized with COVID-19, and six have been on a ventilator at various points.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Most Californians stayed at home on a Saturday unlike any its 40 million residents had ever seen before. Less than 48 hours after Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an unprecedented stay-at-home order to help curb the coronavirus spread, shopping centers and streets were empty. Churches were closed. Playgrounds deserted. However, stores and farmer markets were bustling, and many people took advantage of the beautiful spring weather and rushed to the outdoors. At beaches and parks, not everyone heeded calls to practice social distancing, prompting Newsom to call them out. “Those young people are still out there on the beaches thinking it’s time to party. It’s time to grow up, time to wake up,” he said at an evening news conference. “Time to recognize that it’s not just about the old folks; it’s about your impact on their lives. Don’t be selfish.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Hotels, motels and vacation rentals at the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park are closing to help stem the spread of the coronavirus as the tourism-dependent community discourages people from visiting. Under an order taking effect at noon Monday, all short-term lodging will be closed in Estes Park and the surrounding area. The order is set to stay in effect through April 17. Local workers, long-term residents of short-term facilities and people who are quarantined are exempt. The age and health of a significant number of the area’s population is at risk of having serious complications from COVID-19, and the move came at the urging of Estes Park’s hospital, according to an announcement from the town and Larimer County. At least six people have died because of the coronavirus in Colorado.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont urged residents to sign up for cellphone alerts Sunday, saying he will deliver a recorded message to more than 4 million phone numbers through the state’s CTAlert system about the coronavirus. The message from the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Hartford will urge all residents to stay home and will be accompanied by a text message with a link to Connecticut’s coronavirus website. In Greenwich, First Selectman Fred Camillo ordered all town parks and beaches closed as of 8 p.m. Sunday to keep people from congregating. There were more than 8,000 visitors to one town park Saturday, he said. Meanwhile, a nursing home resident in his 80s is the state’s fifth resident to die from the coronavirus, Lamont said Saturday. So far, 223 people in the state have been diagnosed with the virus, including 43 hospitalized for treatment.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Public health officials have confirmed 47 coronavirus cases in the state as of Sunday morning. A new round of testing will begin Monday at undisclosed locations in all three Delaware counties. As the number of cases continues to rise, state officials have instituted increasingly stringent guidelines and restrictions in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Gov. John Carney ordered Delaware beaches to close Saturday in response to packed beaches the day before, which was unseasonably warm. Many beach towns announced their own restrictions, including the closure of the Rehoboth Beach boardwalk, where businesses can now only offer takeout or delivery. “If people don’t listen to the guidance, if they don’t listen to what the governor’s saying, he has to impose additional restrictions,” Carney’s spokesman, Jonathan Starkey, said Saturday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Health Department officials say four members of the district’s Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department have now tested positive for coronavirus, WUSA-TV reports. Officials said they are in the process of contacting anyone who had contact with the individuals to advise they self-quarantine. “This is a reminder of the heroic work our first responders are carrying out during these unprecedented times,” said Gregory Dean, the department’s chief. Washington, D.C., is under a state of emergency, with 39 cases of coronavirus reported in the district, prompting schools to close until April 1 and the government to operate on a modified schedule to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: More than 720 people in Florida have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday as he resisted an official’s call to issue a statewide “stay-at-home” order. The bulk of the coronavirus cases have been in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. There have been more than 11 deaths statewide, he said, including a third death at a Broward County nursing home. More mobile testing sites are coming online, and hundreds more are being tested each day, DeSantis said during a news conference Saturday afternoon in Tallahassee. DeSantis said new testing sites at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando and the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens will open next week. Also Saturday, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told residents to brace for a “stay-at-home order” in coming days. “It will be soon; I would be surprised if it’s not by Monday,” Castor told reporters Saturday. “Time is of the essence.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Three additional deaths were attributed to the coronavirus Sunday, bringing the total to 23, with 600 confirmed cases reported statewide, according to health officials. While schools and colleges statewide have been closed, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has refrained from ordering restaurants and other businesses to shut down, leaving local governments to decide whether and how to impose restrictions aimed at slowing the outbreak. The 23 people who have died from COVID-19 in Georgia range in age from 42 to 85, and at least 19 of them had underlying conditions, according to Sunday’s Georgia Department of Health update. Dougherty County, where Albany is the county seat, appears to be particularly hard-hit, with four dozen confirmed cases and six deaths. Local officials there ordered residents to stay home unless they’re going to work, buying food, seeking medical care or exercising, and they urged people to report anyone seen violating the shelter-in-place order.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor has instituted a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine starting Thursday of all people traveling to the state as part of efforts to fight the spread of coronavirus. The order applies to returning residents as well as visitors. It applies to all arrivals at Hawaii airports from the continental U.S. and international destinations and extends to other private and commercial aircraft. Returning residents must quarantine themselves at home, Gov. David Ige’s office said. Visitors must quarantine themselves in their hotel room or rented lodging. People under quarantine may only leave their homes for medical emergencies or to seek medical care, the governor’s office said. They cannot visit public spaces such as pools, fitness centers or restaurants. Failure to follow the order is a misdemeanor and punishable by a maximum fine of $5,000, or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both, the governor’s office said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state House ended its legislative session Friday after balancing fears of spreading the coronavirus with potential vetoes of several bills representatives will now be powerless to override. The House voted 32-28 to end the session a day after the Senate went home. They would have needed to stay five more days to wait out a veto decision by Republican Gov. Brad Little. “Under ordinary circumstance, we’d have stayed and let, and I believe the Senate would have stayed, and let the five days toll,” said Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke. The coronavirus “caused enough concern that has made people wonder about the wisdom of going home and coming back on Monday.” One bill that could be vetoed bans transgender people from changing the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a federal court ruling a previous Idaho ban was unconstitutional.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker criticized the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic Sunday, saying the state hasn’t received enough medical supplies, prompting an angry response from President Donald Trump. Pritzker said Illinois got a recent supply, but it was a fraction of what was requested from the federal government. The first-term Democrat, who has issued a statewide “stay at home order” amid the pandemic, said Illinois is buying supplies from the open market, as are other states also in need of supplies. “We’re all competing against each other,” Pritzker told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “This should have been a coordinated effort by the federal government.” Trump, who has said repeatedly that his administration is not to blame for the growing pandemic, lashed out on Twitter, saying governors should not be “blaming the federal government for their own shortcomings.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state reported two new deaths from the coronavirus Sunday, bringing the total number of deaths statewide to six, public health officials said. Indiana has recorded 201 total cases, including 76 new cases announced Sunday. Of those, the highest number was in Marion County, which reported 35 new cases, followed by Hamilton County, which reported eight cases. Gov. Eric Holcomb on Friday delayed Indiana’s May 5 primary election until June 2. But he said he would need to see more signs of widespread spread of the virus before taking action such as the governors of California, Illinois and New York state in ordering nearly all residents to stay in their homes.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Health officials have confirmed 23 new cases of COVID-19 to bring the state’s total Saturday to 68 – up more than 50% from the day before. Johnson County reported five new cases, Polk County had four, Linn County had three, and Allamakee and Black Hawk counties each reported two new cases, the Iowa Department of Public Health said in a news release. The counties of Dubuque, Fayette, Henry, Muscatine, Pottawattamie, Story and Washington each had one new case. Those infected included six who are 61 years or older, nine who are 41 to 60 years old, and eight who are 18 to 40. The new numbers came a day after Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a state emergency declaration that includes the temporary suspension of penalties and interest on late property tax payments, prevents some home evictions, and allows bars and restaurants to sell unopened bottles of alcohol for consumption off premises.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Residents will be able to get medicine without an in-person visit to the doctor during the coronavirus crisis under a new executive order that Gov. Laura Kelly announced Sunday. Kelly, a Democrat, announced two new orders aimed at temporarily expanding health care access. She said in a statement that the orders “will make sure Kansas families can access needed care and supplies until we have weathered this storm.” Fifty-five cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, are now confirmed in Kansas. They include two deaths. One was announced in Johnson County on Saturday. The state’s first death from the virus, a Kansas City-area nursing home resident in Wyandotte County, was reported March 12. Another executive order issued by Kelly eases motor carrier rules and regulations such as weight restrictions. Kelly said the goal is to allow for quicker delivery of resources to address the pandemic.\n\nKentucky\n\nFranklin: Gov. Andy Beshear announced Saturday that a third person has died from the coronavirus as the total number of confirmed cases in the state increased to nearly 90. Beshear said the 67-year-old Anderson County man who died had several other health problems. “None of us have liked that this has happened, but we need to think about his family and provide all the support to him that we can,” he said. The Democratic governor also urged residents to continue social distancing in order to prevent COVID-19 cases as much as possible. He said members of the public should pursue assistance if they need as the virus continues to spread across the state, urging that there “is no stigma” to doing so. “Be that good neighbor,” Beshear said. “Every time there is a group where large groups are not absolutely necessary, we allow this coronavirus to spread.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has issued a statewide “stay at home” directive, ordering all 4.6 million people in Louisiana to stay at home starting at 5 p.m. Monday unless they’re performing an essential task like getting food or medicine. Workers in grocery stores, pharmacies, doctors’ offices and other critical infrastructure are exempt from the governor’s directive. “The bottom line is we are in a race against time when it comes to this coronavirus and its rapid spread in Louisiana,” Edwards said Sunday. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell had issued a similar order for that city two days ago. As of Sunday, coronavirus infections in Louisiana have climbed to more than 830. Twenty people in the state have died of COVID-19, state health officials said. Edwards warned that the state was on a similar trajectory in cases to Italy, the virus has overwhelmed hospitals, and Louisiana’s health system could soon be overloaded with patients.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Concerns about social distancing pushed the state to postpone the start of its season for commercial baby eel fishing by at least two weeks, officials said. The season for baby eels, called elvers, was scheduled to begin Sunday. It’s one of the most lucrative fisheries in the state. The baby eels are used as seed stock by Asian aquaculture companies and can fetch more than $2,000 per pound at the docks. But Maine Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher said Friday that the nature of the elver fishery makes it “impossible to follow social distancing recommendations,” such as maintaining 6 feet of distance from other people as part of an effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the state jumped by more than a dozen from Friday to Saturday to 70.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: The mayor of the state’s most popular beach destination wants vacationers to postpone their trips as the state attempts to combat the spread of the new coronavirus. “We’re not encouraging people to come,” Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan told WBAL-TV on Saturday. “We don’t want them to be here and contract anything while they were down here in Ocean City, even if that’s possible.” Gov. Larry Hogan has reduced the permissible number of people statewide at gatherings from 50 to 10. He said this week that some people were still holding parties and cookouts and large gatherings, in violation of state law. Meehan said Ocean City will be enforcing all of Hogan’s initiatives: “We’re hoping people will wait for those good times to come back before they travel to the beach.” Maryland health officials reported 190 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Saturday, about 40 more than was reported Friday. Two people have died.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state reported its second virus-related death Saturday night as it prepared to open hundreds of day care sites for the children of medical professionals, emergency workers and others who are expected to keep working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second person in Massachusetts to died from a coronavirus-related illness was a Middlesex County woman in her 50s who had a preexisting condition, a release from the state health department said. On Friday, a Suffolk County man in his 80s was announced as the first person in the state to die from related illness. Gov. Charlie Baker announced Saturday that more than 300 sites will open Monday, with more to follow later. The rest of the state’s child care facilities have been ordered to shut down to help prevent spread of the coronavirus. More than 520 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday that the state needs the federal government to provide not only more test kits and masks but also clear guidance on how best to fight the spread of the coronavirus. “We’re all building the airplane as we fly it right now. We’re doing the best that we can. We’re going to continue to be aggressive, and we’re continually monitoring what the next move we can make is,” she said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is – we’re going to do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” She said she doesn’t want to fight with the White House but said a point will come in which failures will need to be examined. Michigan has reported 787 cases in total of COVID-19. Eight people have died.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state’s number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus rose to 169 on Sunday, up 32 from a day earlier. The state has had one death, a Ramsey County resident in their 80s who died Thursday. That person came in contact with an infected family member who had a history of international travel, said Kris Ehresmann, the Minnesota Department of Health’s infectious disease director. The person also had underlying medical conditions, she said. Sunday’s update noted that the virus had been confirmed in two new counties, Cass and LeSueur. Ehresmann told reporters during a conference call Sunday afternoon that 17 patients have been hospitalized so far. Ten remain hospitalized, including five in intensive care. The other seven are recovering at home. The 169 infected patients’ ages range from 10 to 94, Ehresmann said. Thirty-four health care workers have been infected, she added.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Confirmed coronavirus infections climbed to more than 200 in Mississippi, and the governor announced plans to provide quicker access to unemployment benefits for residents affected by the outbreak. The more than 200 cases were reported as of 6 p.m. Saturday, according to state health department figures updated Sunday. A single COVID-19 death has been reported in the state. Gov. Tate Reeves on Saturday took action to help relieve burdens on the state’s workforce, according to a news release. He signed an executive order instructing the Mississippi Department of Employment Security to expedite payments to unemployed workers and relax collection requirements on employers. The governor also suspended collection activity, including enrollment of liens and tax garnishments.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state rose to 90 Sunday, including at least five cases tied to one suburban St. Louis preschool. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is up from 75 on Saturday, according to the state health department. Three people have died in Missouri, one each in Boone, Jackson and St. Louis counties. At least five cases are tied to Temple Israel’s preschool in Creve Coeur. St. Louis and St. Louis County authorities on Saturday announced mandatory stay-at-home orders, effective Monday. Kansas City officials followed later Saturday with a similar order. The order in Kansas City and surrounding areas is set to begin Tuesday.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: There were 34 confirmed cases of coronavirus cases in the state as of Sunday afternoon, up from 27 the day before and adding three cases from Cascade County into the mix. Gallatin County now has the most cases, with 10 confirmed incidents of the respiratory illness that is now a pandemic. The virus has surfaced in 11 of Montana’s 56 counties. So far there have been 10 cases confirmed in Gallatin County, six cases in Yellowstone County, four in Missoula County, three in Cascade and Lewis and Clark counties, two in Flathead and Silver Bow counties, and one each in Broadwater, Madison, Ravalli and Roosevelt counties. Health officials warned Sunday that there is evidence the coronavirus has been spreading in Gallatin County, stressing the need for the public to take precautions to prevent more people from being exposed to it.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials have confirmed 10 new cases of coronavirus to give the state a total of 49 cases. Douglas County health officials reported eight new cases Saturday. Five of the cases are related to travel, and three of the cases had contact with a previous positive case in the area. Health officials in Lancaster and Buffalo counties also announced the second cases in both those counties. Both of those new cases are family members of the first case in each county. Health officials said a 48-year-old Lancaster County man who tested positive for COVID-19 visited Charleston’s Restaurant and Freezing Moo in Omaha on March 15 before he was diagnosed with the illness. Anyone who was at those businesses that afternoon should monitor themselves for symptoms, such as a fever and cough, for 14 days.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: While the governor joined other U.S. officials invoking extraordinary measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the mayor of Las Vegas is pushing back against a shutdown of the casinos that power the city and the state economy. Governors in California, New York and Illinois have ordered millions of people to stay in their homes except for essentials and exercise, while Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and other leaders around the country have told restaurants and other businesses to shut down. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman became an outspoken outlier by declaring that her city should be allowed to stay open for business. Nevada has tallied two deaths and more than 190 cases of COVID-19, almost all in the Las Vegas area. “Our economy depends on tourism and being open for dining, entertainment, gaming, sports,” Goodman said in a prepared speech before the Las Vegas City Council.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Retail stores are being ordered to temporarily transition to the use of single-use paper or plastic bags because of the risk that reusable bags could aid in transmission of the coronavirus. In the order issued late Saturday, Gov. Chris Sununu directed all grocers and retail stores in New Hampshire to transition to use only new paper or plastic grocery bags provided by stores “as soon as feasibly possible.” “Our grocery store workers are on the front lines of COVID-19, working around the clock to keep New Hampshire families fed,” the governor said in a statement. “With identified community transmission, it is important that shoppers keep their reusable bags at home given the potential risk to baggers, grocers and customers.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nParamus: Authorities say a drive-thru coronavirus testing center once again reached capacity Sunday morning shortly after opening, but the site will reopen Monday – and a second drive-thru center is also expected to open in Monmouth County. Bergen County Executive Jim Tedesco said on his Facebook page that the site at Bergen Community College would reopen at 8 a.m. Monday. He said the county has the most cases in the state and has recorded five deaths, so “it is important that we test as many symptomatic residents as possible.” The mass testing center was at capacity minutes after opening Saturday for its second day of operations. Hundreds of cars were waiting in lines, but less than 15 minutes after opening, police began turning people away. Tedesco urged people coming to the site, who must be New Jersey residents, to be patient. They will be screened for symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and coughing.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has grown to 57, and two local high schools’ students and staff are being advised to self-isolate because a student at one has tested positive for the disease. The 14 new cases include a baby boy and eight other people in Bernalillo County, which includes metro Albuquerque, and one each in Dona Ana, Lea, Sandoval, Santa Fe and Taos counties, according to the state Department of Health. Albuquerque Public Schools officials said the Department of Health notified them Friday that it was investigating a case involving a Del Norte High School student. The school’s students and staff and those of Nex+Gen Academy Magnet School also located on the Del Norte campus were advised to self-isolate “in an abundance of caution” and to contact the state if symptoms surfaced and required medical attention.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The governor said Sunday that he was exasperated that people are still ignoring his social distancing orders, saying he spent part of the previous day watching people clustering in groups and acting like it was just another nice spring day. “There is a density level in New York City that is wholly inappropriate. You would think there is nothing going on. In parts of New York City, it was just a bright, sunny Saturday,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. He said city officials must come up with a plan immediately to prevent people from congregating in parks or elsewhere, saying it was a matter of life and death. Nearly 2,000 people have been hospitalized in the state with the virus, and 114 have died, Cuomo said. More than 15,000 have tested positive statewide, including 9,000 in New York City. “I don’t know what they’re not understanding,” Cuomo said, his voice rising. “This is not life as usual.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDuck: People renting beach houses in counties that have blocked visitor access to the Outer Banks because of the new coronavirus should get their money refunded, a state panel says. The North Carolina Real Estate Commission ruled Thursday that state law sides with tenants in this situation, reports The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk, Virginia. Dare and Currituck counties have approved orders preventing visitors and non-resident property owners from entering the Outer Banks. And Hyde County has blocked visitor access to Ocracoke Island. Landlords who won’t refund money are open to a lawsuit, according to the commission. Monica Thibodeau, the owner of Carolina Designs Realty in Duck, said social media and phone calls have been mixed about the visitor prohibitions. The company manages vacation rentals for owners for a fee. “We’re trying to keep everybody happy as possible,” said Thibodeau, a member of Duck’s town council.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials say the state appears to be holding its own as the coronavirus crisis stretches on. The state Department of Health reported Sunday morning that labs tested 106 additional people for the virus between 3 p.m. Saturday and 9 a.m. Sunday, and all tests came back negative. That means the state is holding at 28 positives, three hospitalizations and no deaths. Meanwhile, two hospital executives said Saturday that while their workforce is keeping up with the number of the coronavirus cases, they’re asking former doctors and nurses to think about returning if the numbers continue to climb. Dr. Michael LeBeau of Sanford Health and Kurt Schley of CHI-St. Alexius Health said an order by Gov. Doug Burgum that eases licensing requirements will allow them to bring in people from other states, most of whom are already in their systems. They also put out a plea to local retirees.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Board of Pharmacy took an emergency 7-0 vote Sunday by telephone on a new regulation designed to prevent hoarding of hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug – chloroquine – that are sold around the world under a variety of brand and generic names. They are malaria drugs that are seeing a surge in nationwide demand after President Donald Trump suggested they could treat people with the coronavirus, even though the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said science does not support that idea. Under the new regulation, pharmacists cannot dispense chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or sell them for a COVID-19 diagnosis unless it fulfills various prescribing requirements, including a positive test result, and is limited to a 14-day supply. They are prohibited from selling the drugs for prophylactic use for the coronavirus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A second person in the state has died of COVID-19 as the number of Oklahomans with the illness caused by the novel coronavirus increased by more than a dozen, health officials said Sunday. The man who died was in his 50s and lived in Pawnee County, west of Tulsa, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said in a statement. It did not provide further details on the circumstances of his illness and death. The number of people in the state who have tested positive for the virus increased to 67 Sunday, from 53 the day before. The health department said 11 of those people are hospitalized. Oklahoma County has the most cases, with 26, following by Cleveland County, with 13, and Tulsa County, with six.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state is reporting another death from COVID-19, bringing the total to four, as mayors and others urged Gov. Kate Brown to issue more restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. And a city on Oregon’s northwest coast, Warrenton, declared a state of emergency, banned camping and ordered campgrounds to close. The city also prohibited short-term rentals and home-stay lodging and told hotels to close after an influx of weekend visitors, who were told to leave within 24 hours. The Oregon Health Authority said the latest death was a 72-year-old woman in Marion County who had underlying health conditions. She tested positive March 15 and died Friday at Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside Medical Center. The state also reported 23 new confirmed cases of the disease, bringing the total to 137.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Health officials on Sunday reported more than 100 new cases of coronavirus in the state, for a total of more than 470. Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Saturday that people with mild symptoms do not necessarily need to get tested, and, after calling their doctor, they may be able to stay home, rest, and take fluids and anti-fever medication. Testing is being prioritized for symptomatic people who are health care providers, elderly, very ill or dealing with chronic medical conditions, Levine said. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania House State Government Committee Chairman Garth Everett, R-Lycoming, said Sunday that legislation is being drafted to delay the state’s primary from April 28 to June 2. Everett said he hopes to get the legislation out of his committee Monday and through the Republican-controlled chamber this coming week, to send it to the Senate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo has ordered all gyms, salons and other “close contact” businesses to close by Monday afternoon as the state works to prevent spread of the coronavirus. The Democratic governor announced the new measures Sunday, saying the state needs to be “more aggressive” in its response to the virus. Her new order also requires theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainment venues to close their in-person operations, and Raimondo is urging all residents to work from home if possible. The order requires gyms, fitness centers, hair salons, nail salons, spas and tattoo parlors to close by 5 p.m. Monday. Raimondo said it was a tough decision but vowed to help small businesses get back on their feet later. Any businesses that remain open will be required to keep 6 feet between customers, regularly clean surfaces and ensure proper hygiene among employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s largest public university said Saturday that 18 students living in a campus dormitory are being held in quarantine after one of them tested positive for the coronavirus. The University of South Carolina students were being kept in isolation “pending further investigation” to reduce risks of spreading the new virus, the school said in a news release. It said administrators learned late Friday that a student in a residence hall on the Columbia campus was confirmed to have been infected. Campus staff are making sure the quarantined students have food and any needed medical attention, according to the university. It said at least 11 other students and one faculty member have also tested positive for the coronavirus, but all were either off campus or in other states. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 across South Carolina exceeded 170 on Saturday, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. There were three deaths statewide linked to the virus.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The number of people testing positive for the coronavirus increased from 14 to 21, state health officials said Sunday, but Gov. Kristi Noem declined to order businesses to close as her counterparts have in some other areas of the country. Noem and South Dakota Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon told reporters the new victims apparently contracted the virus through travel or by interacting with another person who had it. However, Noem warned that Beadle County appears to be on the verge of community spread, a term that describes when the source is unknown. She urged local leaders in that county to impose social distancing measures, including limiting group sizes, but stopped short of issuing any executive orders. The Rapid City Journal reports Pennington County commissioners complained during a special Saturday meeting that coronavirus shutdowns elsewhere are going too far.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Sunday urged residents to work from home and ordered bars and restaurants to close for 14 days starting Monday with the exception of drive-thru, takeout and delivery services in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Lee’s sweeping order closed gyms and fitness centers from Monday until April 6. He also barred most visitors to nursing homes, retirement homes and long-term care facilities and prohibited social gatherings of 10 or more people. Residents were told to work from home “where feasible,” but Lee stopped short of mandating that people shelter in place. The order on bars and restaurants allows for the sale of unopened alcoholic beverages, including beer, for takeout or delivery orders as long as they are accompanied by food. In Nashville, Mayor John Cooper on Sunday ordered all nonessential businesses to close for 14 days starting Monday. The number of confirmed cases in Tennessee has risen to more than 370, with one death.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday said the National Guard could begin monitoring drive-in testing sites Monday, and the Republican declined at a news conference to follow the lead of other states with a statewide “shelter in place” order. But Abbott warned Texans that it could be coming if they don’t heed his previous orders Friday that limited social gatherings to under 10 people; closed schools, bars and gyms; and banned dine-in eating at restaurants. “Stricter standards will be taken,” if necessary, Abbott said. “If you don’t have an essential reason for leaving your home, you should not be leaving your home.” The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 334 people statewide have tested positive for the virus, up from 304 on Saturday, and officials in Dallas said a man in his 80s has become the sixth Texas resident with the disease to die.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported its first death related to COVID-19 on Sunday – a man over the age of 60 who had underlying health problems. The unidentified man from Davis County had been at Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful, near Salt Lake City, for two days before his death, the Utah Department of Health hospital operator Mountainstar HCA said in a joint announcement. The man tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday, and health officials are working to identify and contact anyone who may have been in close contact with him. Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert said he and his wife extended their deepest sympathies to the man’s family and friends. “The pain this family must be feeling right now puts into perspective the sacrifices we are all making to keep one another safe and healthy. We encourage everyone to do their part by practicing safe health practices, including social distancing,” Herbert said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Health Department is urging the state’s long-term care facilities to take the temperature of all staff members before they enter the buildings where they work. Workers who show any signs of being ill are being told to stay home. The moves are part of the state’s effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus in long-term care facilities. More than 10 cases of COVID-19 were reported at the Burlington Health and Rehabilitation Center. One patient there died of COVID-19. “This is perhaps the most complex public health event most Vermonters have experienced,” Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said in a statement. “And I can’t repeat this enough – it is extremely important for all of us, young and old, to take extra care to help protect the people most vulnerable to serious illness.” On Saturday, the health department reported the number of cases of COVID-19 in Vermont jumped more than 50%, going from under 30 to almost 50. Two have died.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam on Sunday offered a sobering timeline of efforts to diminish the intensity of the coronavirus outbreak, warning that life as we’ve known it will be disrupted “for a long time.” Health officials said the state’s load of positive COVID-19 cases had grown by 65 from the day before to nearly 220 as of Sunday, with three deaths, including a Fairfax County resident who died Saturday. The increase in cases is attributed in part to the increased testing capacity in the state, Northam said at a news conference, but it’s also because the virus continues to spread. “COVID-19 is going to be with us for a long time – months, not weeks. We need to begin adjusting to that reality,” he said. “It is difficult to live with uncertainty. But the sooner we all adopt these new ways of living, the sooner we will all get through this.” Northam said some people still aren’t heeding the strong advice to avoid nonessential gatherings of more than 10 people. “This is not a holiday; this is not a vacation,” he said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A second patient at Washington state’s largest psychiatric hospital has tested positive for the new coronavirus. The Western State Hospital patient was on a different ward from the one who tested positive last week, officials with the state Department of Health and Human Services said in a release Saturday. Both patients were being treated at a Pierce County hospital. Washington state leads the nation in coronavirus deaths with at least 94 fatalities and almost 1,800 positive cases. Officials also reported last week that a hospital employee had the disease and was recovering at home. After those reports, union hospital workers sent a letter to officials demanding that all employees who had contact with the sick patients and worker be tested for COVID-19. But state officials are asking workers to “self-screen” for symptoms instead and to stay home if they have symptoms.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice has a message about the coronavirus pandemic: It’s like a scary movie. In an apparent attempt to soothe a nervous public, Justice offered a rambling response to the virus in a statewide address Saturday night in which he declined to order a broad lockdown, issued dire warnings about New York state, urged people to follow existing protocols and admitted that perhaps his speech could have waited until Monday. “It’s like we’re all lost in a movie that we can’t relate to in any way,” he said during the roughly 25-minute address that left many on social media scratching their heads. He asked people to search their souls to ask if they believed it’s possible for thousands of West Virginians to die. He fell back on platitudes. He stumbled through math equations. “If we don’t act, and we don’t act as strongly as possible right now, we’re going to lose lives and lots of lives,” the Republican governor said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has asked federal officials for help in obtaining tens of thousands of additional pieces of protective equipment as the state continues to grapple with the coronavirus. Evers announced Saturday that he has directed state emergency management officials to ask the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help in obtaining gear for first responders, including 50,000 masks; 10,000 face shields, 11,000 coveralls, 35,000 pairs of gloves and 3,000 N95 masks, which are designed to ensure a very close facial fit. The state is also trying to obtain more equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile. So far the state has received about 52,000 N95 masks, 130,000 surgical masks, 25,000 face shields, 20,000 surgical gowns, 100 coveralls and 36,000 pairs of gloves from the stockpile. Those supplies are being distributed to health care providers in areas with community spread.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A shortage of testing capacity is making it harder for health officials in the state to determine just how many people have been infected with coronavirus, doctors said, while Gov. Mark Gordon sought to expedite delivery of supplies related to the virus. The nationwide testing shortage includes not enough equipment to reliably move swabs from clinics to labs, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Meanwhile, state guidelines limit testing to high-risk cases: the elderly, health care workers and those in contact with people who’ve been infected. People with milder cases, who make up over 80% of those with the COVID-19 illness, largely are not being tested. “Most providers feel like this is the time we should be testing; this is the time we should figure out where the clusters are,” Wyoming Medical Center chief of staff Dr. Andy Dunn said. “However, due to the scarcity of the supplies, it is what it is.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/health/elon-musk-population-collapse-wellness/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk thinks the population will collapse. Demographers say it's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk tweeted, not for the first time, that “population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.” Climate change is a serious problem facing the planet and experts say it’s difficult to compare problems.\n\nWhat is clear, demographers say, is that the global population is growing, despite declines in some parts of the world, and it shouldn’t be collapsing any time soon – even with birth rates at lower levels than in the past.\n\n“He’s better off making cars and engineering than at predicting the trajectory of the population,” said Joseph Chamie, a consulting demographer and a former director of the United Nations Population Division, who has written several books about population issues.\n\n“Yes, some countries, their population is declining, but for the world, that’s just not the case.”\n\nPopulation projections by the numbers\n\nThe world’s population is projected to reach 8 billion by mid-November of this year, according to the United Nations. The UN predicts the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in just 8 years.\n\nBy 2080, the world’s population is expected to peak at 10.4 billion. Then there’s a 50% chance that the population will plateau or begin to decrease by 2100. More conservative models like the one published in 2020 in the Lancet anticipate the global population would be about 8.8 billion people by 2100.\n\nIt’s true that what’s driving current population growth is not a higher birth rate. What drives global population growth is that fewer people are dying young. Global life expectancy was 72.8 years in 2019, an increase of nine years since 1990. That is expected to increase to 77.2 years by 2050.\n\nGlobally, the fertility rate has not “collapsed,” nor should it, according to the UN, but it has dropped significantly.\n\nIn 1950, women typically had five births each; globally, last year, it was 2.3 births. By 2050, the UN projects a further global decline to 2.1 births per woman.\n\nIn some countries, it is lower. In the US the 1950s, it was 3.6 births per woman, it slipped to 1.6 in 2020, according to the World Bank. In Italy, it was 1.2; in Japan, it was 1.3; in China, 1.2. In January 2022, the country announced the birth rate fell for the fifth year in a row, even with the repeal of the one child policy, allowing couples to have up to three children as of 2021.\n\n“Virtually every developed country is below two, and it’s been that way for 20 or 30 years,” Chamie said. Most countries have gone through what’s called a demographic transition.\n\nThe only continent that hasn’t finished this transition, he said, is parts of Africa, where there are 15 to 20 countries where the average number of children couples have is five. But in those countries, children still face high death rates. The infant mortality rate for kids under 5 is 8 to 10 times higher than in developed regions, and maternal mortality is more than double, Chamie said.\n\nIf women in these African regions had more access to contraception, education, and health care, these problems could be addressed and the global population could decline further – but people would be better off in terms of individual health.\n\nThe ‘gold medal’ century\n\nIn terms of population growth, the 20th century was an anomaly.\n\n“That century was the most impressive demographic century ever. It had more gold medals than all the other centuries,” Charmie said.\n\nThe human population nearly quadrupled, something that had never happened before in recorded history. That’s largely because of improvements in public health.\n\nThe world has antibiotics, vaccines, public health programs and improved sanitation to thank for people living longer and more mothers and children surviving birth.\n\nWith contraception, especially in 1964, when the oral pill was widely introduced in the US, couples were now better able to determine when and how many children they had.\n\n“Contraception, the oral pill had a much more significant effect on the world than the car,” Charmie said.\n\nAs more women got an education, worked outside the home and got a later start on children in many countries with access to contraception, couples had fewer children and the population started to decline.\n\nIn 2020, the global population growth rate fell under 1% for the first time since 1950.\n\nThe picture in the US\n\nIn the US, the fertility rate is down in part due to what Ken Johnson, a senior demographer at the Casey School of Public Poilcy and a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, characterized as a “significant” decline in teen births.\n\n“Most demographers would see that as a good thing,” he said.\n\nHe said the other driver was a decline in the number of births to women in their 20s. That trend has been around since 2008. People put off or decided not to have babies in part because of the recession, he said. Covid then exacerbated this trend.\n\nBetween July of 2020 and 2021, the growth rate of the US population was the lowest it’s been in probably 100 years he said.\n\n“Is it a collapse of the number of births? No, I wouldn’t say that,” Johnson said.\n\nHe said there are a few factors at play in the low US growth rate: fewer births, fewer immigrants due to Trump-era policies, and more deaths as the US population is ages. Covid-19 contributed to higher deaths, too.\n\n“It’s almost like a perfect storm if you will,” Johnson said. “Births are way down, Covid pushes deaths way up, and then immigration is quite slow, too, so it is no wonder that the population growth rate is so low when you bring all those factors together at the same time.”\n\nPreventing population problems down the road\n\nAs the population ages and birth rates decline in some areas of the globe, that could put strain on social systems.\n\nThe share of the population over age 65 will rise from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050. That’s twice the number of kids under age 5.\n\nGlobally, the trick to make such a population age imbalance work, is that governments will need to be proactive, the UN says. Countries with aging populations need to adapt public programs that will support this growing population of older people. That means shoring up programs like social security, pensions and establishing universal access to health care and long-term care.\n\nIn the US, William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with Brookings Metro, said he doesn’t see the need for more couples to have more babies to address the age imbalance in the United States. Policies that would support couples that want children – affordable daycare and family leave policies, for example – could help, but that that hasn’t made a big difference in terms of fertility rates.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFertility is below the replacement rate in the US, meaning couples are having fewer than two children each, but the rate is not as low as it is in most of Europe, he said.\n\n“I don’t think in the US it’s an issue of collapse, because we can certainly open the faucet for more immigrants anytime we want to,” Frey said. “We’ll have no paucity of people who want to come through the door to immigrate here in the future. Immigrants and their children are younger than the population as a whole and so that will help to keep the population from aging as well.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/22/let-us-cheer-cruises-return-adolescent-trials-news-around-states/115586626/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: About two dozen cities and town across Alabama will participate as the state tourism agency resumes a program to promote springtime walking tours. Although the program was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, it will be held all four Saturdays in April with precautions against COVID-19 including social distancing, according to a news release from the Alabama Tourism Department. Larger cities including Birmingham, Mobile and Montgomery will hold walking tours for the public along with smaller communities including Athens, Monroeville and Fairhope. A statement from the agency said 30 communities participated in the walking tour program in 2019, with more than 2,300 people taking part. Alabama is the only state with statewide, simultaneous walking tours, the agency said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: More than 28% of Alaskans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine – better than most states and well above the national average of 22%. Last week, Alaska became the first state to offer vaccinations to anyone at least 16 years old who wants them. Mississippi has since followed suit, and Utah announced it will do the same starting next month. As the rest of the country grapples with the same issue, the success of Alaska offers a lesson in the benefits of avoiding the top-down bureaucracy that has hampered vaccinations elsewhere. From the early days of Alaska’s campaign, local leaders across the state enjoyed some latitude in how to administer the doses they received. The decision to officially scrap eligibility restrictions – which ran two dozen pages – came after state officials realized that many residents were confused about whether they qualified and that too many appointments were going unclaimed.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Grand Canyon National Park officials tentatively plan to reopen the park’s eastern entrance in late May, but there’s sentiment in a small northern Arizona city that depends on tourism that sooner would be better. “Our sales tax for this year is down nearly 30% from last year,” Page city manager Darren Coldwell told the Arizona Daily Sun. “Our Horseshoe Bend visitation is down 80%. So when we say that our numbers dropped off the face of the earth, they really did.” The Grand Canyon’s eastern entrance and the highway leading to it, State Route 64, were closed last spring as a courtesy to the neighboring Navajo Nation, which was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The tribe’s vast reservation in the Four Corners region has reported nearly 30,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 1,219 deaths as of Tuesday, when only two new cases and one additional death were reported. A nightly curfew to help curb spread of the coronavirus remains in effect on the reservation but slowing of the outbreak has prompted the Navajo Nation to begin a partial reopening of some businesses and other facilities. Two of the tribe’s four casinos were set to reopen Friday. Navajo Nation roads remain closed to visitors, but the Navajo Nation Council is considering a bill to rescind those closures – which don’t affect the highway into the park.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson activated 20 members of the Arkansas Air and Army National Guard to assist with coronavirus vaccinations. Hutchinson said the Guard members would administer vaccinations in four public health regions. Each of the four teams will include two medics and two personnel to handle logistics and documentation. “This deployment will accelerate our efforts to contain COVID-19 in Arkansas,” Hutchinson said in a statement. The teams will serve Arkansans from four public health regions with clinics in Marianna, Prescott, West Memphis and Fort Smith, Hutchinson’s office said in a news release. The move comes after Arkansas last week expanded vaccine eligibility to nearly 1 million more people in the state. Hutchinson cited a slowdown in demand for the vaccine, particularly in the state’s rural areas.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Three days after the California Department of Public Health quietly banned cheerleading squads from attending sporting events, the agency reversed its decision Friday, bowing to an uproar from parents, coaches and cheerleaders who chanted in protest: “Let us cheer!” The reversal was tucked into the agency’s daily news release on COVID-19 statistics, as a clarification that said “sideline cheer is an allowable sport” under state guidelines. The agency has not provided any explanation of the rule change or the earlier ban, which made an apparent distinction between competitive cheerleading, which was allowed, and cheering on the sidelines of a football game. The Tuesday ban, which was inserted in a “Youth Sports Q&A” on the agency’s website, said “sideline cheer, band, drumline or other supporting groups are not allowed to attend sporting events at this time.” It struck many as bizarre because the state health agency had only just allowed cheerleading to resume along with football and other outdoor youth sports last month in much of the state.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s health department is moving to relax its statewide mask mandate and limits on gathering capacity, saying the state’s role in determining COVID-19 restrictions will lessen in favor of more local control as vaccination eligibility opens more widely. The proposal announced Friday would allow local authorities and “private entities” in the counties with the lowest coronavirus infection rates to determine whether masks would be required. It would also end most restrictions on capacity for restaurants, personal services providers, retailers, manufacturers, health care providers or outdoor events. Gyms, bars and indoor events would still be subject to a limit on the number of people who can gather there. The proposed change would also not affect schools, as students aged 11 to 18 must wear masks for the rest of the academic year. There are only two Level Green counties where this applies: rural Crowley and Otero counties in southern Colorado, which means they have fewer than 15 cases per 100,000 people in a week. A majority of the state is in the next risk level up, and the Denver metro area is two levels higher than the least restrictive designation, where this guidance would not yet apply. For the majority of the state, masks will be required for indoor public places with 10 or more people, and the capacity restrictions remain in place.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Although restaurateurs welcomed the end to COVID-19-related capacity limits inside their establishments on Friday, an industry trade group is cautioning that it’s just a first step toward getting back to business as usual. Scott Dolch, executive director of the Connecticut Restaurant Association, said most restaurant owners he has spoken to expect to be open at 65% or possibly 70% capacity and not 100% because of social distancing rules. Also, just because Gov. Ned Lamont ended capacity limits, Dolch said, doesn’t mean all restaurants will be flooded with customers despite an increase in reservations since the governor’s plan was announced on March 4. “We’re definitely nowhere near out of the woods yet,” said Dolch, noting how he’s worried about some restaurants located in cities where office workers have not yet returned and establishments that rely on conferences that aren’t being booked. “But I also have to be the optimistic, hopeful one for this industry, because I know how tough it’s been,” he said. “And I have to say to folks, ‘Hey, today is a really good day because there’s other states around us that haven’t done this.’ ” Besides restaurants, capacity limits were lifted at nontheater indoor recreation centers, libraries, museums, aquariums, gyms and fitness centers, retail shops, offices, personal services establishments and houses of worship. Mask-wearing, distancing and cleaning protocols will still be required. Also, movie theaters and performing arts venues will only be allowed to open at 50% capacity. Restaurant seating will be limited to eight people per table and hours of operation capped at 11 p.m. Bars, meanwhile, will remain shuttered.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: People who are 65 years and older are being encouraged by the state to sign up to get their first coronavirus vaccine shot at a three-day vaccination event. The Delaware State News reported Dover International Speedway is holding the drive-thru vaccination event on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Anyone who is over the age of 65 and who lives, works or receives health care in Delaware is invited to sign up. People can sign up through the Division of Public Health’s website. The scheduling website will only accept appointments by individuals 65 and up. A photo ID is required at the vaccination event. The Delaware Division of Public Health said will administer the Moderna vaccine on Friday and Sunday. The Pfizer vaccine will be administered on Saturday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Findings from a new D.C. State Board of Education survey suggested many District teachers have thought about leaving the profession over the last year, WUSA-TV reported. The board’s survey gathered opinions from more than 1,000 public and public charter school educators in the District in January and February. According to the board, 43% of the survey’s respondents said they considered leaving education as a result of teaching during the pandemic. Zachary Parker, president and Ward 5 representative of the D.C. State Board of Education, said the pandemic exacerbated some long-standing problems impacting District teachers. “We know our teachers went over and beyond to teach virtually and to meet the needs of our students, and many of them express through our survey that they did not feel as though they were respected, supported or sought out for their opinion on matters of returning back to in-person,” he said. Teachers from 185 D.C. schools responded to the survey. Parker said most of those educators teach in the D.C. Public Schools system. The survey also revealed that 75% of the teachers inquired said they were either slightly or very uncomfortable returning to in-person teaching during the pandemic, although more than half of teachers answered that they believe the social and emotional well-being of their students is worse now than it has been in previous years.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Two Royal Caribbean cruises will resume in June, ending a yearlong hiatus because of the pandemic, but passengers 18 and older must test negative for the coronavirus before getting on a ship. The company’s Celebrity Cruises subsidiary said Friday that its Celebrity Millennium ship will relaunch on June 5 from St. Maarten. One itinerary will stop in Aruba, Curacao and Barbados, and another will stop in Tortola, St. Lucia and Barbados. Celebrity Cruises CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo said returning to the Caribbean “marks the measured beginning of the end of what has been a uniquely challenging time for everyone.” Royal Caribbean Group’s namesake line will start a week later with a voyage leaving from Nassau, the Bahamas, on the Adventure of the Seas. In both cases, passengers 18 and older will be required to test negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of boarding the ship. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has held up cruise ship operations in U.S. waters since March 2020, although it has laid out guidelines for cruises to resume with conditional sailing certificates.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: Daily Georgia cases have remained above 1,000 since Tuesday, with Saturday’s report from the Georgia Department of Public Health adding 1,167 cases for a total of 842,251. The state added 50 deaths for a total of 16,145. Richmond County reported 22 new cases for 19,019, Columbia County had three for 10,691 and McDuffie and Glascock each reported two for 1,606 and 142 respectively. Four counties only reported one case each: Burke rose to 1,709, Jenkins rose to 712, Wilkes stands at 712 and Lincoln rose to 712. All other Augusta-area counties remained the same – Screven at 794, Jefferson at 1,547, Warren at 366 and Taliaferro at 99. No new deaths were reported in the Augusta-Aiken area. The area death toll remained at 979.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii has given more than a half-million COVID-19 vaccines as of Wednesday. Nearly 560,000 shots have been administered on the islands according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 data tracker, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Thursday. Data showed the state ranked seventh in the nation for vaccinations with a rate of 39,489 doses per 100,000 residents. Lt. Gov. Josh Green said the state by April 1 hopes to reach a total of 600,000 shots, and 900,000 by May 1. He said about 10,000 vaccines are being put in arms each day. “It’s a big milestone that keeps us on track,” he said. “All of which bodes very well for us because we’re rapidly increasing our immunity.” The total includes vaccinations by the military and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Hawaii is behind only Alaska at 47,295 per 100,000; New Mexico is at 46,914; South Dakota at 43,518; North Dakota at 42,674; Connecticut at 41,612; and Vermont at 39,530\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Legislature voted Friday to shut down for several weeks after an outbreak of COVID-19. Lawmakers in the House and Senate made the move to recess until April 6 with significant unfinished business, including setting budgets and pushing through a huge income tax cut. At least six of the 70 House members tested positive for the illness in the last week, and there are fears a highly contagious variant of the coronavirus is in the Statehouse. “The House has had several positive tests, so it is probably prudent that the House take a step back for a couple weeks until things calm down and it’s not hot around here for COVID,” House Majority Leader Mike Moyle said before the votes. Five of those who tested positive are Republicans and one is a Democrat. Another Republican lawmaker is self-isolating. The chamber has a super majority of 58 Republicans, most of whom rarely or never wear masks. All the Democratic lawmakers typically wear masks. The three lawmakers who tested positive this week, two Republicans and one Democrat, had been participating in debates on the House floor. The House, with the illness spreading, requested the Senate recess as well. Two senators contracted COVID-19 but have recovered and returned to the 35-member Senate. The Senate honored the House request and voted to recess about an hour after the House, with Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder calling it “an unusual and kind of historic request that has been made of us.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker said higher education staffers, government workers and the media will be eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines beginning this week. In a news release, the governor said the latest groups can get their vaccines beginning Monday. On March 29, religious leaders, construction trade workers and food and beverage workers will be eligible for vaccines. Then, on April 12, vaccines will be open to any resident of Illinois 16 years and older. Also, on Friday the Illinois Department of Public Health announced the latest COVID-19 statistics, reporting another 2,380 confirmed and probable cases in the state and that the death toll had climbed by 12. With Friday’s totals, Illinois has reported 1,218,470 COVID-19 cases and 21,034 deaths since the pandemic began early last year.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Authorities are adding residents between the ages of 40 and 44 to those eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine starting Monday. Indiana had previously limited eligibility to residents who are 45 and older. The state also made health care workers, long-term care residents, first responders and educators up to grade 12, along with other school workers such as classroom aides, bus drivers and cafeteria workers eligible. The Department of Health said the expanded age requirements will make 400,000 additional residents eligible to be vaccinated. Appointments for those between the ages of 40 and 44 will become available starting Monday. State health authorities said slots will extend over the next several weeks to match with expected deliveries of more vaccine to Indiana. Eligible residents can schedule an appointment to receive a vaccine by visiting https://ourshot.in.gov or calling 211 if they do not have access to a computer, or require assistance.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ job approval has slipped, and a majority of Iowans said they hope she decides against seeking reelection in 2022, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed. A majority of Iowans now disapprove of the way Reynolds has handled the coronavirus pandemic. Fifty-one percent disapprove, the highest percentage since the start of the pandemic; 47% approve; and 3% are unsure. Her 47% pandemic approval rating is slightly higher than it was in September, when it hit 44%. But it’s far lower than in June, soon after the pandemic’s outset, when 59% approved. Fifty-two percent said they hope Reynolds decides not to seek a second full term as governor, and 41% hope she decides to run. Another 7% are unsure.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: About 40% of Kansas prison staff and about 30% of inmates have declined to be vaccinated for COVID-19 despite massive outbreaks at lockups that have infected thousands. The Department of Corrections is in its sixth week of offering vaccinations to inmates and staff, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. It plans to continue operating vaccination clinics through mid-April, agency spokeswoman Carol Pitts said in an email. The agency doesn’t require employees or inmates to explain their reasons for declining the vaccine. Vaccinating inmates in the current phase, which also includes those 65 and older and essential workers such as teachers, has been controversial. The Republican-controlled Legislature urged Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to postpone their inoculations so that others could get them first. But Kelly said prisons needed to be prioritized because they had been hard-hit and because outbreaks there could affect surrounding communities. As of Thursday, the prison system had reported 1,277 cases among staff and 6,117 among inmates since the start of the pandemic. There also had been 21 deaths among prisoners and staff.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear has relaxed the curfew on bars and restaurants as the state’s rate of positive COVID-19 cases reached its lowest level since early July. The curfew was extended one hour, starting last Friday. Bars and restaurants can serve food and drinks until midnight local time and stay open until 1 a.m., the governor said. “Hopefully this is a little bit of relief given the positive movement of where we are right now as a state with vaccines going up and cases going down,” Beshear said. Capacity limits at bars and restaurants will remain at 60% and the spaced-out seating rule still applies, the governor said. “We cannot have people crowding around bars or in restaurants around bars,” he said. “We do have to keep people separated.” Kentucky’s rate of positive cases fell to 3.23% Thursday, the lowest level since July 3. On Friday, the rate was up slightly to 3.4% with 731 new cases and 25 new deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Louisiana Supreme Court is ending the suspension it enacted on jury trials across the state because of the coronavirus pandemic. The high court announced that trial courts can resume jury trials April 1, if the local courts have determined they can meet safety protocols including social distancing provisions and mask mandates. “It is imperative that members of the public feel safe in returning to our courthouses for jury duty,” Chief Justice John Weimer said in a statement. “Serving as a juror is one of the most important civic responsibilities to be undertaken by our citizens, and it is the courts’ responsibility to ensure their safety.” Weimer said the Supreme Court’s decision to end the jury trial moratorium came after consultation with legal and medical experts, including the governor’s top public health adviser, Dr. Joe Kanter with the state health department, and Louisiana’s state epidemiologist, Theresa Sokol. A backlog of cases has built up because of the delay in jury trials.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A company that’s one of only two manufacturers of a specific type of swab needed for coronavirus tests is opening a production facility in Tennessee, officials said. The Puritan Medical Products plant would be the first outside Maine, but the company had no details on where it would be located or when it will open, spokesperson Virginia Templet told the Bangor Daily News. The company has three plants in Maine. The federal government has provided the company hundreds of millions of dollars since the start of the pandemic as the government rushed to ramp up coronavirus testing last year. Puritan, which is based in Guilford, opened two plants in Pittsfield last year. One was helped by $75.5 million in funding from the Department of Defense, and $51.2 million in coronavirus relief funding helped launch another plant. In January, the federal government awarded it $110 million to purchase production equipment necessary to increase swab production. Last June, former President Donald Trump visited the company’s headquarters to praise the workers. The only other company that makes the specific swab is in Italy.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan said a group of independently owned pharmacies headquartered in Maryland have joined the state’s vaccine distribution network. His office said in a statement that the network is known as EPIC Pharmacies. The Republican governor also will visit Apple Discount Drugs in Salisbury on Friday. It’s one of the first independent pharmacies taking part in the program. “We currently have 2,324 different distribution points from one end of the state to the other, and are thrilled to add EPIC Pharmacies to our vaccination efforts in order to further expand our reach and ensure that no Marylander is left behind,” Hogan said in a statement. Nearly 300 pharmacies across Maryland are administering COVID-19 vaccines as of last Friday. The stores are receiving direct allocations from the state and the federal government. Pharmacy providers of the vaccine can be found at covidvax.maryland.gov.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Twenty-nine organizations are asking Gov. Charlie Baker to delay the reopening steps taking effect Monday by at least at month. Massachusetts moves into the next phase of reopening starting Monday, with large sports venues allowed to open with 12% capacity. Gathering limits for event venues and in public settings will increase to 100 people indoors and 150 people outdoors, the administration said. “We constantly go back and look at what we’ve done and think about it as we look forward,” Baker told WBZ. “The idea that this process isn’t an iterative one, is just wrong. We’re constantly talking to people about this.” Carlene Pavlos, executive director of the Massachusetts Public Health Association, drafted the letter to Baker from the groups. “We’re concerned that there’s the possibility of a fourth wave of the pandemic just as we’re about to see that light that we all need at the end of the tunnel,” Pavlos said. The CDC last week urged states to reconsider rolling back restrictions, the news station reported.\n\nMichigan\n\nCoopersville: One of the state’s top high school wrestlers who has been idled by strict COVID-19 rules could not persuade a judge to get him into the weekend state tournament. Ottawa County Judge Karen Miedema declined to intervene Friday, said David Kallman, an attorney for Tyler Janssen of Coopersville High School in western Michigan. “Tyler is the No. 1 wrestler in the state in his weight class. … This could adversely impact his college prospects,” Kallman told the Associated Press. The county health department ordered Janssen into a 10-day quarantine on March 12 after being told that he was near a classmate who tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the lawsuit. Janssen, a senior, has tested negative each day during his quarantine, which ended Sunday – a day late for the wrestling tournament, Kallman said. Marcia Mansaray of the local health department acknowledged that federal guidance called for a seven-day quarantine. But the Michigan health department, she said, is sticking with 10 days. “If we were in the wrong fighting for what we’re fighting for, we’d take a step back and it would be fine,” Janssen said. “But it’s the fact that we’ve tried to follow every guideline, every protocol there is. My voice feels like it’s not getting heard by anybody. That’s my biggest frustration.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Health officials suspect that a coronavirus variant is driving a recent increase in the state’s case rate. Infectious Disease Director Kris Ehresmann said during a media briefing Friday that more than 300 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the United Kingdom have been found in Minnesota. Cases have been detected in various parts of the state, including in Carver County near the Twin Cities, and Mankato and St. Louis counties in the northern part of the state. Health officials called virus variants a “significant cause for concern,” and expect B.1.1.7 to become the dominant strain in the state and country. As Minnesota continues with its vaccination efforts, officials warned against ceasing mitigation efforts like masking and social distancing to avoid further transmission of the more contagious variant.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The South African coronavirus variant has been discovered in a Mississippi resident for the first time, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said Friday. A resident of Harrison County on the Gulf Coast contracted the B.1.351 strain, which was first detected in South Africa and is believed to be more infectious. The sequencing was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mississippi’s state health department submitted samples to the CDC on a weekly basis for testing, Dobbs said. There have been more than 140 cases of the South African variant that have been detected in at least 25 states, Dobbs said. The strain shares some mutations with B.1.1.7, a more easily spread variant that was first identified in Britain late last year. Dobbs said the discovery of the South African variant in Mississippi is “a strong reminder that we are not remotely out of this (pandemic) and we still need to exercise some basic caution.” He advised mask-wearing and not gathering in large groups. The state has reported 10 cases of the U.K. strain since it was first detected in Mississippi in mid-February. Dobbs said the health department plans to post more detailed information on the variants found in the state on its website in the coming days.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Missourians now have until mid-May to file state taxes. Gov. Mike Parson on Friday announced his administration pushed the deadline for individuals to file state tax returns from April 15 to May 17, days after the federal government did the same. Parson said the delayed due date will help people still struggling financially because of the pandemic. Also on Friday, researchers released results from a pilot study of COVID-19 transmission in some Springfield and St. Louis schools. The study by the Washington University School of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed the virus’ spread in 57 schools over a two-week period in mid-December, when virus cases in Missouri were high. Masks were required at the schools. Other safety measures included deep cleaning, emphasis on hand-washing and sanitizing, better ventilation, daily symptom screening and virtual class options. Of 102 students in close contact with 37 people who tested positive for the coronavirus – other students, staff and teachers – the pilot study found only two contracted the virus. The pilot study also shed light on differences in quarantine procedures between schools. Springfield schools allowed students who were close contacts of infected people at school but reliably wore masks to continue in-person learning. The spread of the virus was still rare.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is dropping legal action filed last year against five businesses in northwestern Montana accused of violating public health orders meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, Gov. Greg Gianforte said. As part of a settlement filed in the Flathead County district court, the businesses are also dropping counterclaims against the state. The state is paying the defendants’ more than $94,000 in attorney costs, the settlement stated. The lawsuit was filed by the state health department under former Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, in October. It accused the businesses of failing to adequately enforce the statewide mask mandate. Gianforte, a Republican, promised to end the legal action soon after taking office in January. “We already have enough federal overreach that we don’t need the state joining in,” he said in a statement. The businesses involved are the Remington Bar, Sykes Diner and Scotty’s Bar in Kalispell, and the Ferndale Market and Your Turn Mercantile near Bigfork. They filed a counter lawsuit in November claiming the agency selectively targeted them and hurt them financially, officials said. Separately, a case filed by Gallatin County against the Rocking R Bar for failing to follow COVID-19 mitigation rules was dismissed last month after Gianforte eliminated several health mandates put in place by Bullock, NBC Montana reported.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A child care and preschool center in west Omaha has been closed after reporting more than 60 possible cases of COVID-19. The Douglas County Health Department confirmed that Rosewood Academy Childcare & Preschool closed Wednesday night, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Department spokesman Phil Rooney said the center will remain closed for 10 days as health officials investigate. A small outbreak of an illness at a day care is not unusual, Rooney said, but having one that requires a center to close is rare. So far, health officials have confirmed 23 cases, but expect that number to rise.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Seventeen tribal communities in Nevada are set to receive a total of more than $10 million for affordable housing under the federal government’s COVID-19 relief act, the state’s U.S. senators said. Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen said Friday the $1.9 trillion bill included more than $31 billion for Indian country. Rosen called the funds for tribes long overdue and the largest infusion of dedicated resources to Indian Country in U.S. history. Masto said funds will support health care, housing and economic recovery. Allocations range from about $35,000 each for the Las Vegas Tribe of Paiute Indians, the Summit Lake Paiute Tribe and the Winnemucca Indian Colony to nearly $1.5 million for the Duck Valley Shoshone-Paiute Tribes in Owyhee. The Walker River Paiute, Pyramid Lake Paiute and Washoe tribes will each receive more than $1 million, and the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone, Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians, Yerington Paiutes and Reno-Sparks Indian Colony will each receive amounts varying between $500,000 and $1 million. Other tribes receiving funding are the Duckwater Shoshone, Ely Shoshone, Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone, Lovelock Paiute, Moapa Band of Paiute Indians, Summit Lake Paiute and Yomba Shoshone.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A state infection control assessment conducted at the New Hampshire Veterans Home showed sufficient personal protective equipment at the Tilton home, while recommending more staff training for putting on and removing it. “During our site visit, you described your infection control program and infrastructure especially focusing on hand hygiene, personnel protective equipment, safe injection safety respiratory/cough etiquette, and environmental cleaning,” a letter from Andria Scacheri, a specialist at the Healthcare-Associated Infections Program at the state’s Bureau of Infectious Disease Control, said. “Overall, your facility has a good infection prevention and control infrastructure.” Health officials visited the 250-bed nursing home on March 12. The report said staffing and testing capabilities are “adequate” to handle a coronavirus outbreak. It noted that the home is still having difficulties ordering N95 respirator masks. Nearly all of the residents had received the COVID-19 vaccine, the report said. The home had more than 30 deaths related to the coronavirus during an outbreak last year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:The coronavirus has continued to spread across New Jersey at such a high rate that the Garden State now has an unwanted distinction: It leads the U.S. in new cases per capita over the past week. Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday that the case rate and other key pandemic metrics are “uncomfortably too high.” His administration is hoping to bring that number down with an “exponential” increase in vaccines that are expected to be allotted to New Jersey starting in the next few weeks. After seeing significant drops in January and February, major COVID-19 metrics like hospitalizations and intensive care admissions have plateaued in March despite a ramp-up in vaccinations. But the state’s rate of 293 new cases per 100,000 is more than double the national average of 113, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We’ve got to watch this like a hawk to make sure this does not break out and up from that range,” Murphy said. New Jersey ranked ninth in COVD-19 deaths per 100,000 over the past week at 3.1, according to the CDC. The national average is 2.2. The rise in cases came as Murphy began to slowly lift restrictions, the most significant occurring Friday when restaurants, gyms, salons and other businesses were allowed to expand to 50% occupancy.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The Department of Health is launching an app that will enable your phone to tell you in some instances if you have been exposed to the coronavirus. The app called NM Notify and intended to help slow spread of the coronavirus will go live Tuesday, KRQE-TV reported. The department said NM Notify is a voluntary program that works by exchanging anonymous keys through Bluetooth with other nearby phones that also have the exposure notification app activated. When a person tests positive for the coronavirus, they will get a text with a verification that, when activated, will let other phones nearby know of exposures. According to the department, the notifications go out only a few times a day to help ensure privacy of the infected person. Users of Android devices can find the app in the Google store. Users of iPhones using settings to turn on exposure notifications. The department said the NM Notify app does not collect personal or location data and that no identifying data is returned to the department or another organization.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Public school students will get another chance to go back to school in-person this spring after federal authorities eased their guidance on how many children can safely fit in a classroom, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. He said the new window for choosing in-person school would open this week, with details to be announced Monday. Returns to the classroom will start with preschoolers and elementary school students. “For parents of kids in younger grades, we are confident that we will be able to bring back a substantial number of students by the end of April,” said de Blasio, a Democrat. But the teachers union questioned the mayor’s authority to open schoolhouse doors to more students and complained that he had issued a “proclamation without a plan.” “We will wait for New York state to weigh in,” the United Federation of Teachers said in a statement. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that students can safely sit 3 feet apart in the classroom if they wear masks. The agency previously called for 6 feet of distance. Schools across the country had to remove desks and stagger schedules in order to meet that standard. Students should still be kept 6 feet away from one another at sporting events, assemblies, lunch or chorus practice, the CDC said. The teachers union said it would be “extremely complicated to implement such a plan in New York City public schools” in an email to members before de Blasio’s announcement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Gov. Roy Cooper urged legislators to expand Medicaid during a tour of a large-scale vaccination clinic in Greenville on Friday. Cooper visited the Vidant/Pitt County Large Scale Vaccine Clinic at the Greenville Convention Center to see how vaccine distribution is proceeding in eastern North Carolina. The center will have administered 50,000 doses of the vaccine as of Saturday, said Dr. Michael Waldrum, CEO of Vidant Health, the primary health care provider in 29 eastern counties. “The vaccination center has brought together all kinds of people and to hear the voices of people who have just got their shots, knowing that they are a little more protected, and all said they are coming back for their second one,” Cooper said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials said vaccinations for the coronavirus will be available to the general public beginning March 29. The agency said some regions of the state could move into the Phase 2 of the vaccination plan even sooner. The state developed a series of priority phases with the help of a vaccine ethics committee. Health care workers, long-term care residents and staff, and older adults were the first to be vaccinated. Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement that people who have not received a vaccine are encouraged to do so. Burgum received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine last week. The governor has described vaccination as part of the plan to return to normal life. The health department said as of Friday, almost 195,000 people in North Dakota had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:The state reported 1,483 confirmed and probable coronavirus cases Sunday, bringing the total to 999,750 since the start of the pandemic. There were no new deaths reported and the total stands at 18,340. So far, 2,786,318 people, or 23.84% of the state’s population, have been vaccinated; the national average is 23.3%.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of new COVID-19 cases continued to trend lower Saturday in Oklahoma, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The university’s data showed the rolling average number of the state’s new daily COVID-19 cases were falling by 31%. The State Department of Health reported no new cases on Saturday, leaving the state’s pandemic total holding steady at 434,491. However, Johns Hopkins data showed 29 new COVID-19 deaths drove the state’s pandemic death toll to 4,788. More than 1 million people in Oklahoma have received at least one vaccine dose, almost 27% of the population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Students in Portland Public Schools will begin hybrid, in-person instruction April 1 after the teachers union and the school board ratified a deal to return to classroom instruction during the pandemic. KOIN reported that by a 6-1 vote Thursday night, the PPS Board of Educatoin approved the plan for the youngest students – preschool through 1st grade – to begin on April 1. Students in 2nd grade through 5th grade would begin in-person instruction on April 5, and students in 6th grade through 12th grade will start the week of April 19. The PPS Board of Education’s vote was the final step in students and teachers returning to class. Board member Amy Kohnstamm was the sole “no\" vote. She cited a rule that requires at least 6 feet of space between desks and said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to change that recommendation as early as this week. “It makes an enormous difference for our kids because if we simply create the flexibility to adjust to a change in those physical distancing requirements we can double the amount in-person instruction time,” Kohnstamm said. The Portland district is Oregon’s largest, with about 49,000 students.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nErie: Erie County’s weekly total of COVID-19 cases has tumbled to a level not seen since October. County health officials remained concerned, however, that more easily transmissible coronavirus variants could spark another surge in cases. The county’s first case of the B.1.1.7 variant, commonly known as the U.K. variant, was reported Wednesday. “If we can hang on another four to six weeks, we will have a lot more people vaccinated and perhaps we won’t see a rise in cases,” said Dr. Howard Nadworny, a Saint Vincent Hospital infectious diseases specialist and adviser to the Erie County Department of Health. The county reported 192 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 12-18, fewer than half of the 405 cases reported between March 5-11, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. It’s the fewest weekly cases reported since the week of Oct. 16-22, based on county health department data. The previous week’s total was boosted by a COVID-19 outbreak at the State Correctional Institution at Albion that infected nearly 300 inmates and staff. The inmates are considered county residents and are included in the county’s case totals.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:Several students at a Rhode Island independent school are enrolled in a clinical trial to study the effectiveness of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine in adolescents. Moderna has enrolled 3,000 12- to 17-year-olds in the trial, including nine at the Gordon School in East Providence, The Providence Journal reported. Each will receive either a placebo or the real vaccine, then they will be followed for 12 months after their second shot. Peyton Riegel, a seventh-grader at the school that educates children up to eighth grade, said she volunteered because this is “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something that will really help.” Her father tested positive for the coronavirus in January and although he wasn’t sick, he had to quarantine for two weeks while Peyton shifted to remote learning. “We had to bring him meals,” she said. “Suddenly, it hit us. It really hadn’t before.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A legislative committee has approved spending $313,000 on devices that clean the air of viruses and mold in the six buildings on the Statehouse grounds. Officials expect the air ionizing devices should be in place next month, The Post and Courier of Charleston reported. The state prison system has installed some of the machines and said they immediately slowed the spread of COVID-19 among inmates and workers. The devices can eliminate the coronavirus, but also other more common viruses that cause illnesses. They can also eliminate mold, an important consideration in a complex where each building is at least 40 years old, according to the state Department of Administration. The agency that oversees maintenance on many state buildings is also evaluating how much it will cost to put the machines in 46 other facilities it manages, Department of Administration spokesperson Kelly Coakley said. Members of the Joint Bond Review Committee who approved putting the machines in the six Statehouse buildings, a parking garage and the South Carolina Supreme Court building across the street believe the devices can be paid for through federal COVID-19 relief money. The same committee set aside $1.7 million in December to put the air ionizing devices in 21 state prisons and administrative buildings, and the number of COVID-19 cases dropped, Department of Corrections Director Bryan Stirling told the newspaper.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Meat processors in South Dakota will get a helping hand after all because of COVID-19 relief funds. The South Dakota Department of Agriculture will distribute $5 million in grants to qualifying butchers in response to market and workforce disruption, according to a news release. Previously, Gov. Kristi Noem had asked the state legislature to approve House Bill 1040, which would have allocated $5 million to butchers to expand their facilities and upgrade equipment in response to the pandemic. However, that legislation was tabled indefinitely by the House of Representatives, most likely because it was made known in committee by Rep. Chris Karr that federal relief funding was available for the project. Grants will be available to processors with less than 60 employees that are state-inspected, licensed custom-exempt slaughter plants or small federally inspected plants. Applications are now available on the Department of Agriculture website and are due by May 1. Grants will be announced on May 25.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The Metro Public Health Department announced the city would shift to the next phase of vaccination eligibility beginning Monday. Phases 2A and 2B are now open, which includes all people 55 and older, along with critical infrastructure workers in the following groups: social services, commercial agriculture, commercial food production, corrections staff, public transit, transportation, public infrastructure, telecommunications and utilities and energy. The move comes as two of Tennessee’s largest metro counties announced expanded eligibility this week under phases 2A and 2B. On Tuesday, the Madison County Health Department advanced to the next phases. Shelby County did the same on Thursday. The following day, Knox County announced its expansion. Davidson County, home of Nashville, the state’s largest city, was still in Phase 1C as of Friday as it prepared for its first mass vaccination event, scheduled for Saturday. At the event, Mayor John Cooper announced that as of Wednesday, more than 20% of Nashville residents have received a vaccine. Having reached this milestone, he said the city can continue to open its economy, as long as mask-wearing and social distancing continue.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: New Texas COVID-19 cases took a solid dip in their total on Friday, according to the state case count. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 3,521 new cases Friday, 852 fewer than the day before. The addition of 53 previously unreported cases brought the state’s pandemic total to 2,739,385. The state also reported the fewest number of COVID-19 hospitalizations since Oct. 10 at 3,752 as of Thursday, the most recent total available. The estimate of active cases fell by 1,099 to 107,597. Johns Hopkins University researchers said the 158 new COVID-19 deaths reported Friday raised the state’s pandemic death toll to 47,193. The researchers also said the rolling average of daily new cases had fallen by almost 3,003 over the past two weeks, decreasing about 41%.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Intermountain Healthcare said it will keep its mask guidelines in its facilities when Utah’s statewide mandate ends on April 10. Caregivers working in patient-facing areas or with visitors will continue to follow all PPE guidelines and wear a procedure mask and eye protection. Also, caregivers in nonpatient-facing areas will continue to wear cloth face coverings. Patients and visitors should continue to wear cloth face coverings. Masking will continue to be required within all Intermountain hospitals and facilities. “Our guidelines have worked and it’s important to continue our focus on patient and caregiver safety,” said Eddie Stenehjem, Intermountain Healthcare infectious diseases physician, in a press release. Another reason Intermountain isn’t changing its masking guidelines for patients and caregivers right now is because the risk of transmission of COVID-19 variants remains a concern, especially with movement between counties and states.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Two strains of coronavirus variants were detected in Vermont residents, according to the state’s health department. Earlier this month, the state reported that testing had detected a variant that originated in the United Kingdom. More cases of the U.K. variant have been detected in the state in addition to a variant that was first identified in California. Health officials said although it is not surprising that the variants continue to be detected, it reinforces concerns of increased cases, illnesses and outbreaks. Despite progress in vaccinating Vermonters and easing of some of the restrictions designed to reduce the spread of the virus, the state is still urging people to wear masks, maintain social distance and avoid crowds. “These variants of the COVID-19 virus can move more easily from person to person,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine. “This is setting us up for a race of sorts between the presence of strains of a highly contagious virus, our rapidly progressing vaccination program, and the need for each of us to continue to focus on prevention and getting tested.” State officials are expected to update the public on Friday about the schedule for vaccinating Vermonters against COVID-19.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A judge has refused to issue a preliminary injunction sought by state officials against a restaurant whose owner has defied Gov. Ralph Northam’s COVID-19 restrictions on businesses. The judge on Friday denied the state’s request for an injunction that would have resulted in the immediate closure of Gourmeltz restaurant in Fredericksburg. The judge said the state had failed to show that it would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction or that an injunction was in the public interest. The Free Lance-Star reported that Gourmeltz owner Matt Strickland has refused to stop serving food and alcohol despite having his licenses suspended by the Virginia Health Department. State attorneys argued at a hearing last week that Strickland’s refusal to comply with mask and social distancing requirements justified the restaurant’s immediate closing. Strickland said the state’s mandates are unconstitutional. State officials began investigating Gourmeltz after receiving complaints about employees not wearing masks, social distance protocols not being followed and required signs not being posted.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap: A new drive-thru COVID-19 vaccine clinic is opening this week at the Olympic College campus in Poulsbo as a new wave of people becomes eligible for vaccinations. And other public vaccine clinics established by Kitsap Public Health and the county’s Emergency Operations Center are in the works, according to the health district, including at a new unnamed site in South Kitsap. The two have continued to run a clinic at the old St. Michael Medical Center campus in Bremerton. “Our goal is to vaccinate Kitsap residents as safely, efficiently, and equitably as possible,” Kitsap Public Health District Health Administrator Keith Grellner said in a statement. “We are grateful to Olympic College Poulsbo and the Olympic College Nursing Program for making this North Kitsap site possible.” A new set of eligible people can flood the market for vaccines this week as agricultural, grocery store, child care and public transit workers, those who are pregnant, those with a disability that puts them at high risk and others can begin to sign up for shots. The state’s Department of Health estimated that roughly 18,000 people in Kitsap are newly eligible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A member of the House of Delegates has contracted the coronavirus and is under quarantine, a House leader said. Raleigh County Republican Brandon Steele tested positive on Saturday, House Majority leader Amy Summers said in a statement. Steele chairs the House Government Organization Committee. Steele addressed legislation in the packed House chambers without a mask on Friday. Delegates are allowed to remove their masks when recognized to speak. “We have attempted to notify anyone who had the potential of high-risk exposure to this member, which would have meant close contact for more than 15 minutes, and we also want everyone with the House of Delegates to be aware of this positive case,” Summers said. Virus testing will be offered at the state Capitol starting Monday, including a drive-thru option, the statement said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Although the state’s second-largest school district remained closed to in-person learning for most of the school year, a large number of districts across the state maintained in-person learning since September, with some only closing for one or two weeks because of COVID-19-related staffing shortages. The districts outlined a number of reasons why they opted to maintain in-person learning, with the lack of access to broadband internet needed to support online learning at the forefront. Some areas also lack cellphone coverage, so not even cellphone hot spots are an option. “The real issue is the infrastructure is not there,” Unity School District Superintendent Brandon Robinson said. When his district had to shut down in-person learning for two weeks in the fall because of a staffing shortage, students and families would sit in the parking lot to access the school’s Wi-Fi to complete classwork, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. The Markesan School District, located in rural Green Lake County, has a student population of roughly 800 and has been open since September, but not without challenges, said Jason Breaker, interim district administrator and elementary principal. The district’s former superintendent, Duane Bark, died of COVID-19 last year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming has had about 7,000 people use its COVID-19 app at its peak, but only about 75 used a code to broadcast potential exposures, according to Kim Deti, a health department spokesperson. Instead, she said, the state relies primarily on in-person tracing. “We have continued to consider phone interviews by trained epidemiologists with cases to identify those at high risk of exposure, followed by direct notification of an exposure by an epidemiologist, to be the gold standard of response,” Deti wrote in an email.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/education/2020/12/30/take-look-how-covid-19-impacted-acadiana-schools-2020/4007917001/", "title": "Take a look at how COVID-19 impacted Acadiana schools in 2020", "text": "In looking back at the past year in Acadiana education, it's clear what the biggest news story was — the novel coronavirus. But that wasn't just one story.\n\nFrom whether schools would close in the spring to where graduations would be held in the summer to how the fall would look, the impact of COVID-19 on education has spanned the seasons and constantly changed, and will continue into 2021.\n\nHere's a look at the impact of coronavirus on Acadiana schools over the last year.\n\nMarch\n\nSchools begin to prepare for COVID-19, limit travel\n\nMarch 3 — Louisiana education officials made plans to handle issues that could arise with cases of novel coronavirus, which Gov. John Bel Edwards said was expected to surface in the state.\n\nMost of the steps emphasized prevention and increasing awareness.\n\n\"Our administrators have been in ongoing conversations and monitoring the status of the situation and information released from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the Louisiana Department of Hospitals,\" Allison Dickerson, public information officer for the Lafayette Parish School System, said in early March.\n\nThe Louisiana Department of Education and local districts were preparing information with guidance from the CDC for schools to address concerns about COVID-19.\n\nStudents or staff who had recently traveled outside the U.S. to a country on the CDC's risk-assessed list, were asked to wait 14 days, beginning with the day of return to the U.S., before returning to school and work.\n\nStaff were trained in \"preventing the spread of germs in schools\" through an online course.\n\nAt this point, there were no plans as drastic as closing schools, as there had been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Louisiana.\n\nMarch 9 — The University of Louisiana at Lafayette began prohibiting university-supported travel for staff, faculty and students to certain countries due to concerns about the novel coronavirus.\n\nThis announcement came after Louisiana confirmed its first presumptive positive case of coronavirus.

But students could remain on campus if necessary, officials said.\n\nMost higher education leaders making the decision to cancel face-to-face classes were in the New Orleans area, where 15 presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 had been reported.\n\nLouisiana State University announced it would move all classes online beginning March 30, after two weeks without classes. The online classes continued through the spring semester.\n\nThe decision was made following Edwards' declaration of a statewide public health emergency, which set into motion a number of precautionary steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, according to LSU.\n\nMarch 25 — Following a statewide order from the governor to stay home, Louisiana universities asked on-campus residents to move home, if possible.\n\nThose remaining in on-campus housing were to adhere to the order, which limited Louisiana residents to their homes except to perform \"essential tasks\" like grocery shopping and medical appointments.\n\nUL Lafayette has first confirmed student case\n\nMarch 25 — A student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nIn an emailed statement to students, faculty and staff members, UL President Joseph Savoie said the student did not live on campus and was not a student resident in the spring semester.\n\nMore:University of Louisiana at Lafayette student tests positive for COVID-19\n\nGovernor closes Louisiana schools\n\nMarch 13 — As suspected coronavirus cases increased, Edwards issued an executive order March 13 to close all Louisiana's public schools, ban gatherings of 250 or more and postpone the state's April 4 presidential primary.\n\nLafayette Parish school officials said they had a plan to respond to Edwards' declaration.\n\n\"Our schools are prepared to do what's necessary, and we have a plan,\" Lafayette Parish School Board President Britt Latiolais said. \"It's a plan that will evolve with the changes of the situation.\"\n\nThe governor's declaration closed all K-12 public schools statewide until April 13, the day after Easter.\n\nMarch 19 — The Lafayette Parish School System decided to keep schools closed through April 17, Superintendent Irma Trosclair said in a video shared by the district.\n\nMarch 25 — The plan in Louisiana was to reopen schools when emergency proclamations were to expire April 13, the governor said.\n\n\"Right now we have not called off school for the rest of the year,\" Edwards had said. \"That may or may not be possible.\"\n\nNew guidance from the CDC stated that closing schools for eight or more weeks has a greater impact on mitigating the spread of the virus than shorter closures.\n\nVirtual learning starts for some private schools\n\nMarch 30 — St. Thomas More was among schools offering remote or virtual learning through programs like Zoom and Google Classroom to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, protect faculty and students and continue instruction.\n\n\"Our students are counting on us to prepare them to move to the next level, whether that be the next grade or moving on to college,\" STM Principal Kelley Leger said. \"If, as a school, we have the capability and equipment to continue the educational process, then we should do so.\"\n\nTeurlings Catholic High administration did the same, working to minimize this interruption of the school year for everyone's academic and mental well-being.\n\n\"We want to keep minds active and maintain some sort of instruction, continuity and normalcy,\" Teurlings Assistant Principal Lauren Jeffrey said.\n\nOpelousas Catholic School students from 4 years old to 12th grade transitioned to distance learning with videos from teachers and online assignments.\n\nAs schools closed to stop the spread of COVID-19, Chromebooks were loaned to families without computers.

Louisiana students and teachers learned suddenly before dismissal on a Friday afternoon in March that schools would shut down for a month.\n\nIt was jarring news, and on top of all the questions — would there be distance learning? what about meals? what happens with testing? — many educators were just plain sad.\n\n\"..This is even harder than summer break,\" said Jennifer Babineaux, a first-grade teacher at Broadmoor Elementary in Lafayette.\n\nShe described the initial feeling as something similar to mourning or grieving. She wasn't alone. Blogs using the same descriptors circulated on social media as teachers related and shared.\n\nFull story:We asked Louisiana teachers how they're coping. They miss their students terribly.\n\nApril 3 — Lafayette Parish teachers brought back the art of letter-writing to reach their students from afar during the COVID-19 pandemic. With schools closed since March 13, teachers not only wanted to make sure kids were reading, but also just wanted to connect.\n\nRaegan Abshire, 21, a student teacher at Charles M. Burke Elementary in Duson, wrote each of her 39 third-graders a letter and mailed them with a bookmark after a few weeks away from school.\n\n\"Honestly, I was just getting really lonesome for them,\" Abshire said. \"It's my first year teaching. I've gotten very close to these kids, my first group.\"\n\nJulia Lopez, also a teacher at Burke, turned to mail to reach her pre-kindergarten Spanish immersion students. The letters were an opportunity for them to practice their language skills by reading her Spanish letter and writing back.\n\nApril 13 — With schools closed, Lafayette students and teachers got creative with virtual art days, reading challenges and P.E. videos.\n\nLibrarians used Google Classroom, emails and the Remind app to share resources like Tumblebooks, Read Epic and online read-alouds like Storyline Online. And, students took reading comprehension quizzes at home instead of only at school to earn Accelerated Reader points.\n\nApril 15 — David Thibodaux STEM Magnet Academy seniors returned to campus in cars to find administrators in blue masks, gloves and even a full bulldog costume. They cheered, jumped and handed over bags filled with announcements, gowns and tassels — everything the seniors ordered months ago for graduation in May.\n\nNormally, students picked up their supplies inside school during lunch or another break, but this time, they did it from their cars to maintain social distance.\n\n\"It's crazy how good the feeling is when you actually see them, even if it's from a distance,\" Sherrie Campbell said about seeing students for the first time in a month.\n\nLafayette mom creates national movement honoring high school seniors\n\nApril 26 — Amanda Menard Hunt started a Facebook group with a simple post about her graduating senior son, Seth.

By May, they were planning virtual commencements.\n\nThe University of Louisiana at Lafayette provided all the pomp and circumstance but in a virtual way May 15.\n\nThe general assembly and commencement speakers were livestreamed on the Spring 2020 Commencement website and were televised on local cable stations.\n\nUL Lafayette conferred 1,905 degrees, the most for a single semester in university history.

Five of the eight high schools have more than 200 graduates each.\n\nHowever, school district and Cajundome officials learned days before the first ceremony that they could not hold events with these proposed crowd sizes \"due to the recent spike in the number of positive COVID-19 cases,\" according to an email from the Louisiana Office of State Fire Marshal Dispatch Operations.\n\nThe venue was changed to Cajun Field, and about 100 Northside High students were the first to take the field July 9, sitting in folding chairs spaced at least six feet apart on the field for an early morning commencement ceremony.\n\nGuests — limited to no more than four per graduate — arrived early to follow parking and social distancing protocols and still get inside early enough to hear their student's name called. Some came with balloons and posters, and most used their program to shield their eyes from the rising sun on the hot July day.\n\nJuly\n\nPresidential responses to COVID-19 threaten to impact international teachers\n\nJuly 6 — President Donald Trump's decision to suspend the J-1 temporary work visa would have meant more than 70 foreign language teachers scheduled to join Louisiana schools in the fall wouldn't be coming.\n\n\"This action could close programs,\" Louisiana Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said.\n\nThe language immersion teachers were under contract with the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) and the Louisiana Department of Education. They typically arrive in July to get settled into their new cities and prepare their French or Spanish classrooms.\n\nTrump's order made it impossible for them to come without an exemption. So CODOFIL and educators reached out to elected officials to obtain exemptions for the teachers and save immersion programs in Louisiana.\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Louisiana public school students were impacted by the absence of these teachers. There are not enough local, \"homegrown\" teachers to fill these positions, which require teachers qualified in certain subjects, such as social studies or math, to instruct students in the target language, advocates said.\n\nJuly 22 — The Trump administration reversed course on some of its recent visa restrictions, granting exceptions to allow foreign language teachers to work in schools and to keep international students in Louisiana even if they have to shift to fully online schedules.\n\nThe federal government announced exceptions to the president's proclamation that suspended temporary work visas, allowing immersion teachers to come to Louisiana schools and fulfill their contracts.\n\nBESE sets standards for how schools could open for fall\n\nJuly 14 — The Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education set measures stating that schools in Louisiana would need to provide employees access to cleaning supplies, set up isolation areas for anyone showing signs of being sick and limit visitors to those considered \"essential.\"\n\nThe minimum safety standards for reopening schools called for students to wear masks, wash or sanitize their hands at least every two hours and to remain in the same groups to reduce contact.\n\n\"These restrictions will be onerous on any school, but they will put the school in the best position possible to minimize spread (of the virus) and absenteeism,\" Dr. Joseph Kanter, assistant state medical director with the Louisiana Department of Health, told BESE members. \"These disruptions will occur, but if we skimp on this type of precautions, they will occur at a greater frequency.\"\n\nFull story:Louisiana board sets rules for reopening schools this fall.

This model remained in effect through the first nine-week grading period that ended Oct. 13.\n\nMany Lafayette private schools said they planned to start classes with regular five-day attendance on campus for students, although each would follow safety restrictions.\n\nSome Lafayette Catholic schools released information about their safety and health protocols, and common safety standards can be found in individual school plans for the first day of school. Students would return to campuses in August, with some alternating days and others maintaining social distance on campus five days week.\n\nStudents in Lafayette Parish charter schools would alternate days on campus and at home, like many students across the state.\n\nSurvey finds many in Louisiana uncomfortable with sending kids to school\n\nJuly 13 — Many in Louisiana were uncomfortable sending their children back to school next month, according to survey results released in July by the Louisiana Federation of Teachers and School Employees.\n\nNearly 15,000 people responded to the union's online survey between June 30 and July 10, including more than 8,400 current Louisiana school employees.\n\nAbout two-thirds (58%) of respondents statewide said they were not comfortable sending their children back to school.

This helped students who do not have the access required to complete online assignments.\n\nMore:Lafayette school system commits $1.5 million to provide internet for qualifying students\n\nMany schools delay start of school to after Labor Day\n\nAug. 8 — Most public and private school systems across Acadiana postponed the first day of school to Sept. 8 \"after careful consideration and in consultation with local health officials,\" according to a release.\n\nBut others stuck with August dates for welcoming back students. About 200 students returned to Carencro Catholic School on Aug. 13 for the first time in five months, and it looked a little different. Parents dropped off their kids in front of a blue-and-yellow balloon arch in front of the building, because they couldn't go inside.\n\nMore:Carencro Catholic welcomes students for first day of school Thursday\n\nAug. 19 — Lafayette Parish reverses its plan for elementary students for the fall.

The Lafayette Parish School System started the school year on an A/B schedule, in which students alternate days on campus and learning from home.\n\nPlus, about 5,000 of the district's 32,000 students enrolled in the fully virtual Lafayette Online Academy. That number grew to more than 9,000 enrolled in LOA for the first grading period, a huge increase over the couple hundred enrolled in previous years.\n\nAs Lafayette Parish families sent their children back to school, a special help line seeking tech support for remote learning was busy, with about 600 calls in one day, Superintendent Irma Trosclair said. The Lafayette Parish School System and community organization Love Our Schools set up the help line for those needing tech support or questions answered, Trosclair said.\n\nMore:Back to school: Lafayette Parish school system help desk receives 600 calls in one day\n\nSt. Landry students faced connectivity issues\n\nAs St. Landry Parish schools started the academic year virtually for 13,000 students, they faced connectivity issues. While students were required to log into Google Classroom from tablets and Chromebooks at home, not everyone was able to connect to the internet or load the correct program, school officials said.\n\nAt least one school had a momentary internet crash, impacting teachers leading class virtually from their brick-and-mortar classrooms. But Superintendent Patrick Jenkins said \"the vast majority\" of students in the district's 38 schools were able to connect, speak with their teachers and start the school day when classes resumed the next day.\n\nFull story:St. Landry Parish students face connectivity problems as school year starts virtually\n\nSome school campuses close temporarily due to COVID-19\n\nNov. 15 — With about 11% of the 1,600-plus Southside High students quarantined, the Lafayette Parish School System closed the campus and required students to take classes virtually through Nov. 30.\n\nIn November, St. Thomas More Catholic High went to virtual classes until after Thanksgiving break due to a number of positive COVID-19 cases among students. School officials announced in an email that nine students have tested positive for the virus and were quarantined.\n\nDavid Thibodaux STEM Magnet Academy closed its campus from Nov. 18-30, becoming the second school in the Lafayette Parish School System to shift to all virtual classes.\n\nDecember\n\nLafayette Parish students go all-virtual for two days\n\nDec. 17 — The Lafayette Parish School System went fully virtual for all students Dec. 21-22, the last days before winter break, as a \"practice run\" should the shift become necessary the following semester. The two-day move to virtual was not due to significant changes in COVID-19 cases in district schools, administration said in a release.\n\nMore:Lafayette Parish students will go virtual for last two days before winter break\n\nDec. 4 — With the majority of students in the Lafayette Parish School System taking at least some classes virtually, the school board adopted a virtual discipline policy. The goal of the new policy was to clarify expectations for student conduct in the virtual classroom.\n\nRules from the physical classroom applied, as student conduct is governed at all times by the Student Code of Conduct and state statutes. Students are expected to have a quiet, well-lit space that is free, to the extent possible, from toys, images, messages, personal property, or other items that may distract from teaching and learning or that may subject the student to disciplinary action if possessed on school buses, in the regular classroom, or on school property.\n\nFull story:Lafayette Parish School Board approves new discipline policy for virtual school\n\nUL Lafayette holds fall graduation outdoors over two days\n\nDec. 2 — Fall graduates at the University of Louisiana Lafayette got their chance to mark this milestone in person, but it looked different.\n\nRather than gathering together as a general assembly in the Cajundome, graduates took part only in individual college commencement ceremonies at different outdoor venues over two days to meet COVID-19 restrictions and \"ensure the health and safety of attendees,\" according to the school.\n\nFull story:UL Lafayette to hold fall graduation ceremonies outdoors over two days\n\nCOVID-19 impacts students' physical and mental health\n\nIt's a hard time to be in college. It's never easy, of course, as a major life transition into a new social setting on top of the actual school work. But this year is proving to be especially difficult, with a pandemic and multiple hurricanes impacting classes, student activities, jobs and health.\n\nAll the extra stressors are doing a number on students' mental health, affecting them disproportionately worse than others, according to a CDC survey in June. Adults age 18-24 reported worse mental health outcomes, increased substance use and elevated suicidal thoughts due to the pandemic.\n\n\"It has surely been a difficult nine months,\" UL Lafayette Dean of Students Margarita Perez said. \"We're seeing stress, anxiety, worry, loneliness, depression.\"\n\nFull story:'A perfect storm': College students face incredible mental health stressors amid pandemic\n\nThe CDC and other health organizations recommend at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily for children and adolescents ages 6 through 17.\n\nThat can be hard to achieve in a normal school year, and 2020 has been anything but normal. Many children are taking classes remotely, including thousands who enrolled in the virtual Lafayette Online Academy this year, and most parks and playgrounds have closed unless they can be sanitized regularly and meet other COVID restrictions.\n\n\"Children on average are not getting enough physical activity even in the best of times,\" said Chuck Duncan, kinesiology professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. \"So, I am confident that the problem is worse during the past year.\"\n\nResearch on the impact of the pandemic on children's fitness is just beginning, but Duncan said it's clear that it has affected kids negatively. He anticipates long-term impacts on children in Louisiana, which has long been known for poor health outcomes.\n\n\"Children just aren't being active enough,\" he said. \"We'll be playing catch-up, and we've already been playing catch-up for 40 years.\"\n\nFull story here:P.E. in a pandemic: How kids are staying active — or not — while social distancing\n\nContact Leigh Guidry at lguidry@theadvertiser.com or on Twitter @LeighGGuidry.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/04/iowa-coronavirus-covid-19-preparation-testing-virus-sick-cases-test-news-map/4955581002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Iowa: A look back, March 3-15: Urbandale school ...", "text": "Register staff\n\nState and federal officials say there are simple, everyday steps you can take to avoid catching or spreading respiratory diseases, including COVID-19: Cover your coughs and sneezes, thoroughly wash or sanitize your hands and stay home if you are sick.

Several options within the committee’s jurisdiction are being considered as we learn more about the effects on specific industries and the overall economy,\" said a statement from Grassley spokesman Michael Zona.\n\nThe virus' spread has already rattled financial markets.\n\nDes Moines preparing for worker absences\n\nMarch 9: Des Moines officials have begun preparing for the arrival new coronavirus.\n\nIn a Monday morning workshop, City Manager Scott Sanders told the Des Moines City Council the city’s department heads have been working on continuity plans for essential city operations in case large numbers of staff are kept from work because of the illness.\n\n“It is an exercise in, how would you operate with fewer and fewer staff?” he said.\n\nIf enough people are catch the virus -- or are stuck at home caring for a family member — Des Moines residents could see city service levels affected, Sanders added.\n\nCity officials are also working on ways staff members can work remotely. They’ve also posted hand-washing and COVID-19 symptom guides in City Hall bathrooms.\n\nTesting continues for others\n\nMarch 8: The State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa, the sole laboratory in the state testing for the coronavirus, said it has materials to test about 500 people.\n\nAs of Sunday, the lab had tested just 37. Three have tested positive, 26 have tested negative and there are now 8 pending tests.\n\nPeople in Iowa cannot request to be tested for the coronavirus at this point, according to Polly Carver-Kimm, a spokeswoman at the Iowa Department of Public Health. Instead, health care providers, following guidelines around a person's symptoms, must contact the department.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Public Health told reporters it is covering testing for coronavirus, but other expenses related to seeking medical care remains up to individuals.\n\nPublic health officials in Iowa have said for weeks that the risk of contracting the virus in the state is low, in part because many of the early reported cases were linked to international travel in areas with large outbreaks.\n\nBut some of the cases now reported around the U.S. do not have clear connections to that kind of travel, a potential sign that infection could spread through a community.\n\nThe state is also monitoring 15 people who have either traveled to China or Iran in the past 14 days or have had contact with a confirmed case of the virus. The monitoring process includes those individuals checking in periodically with officials. The state had completed the monitoring of 40 people.\n\nThe public health department has also asked Iowans returning home from certain areas overseas to \"self-isolate\" to stop potential spread of the virus. The request is for travelers coming back from Italy, Japan and South Korea.\n\n► National coronavirus updates: The latest on deaths, cases and preparation across the U.S.\n\nNo travel restrictions or testing at Des Moines' airport\n\nMarch 8: Des Moines International Airport had previously announced it was not imposing travel restrictions or requiring testing of arriving passengers for the coronavirus. It planned no immediate changes after Reynolds announced presumptive cases of COVID-19 in Iowa, airport spokeswoman Kayla Kovarna said Sunday night.\n\nThe outbreak:\n\nPrevention:\n\nWells Fargo announces donations to aid coronavirus response\n\nMarch 8: The Wells Fargo Foundation announced Sunday it will give up to $6.25 million to support domestic and global response to the coronavirus outbreak and to aid public health relief efforts.\n\nIn a news release, the San Francisco-based company, which is among Des Moines' largest employers, said its giving will include $1 million for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s emergency relief fund and $250,000 to the International Medical Corps. The company said it will also donate up to $5 million to aid local-level efforts. It did not specify the localities.\n\n“We recognize and appreciate the role of front-line health care providers as they apply their expertise on this fast-moving issue and care for the well-being of our communities,” Bill Daley, Wells Fargo vice chairman of public affairs at Wells Fargo and chairman of the board of the Wells Fargo Foundation, said in a statement. “We also continue to monitor this situation closely for our employees, customers and the communities we serve and are prepared to adapt as needed.”\n\nTwo hospitals begin limiting patient visits\n\nMarch 6: Two hospitals in Cedar Rapids are limiting their patient visits.\n\nMercy Medical Center and UnityPoint Health-St. Luke's Hospital announced in a news release Friday that staff is limiting patient visitations to minimize their potential exposure to \"seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses.\"\n\nThe hospitals note in their news release that there are no cases of the novel coronavirus in Iowa.\n\nVisitors at both hospitals will be limited to two adults per patient room at any time unless there is a special circumstance, according to a news release. There are different visiting rules for the maternity and pediatrics floors, as well as the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\nIowa company plans to deliver 1 million test kits\n\nMarch 6: An Iowa company is at the center of the federal government's effort to increase the availability of testing for the novel coronavirus, which Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged Thursday is in short supply.\n\nBased in Coralville, Integrated DNA Technologies manufactures and distributes a wide variety of testing kits and related products worldwide. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters Thursday that the company expects to ship 1 million testing kits to U.S. laboratories by week's end. That amounts to the capacity to test roughly 400,000 people, given that it takes multiple test samples to confirm a result.\n\nOn Friday, company officials said they had delivered materials that enabled testing of over 700,000 individuals for the coronavirus. A company spokeswoman said the biotech firm is ready to send additional materials for more testing.\n\nThe U.S. has trailed other countries in rolling out tests because of problems with its test kits, and because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially limited the number of eligible people.\n\nU.S. senators who were briefed on the plan said it could take days or weeks before thousands of medical personnel are trained to use the tests.\n\nIowa has increased its capacity to test for the coronavirus\n\nMarch 6: The State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa has upped its capacity to test for the coronavirus in recent days.\n\nAnne Bassett, a spokeswoman for the Coralville-based facility, said that as of Friday, the lab has materials to test about 500 people for the virus. That is an increase from about 250 people.\n\nMichael Pentella, director of the State Hygienic Laboratory, told reporters at a news conference last week that he's not concerned about the state's capacity to test people.\n\n\"I think we have the resources that we need,\" Pentella said.\n\nThe lab is able to confirm the negative results of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must confirm potential positive results.\n\nIowa's public universities cancel travel plans\n\nMarch 5: Iowa's three public universities have limited their travel over the next month.\n\nThe Iowa Board of Regents, which oversees the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa, announced Thursday that it has canceled all university-sponsored international travel for all faculty, staff and students for 30 days, effective immediately. That includes spring break travel.\n\nOfficials are recalling faculty, staff and students already abroad who are in areas with large outbreaks as determined by the CDC. As of Thursday, those countries are China, Iran, South Korea and Italy.\n\nThe University of Northern Iowa announced Friday that it is canceling all summer study abroad courses in light of the virus' spread, impacting more than 250 students with trips planned to countries including Egypt, Italy and the United Kingdom, according to a news release.\n\nIowa's congressional delegation approves money to combat coronavirus\n\nMarch 6: All of Iowa's congressional delegation approved federal money last week to help combat coronavirus.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives voted Wednesday in support of an $8.3 billion package. The U.S. Senate approved the funding Thursday, and President Donald Trump signed it on Friday morning.\n\nThat included votes from Democratic U.S. Reps. Cindy Axne, Abby Finkenauer and Dave Loebsack, as well as Republican U.S. Rep. Steve King.\n\nU.S. Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst also approved the funding.\n\nThe money includes more than $3 billion for research and development for vaccines, $2.2 billion for prevention and response, and $1 billion for state and local responses.\n\nHow has the virus affected Iowa?\n\nMarch 3: The coronavirus has begun to affect daily life in Iowa, though the full scope of potential impact is unclear.\n\nState and local officials are evaluating a range of considerations about Iowans' ability to do things such as work, learn and congregate. Restrictions remain limited, but they have the potential, in some cases, to upend Iowans' routines and lives.\n\nRegister reporters Nick Coltrain, Barbara Rodriguez, Jason Clayworth, Brianne Pfannenstiel, Austin Cannon, Sarah LeBlanc, Cecelia Hanley, the Associated Press and Iowa City Press-Citizen reporter Aimee Breaux contributed to this report.\n\nA subscription makes work like this possible.

Jefferson County Health Officer Mark Wilson announced the orders at a news conference Monday. Seventeen of the 29 confirmed virus cases in Alabama have been detected in Jefferson County, which includes the city of Birmingham. Wilson said child care centers, preschools and private school centers with 12 or more students are to close from Thursday until April 6. Restaurants beginning Tuesday should not have on-site dining for one week, but delivery and takeout can continue. The orders also call for the closure of senior citizen center activities and for nursing homes to restrict visitation except for compassionate situations such as end of life. The order prohibits public gatherings with more than 25 people.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The mayor signed an order Monday closing gyms and entertainment venues and barring restaurants, bars and other establishments from offering dine-in service to the public through the rest of March amid concerns over the new coronavirus. The order, signed by Mayor Ethan Berkowitz, also would close self-serve buffets and salad bars. The order would not apply to drive-thrus or takeout or delivery services. Grocery stores would remain open, according to a release from his office. Entertainment venues, which his office said includes theaters, gyms and bingo halls, will be closed through March 31 as well. Gatherings of at least 50 people in Anchorage also will be prohibited, though the order says this does not apply to the day-to-day operations of organizations such as businesses, universities or day cares that are not already subject to closure. “By making sacrifices now, we reduce the likelihood that we will pay a larger cost later,” Berkowitz said in a release. Gov. Mike Dunleavy said he has not yet felt the need to enact such restrictions statewide.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Attorneys representing the 34,000 inmates in Arizona’s prisons asked a judge Monday to order the state to develop an adequate plan for confronting the new coronavirus behind bars, arguing housing conditions and the state’s lack of preparation put the lives of older prisoners with chronic illnesses at risk. The lawyers said they saw medically fragile inmates crowded in dirty and unventilated dorms and tents during a visit last week at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence. They said corrections officials and the state’s health care provider for prisoners “had no articulable plan for managing and preventing the spread of the virus.” The Department of Corrections, Reentry and Rehabilitation said it has taken steps to reduce the potential spread of the virus, such as suspending visitation for at least 30 days and suspending a $4 copayment on inmates who seek medical help for cold and flu symptoms.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The city is imposing more restrictions, including a curfew, in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus as the number of infections in the state continues to rise. Mayor Frank Scott said Monday that a curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. will be in effect in Little Rock beginning early Wednesday. “This decision we did not take lightly at all,” Scott said. The curfew will not apply to people traveling to or from work, and police won’t stop vehicles for breaking the curfew, Scott said. The mayor made the announcement shortly after the state Department of Health announced that the number of coronavirus cases in Arkansas had risen by six to 22. Two of the new infections were found in people from who live in Cleburne County but had traveled out of state to a conference, health officials said. The other four contracted it in a health care setting. Meanwhile, two more casinos – Southland Casino Racing, a West Memphis dog track, and Saracen Casino Resort in Pine Bluff – are closing temporarily because of concerns about the virus.\n\nCalifornia\n\nEncinitas: Disturbed by empty store shelves and reports of hoarding during the coronavirus crisis, a man stood on a Southern California street corner and held up a homemade cardboard sign with a simple request: “Share your toilet paper.” Jonny Blue told the San Diego Union-Tribune the response to his impromptu toilet paper exchange in Encinitas was immediate and positive. Drivers honked horns in support and stopped to drop off rolls of toilet paper. Just as quickly, Blue would hand rolls to those in need. Blue, a physical therapist, said he planned to head out to the corner again to “encourage people to be better” amid the global pandemic. Blue gave a few rolls to a grateful motorist who said he came up empty at several stores. “He was like, ‘Do you want me to pay you?’ I said, ‘No, man. Somebody gave it to me. Take it.’ ” The 33-year-old told the newspaper he made his sign after a friend had a difficult time finding diapers and essential supplies for his kids. “I think people want a sense of community,” Blue said. “When things are really challenging, people are looking to band together and be unified.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s 12,000 bars and restaurants are limited to takeout and delivery orders under a ban on gatherings of 50 people as the state expands testing to try to brake the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday. Polis also announced the closure of all theaters, gyms and casinos until further notice. The restaurant-bar measure will affect 240,000 workers and last at least 30 days, he said, calling it a tough but necessary step to fight a pandemic that has likely infected thousands in Colorado. At least 160 people had tested positive for the coronavirus as of Monday, and 20 were hospitalized, Polis said. The greatest challenge, he said, was in chasing a virus where the latest information, based on tests, is always three to five days old. Mayor Michael Hancock said people arrested for low-level crimes will no longer be booked into jail, and social distancing would be increased behind bars. To keep people in homes, sheriff’s deputies will not enforce eviction notices during the crisis, and the city is also negotiating with hotels to house homeless people, prioritizing those who have significant respiratory problems.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 200 employees of a health care system that includes seven hospitals in Connecticut and New York are staying home because they may have come into contact with the coronavirus, according to Gov. Ned Lamont. He said the workers are with Nuvance Health, whose system includes Danbury Hospital, where the first Connecticut resident who tested positive for COVID-19 was treated. The Democratic governor said Monday night that the situation shows the need for a large increase in testing. Nuvance Health said in a statement Tuesday that “the number of people furloughed is evolving as some early furloughs are now safely returning to work.” It said testing for those who meet criteria is continuing. Lamont said on MSNBC that Danbury Hospital was at capacity, but Nuvance officials said that was not the case.\n\nDelaware\n\nSmyrna: Gov. John Carney has directed restaurants and bars to restrict their operations to takeout, drive-thru and delivery services. A revision of an emergency declaration Carney issued last week also gives Delaware’s secretary of labor authorization to develop emergency rules to ensure unemployment benefits are available for Delawareans whose jobs are affected by the outbreak. It also directs organizers and sponsors of public gatherings of 50 or more people to cancel them immediately and halts gaming operations at casinos. Also Monday, public health officials confirmed the state’s eighth case of coronavirus, a day after U.S. Sen. Tom Carper’s office announced a member of his Delaware-based staff had tested positive for COVID-19. Meanwhile, Carney got a firsthand look at how Delaware is monitoring and responding to the spread of the coronavirus during a tour Monday of the State Health Operations Center in Smyrna. “I was just really impressed as I walked around here with the diligence and focus of our team,” he said. State laboratory director Dr. Sergio Huerta told Carney that Delaware officials were “ahead of the game.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser has ordered bars and some restaurants in the district closed, WUSA-TV reports. Drive-thru, carryout, takeout and food delivery remain available throughout the city. Specific businesses affected by Bowser’s announcement were to close doors by 10 p.m. Monday. Bowser’s decision to shut down businesses was part of an effort to limit day-to-day interactions and to encourage social distancing in order to stop the spread of coronavirus. “We all have a role to play,” Bowser said. She spoke about “flattening the curve” through social distancing during a news conference Monday. “Let me be clear about why social distancing is so important. When we slow the spread of COVID-19, we protect our hospitals from getting overwhelmed. We are able to keep more hospital beds open and make better use of limited resources,” Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered all bars and nightclubs closed for 30 days starting at 5 p.m. Tuesday, upending St. Patrick’s Day revelries as the state acts more aggressively to contain a new strain of coronavirus that has infected more than 170 people in Florida, killing five. He also said he’s asking Florida’s university board of governors to require students to return home for remote learning for the rest of the spring semester. The governor also announced that restaurants must limit their number of patrons to maintain safe distances between diners. Under the governor’s order, restaurants can only operate at half-capacity. Up until now, DeSantis has mostly refrained from issuing mandates and allowed localities to use their own judgment on how to limit public activities. Many beaches in Florida, including Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale Beach and Hollywood Beach, have closed to spring break crowds. But some have stayed open: Beaches in Clearwater, on Florida’s Gulf Coast, were packed with spring breakers Monday afternoon.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp on Monday ordered public schools and colleges closed from Wednesday until at least March 31, after lawmakers ratified his weekend emergency declaration to fight the new coronavirus. Public schools serving more than 1.7 million of Georgia’s 1.8 million students had already closed, although some mostly in rural areas had remained open. Most schools say they hope to continue delivering lessons online. The state university system announced its 26 public colleges and universities would shift all classes online for the remainder of the spring semester, “with extremely limited exceptions.” Students can’t return to campus without their college’s permission, the University System of Georgia said, and dorms will be closed except for students unable to return home. Kemp’s move came as the number of cases continues to rise, with the Georgia Public Health Department reporting 121 cases at noon Monday, up from 99 on Sunday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State lawmakers on Monday voted to indefinitely suspend the current legislative session to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The announcement came as Honolulu reported Hawaii’s first case of an individual testing positive for the disease without having traveled out of state. The House and Senate both voted for resolutions calling for a recess effective Tuesday after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to restrict gatherings of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks. “This is an unprecedented situation. We are having to monitor events not by the day but practically by the hour,” House Speaker Scott Saiki told reporters at a news conference. He said members of the public feel the need to attend hearings as bills move through the legislative process, and lawmakers didn’t want people to have to compromise their safety by attending.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State health officials say two more people have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of residents known to be infected with the coronavirus to seven. One of the cases announced Tuesday was in a woman under the age of 50 in the Ada County region, and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said she had no known interactions with the other two cases previously identified in the area. Still, officials believed her case was likely travel-related and said she had mild symptoms and was recovering at home in isolation. The other case was in the South Central Public Health region, in a woman over 50. Investigators are still trying to determine how she contracted the illness but said she was also recovering well at home. Officials did not release where in the region the patient was from. She’s the third person in the district diagnosed with COVID-19. Idaho’s other known case is in eastern Idaho’s Teton County.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Election workers were delivering hand sanitizer at polling places Tuesday as the state’s presidential primary got underway amid a global pandemic. State officials declined to postpone the election despite concerns about low turnout during the COVID-19 outbreak. Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who has ordered schools, restaurants and bars closed due to the virus, said Sunday that “we have to elect leaders, even in less than ideal circumstances.” Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough said shortly after the polls opened that she had heard of no immediate problems at the county’s polling sites and expected “things to go well.” There were some signs of early confusion, though. Timna Axel, director of communications for the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, said voters had been calling the group’s hotline all morning to get help finding their polling places. Election authorities around the state scrambled to find alternate locations as nursing homes and other typical polling sites backed out amid concern about the coronavirus. The steady flow of calls – including from some polling place workers – is “unusual for a primary,” Axel said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A second person has died in a coronavirus-related death, state health officials announced Tuesday. The person, who was older than 60 and had been hospitalized, was from Johnson County, just south of Indianapolis, according to the Indiana State Department of Health. That announcement came after Indiana recorded its first COVID-19 death Monday, when an Indianapolis resident died. The health department on Tuesday reported six additional confirmed COVID-19 illnesses, giving the state 30 cases across 15 counties. State officials acknowledge that likely thousands of people are infected by the virus and that testing is largely being done on those with serious symptoms or known exposure to others infected. Indiana’s Roman Catholic bishops on Tuesday said they were suspending all public Sunday and weekday Masses starting Wednesday until further notice. The bishops cited the recommendations of health officials, who have asked for no public gatherings of more than 50 people.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds on Tuesday ordered restaurants, bars, fitness centers, theaters and casinos to close for two weeks as part of a public health emergency plan designed to reduce the community spread of coronavirus. Reynolds’ proclamation prohibits social, community, spiritual, religious, recreational, leisure and sporting gatherings. It also bans events of more than 10 people including parades, festivals, conventions and fundraisers, in line with federal recommendations. Senior citizen centers and adult day care facilities were closed. “These are unprecedented times and the state of Iowa will do whatever is necessary to address this public health disaster,” Reynolds said in a statement. “The actions taken today are necessary to protect the health and safety of all Iowans and are critical to mitigating the spread of the virus.” Iowa had 23 positive cases as of Tuesday morning.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state has at least 14 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as the fallout from the pandemic continues to spread, officials said Tuesday. Ford County health officials reported their first case, and Johnson County reported two more, bringing the total in the state’s most populous county to 10. Franklin, Butler and Wyandotte counties also have each recorded a case. After a Kansas House panel approved a bill to give laid-off workers another 10 weeks of unemployment benefits, the chamber canceled all of its remaining committee meetings until further notice. It also sent office assistants home. Also Tuesday, Kansas lottery officials announced the four state-owned casinos will close at the end of the day Tuesday until at least March 30. That comes after two of the state’s major universities announced Monday that they will move to all remote classes and not hold scheduled graduation ceremonies.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Derby was postponed until September on Tuesday, the latest rite of spring in sports to be struck by the new coronavirus. The Derby, America’s longest continuously held sports event, had been scheduled for May 2. It will now be run Sept. 5, kicking off Labor Day weekend. “We’ll roll with the punches and feel very, very good that September is the right date,” Bill Carstanjen, CEO of Churchill Downs Inc., said on a conference call. It’s the first time the Derby won’t be held on its traditional first Saturday in May since 1945, when it was run June 9. The federal government suspended horse racing nationwide for most of the first half of the year before World War II ended in early May, but not in time to hold the first leg of the Triple Crown that month. The date change still must be approved by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission at its meeting Thursday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A dozen residents of a retirement home are now infected by the coronavirus, which has proven more lethal for older people than other age groups, the governor said. One of Louisiana’s four deaths from COVID-19 was an 84-year-old resident of the Lambeth House retirement home in New Orleans, Gov. John Bel Edwards said. Dr. Jennifer Avegno, leader of the city health department, stressed that the virus was spreading much faster in New Orleans than in other U.S. cities. “This is a rapidly changing situation,” she said. “There is substantial community spread.” The governor has ordered bars, gyms and movie theaters to close and limited restaurants to delivery and takeout. The number of positive tests for the virus in Louisiana reached 171 by Tuesday, according to the state health department’s latest figures. The fourth death in the state was reported Tuesday.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: More than 30 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across seven counties in the state, officials said Tuesday. Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the number will likely grow, and he encouraged people not to panic. “Panic is a paralytic. It can cloud your mind and cause you to focus on things that are not your top priorities,” he said. One of the new cases is a child under 10 in Andrscoggin County, Shah said. For now, he said there’s evidence of community spread only in Cumberland County. The announcement by the Maine CDC came as the Legislature convened to consider an omnibus bill related to the coronavirus and a supplemental budget bill that includes spending to fight the virus.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan postponed the state’s April 28 primary to June 2 on Tuesday, but the state is moving forward with a vote-by-mail special general election April 28 to fill the congressional seat that was left vacant by the death of Elijah Cummings. The Republican governor said his two main priorities are keeping Marylanders safe and protecting their constitutional right to vote. Hogan said Maryland has confirmed 57 cases of the coronavirus, a 54% increase from the day before. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assembly in places like schools and senior centers, which are already closed under the state of emergency, and it would put Marylanders at risk, especially the poll workers and election judges, most of whom are retirees and in the most vulnerable population,” Hogan said at a news conference. He said a mail-in vote for the entire state could not be done, “but we didn’t want to have people without representation for that long in that district.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Biogen Inc., the Massachusetts biotech company linked to a cluster of COVID-19 cases stemming from a meeting last month at a Boston hotel, is donating $10 million to fight the pandemic. “This donation will be used to help expand testing options, ease the strain on medical systems, provide training for front line health workers and support access to necessities like food,” the Cambridge-based company said in a statement. The money, donated through the Biogen Foundation, is designed to help nonprofits in Massachusetts and North Carolina, as well as Italy and other countries affected by the pandemic, the company said. There have been about 200 cases of COVID-19 in Massachusetts, about half of which have been linked to the Feb. 26-27 conference. The company has also provided medical equipment and supplies to Partners HealthCare, the state’s largest hospital and health care organization, to help diagnose COVID-19 in a greater number of people.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Bus riders in the city suddenly were stranded Tuesday after most drivers didn’t report to work, apparently concerned about the spread of the coronavirus and whether Michigan’s new restrictions on gatherings include vehicles loaded with commuters. The Detroit Department of Transportation canceled bus service shortly after 8 a.m. due to the shortage of drivers. Riders waiting at stops across the city were surprised and pulled out their phones to get a lift from friends or family. Bus driver Schetrone Collier said he and his colleagues have concerns about the coronavirus pandemic that are not being addressed. They note that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s order bans more than 50 people from gathering at a time and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended no more than 10 people gather. The city said it reached an agreement with unions to address anxieties and restore service.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state House passed a bill early Tuesday that provides $200 million to combat the coronavirus pandemic in this state where the number of cases has grown to 54. The bill allocates $150 million for a newly created health care response fund. The Minnesota Department of Health will make grants to health care providers in dealing with COVID-19, including testing services. The legislation also provides $50 million for a contingency account for use by providers, ambulance services, health care clinics, hospitals and long-term care facilities. The House action on St. Patrick’s Day comes after Gov. Tim Walz ordered bars and restaurants across Minnesota to temporarily close to customers who dine in. “While each of us is working as hard as we can to decrease the risk of transmission, we must ensure our health care providers have the resources they need to take care of Minnesotans who may be afflicted with COVID-19,” House Speaker Melissa Hortman said in a statement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Legislators said Tuesday that they will suspend their session until at least April 1 because of the coronavirus pandemic, in accordance with a recommendation from the state health officer. Mississippi reported 21 confirmed cases of the virus as of Tuesday, up from 12 on Monday. Lawmakers were attempting to finish up one urgent task before pushing the pause button: considering a bill that would give city and county governments and school boards the power to pay hourly employees who are not working during a disaster, including the current pandemic. The bill was expected to pass. State law already authorizes the government to pay its hourly employees who can’t work during emergencies. The legislation would not affect private businesses, although Democratic Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez sought changes to make unemployment benefits available to private employees temporarily out of work.\n\nMissouri\n\nLee’s Summit: A clinical lab in the state says it has developed a test for the novel coronavirus that is more than 99% accurate. KCUR reports Viracor Eurofins in Lee’s Summit claims it is capable of performing more than 1,000 tests per day and returning results the same day. Officials say the test would allow for expanding testing to patients who don’t currently meet the eligibility criteria for public laboratory testing established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Company Vice President Steve Kleiboecker said the test is performed with chemicals and reagents – compounds used to detect other substances. That allows it to be performed quickly. The test has yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the company is certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, which sets standards for clinical lab testing. The certification allows the lab to proceed with tests and then send data to the FDA for review. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has allowed testing to begin.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: The Irish flag flew over the Capitol on Tuesday, keeping alive one St. Patrick’s Day tradition even as celebrations and parades were canceled across the state because of the coronovirus outbreak. With ample space between them, a nod to the precautions being taken to curb the virus’s spread, Gov. Steve Bullock and Lewis and Clark County Commissioner Jim McCormick read proclamations on the Capitol steps in Helena before raising the Irish flag. But the festivities that usually take place afterward, including Irish dancing in the rotunda, were canceled. St. Patrick’s Day is widely celebrated in Montana. But the mood was subdued Tuesday, with parades scratched and people sticking close to home, or else practicing social distancing guidelines that advise people to keep at least 6 feet away from one another. Most of the state’s large cities issued orders to close bars, restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Eight state residents who were on a cruise ship forced to idle off the California coast because of COVID-19 cases aboard have returned to Nebraska and will isolate themselves for 14 days, officials said. The Grand Princess pulled into the Port of Oakland on March 9 with more than 3,500 people aboard – 21 confirmed to be infected with the new virus. The Nebraska residents were among those then taken for quarantine at a California military facility. Eight of them flew back to Nebraska on Monday, the Nebraska Health and Human Services Department said. Four more will be arriving in the coming days. The passengers were medically screened before their flights to ensure they are not showing symptoms of COVID-19 or other illness. In another Nebraska coronavirus development, Douglas County reported Tuesday that another resident tested positive. He was described as a man in his 30s who was exposed in another state.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: All bars, nightclubs, restaurants and gyms will close in the city by 5 p.m. Friday in an effort to reduce the risk of exposure to the coronavirus outbreak, Mayor Hillary Schieve announced. Schieve initially included casinos on the closure list late Monday with plans to begin the shutdowns Tuesday morning. But she quickly rescinded that directive and further clarified restaurants can continue carry-out orders and keep drive-thru windows open. Officials for the neighboring city of Sparks and surrounding Washoe County said Tuesday they have no immediate plans to follow Reno’s lead. The mayor of Las Vegas – where several large casino resorts have closed on the Strip – said a mandatory closure of bars and restaurants there would be devastating. “My hope is that private industry rises to the top, that they’re allowed to stay open and take care of these families that are paycheck to paycheck,” Mayor Carolyn Goodman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Nevada has reported at least 45 cases of the virus so far.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State residents unable to work or those facing reduced hours because of the coronavirus pandemic will have access to immediate unemployment benefits, as well as temporary protection from losing their homes or having their utilities shut off. Gov. Chris Sununu issued several executive orders Tuesday, a day after he banned both large public gatherings and dine-in service restaurants. The latter decision was made in part to prevent St. Patrick’s Day revelers from flooding into the state from Massachusetts, which enacted similar restrictions over the weekend, Sununu said. “Unlike some larger states like Texas or Oklahoma, we have such common interstate travel over our borders,” said Sununu, a Republican. “All of those factors and data points are brought into consideration before we make any serious decision.” As of Tuesday, nearly 20 people in the state had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A third person in the state died from COVID-19 on Tuesday, Gov. Phil Murphy said, while casinos, gyms and theaters weathered their first night of an indefinite shutdown. Murphy, a Democrat, announced the state’s farthest-reaching virus mitigation measures to date: prohibiting groups of more than 50 people, along with the shutdown of some of the state’s entertainment and recreational sector and the curtailing of dining across the state. Many restaurants, bars and their patrons coped with mandated takeout and delivery-only service. All schools in the state will be shut down indefinitely by Wednesday in accordance with Murphy’s order, though many have already closed. “I’m reminded of Sheriff Brody in ‘Jaws,’ ” Murphy said Tuesday. “When he finally had a good look at the shark, he turned around and said, ‘We’re going to need a bigger boat.’ And what you’re hearing from us today is a bigger boat. We have seen the enemy, and we do not want to be dragged by the enemy.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Two more people in the state have tested positive for the coronavirus, health officials said Tuesday. A man in Taos County in his 50s and a man in Santa Fe County in his 40s both recently tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in New Mexico to 23, officials said. It’s the first positive test in Taos County. The state Department of Health has active investigations into each of the positive patients, which includes finding people with whom they were in contact and swabbing those with symptoms. The new cases come as the National Guard is helping deliver food to some school districts scrambling to feed children on the first day of a statewide school shutdown. Nine districts – from Santa Fe and Estancia to Bloomfield, Silver City and Texico – lacked supplies because students there were supposed to be on spring break this week. The Albuquerque Journal reports the National Guard delivered the food Sunday night and Monday morning.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city ground to a halt Tuesday, the first full day without restaurants except for takeout orders amid the coronavirus crisis. State officials scrambled to bring more hospital beds online as the number of confirmed cases in the state rose above 1,300. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that demand for hospital beds in the state could outstrip current capacity by tens of thousands when cases of the coronavirus reaches an expected peak in 45 days. Cuomo revealed the projections as confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus statewide shot up to more than 1,300. There were 264 hospitalizations and 12 deaths. Officials are also scrambling to increase the number of hospital beds in New York from 53,000, with 3,000 ICU beds. Cuomo said at the current rate of spread, the state would need 55,000 to 110,000 hospital beds and 18,600 to 37,200 ICU beds. “The numbers are daunting,” he said. Cuomo said the state also will need more ventilators to help patients breathe.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper is ordering all restaurants and bars be closed to dine-in patrons as movement restrictions keep getting ratcheted up to dampen the spread of the coronavirus. Cooper’s office announced he would issue a new executive order directing the closings effective at 5 p.m. Tuesday. The establishments can continue to offer takeout and delivery, according to a news release. Until now, bars and restaurants were exempted from Cooper’s prohibition of assemblies of more than 100 people, but state health officials had discouraged crowds at them and urged safe distancing. Cooper’s order was also set to expand unemployment benefits to help employees harmed financially by closings in commerce, his office said. By Tuesday morning, North Carolina state government had counted 40 residents who tested positive for COVID-19, with 15 of those living in Wake County and seven in Mecklenburg. No deaths have been reported in the state.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Cass County is planning to reduce the number of inmates in its jail to deal with a possible coronavirus outbreak. Jail administrator Andy Frobig says reducing the population will allow single bunks for every inmate. KFGO reports there will also be housing units designated for those that show signs of illness, which will further separate them from other inmates. About 270 inmates are currently in the jail. Frobig says the goal is to cut the number of inmates to 180 or less. Modifications may be made on a case-by-case basis for inmates with minor offenses that would allow their release, most under supervision by the sheriff’s office.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state marked St. Patrick’s Day on Tuesday with no parades and no primary election over fears of the coronavirus outbreak. Health Director Dr. Amy Acton issued an order late Monday shutting down polls Tuesday after a judge refused to stop the election. As of Monday, there were 50 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Ohio, including 14 hospitalizations. There have been no reported deaths in the state. Drive-up testing offered by hospitals was available Tuesday in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dayton, among other cities. Ohio State University and Capital University in Columbus, Youngstown State University, and the University of Findlay were among those announcing the cancellation of May commencement ceremonies, saying they couldn’t comply with restrictions severely limiting the size of gatherings. And with numerous businesses ordered temporarily closed, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services said it had received 48,640 unemployment insurance benefit applications online in just two days this week, compared to typical filings of a few hundred. Restaurants are among the hardest-hit businesses because of restrictions on dining in.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: Bars, some restaurants and other businesses in two of Oklahoma’s three largest cities are being closed by mayors in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. On Tuesday, Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum ordered the immediate shutdown of bars, while restaurants can serve only takeout orders starting at midnight. Bynum’s order comes a day after Norman Mayor Breea Clark ordered the shutdown of bars and banned dine-in services at restaurants starting at 8 p.m. Wednesday. Businesses such as theaters, gyms and amusement facilities must also close in both cities. The order in Norman is in effect until April 3, according to a news release, while Tulsa’s directive is in effect “until further notice,” said city spokeswoman Michelle Brooks.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Authorities in Multnomah County – home to Portland – announced Tuesday that they will be opening hundreds of new shelter beds in public buildings throughout the city to try to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the homeless community. The most vulnerable homeless residents have been given vouchers for hotel and motel rooms, and those businesses will not be allowed to kick them out or turn people away, said Deborah Kafoury, chair of the Multnomah County Board of Supervisors. Local government will also open spaces for homeless people with the coronavirus to recuperate indoors, she said. Volunteers have made contact with 1,700 people living on the streets or in their cars in the past week throughout the county to provide information about the coronavirus and to offer services, Kafoury said. The city and county are also jointly suspending evictions for those who can’t pay rent due to COVID-19 for as long as the crisis lasts, said Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. Renters will have six months to repay their back rent after the city and county lift the state of emergency.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s Department of Health is working on a plan to open public testing sites for the coronavirus, as Pennsylvania’s health systems and hospitals increasingly operate their own sample-taking sites or testing laboratories. A department spokesman, Nate Wardle, said the agency is in the process of organizing public testing sites and will announce them when there are locations, times and dates. Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is able to test, and Geisinger Health System is testing for its own in-house patients, the department said. Meanwhile, some hospitals are operating specimen-collecting sites, including the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Main Line Health in the Philadelphia area and Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh. Dr. Ronald Walsh, clinical laboratory director at Health Network Laboratories/Lehigh Valley Health Network, said Tuesday that his lab will go live with testing in the next couple of days. In addition to the Department of Health, four private lab companies are testing specimens, the department said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Two charitable organizations teamed up Tuesday to help support nonprofits serving vulnerable populations affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Rhode Island Foundation and United Way of Rhode Island jointly established the COVID-19 Response Fund, quickly raising $1.5 million from individual and corporate donors. The Foundation and United Way will form a joint grant-making committee to make funding decisions. United Way says the state’s nonprofits need grocery gift cards and meals for low-income families; internet access, smart devices, laptops and technical support to enable remote work; cleaning supplies, gloves and masks for direct service employees; and utility relief and rental assistance. “We are in the midst of an unpredictable, rapidly changing public health emergency – one that is having immediate impact on the community we care so deeply about, and that will likely have lasting, consequential effects,” said Neil Steinberg, president and CEO of the Foundation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State senators on Tuesday approved $45 million in emergency funding to fight the new coronavirus and will debate whether to go ahead and pass a plan to keep government operating if they can’t meet enough to approve a budget. The Senate Finance Committee met in a nearly empty room Tuesday, and the Senate met in a nearly empty Statehouse later. After getting an update on the virus and agreeing to send the emergency request to the full Senate, the committee then debated what kind of message it would send if they voted in mid-March for a proposal typically passed in June when budget negotiations appear to be running long. On one side are senators who said they don’t expect a disaster that would prevent them from meeting for months but think it is better to be prudent just in case. “Talk about chaos in this state,” Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman of Florence said if the worst-case scenario happened and state government had no way to spend money after July 1. On the other side were senators who said it would send the wrong message to take such a drastic step when they are trying to maintain confidence with the public.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday ordered schools to stay closed again next week while the state waits for health care providers to make more testing available. Officials announced earlier in the day that one more person has tested positive for COVID-19 in South Dakota, bringing the state’s total to 11. Authorities confirmed Monday that one death last week was caused by COVID-19. The new case is in Minnehaha County, which contains Sioux Falls, the state’s largest city. Five of the people who tested positive for the coronavirus live in the county. The latest case is a woman in her 50s. All the positive cases have come from people who traveled outside the state, and there is currently no evidence of it spreading in communities, officials said. Noem on Monday met with leaders from two of the state’s largest health care providers, Sanford and Avera. The companies announced they would be coordinating to make more tests available and expanding testing to commercial labs.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State lawmakers acknowledged they were shirking federal health recommendations on the coronavirus by sitting in close quarters as they conducted business Tuesday. They also drew questions about whether they were staying focused on only the most necessary legislation, as promised, during their sprint toward a recess by the end of the week. “Wash your hands regularly. Do the best you can to social distance. I know we are currently, we’re not necessarily right now, well, we’re not following the recommendations,” Republican Sen. Bo Watson told members of his Finance Committee. The Republican leadership has said it’s focusing on “mission critical” legislation, including constitutionally required budget duties, so lawmakers can disperse amid global closures to stem the virus’s spread and come back as soon as June 1 to finish approving other legislative issues.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The city on Tuesday joined other major counterparts across the state in closing bars and restaurant dining rooms to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which has now resulted in the state’s first death. Dr. Mark Escott, director of Austin-Travis County Health Authority, also announced that pubic gatherings in the Texas capital are now limited to 10 people, following recommendations released a day earlier by the Trump administration. That’s more restrictive than similar measures taken in Dallas, which on Monday ordered that public gatherings should not exceed 50 people. Houston has also enacted restrictions on bars, clubs and restaurants in hopes of keeping people home.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s two largest hospital systems have delayed elective surgeries and other non-urgent medical procedures to save space and equipment for future patients with the new coronavirus. Intermountain Healthcare and University of Utah Health expect an influx of coronavirus patients in the coming weeks. Though most of the 41 people diagnosed have recovered at home so far, the path of the virus in other places like Italy indicates Utah will experience a surge soon, authorities said Monday. Patients who had planned surgeries or other procedures are expected to hear from their health care providers about changes. Delays are expected to be for at least a few weeks, KSL reports. The move will keep hospital beds free and preserve protective equipment that’s in short supply around the country, hospital officials said. It will also allow doctors, nurses and patients to practice social distancing. People with urgent needs and time-sensitive conditions like cancer will continue to get treatments, the Salt Lake Tribune reports.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: The first Vermont patient with a confirmed case of COVID-19 has improved to stable at the hospital where he is being treated, officials said. In a statement issued by the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center, Chief Nursing Officer Pamela Duchene called the patient’s condition an improvement. The Bennington hospital is now treating three cases of COVID-19. The hospital is also offering drive-up testing for the disease caused by the coronavirus. The hospital has been conducting about 20 tests a day, Duchene said. The Burlington-based University of Vermont Medical Center has also set up a pop-up testing site at the Champlain Valley Exposition in Essex Junction. All pre-K-12 schools in Vermont were to shutter by Tuesday. Also, bars and restaurants across the state were told to close by 2 p.m. Tuesday, although takeout and delivery are still available.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Restaurants, gyms and theaters will not serve more than 10 customers at a time under an order the governor issued Tuesday in response to the coronavirus. Gov. Ralph Northam also urged Virginians to comply with new federal guidelines not to gather in groups of more than 10 and for people older than 65 to self-quarantine. Several other states and cities have ordered restaurants and bars to close, which Northam said he did not favor. Speaking at a Capitol news conference, he said Virginians get about half their meals from restaurants, and an outright ban would be harmful. He also said he hoped Virginians would voluntarily comply with the new measures. “I’m much more about carrots than I am about sticks,” Northam said. “Hopefully we get to the point where we don’t have to do a lot of enforcement.” The governor’s office said the 10-customer cap was indefinite but would be reevaluated in two weeks.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The death toll from the coronavirus in the state reached 50 on Tuesday morning when Clark County health officials announced their first fatal cases, a husband and wife in their 80s. The couple were hospitalized at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center last week and died Monday night, according to Clark County health officials. One had been living in a small adult family home, and the other was a resident of an assisted living community. “This is a horrible tragedy,” said Dr. Alan Melnick, Clark County health officer and Public Health director. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this time.” Washington has the highest number of deaths in the U.S., with most being associated with a nursing home in Kirkland. By Monday, the number of positive cases topped 900. Gov. Jay Inslee imposed strict new rules this week to help slow the spread of COVID-19. He mandated an immediate two-week closure of all restaurants, bars recreational facilities. He also increased the limits on large gatherings.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Monday declared a state of emergency in response to the new coronavirus, even as West Virginia remains the last state in the U.S. without a confirmed case. The Republican governor said he issued the declaration so certain rules on personnel and purchasing could be waived. He said he wants to be on the “safe side.” “In the state of West Virginia, I do not want us to be asleep at the switch because just happened to not have a positive test,” Justice said. State health officials said 84 people have been tested, with 80 negatives and 4 tests pending as of Monday afternoon, but Justice has repeatedly said the virus is likely here and going undetected because of a national lack of testing. Justice and U.S. Sen Joe Manchin, a Democrat, noted the virus could be especially damaging in West Virginia because of the state’s high elderly population and high percentage of people with existing health problems. “I’m afraid it could be lethal because of our fragile population,” Manchin said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers ordered a statewide ban on all gatherings of more than 10 people as of 5 p.m. Tuesday and closed all bars and restaurants except for delivery and pickup orders – more unprecedented disruptions to daily life imposed in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Evers also extended the closure of all public and private K-12 schools indefinitely and called on the Legislature to waive a one-week waiting period to receive unemployment compensation insurance. Evers said he would be talking with legislative leaders Wednesday about an aid package and when they could take it up. He also reiterated that he has no intention of delaying the state’s April 7 presidential primary and general election. Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald also said a delay wasn’t being discussed.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Testing has revealed the new coronavirus in seven more people in the state, all of them tied to an assisted living center resident who tested positive previously. The number of Wyoming residents known to be infected rose to 10 with the new cases announced Monday night. Health officials confirmed the virus in an older man at the Showboat Retirement Center in Lander late last week. Wyoming Department of Health officials declined to say whether those newly identified with the virus also were patients at the assisted-living facility or discuss their conditions, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. People in recent contact with them would be monitored for fever, coughing and other symptoms of the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus and tested if needed, the department said in a news release.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/04/coronavirus-live-updates-washington-outbreak-amazon-schools-vaccine-facebook/4940378002/", "title": "Coronavirus update: First California death, face mask shortage", "text": "As the U.S. death toll hit 11 Wednesday, both California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti declared states of emergency and announced six additional cases of the deadly coronavirus that has health officials around the world scrambling for answers.\n\nMore than 150 cases have been confirmed across the nation. Los Angeles had confirmed just one before Wednesday's announcement.\n\nA death reported Wednesday by California's Placer County, near Sacramento, represents the first fatality outside of Washington state.\n\nCounty officials referred to the victim as \"an elderly adult with underlying health conditions.'' They said the patient was in isolation at a local hospital and was probably exposed to the virus on a trip aboard a Princess Cruises ship that traveled from San Francisco to Mexico in February.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a group of coronavirus patients in Northern California who were passengers on that ship.\n\n“The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus,” Newsom said. “This emergency proclamation will help the state further prepare our communities and our health care system in the event it spreads more broadly.”\n\nFlorida and Washington state have already declared emergencies.\n\nGarcetti said the emergency declarations would help state and federal funding be available to \"keep our communities safe.\" Health officials said one of the new patients was hospitalized, the others were under home quarantine.\n\nLater in the day, the Department of Homeland Security said a medical screener at Los Angeles International Airport has contracted the virus. The agency said no travelers screened at LAX have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nCounty Supervisor Hilda Solis said the outbreak of the virus, which began in China, has fueled bias against the local Asian community.\n\n\"There's been too much misinformation spreading around and, as we expected, it's cultivating fears and leading to racial profiling,\" Solis said. \"The last thing we want to do is create more fear.\"\n\nDaily coronavirus updates: Get them in your email. Sign up here\n\nHere's the latest COVID-19 developments:\n\nWashington state keeps schools open, encourages telecommuting\n\nOfficials in the area of Washington state experiencing an outbreak of the virus are recommending that people work from home but they're not closing schools.\n\nIn Seattle, King County Executive Dow Constantine encouraged workers to telecommute when possible for the next three weeks, saying the county will reassess the risk at the end of every week. County officials also recommended businesses stagger the arrival and departure of employees to minimize contact with each other.\n\nThe county has decided not to close schools “unless there’s been a confirmed case within that school,” said Patty Hayes, the director for public health in Seattle and King County.\n\nThe Seattle metropolitan area has been at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., with 31 cases and nine of the country's 11 deaths. Most of the victims have been patients of a nursing home in suburban Kirkland.\n\nThe county is recommending, but not requiring, that people in higher-risk groups stay home and away from large groups if possible. Higher-risk people include those 60 and older, people with underlying health conditions, people who have weakened immune systems and pregnant women.\n\nIn explaining the county's measures, health officer Jeffrey Duchin recognized the need to “keep our society functioning, our businesses functioning and schools functioning.” He emphasized that they’re not asking for anyone to completely put their lives on hold, but to remain cautious and conscious.\n\n—Lindsay Schnell\n\nAnother cruise ship may be carrying patients\n\nA cruise ship heading from Hawaii to San Francisco is carrying aboard 62 passengers who may have been exposed to a “small cluster’’ of patients from a previous voyage who have contracted the coronavirus.\n\nPrincess Cruises said in a news release it has been in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is investigating a handful of cases in Northern California of passengers who traveled on the company’s Grand Princes roundtrip from San Francisco to Mexico from Feb. 11-21.\n\nOne of those patients, described in the release as a 71-year-old male, died Wednesday at a hospital in Placer County, northeast of Sacramento. He’s the first person to die of coronavirus in California and the 11th in the U.S.\n\nThe Grand Princess’ chief medical officer said the ship was at sea off the coast of Mexico and will skip a scheduled stop in Ensenada and return directly to San Francisco, where CDC and cruise officials will meet to determine the next course of action. The ship is expected to dock in San Francisco on Thursday.\n\nPrincess Cruises said the 62 passengers, who remained on board after the previous cruise and headed for Hawaii, along with some crew members have been told to remain it their cabins until getting screened by the ship’s medical personnel.\n\nIt’s not clear how many of the passengers on the cruise will have to be isolated, but last month another Princess Cruises ship was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, and more than 700 passengers and crew members came down with the virus.\n\n“The CDC is continuing to actively collect information and is collaborating with us to determine what, if any, actions need to be taken during the current Hawaii cruise and upon the ship’s return to San Francisco,’’ the company’s statement said. “We have shared essential travel and health data with the CDC to facilitate their standard notification to the State and County health authorities in order to follow up with individuals who may have been exposed to the people who became ill.’’\n\nFacebook employee in Seattle tests positive for coronavirus\n\nA Facebook employee based in Seattle has tested positive for the coronavirus, the social network confirmed to USA TODAY on Wednesday night.\n\n“A contractor based in our Stadium East office has been diagnosed with the COVID-19,\" Tracy Clayton, a Facebook company spokesperson, said in a statement. \"We’ve notified our employees and are following the advice of public health officials to prioritize everyone’s health and safety.\"\n\nThe Seattle Facebook offices are closed immediately until March 9, which is the end of the incubation period. However, because of King County's updated guidance released Wednesday, Facebook is encouraging all Seattle-based employed work from home until March 31.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after Amazon said an employee who works at the company's Brazil building near downtown Seattle was diagnosed with the virus.\n\n—Kelly Tyko\n\nAIPAC advises conference-goers of possible coronavirus exposure\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee issued an advisory to its conference attendees, some of whom include lawmakers, that a group of conference-goers may have had contact with a coronavirus patient before traveling to Washington, D.C., for the March 1-3 event.\n\nThe pro-Israel lobbying group said in a statement to attendees, speakers, administration and Capitol Hill offices that the D.C. Health Department deems the potential exposure as \"low-risk.\"\n\nThe individual with coronavirus did not attend the conference, but may have been in proximity to the group of individuals from New York who attended, AIPAC said, noting that the Health Department said there is no reason to \"sound the alarm\" at this point.\n\n\"To our knowledge, no one who attended the conference has tested positive for coronavirus at this time,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe group that may have had the initial exposure is in a self-quarantine, according to the statement.\n\nAttendees and speakers at the conference include Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., former 2020 Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg, former candidate Sen.

The number is more than triple the $2.5 billion President Donald Trump originally asked for last month. The package includes more than $3 billion for research and the development of vaccines and $2.2 billion to help in prevention, preparedness and response to the threat of the virus.\n\n—Christal Hayes\n\nUnited reduces flights, freezes hiring\n\nUnited Airlines, faced with a steep drop in travel demand due to the coronavirus crisis, is aggressively cutting April and May flights, freezing hiring and offering employees voluntary unpaid leave.\n\nThe airline announced the unprecedented steps, the first by a U.S. airline since the outbreak began, in a memo to employees Wednesday.\n\nThe airline did not provide specific routes being targeted but said it is reducing its international schedule by 20%, including previously announced cuts to China and Hong Kong, and 10% in the United States.\n\n—Dawn Gilbertson\n\nUNESCO: 290M students out of school\n\nIn its first global tally, UNESCO said the education of 290.5 million students is being disrupted by school closures prompted by the coronavirus. The organization is trying to help countries set up remote teaching options.\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said 22 countries in three continents have announced or put into effect school closures, 13 of them on a nationwide basis. Two weeks ago, China was the only country to require those measures.\n\n\"While temporary school closures as a result of health and other crises are not new unfortunately, the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled and, if prolonged, could threaten the right to education,” Director-General Audrey Azoulay said.\n\nWife, kids, neighbor of New York patient infected\n\nThe wife, two children and a neighbor of a suburban New York man hospitalized in critical condition with the coronavirus have all tested positive for the disease, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. The neighbor drove the New Rochelle man, 50, to the hospital, Cuomo said. One of the children, a 20-year-old son, attends Yeshiva University, which canceled classes on its Manhattan campus Wednesday.\n\nThe state now has six confirmed cases, including a New York City health care worker who recently returned from Iran. Cuomo also said hundreds of state university students studying abroad in China, Italy, Japan, Iran or South Korea will be brought home and quarantined for 14 days \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\nWHO: Face mask, gloves shortages risk lives\n\nA severe and mounting disruption to the global supply of masks, respirators, gloves and other personal protective equipment is putting lives at risk from the new coronavirus and other infectious diseases, the World Health Organization said. The agency blamed the shortage on rising demand because of panic buying, hoarding and misuse, and it called for a 40% increase in production. Physicians, nurses and other front-line workers are \"dangerously ill-equipped\" to care for COVID-19 patients, WHO said.\n\n“Without secure supply chains, the risk to health care workers around the world is real,\" Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. \"Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding.\"\n\nNew Jersey has its first case\n\nThe first case of coronavirus in New Jersey was confirmed on social media by Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday night.\n\nMurphy tweeted that he and Acting Governor Sheila Oliver were announcing the first presumptive positive case in Bergen County.\n\nA man in his thirties has been hospitalized since Tuesday. Murphy also noted that officials are taking the situation “very seriously and have been preparing for this for weeks” while urging residents to remain calm.\n\nDonald Trump jokes: 'I haven't touched my face in weeks'\n\nPresident Donald Trump unexpectedly dropped in on a White House meeting of airline executives and health officials trying to reassure the traveling public that flying remains safe. Trump, a self-acknowledged germophobe, also brought a little levity to the discussion.\n\nWhen reporters pressed him on what precautions people should take before getting on a flight, health officials in the Roosevelt Room urged the flying public to wash their hands and not touch their face.\n\n\"I haven’t touched my face in weeks!\" Trump said to laughter. \"I miss it.\"\n\n– John Fritze\n\nItalian sports without fans\n\nThe Italian government said all sporting events will be closed to the public until April 3 as the country deals with a coronavirus outbreak that has sickened more than 3,000, the third largest number in the world.\n\nThe Italian pro soccer league will likely resume in full this weekend after taking a week off, but fans won't be allowed to attend the games.\n\nSXSW gets support from health official\n\nThere is no evidence that canceling the South by Southwest Conference and Festivals or any major event will make the community safer, public health officials in Austin, Texas, said. Mark Escott, interim director of the city Health Authority, said SXSW organizers have been “extremely responsive to mitigation strategies,” such as promoting hygiene tips and making hand sanitizer readily available. Facebook is among several big companies that have already pulled out.\n\n“Today the threat of community spread remains low, but we are prepared for it to happen here,” Escott said.\n\n– Kelsey Bradshaw, Austin Statesman-American\n\nBond film ‘No Time to Die’ delayed by virus\n\nThe release date for Daniel Craig's final James Bond film \"No Time to Die\" has been postponed until November amid the global coronavirus outbreak. The film's producers announced Wednesday that \"after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace\" the release would be postponed from its original April release date.

Tedros said the virus is more lethal than the flu, which kills tens of thousands of Americans each year but does not spread as easily.\n\nThe death rate for the seasonal flu in the U.S. is far less than 1%. Previous global mortality rate estimates for the coronavirus had been around 2%, and the 3.43% estimate is not firm because it remains unclear how many people actually have been infected.\n\n\"COVID-19 is a new virus to which no one has immunity,\" Tedros said. \"That means more people are susceptible to infection, and some will suffer severe disease.\"\n\nEngland total almost doubles, to 80\n\nEngland's confirmed case total jumped by 32 on Wednesday, to a total of 80. All but four of the new patients had recently traveled to countries with relatively large outbreaks or were part of \"recognized clusters\" that were being investigated, the government said. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have had a total of five cases.\n\nUpside: More than 16,500 tests across the U.K. have come back negative, according to the Department of Health and Social Care.\n\nItaly closes schools, Iran cancels prayers, Saudis halt pilgrims\n\n• Italy's schools will close Thursday and remain shuttered until March 15. \"It is a decision of impact, I hope the pupils will return to school as soon as possible,\" Education Minister Lucia Azzolina said.\n\nItalian officials have put in place several enhanced measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Starting Tuesday, passengers on U.S.-bound flights who had a temperature above 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit were not allowed to board.\n\n• Iran, where at least 92 have died and almost 3,000 cases have been confirmed, canceled Friday prayers that devout Muslims normally perform in a communal setting.\n\n• Israeli health authorities ordered everyone from a central Israel high school and dozens of soccer fans into home quarantine after their possible exposure to a teen boy who tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\n• Saudi Arabia banned its citizens from pilgrimages to Mecca, among Islam's holiest cities. The country had banned foreigners from such pilgrimages last week.\n\nHow many cases of coronavirus in the US, and where?\n\nThere were 158 confirmed cases across at least 15 states as of Wednesday night, according to a coronavirus dashboard run by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThat number is expected to rise, as the CDC has expanded its testing efforts and encouraged more testing at health centers across the country.\n\nCommon signs of infection include fever, cough and breathing difficulties. If the infection worsens, it can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.\n\nWhat's the worldwide coronavirus death toll?\n\nThe global death toll was at least 3,285 late Wednesday, with more than 2,900 in mainland China, where the outbreak began in the bustling capital of the country's Hubei province, Wuhan.\n\nThe worldwide count of confirmed cases was at 95,413 on Wednesday night.\n\nFacebook gives free advertising to combat virus misinformation\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the social network is stepping up its efforts to combat virus-related misinformation by giving the WHO free advertising. Zuckerberg said in a post on his Facebook account that the company is working with national health ministries and global organizations like the WHO, the CDC and UNICEF to get out timely and accurate information on the virus. Zuckerberg said Facebook will also give “support and millions more in ad credits” to other unspecified organizations.\n\nContributing: Morgan Hines, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/01/02/delawareans-who-died-2024/77231146007/", "title": "Well-known Delawareans who died in 2024 from politics to sports", "text": "Delaware lost many well-known residents in 2024 who touched the lives of their family, friends and community.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal has compiled a list of some of the most prominent Delawareans who passed away, reflecting on their lives and legacies.\n\nMyrna L.

At the same time, flood recovery efforts continued in Australia and Pakistan, while catastrophic rainfall hit the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nTake a look back at the deadliest and most extreme weather events of 2022.\n\n1. Storms, southern Africa\n\nStorm Ana hit Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique in January (Image credit: Rijasolo/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn January, Storm Ana “wrought devastation across southern Africa”, said Climate Home News. More than 80 people were killed and thousands of people were “cut off” as roads and bridges were “washed away in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi”, said the BBC.\n\nAna “highlighted the need for investment in early warning systems and anticipatory action” in African nations, said Climate Home News.\n\n2. Cyclone, Africa\n\nCyclone Batsirai displaced more than 60,000 people (Image credit: Rijasolo/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWithin weeks of Storm Ana, Cyclone Batsirai then “barrelled towards” Madagascar, said Reuters. The tropical storm also hit Mauritius, bringing life “to a standstill, with public transport cancelled, shops and banks shut, and air and sea travel halted”, said Africa News.\n\nIn Madagascar, the death toll reached 120 and 124,000 people had their homes damaged or destroyed. The island had already been “struggling with food shortages in the south”, said Al Jazeera, “a consequence of a severe and prolonged drought”.\n\n3. Floods, Pakistan\n\nA third of Pakistan was under water in September (Image credit: Shahid Saeed Mirza/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt was estimated that more than 33 million people were impacted by the deadly floods that swept across Pakistan from June to September this year. “Logistically the country was hardly prepared”, said The Diplomat. When the government announced a “national emergency” in August, “it was already too late”.\n\nA UN report published in December warned that 240,000 people remain displaced as a result of the flooding, while an estimated eight million are still potentially exposed to the floodwaters.\n\nThousands of kilometres of road were washed away. By September, a third of the country was underwater, with water-borne diseases “now making the situation even worse”, the site continued. It remains “hard to predict if Pakistan will be able to rebuild its lost infrastructure in this decade”.\n\n4. Lightning strikes, India\n\nLightning strikes Kolkata in May (Image credit: Indranil Aditya/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIndia experienced “a big jump in extreme weather events” this year, said the World Economic Forum (WEF). Almost 50 people in Uttar Pradesh were killed by lightning strikes during the monsoon season. The state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, called for an early warning system for thunder and lightning storms as a result.\n\nA significant number of people die each year in India due to lightning, said The Independent, “A large number of people work outdoors” and there is “poor awareness and education about the dangers” of strikes. According to government figures, lightning increased by 111 times this year and 907 people were killed by strikes in 2022.\n\n5. Heatwave, UK\n\nTemperatures in England hit new highs in 2022 (Image credit: Carlos Jasso/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“For three months, heat was a regular curse, not an occasional blessing” in the UK, said the Financial Times. A record-breaking temperature of 40.3 degrees was recorded on 28 July, and a series of fires broke out across the country.\n\nA drought was officially declared in parts of England in August, with a hosepipe ban imposed in some areas as reservoir levels sunk. Analysis by the UK Health Security Agency published in October, found that 2,800 more people aged 65 and over died during the periods of high temperatures than would normally be expected.\n\n6. Wildfires, Europe\n\nThe Bordeaux region suffered devastating wildfires (Image credit: Thibaud Moritz/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBy mid-August this year, wildfires had burned an area equivalent to the size of Azerbaijan, according to Euronews. Portugal, Italy and Romania were among the countries affected by blazes, and “wildfire carbon emissions broke all records in France and Spain”, said The Guardian.\n\n“Fire weather” – a mix of heat, dry conditions and wind – “is not new to the Mediterranean”, said Euractiv. But rising global temperatures are “creating more intense, less controllable fires, and driving these conditions” further across the continent.\n\n7. Heatwave, US\n\nCalifornia hit a record 116F in September (Image credit: Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nCalifornia experienced its most extreme heat ever in September, “an epic grilling that disabled one of Twitter’s main data centers, pushed the power grid to its limit and triggered a succession of weather and safety alerts”, said the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTemperatures “sizzled” across the state as mercury readings soared above 100F, said CNN. “Such extreme heat events are being pushed into unprecedented territory”, scientists warned.\n\n8. Typhoon, Japan\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol hit southern Japan in September (Image credit: Yuichi Yamazaki/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol was “one of the most powerful” storms that Japan had ever seen, said The Japan Times. Local authorities ordered the four million people living on Kyushu island to evacuate their homes in September.\n\nDespite “dumping heavy rain, paralysing traffic and leaving tens of thousands of homes without power”, said The Guardian, the Japan Meteorological Agency said that damage “appeared relatively limited”.\n\n9. Hurricane, US\n\nHurricane Ian caused havoc across Florida and the Carolinas (Image credit: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)\n\n“One of the strongest storms ever to hit the US mainland”, according to Reuters, made landfall on 28 September.\n\n“After pummeling Cuba”, said The Washington Post, Hurricane Ian “came ashore on the western coast of Florida with an unforgiving storm surge that gutted the first floors of buildings and winds that knocked out about a quarter of Florida’s power”. It then moved up the Atlantic coast, hitting North and South Carolina.\n\nMore than 100 people died in Florida as a result of the storm’s devastation, said The New York Times, more “than any hurricane in almost 90 years”.\n\n10. Typhoon, Philippines\n\nVillagers are rescued in Bulacan, Philippines (Image credit: Dante Diosina Jr/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nPhilippine residents are “accustomed to severe weather”, said CNN; the country experiences around 20 tropical storms a year. But locals living on the island of Polillo were “stunned by the intensity of Typhoon Noru” in September, with “ferocious winds that lifted waves and lashed properties on the shoreline”.\n\nNoru was initially expected to be a category one hurricane, but that was quickly escalated to a category five. It’s estimated that more than 100,000 people who rely on agriculture and fishing for their livelihoods were affected.\n\n11. Flooding, Australia\n\nSandbags are delivered in Forbes, NSW, in November (Image credit: Brendon Thorne/Getty Images)\n\nAustralia has been hit by a series of extreme floods this year “due to a multi-year La Nina weather phenomenon”, said Reuters, which increases the likelihood of higher average rainfall. Floods have “left thousands homeless and damaged agricultural industries”.\n\nCentral west New South Wales is right now braced for “its worst flooding in 70 years”, said The Guardian. Many people have been evacuated from their homes, as farmers “struggle to recover from repeated bouts of destruction to crops and livestock losses”.\n\n12. Snowstorm, US\n\nSeveral feet of snow fell on western New York in November (Image credit: John Normile/Getty Images)\n\nA “historic lake-effect snowstorm” that swept across western New York in November “buried” much of the region, “dropping over 80 inches of snow in four days”, said Fox Weather. At least four people were known to have died as a result of the intense snowfall.\n\nSchools and highways were shut as crews cleared away several feet of snow, and President Joe Biden ordered federal aid to help local authorities.\n\n13. Flooding, Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n‘Months’ of rain fell on the capital city of Kinshasa in December (Image credit: Augustin Wamenya/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nIn mid-December, “a ‘biblical’ downpour submerged swathes” of Kinshasa, central Africa’s “largest megacity”, said The Times. “Months of rain” caused landslides and floods in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital, with at least 120 people known to have died.\n\nPictures from the area showed “just the tops of buses visible on deluged roads” as people clung to passing debris. With a population of 17 million, Kinshasa’s “rapid development and poor planning regulation have made the city’s population vulnerable to extreme weather events”.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Devika Rao", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/23/governors-vaccinated-christmas-precautions-medical-worker-shortage-news-around-states/115208798/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Gov. Kay Ivey became one of the first governors on Monday to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, bidding to build public confidence in the vaccinations that will have to be widely administered to ease the pandemic. “We want to send a clear message to all Alabamians that we can have confidence in this vaccine and its effectiveness. I want to assure people it is a safe thing to do and if everybody will take the vaccine voluntarily we’ll have good strong immunity and it will stop COVID-19,” Ivey said at a news conference. She spoke after getting the first of the two-shot Pfizer vaccine at Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery. State Health Officer Scott Harris and State Chief Medical Officer Mary McIntyre also received the vaccine. The 76-year-old Republican governor, a lung cancer survivor, said she had no hesitation about taking the vaccine and urged others to take it as it becomes available. “Shoot, a sore arm for a few days is a lot better than three months on a ventilator,” Ivey said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A mask mandate in Juneau has been extended for at least six months. The ordinance passed by the City and Borough of Juneau Assembly upholds the requirement for masks to be worn in all indoor public settings and outdoors when within 6 feet of other people. Alaska is one of 12 states without a statewide mask mandate. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has said that although he acknowledged the efficacy of masks, which has been corroborated by studies from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization, the issue is best delegated to local governments. But many local officials in the state have said they do not have the power to implement mask mandates or that they would let businesses decide for themselves. In Juneau, where a mask mandate was imposed when the state was experiencing roughly 10% of the cases it has reported in December, some business owners said they have embraced the policy change.\n\nArizona\n\nWindow Rock: The Navajo Nation reported 158 new coronavirus cases on Monday and two more deaths from COVID-19. The latest figures from the Navajo Department of Health bring the total number of cases on the reservation that extends into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah to 21,177. The Navajo Nation has reported 748 deaths since the pandemic hit. Tribal officials are urging residents of the vast reservation to stay vigilant to help stop the spread of the coronavirus amid the holiday season when families usually gather to celebrate. “We saw a spike in new COVID-19 cases following Thanksgiving, so we want to avoid that happening again,” said Navajo President Jonathan Nez. He encouraged everyone to spend Christmas with only the people in their household. A stay-at-home order is in effect until Dec. 28, along with a weekend lockdown where business hours are limited. The tribe also requires masks to be worn in public.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas received more doses Monday of coronavirus vaccines as the number of virus-related deaths continued to mount in the state, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said.The state reported 58 deaths from COVID-19 on Monday, though about one-third of those were delayed reports, Hutchinson said. The state saw 1,457 new cases of the virus, and more than 1,000 people remained hospitalized. Also Monday, Arkansas began receiving shipments of the newly approved coronavirus vaccine from Moderna, with 5,900 doses and additional shipments planned for Tuesday and Wednesday, Hutchinson said. The state also received 18,575 doses of Pfizer’s vaccine. “While this news provides hope for many, it is a continued concern to see the loss of 58 additional Arkansans … We must steel our resolve to take every precaution to keep everyone safe,” Hutchinson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Much of California has exhausted its usual ability to staff intensive care beds, and the nation’s most populated state is desperately searching for 3,000 temporary medical workers to meet demand during a recent surge of coronavirus cases. State officials are reaching out to foreign partners in places like Australia and Taiwan amid a shortage of temporary medical workers in the U.S., particularly nurses trained in critical care. California hospitals typically turn to staffing agencies during flu season, when they rely on travel nurses to meet patient care needs. It is the only state in the nation with strict nurse-to-patient ratios requiring hospitals to provide one nurse for every two patients in intensive care and one nurse for every four patients in emergency rooms, for example. However, those ratio requirements are being waived at many hospitals as virus cases surge. But the pool of available travel nurses is drying up as demand for them jumped to 44% over the last month, with California, Texas, Florida, New York and Minnesota requesting the most extra staff, according to San Diego-based health care staffing firm Aya Healthcare. It is one of two companies contracted by California to fulfill hospitals’ staffing requests.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Lawmakers will pause their upcoming new legislative session soon after convening in January as they wait for COVID-19 cases to subside, Democratic leaders said Monday. Lawmakers will begin the new session Jan. 13 and address any urgent business and required actions, like swearing in new members, as quickly as possible before temporarily going into recess, Senate President Leroy Garcia, incoming House Speaker Alec Garnett and others leaders said in a joint announcement. The tentative plan is to reconvene Feb. 16 when leaders hope the peak of the coronavirus pandemic will have subsided and there will be less of a health risk for those at the state Capitol. However, they said that lawmakers would resume work earlier that if there is an emergency that requires immediate attention. Earlier this month, lawmakers wrapped up a short special session to approve assistance to restaurants and food pantries struggling to keep their doors open during the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The second approved vaccine to fight COVID-19 began arriving in Connecticut on Monday as a state advisory panel met to discuss who gets vaccinated next. Workers at Hartford Hospital began unloading 8,800 doses of the Moderna vaccine shortly after 10:30 a.m. to the applause of health care workers. Critical care nurse Mandy Delgado was the first at the hospital to get a Moderna shot, saying she was hopeful vaccinations will lead to fewer patients being admitted with the virus. “Working in critical care, I’ve been exhausted, overwhelmed, seeing patients come in needing more oxygen and able to talk and progressively getting worse, then actually dying, and families not being there,” she said. Gov. Ned Lamont said the state expects to receive 63,300 doses of the Moderna vaccine this week, as well as 24,375 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. That is in addition to the 31,200 doses of the Pfizer vaccine the state received last week, Lamont said. The doses arriving this week are targeted for front-line health care workers and those in nursing homes.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Those who plan to attend Mass on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day in one of the 74 Catholic parishes or mission churches in Delaware or Maryland’s Eastern Shore are urged to check their parish’s website or bulletin before heading out, as some are requiring advanced reservations in order to comply with state mandated attendance limitations because of the recent uptick in area COVID-19 cases. “We want to avoid having to turn people away at the door,” said the Most Reverend W. Francis Malooly, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington. “Parishes are following government guidelines to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy during Christmas and beyond. Limiting attendance, social distancing, wearing masks and other requirements will be in place to assure that we will all be around when our Christmas Masses are once again standing room only.” The dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Day Masses that Malooly instituted in March remains in place in the Diocese of Wilmington. Many parishes are livestreaming or posting prerecorded Masses on their YouTube, Facebook or web pages. Catholics are encouraged to check their parish website or bulletin to find out if and when their Christmas Mass will be available online. Christmas Eve Mass with Malooly will be livestreamed from the Cathedral of Saint Peter in Wilmington at 2 p.m. Wednesday. Viewers can watch it live or recorded at youtube.com/dioceseofwilm.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dr. Ankoor Shah, interim principal deputy director of DC Health, said the District is expecting to get 12,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4,700 more doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week, WUSA-TV reported. D.C. will also be getting more than 16,000 additional doses of vaccine through an agreement with Maryland and Virginia to help vaccinate DC health care workers who live in those states. Shah said the District was allocated vaccine doses from the federal government based on its population, not on the size of its health care workforce, which has put it below where it needs to be. “We are getting less than what we deserve, and that is a simple fact,” Shah said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:A former Florida Department of Health employee sued the state on Monday over a search warrant executed on her house after investigators said they identified a message sent from a computer at the address to health department employees. Rebekah Jones, who was fired in May for insubordination after repeatedly violating department policy about communicating with the media, helped create the state’s coronavirus dashboard. She contended that she was fired for not falsifying data. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement served the search warrant earlier this month. Jones posted a 31-second video of officers entering her home, and the department later released more than 20 minutes of bodycam video that showed she refused to respond to phone calls and knocks on her door. The message that led to the search warrant implored employees still at the Health Department “to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero.” Jones has had several run-ins with law enforcement over personal issues, but has gained international attention by disputing Florida’s COVID-19 statistics. She was paid almost $48,000 a year as a Department of Health employee, but since May has raised nearly $260,000 on a GoFundMe account after criticizing Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. No charges have been filed in the investigation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta:Georgia K-12 public schools have the option not to count year-end tests toward students’ final grades this year because of schooling hardships from the COVID-19 pandemic following a vote Monday by the state Board of Education. State law requires scores on the annual Georgia Milestones tests to account for 20% of the cumulative grades for most of the state’s public-school students, from the third grade up to their senior year of high school. But this year, the Milestones scores can be counted essentially zero after State School Superintendent Richard Woods won approval for his proposal to water down the tests so students and teachers can have some relief as they continue working through tremendous challenges due to the virus. School districts now have leeway to recalculate final course grades for the fall semester and count the tests as 0.01% if they want, a state Department of Education spokesperson confirmed. The same 0.01% weight can also apply for year-end tests in the upcoming spring semester.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii’s rural island of Kauai had only 61 known coronavirus cases from March through September. But after Oct. 15, when the state launched a pretravel testing program to reignite its decimated tourism economy, Kauai had at least 84 new cases in the ensuing seven weeks. The surge seeded community transmission and led to the island’s first – and so far only – COVID-19 death: Ron Clark, who worked for decades as a tour driver. Despite Hawaii’s cautious effort at reopening that allowed travelers who tested negative for COVID-19 before they flew to the state to sidestep quarantine rules, the Kauai spike illustrates the difficulty of preserving public health – even on an isolated island – when economic recovery relies on travel. Kauai officials have decided the cost of vacationing in paradise, for now, is too high. Clark got COVID-19 in November and died about 10 days later. The day after Clark’s death, Kauai officials said they would opt out of the state’s testing program and require visitors to again quarantine for two weeks whether they test negative for COVID-19 before arriving. Kauai officials say the single-test scheme did not do enough to protect the people who live there. With only nine ICU beds and 14 ventilators, the island’s health care system could quickly become overwhelmed by a large outbreak, said Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami. After the Kauai surge, the state Department of Health traced most of the island’s October and November cases to returning residents and tourists who brought the virus in despite the pre-flight testing program.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Life could be back to normal in about four months with coronavirus vaccinations now being administered, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican late last week said health care workers and long-term care facility residents should have their vaccinations by the end of January. He said the next wave of vaccinations to essential workers such as firefighters and police could be done by June. But he said it will be longer than that before everyone who wants a vaccination can get one. “With the vaccines coming, we are maybe 120 days away from, for the most part, life back to normal,” Little said, the Post Register reported. “And it will be longer than that before everyone gets vaccinated.” About 3,500 people have been vaccinated since the initial shots started last week. Little said he expects vaccinations to pick up in the coming weeks as federal authorities have now approved two different vaccinations. “It’s going to be my responsibility to help make the point, and have our public health officials make the case to people to choose to get that vaccine,” Little said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An Illinois woman who ordered flags for her grandmother’s garden got a surprise when the package arrived – someone’s apparent coronavirus test specimen. Andrea Ellis was wrapping Christmas gifts at her aunt’s house in East Moline, in northwestern Illinois, when she opened a padded envelope containing the flags she ordered weeks ago from the department store chain Kohl’s, according to The Quad City Times. “I pulled out the flags and I told my aunt, ‘Look how cute these are,’ ” she said. “I pulled out the packing slip and then noticed something deeper inside the envelope and pulled that out. It was a biohazard bag containing someone’s COVID-19 test specimen.” Ellis, who didn’t immediately reply to a phone message from the Associated Press, called the police, who referred the issue to the county health department, according to East Moline police Chief Jeff Ramsey. Janet Hill, the chief operating officer at the Rock Island County Health Department, told the AP that she picked up the biohazard bag over the weekend and that it appeared to contain a used nasal swab and identifying information of a person from Virginia. She said she was figuring out what to do next, including contacting health officials in Virginia and trying to determine if the specimen was still viable. Wisconsin-based Kohl’s issued a statement apologizing for “this very unusual and inexplicable experience” and saying the package was sent from an “outside direct ship vendor” and not directly from the retail chain. The company said it launched its own investigation, but it declined to give further details, including the name of the vendor.\n\nIndiana\n\nKokomo: Fiat Chrysler has pushed back the reopening of a shuttered Indiana factory until late 2021, blaming delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Company officials had announced in March a $400 million plan to convert a Kokomo transmission factory so that it could begin engine production within the first three months of 2021. That reopening has been delayed until 2021’s last quarter, in part because of the company’s eight-week shutdown earlier this year, Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman Jodi Tinson told the Kokomo Tribune. Older equipment has been removed from the factory and interior walls and offices torn down as part of the conversion project, Tinson said. Steel is being raised to add a 30,000-square-foot addition to provide more manufacturing space. Fiat Chrysler said it plans to make the factory into the U.S. production site for the Global Medium Engine Turbo 4 for Jeep Wranglers and Cherokees, which is now built in Italy. Officials said the project would retain about 1,000 jobs and add nearly 200, bringing the total Fiat Chrysler workforce at its Kokomo-area factories to more than 8,000.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowans are heading into the winter holidays with few restrictions on gathering or social activities despite significant numbers of recent COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations in the state. The state Health Department on Monday reported 600 new confirmed cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus but no new deaths from it, though fewer tests were conducted in the past few days and there was a delay in the reporting of deaths. The state reported 138 deaths on Sunday after listing none in the previous two days. Public health officials revised the state’s method of calculating deaths earlier this month and said the new system would likely delay the reporting of COVID-19 deaths by up to a week. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Iowa has risen slightly, from nearly 44 per day in the two weeks that ended Dec. 5 to nearly 46 per day during the two weeks that ended Dec. 19, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas will need far more doses of coronavirus vaccines than it’s set to receive in the coming days to start giving shots to all residents 75 or older, officials at a major health care system said as the state reported its worst seven-day spike in COVID-19 deaths of the pandemic. State officials expect Kansas’ 49,000 doses of a vaccine made by Moderna set to arrive this week to go to local health departments and community health care centers, so that they can vaccine health care workers, said Ashley Jones-Wisner, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The state’s first vaccine shipments last week, 23,750 doses made by Pfizer, went to hospitals for at-risk health care workers. The state’s vaccine distribution plan calls for vaccines first to go to health care workers, workers in nursing homes and nursing home residents, though Jones-Wisner said another shipment of Pfizer’s vaccines, expected to be 17,550 doses, will be used to start those shots. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses. “Somebody’s going to feel left out, because there’s not enough,” said Dr. Steve Stites, the chief medical officer for the University of Kansas Health System. “We just have to have a lot more of the vaccine.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Together with top state lawmakers, Gov. Andy Beshear and first lady Britainy Beshear received COVID-19 vaccinations Tuesday. The Democratic governor thanked the top two Republican legislative leaders, House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers, for joining him in “setting the right example for the people of Kentucky.” The head of the Kentucky National Guard, the lieutenant governor and state police commissioner will receive vaccines on Wednesday, Beshear said. “As more quantities become available, we will be providing them to more officeholders and or critical physicians,” he said. “Again, we’re doing this in a way that preserves 99.99% of these for front-line workers and for long-term care but builds confidence as we go.” About 7,000 Kentuckians, the vast majority of them health care workers in hospitals, have been vaccinated since Dec. 14.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Louisiana Supreme Court on Monday sent a legal feud between Gov. John Bel Edwards and House Republicans over coronavirus restrictions back to district court, saying the judge ruled too quickly that the state law the GOP used to try to nullify the restrictions was unconstitutional. The justices wrote in their opinion that Baton Rouge Judge William Morvant should have held a full hearing on other issues raised in the lawsuit over the Democratic governor’s statewide mask mandate, business restrictions and crowd size limits aimed at fighting the spread of COVID-19. “We find the district court acted prematurely in reaching the issue of constitutionality,” the justices wrote. The high court’s decision requires Morvant to hold another hearing in the case. The Edwards administration intends to continue enforcing its COVID-19 rules while the case is pending. The governor has since issued tougher restrictions than those that drew objections from House Republicans, as Louisiana sees a spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The bishop of Maine’s Roman Catholic diocese called on Catholics in the state to observe social distancing and other precautions this Christmas. Bishop Robert Deeley said 2020 is a year for “a different Christmas” because of the coronavirus pandemic. He said he plans to stay home and celebrate livestreamed Masses on Christmas morning at midnight and 10 a.m. this year. Deeley said it’s a good year to “put more lights up outside the house but bring less people into the house.” He also encouraged the use of facial coverings in any gatherings that involve people from different households. Deeley previously called on the state’s Catholics to use the coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available to them\n\nMaryland\n\nWilliamsport:The town has announced plans to line Byron Memorial Park with luminarias Saturday night to honor those who have died from COVID-19 and those who have contracted the disease, as well as others who have been impacted by the pandemic. Williamsport Main Street Manager Kathyrn Gratton said in a news release that living through 2020 has been challenging but strength has been found in those challenges. The luminarias that will placed throughout the park will be meant to shine a light on that strength, Gratton said. The event, made possible by a partnership between the town and the Williamsport Lions Club, will involve the lighting of the luminarias starting at dusk, according to the release. The luminarias will remain lit through the night and will coincide with ongoing holiday displays in the park. The event is also meant to honor the business community, all first responders who have been on the front line in the pandemic and the community as a whole, according to the release. Those coming to the park to view the lights are being asked to practice safe measures such as social distancing and use of masks. For those who wish to remain home, a Facebook Live video will be shown on the Town of Williamsport and Main Street Williamsport Facebook pages.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art has temporarily closed again in response to the latest statewide spike in COVID-19 cases. The closure that began Monday is precautionary, Alexandra Kennedy, executive director of the museum told The Daily Hampshire Gazette. Staff will continue to go into the museum on an as-needed basis and the museum’s bookshop will offer curbside service, she said. “We are hoping we can reopen to visitors early in the new year,” Kennedy wrote in an email. Museum officials said they will monitor state health data and reopen as soon it’s safe for staff, visitors and the community. Everyone who has purchased advanced tickets will be issued a refund. The museum closed in March at the start of the pandemic and reopened in August with strict protocols in place, including advanced registration for most visits and limited capacity.\n\nMichigan\n\nDeWitt Township:Hundreds of toys were distributed Tuesday in honor of a Lansing-area police officer who died of COVID-19. The toys were donated to DeWitt Township by the First Responders Children’s Foundation, the Lansing State Journal reported. Sgt. Bill Darnell died in November at a time when COVID-19 was having a major impact on the community of 15,000 people, north of Lansing. The DeWitt Township police department had to close for a week and get help from other police agencies because of the virus. “We want to get these (toys) to kids and families who need them, who want them,” said Police Chief Mike Gute. “We just want to do a good thing in honor and memory of Bill.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials are encouraging high school students who lost their jobs because of the pandemic to apply for unemployment assistance, hoping to get the help to more people who might not be aware of a recent state Court of Appeals ruling that made them eligible. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and other state officials held a virtual roundtable with several youth activists on Monday to get high school workers across the state who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic to apply for an estimated $14 million to $28 million in unemployment insurance funds provided by the federal CARES Act, for which they are now eligible. “Those first few months were extremely challenging for my family and if I had been allowed benefits at the time, it would have taken an immense amount of stress off of my shoulders,” said Rahma Farah, a 17-year-old high school student from south Minneapolis and one of the teens who helped with the effort.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state surpassed its previous record for the highest number of coronavirus deaths reported in a day Tuesday with 79. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said the state is on track to surpass 1,000 deaths in the month. Close to 4,500 people with the coronavirus have died in Mississippi since the start of the pandemic, according to the state Department of Health. “We’re all going to suffer,” Dobbs said during a virtual briefing Tuesday. “I think more and more people are seeing the impact on our families from personal experience.” The 79 deaths were reported as of Monday night. Fifty-six of the people died at different times within the last 10 days and were identified as coronavirus-related fatalities later using death certificates, according to the Department of Health. Dobbs, the state’s top health official, said he could not share the names of the dead because of privacy laws. But he took a moment at the start Tuesday’s briefing to honor some of those 79 who died. He listed individuals by age, sex and race: A Black woman in her late 30s, an 84-year-old white man and a 52-year-old Black man among them. “These are people, but for COVID, would be with us for next Christmas,” Dobbs said. “These are people who didn’t have to die.”\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: CVS Health said it plans to administer about 100,000 coronavirus vaccinations next week at Missouri long-term care facilities as the vaccination roll-out expands beyond health care workers, the company said Monday. The pharmacy chain will vaccinate residents and staff at more than 40,000 long-term care facilities across the U.S. The first of those vaccinations have begun, but Missouri facilities will see their first vaccinations starting Monday, CVS Health spokesman Charlie Rice-Minoso said. CVS and its competitor, Walgreens, are facilitating the inoculations at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Walgreens didn’t immediately reply to a Monday email seeking further information about that company’s plan in Missouri.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov.-elect Greg Gianforte signaled he won’t continue a statewide mask mandate in place since July, though he said he plans to wear a mask himself and get vaccinated against COVID-19. If Gianforte, a Republican, reverses outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock’s mask order, Montana will be just the second state after Mississippi to lift its mandate. Thirty-eight states now have statewide mandates. “I trust Montanans with their health and the health of their loved ones,” Gianforte said in a recent interview with KHN. “The state has a role in clearly communicating the risks of who is most vulnerable, what the potential consequences are, but then I do trust Montanans to make the right decisions for themselves and their family.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said masks help prevent transmission of COVID-19. At least one study has found that states with mask requirements have had slower COVID growth rates compared with those without mandates. “We’re going to encourage people to wear masks,” Gianforte said. “I’m personally going to lead by example, wearing a mask in the Capitol.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials said it’s important to remain vigilant about social distancing to limit the spread of the coronavirus, even though vaccines have started to be administered and the state’s virus numbers have improved recently. Douglas County Health Director Adi Pour said the arrival of vaccines this month offers hope, but it will be some time before enough people have been vaccinated to make a difference in the pandemic. “Until 60% to 70% of the community is vaccinated, you still need to wear the mask, you still need to have social distancing, you still need to take all of those precautions,” Pour said. Over the past several weeks, the virus numbers have been improving in Nebraska. The rate of people being infected with the virus went from the fifth-highest in the nation early this month to the 29th-highest rate on Monday. The state said the number of people hospitalized with the virus remained unchanged Monday at 582. That is significantly lower than the peak of 987 set on Nov. 20 although it is still more than 2.5 times higher than it was on Oct. 1.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada is open for visitors with precautions in place, tourism and coronavirus response leaders said Monday, despite a weekend where the state passed the 200,000 mark in known COVID-19 infections and totaled 73 new deaths. In Las Vegas, where New Year’s fireworks that typically draw 300,000 people to the resort-lined Strip have been canceled, casinos are “open within the limits of the capacity determined by the governor,” Nevada tourism promotions chief Brenda Scolari said in a media call with state COVID-19 response leaders. Gov. Steve Sisolak in November tightened occupancy limits for restaurants, bars, casino floors and gyms, and set capacity at 25% for many businesses in a bid to stop a surge of coronavirus cases that are driving up hospitalizations. “We are very much promoting that properties in Las Vegas are acting with safety of visitors in mind and have every measure in place that’s necessary to make New Year’s Eve safe and memorable,” Scolari said. But a handful of Las Vegas Strip resorts have announced midweek closures because of a lack of demand. The Mirage said that starting in January, it will only be open from noon on Thursdays through noon on Mondays. Although some casino-resorts have only announced weekday closures for hotel reservations, the Mirage plans weekday closures of all of its operations, including its casino floor, restaurants and volcano show out front that erupts four times a night.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: New Hampshire’s largest art museum has closed until at least mid-January because of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials at the Currier Museum of Art said they will reopen the museum when COVID-19 infection rates start to decrease, and noted that many museums across New England have taken similar steps. “Our region has recently experienced an alarming spike in cases and the Currier Museum is doing all it can to contain the spread of COVID-19 and avoid burdening local health resources,” officials said. In the meantime, the museum will expand its online programs, including the family-friendly “Noon Year’s Eve” event.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:The Murphy administration defended itself Monday and seemed to shift some blame to the federal government after missing a deadline to start vaccinating staff and residents of nursing homes this week against COVID-19. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy dismissed a top Republican's call for Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli to resign over the delay, saying \"the last thing we need is people who don't know what they're talking about from the cheap seats.\" Murphy did not say where the responsibility lies for the Department of Health's failure to submit the required paperwork to the federal government in time to begin vaccinating staff and residents in the locations hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, he urged patience and understanding as his administration rolls out a vaccine that was developed in record time and on a massive scale. \"This is not an easy, straight-line process,\" Murphy said. \"It is one of the most ambitious federal government initiatives ever undertaken, and folks have to understand that.\" The Department of Health missed by a day a federal deadline that would have allowed the pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens to begin vaccinating in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities Monday. In order to start vaccinating, the agency needed to submit information on more than 650 long-term care facilities throughout the state by Dec. 7. Now the vaccines should start being distributed Dec. 28.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Health officials said Tuesday they are hoping to boost the number of people getting tested for COVID-19 through a new program that will provide free, at-home test kits to anyone who requests one. Through a partnership with Vault Medical Services, the saliva tests can be ordered online. All that’s needed is an internet connection, an email address and photo identification. State officials acknowledged the lack of broadband access across New Mexico and said the new at-home option expands what they described as one of the most wide-reaching testing programs in the nation. The state Health Department has been operating in-person testing locations in every county since early in the pandemic, including in spots that have connectivity issues. The state is now averaging more than 14,000 tests a day and that’s expected to grow with the new program. In all, more than 1.8 million tests have been done since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city’s public school system will conduct special social, emotional and academic behavioral screenings next year for students in 27 neighborhood hard hit by the coronavirus, officials said. Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said the screenings, beginning in September, will allow educators to get a jump-start on treating mental health issues related to the virus or the disruption of schooling that might linger into adulthood. The city is hiring 150 additional social workers for the effort and will expand a partnership between schools and the city’s public hospital system. Carranza said he would like to bring such services to all city schools, but can’t afford it without outside funding. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, heads up the city’s mental health initiatives. She described the new screenings as an important extension of a child’s annual pediatric exam.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper signed an executive order Monday making it easier for businesses to sell alcohol without customers having to show up in person for their purchase. The order, in effect through the end of January, lets restaurants, hotels, clubs, bars and some distilleries holding certain permits from the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission to sell alcoholic products for delivery or curbside pickup. The move is intended to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. “This order will help people avoid settings that can contribute to increased viral spread while giving restaurants and bars a financial boost that they need right now,” Cooper said in a statement. “With cases and hospitalizations high around the country, let’s all do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19 while supporting local, small businesses safely.” The 10-member Council of State approved Cooper’s action. Members include the Democratic governor and several other statewide elected officials.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum signed an amended executive order that paved the way for bars and restaurants in North Dakota to return to regular hours of operation on Tuesday, as the active number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have declined in the state. The food service establishments had been closed to in-person service between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m. since Nov. 16. The order Burgum signed Monday allows them to return to normal hours, consistent with any local requirements. But to keep the virus in check, the bars and restaurants must follow other state and local rules, including limiting capacity to 50% and allowing no more than 150 people inside until Jan. 8. Social distancing, mask wearing and other precautions also remain in place. A state order requiring masks to be worn in indoor businesses, indoor public settings and outdoor public settings where physical distancing isn’t possible remains in effect until Jan. 18. Banquet, ballroom and event venues also remain limited to 25% percent of maximum occupancy until Jan. 8.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:From TV commercials to a new mailing of masks to seniors, spending on a state public awareness campaign to persuade residents to play it safe in dealing with the coronavirus now totals more than $24 million. The state aging and health departments in recent days began a $13.5 million program to mail masks and COVID-19 precaution information to more than 2 million Ohioans age 65 and older. Including a new spot last week featuring four of the front-line nurses tending to virus patients, the Ohio Department of Health had spent $8.3 million with federal aid to produce and air an ongoing series of TV commercials counseling COVID caution.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: CVS Health said it plans to begin administering vaccines to more than 27,000 patients at 176 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities across Oklahoma. Those workers are in the first phase of the state’s vaccine distribution plan. More than one-third of the COVID-19 deaths in Oklahoma, or about 685 people, have been residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities, according to the most recent data from the State Department of Health. Oklahoma health officials reported 2,596 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday and six additional deaths, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 263,434 and the statewide death toll to 2,218.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:As protesters and police clashed outside, lawmakers met in a special session Monday to pass measures to deal with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s the third time lawmakers have met for an emergency session in what has been an extraordinary year, marked by the pandemic, widespread protests and blistering wildfires. Lawmakers extended a statewide ban on evicting renters until the end of June, narrowly managing to stave off a major crisis for thousands of Oregon renters. Between 27,700 and 56,100 Oregon households risk getting evicted on Jan. 1, the day after the current moratorium ends, according to a legislative analysis that cited data from the National Council of State Housing Agencies. “Now more than ever, preventing evictions is an investment in the well-being of every Oregonian,” said Rep. Julie Fahey, D-Eugene, who carried the bill on the floor. Rep. Mark Meek, D-Clackamas County, said that although he supported extending the state’s moratorium on evictions, he didn’t support the bill, which he said doesn’t provide “meaningful relief to housing providers” through a fund set up to compensate landlords.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf on Tuesday delivered a mixed review of Congress’ newly passed pandemic relief package, as Philadelphia extended its coronavirus restrictions affecting indoor dining, in-person instruction at colleges and other activities. Wolf, a Democrat, said the $900 billion in federal aid package will provide vital support for people, small businesses and efforts to fight the virus. But, he said, it lacked direct aid to state and local governments trying to prop up crucial services, and more aid is needed for a hard-hit service industry – such as restaurants and bars – and in direct payments to individuals and families. The bill would establish a temporary $300-per-week supplemental jobless benefit and a $600 direct payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, plus money for schools, health care providers and renters facing eviction. In Philadelphia, city officials extended restrictions on indoor dining, indoor events, theaters, casinos, colleges and indoor organized sports for two more weeks, through Jan. 15. Museums, outdoor sports, gyms, in-person instruction in high schools and outdoor catered events can resume Jan. 4, with capacity limitations, unless state restrictions set to expire that day are extended by Wolf, city officials said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Providence Public Schools and its food vendor are making sure the city’s children don’t go hungry over the holidays amid the pandemic. The schools and Sodexo on Tuesday as part of the grab-and-go program are offering students 13 days’ worth of meals, enough to cover the holiday break, at its eight meal sites across the city. The grab-and-go meal sites will not be active during the break. The Home for the Holiday meal pack includes a turkey or pork roast, potatoes, mandarin oranges, macaroni and cheese, cereal, milk, juice and other items. Parents and guardians may pick up a student’s meal pack, provided they have the student’s school ID number.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s health board selected a retired military doctor to head the state’s health and environmental department, which has been overseeing South Carolina’s coronavirus response. The Department of Health and Environmental Control board unanimously voted Tuesday to hire Dr. Edward Simmer, who previously oversaw civilian medical and dental care for the Defense Health Agency in Virginia and served three decades in the Navy. The board-certified psychiatrist also holds a master’s degree in public health.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Monument Health, the largest hospital system in the western part of South Dakota, began administering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to hospital workers and staff at long-term care facilities in several locations. Meanwhile, the largest hospital systems in the eastern part of the state planned to distribute the vaccine in the coming days. The state’s distribution plan calls for medical workers in hospitals and long-term care facilities to receive the vaccine first, followed by residents of long-term care facilities. The Department of Health reported that 7,844 people have received the first dose of the vaccine manufactured by Pfizer and expects to receive enough doses of the Moderna vaccine for 14,600 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Democratic U.S. Rep. London Lamar said Tennessee is “setting a world example of how to kill people during a pandemic” by not requiring masks and other measures. Dr. Jason Martin of a physician’s group said Gov. Bill Lee has “betrayed your oath and abandoned the people you were elected to serve,” and has rebutted Lee’s contention that there’s argument and dissention about “what’s the right tactic” among health professionals. The president of the Tennessee Medical Association, Dr. Kevin Smith, said his group hasn’t heard from any of its 9,000-plus physician members who oppose mask requirements now. The association is calling for mask mandates in counties that top 10 new cases per 100,000 people a day – currently, the whole state, since the best county was eight times worse in the last week, Smith said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday joined the ranks of governors receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in hopes of assuring the public that the inoculations are safe. Abbott, a Republican, said after getting the vaccine at a hospital in the state capital that federal health officials have urged governors to set an example. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey also received the first dose this week, and other governors have said they will wait. A resurgence of the virus in Texas has put the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients back over 10,000 for only the second time during the pandemic. Nearly 11,000 people were hospitalized in July during a deadly summer outbreak. Abbott has said he won’t impose new lockdown measures as cases climb.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Thirty-seven of the 128 deaths of southwestern Utah residents attributed to COVID-19 have come since Dec. 1, making it the deadliest month since the pandemic began, according to new state figures released Monday. Two more deaths were added to the count Monday, including a Washington County man between the ages of 45 and 64 and another between the ages of 65 and 84. The numbers have accelerated in recent weeks. There were a total of 57 deaths by the end of October, and then 35 in November before the increase in December. In addition, another 40 people were hospitalized with the disease as of Monday, according to the Southwest Utah Public Health Department.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott said he is relaxing restrictions on gatherings over the holidays to allow two trusted households to gather as Vermont’s coronavirus case numbers have stabilized, although they are still higher than the administration would like to see. “It’s been a little over a month since we took significant steps to slow the rising spread of the virus. And it’s clearly working,” Scott said. The state has seen several days of fewer than 100 cases, which is still high but shows vast improvement, he said. Gathering with only one trusted household will be allowed from Wednesday to Jan. 2, with other stringent measures still in place, Scott said. Gathering with more than one trusted household on different days is not permitted, he said. And if one of the two households is from out of state, everyone must quarantine for seven days and get a negative test or quarantine for 14 days afterward, he said. Scott also announced that residents can participate in outdoor recreation with others outside of their households provided that they can physically distance and wear a mask. Starting Friday, school-based and youth recreational sports teams may begin practices with skills, strength and conditioning drills with no contact and physically distancing and mask-wearing at all times.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials announced a temporary policy change Tuesday that will provide about $200 million in payroll tax relief next year to Virginia businesses that laid off workers amid the pandemic. Under an executive order from Gov. Ralph Northam, the Virginia Employment Commission won’t be counting layoffs that took place in April, May or June against businesses when calculating unemployment insurance tax rates for 2021, Northam’s office announced. Without the change to what’s called the experience tax, about 10,000 more businesses than last year would have had to pay the full amount of about $600 per year per employee, according to Megan Healy, Northam’s chief workforce development advisor. She said the tax relief will be offset by about $210 million in federal stimulus money that lawmakers directed to the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund during the special session. Nicole Riley, Virginia state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, said Northam’s decision would relieve some of the financial pressure on employers and ultimately make it easier for them to put people back to work.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee has announced new travel restrictions for people arriving from the United Kingdom and South Africa where a new and seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus is circulating. Inslee said Monday he would issue a proclamation requiring passengers who arrive from the United Kingdom and South Africa to quarantine for 14 days, including passengers who have arrived from those countries in the past few days. It also encourages those people to get tested for the virus. “Today’s action is a commonsense public health measure and … is another attempt to keep Washingtonians safe,” Inslee said. The quarantine measures are precautionary and meant to stem a possible surge in cases that could overwhelm hospitals, he said. The quarantine is mandatory and although it’s legally enforceable, Inslee said no one will be taken into custody over it. Dozens of countries have restricted travel from Britain in recent days because of the new strain. Inslee said he wasn’t aware of other states issuing restrictions. British Airways canceled the only nonstop flight from London to Seattle on Monday, according to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport spokesperson Perry Cooper, but he said the reason behind it wasn’t immediately known.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a single-day record of 42 deaths linked to the coronavirus on Tuesday, with victims ranging in age from 48 to 100. The state reported 787 confirmed coronavirus cases, down from a high of 1,257 last week. There are 22,864 active cases in the state. West Virginia has received nearly 21,100 doses of a coronavirus vaccine so far, administering more than 15,900. Gov. Jim Justice said Monday a combined 44,300 doses of vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive this week. Officials expect to administer doses at all nursing homes and long-term care centers by the end of the month.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System paid out nearly $70 million in coronavirus-related refunds to students in the last year, according to a report released Tuesday. The Legislative Audit Bureau released findings that show the system paid out $68.5 million in housing and food service refunds to students after campuses closed in March as the pandemic was taking hold in Wisconsin. The report didn’t say how much the system might have saved by closing down dorms and food services. State Auditor Joe Chrisman didn’t respond to a message seeking further information. Auditors also found that the Board of Regents approved reductions in other student fees at four two-year schools and at UW-Milwaukee heading into the fall semester to reflect a lack of athletics and performing arts programming. Student fees support both areas. The fee reductions ranged from $36 per student at UW-Milwaukee’s Waukesha branch to $187 per student at UW-Milwaukee. The report went on to say that the system received $94.2 million in federal pandemic relief funds. Half of that money had to go for financial aid for students for pandemic-related expenses; the rest had to be used to cover changes in instruction delivery or student aid.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The 70 new confirmed COVID-19 cases recorded in Campbell County on Monday afternoon pushed its total to 3,646 since the pandemic began, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. Campbell County Memorial Hospital continues to feel the strain of its resources as its COVID-19 hospitalizations remain high, despite a noticeable decrease at other hospitals throughout the state, the Gillette News Record reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/23"}]}

Currently, a select group of users have been demoing Waymo's self-driving ride hailing service, but the company plans to open it to the public in the Arizona city laster this year.\n\nThere are as yet no details on how such a service would work and cost, but ride hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft have also been pushing hard in the self-driving car tech space because removing the driver from ride hailing would radically improve their bottom line.\n\n“Waymo's goal from day one has been to build the world’s most experienced (artificial) driver and give people access to self-driving technology that will make our roads safer,” Waymo CEO John Krafcik said in a statement.\n\nMore:Warning, drivers: Your car can cruise on its own, but you're still responsible\n\nMore:Tesla, Uber crashes spotlight automatic emergency braking. Here's what it won't do.\n\nSergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, added that strategic partnerships with technology-focused companies — a popular approach for big automakers of late — \"will help to drive innovative technology to the forefront.”\n\nSo far, FCA has provided Waymo with around 600 minivans, which are built to Waymo's specifications to accommodate the installation of the company's various autonomous car sensors — namely radar, cameras and LiDAR, or light detection and ranging lasers. Those sensors help self-driving cars see their environment and react accordingly.\n\nAutonomous car testing was thrust into the spotlight in March when an Uber self-driving Volvo SUV killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz. Uber immediately halted all of its autonomous testing, and then pulled out of Arizona altogether.\n\nThe ride hailing company says it will resume testing in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Toronto after federal investigations into the crash are completed.\n\nA preliminary report indicated that while Uber's sensors detected the pedestrian well before the actual collision, the car's computer wasn't sure how to categorize what it was seeing and delayed its reactions.\n\nRecent crashes of Tesla automobiles while on Autopilot — the electric automaker's name for its driver-assist features that require human oversight — have renewed discussion about how technology is changing the driver experience.\n\nWhile many driver assist features such as lane keeping and adaptive cruise control can ease fatigue and even save a driver in an emergency, some of the Tesla accidents suggest drivers often abdicate their responsibilities and get distracted by other tasks.\n\nA recent Tesla crash in Utah was the result of the driver not touching any controls for 80 seconds — she said she was looking at her phone — until the vehicle slammed into a stopped fire truck at 80 mph.\n\nAutomakers appear torn between touting new driver-assist features in futuristic ads while also warning drivers in manuals and with visual and audio prompts that they must stay focused on the road.\n\nSuch features, categorized as Level 2 systems, are different from autonomous systems being developed by Waymo and others, which are considered Level 4 and 5 systems and do not require driver input.\n\nSome companies will begin testing self-driving cars without safety drivers in some states, and have suggested future cars will not have steering wheels or pedals.\n\nWhile Waymo has built and tested a prototype two-person car that has no controls, its growing fleet of consumer-facing vehicles will be far more traditional. Besides the growing partnership with FCA for Pacifica minivans, Waymo has also inked an agreement with Jaguar Land Rover for 20,000 I-PACE vehicles.\n\nTo date, Waymo self-driving cars have logged 6 million miles on public roads and 5 billion miles in simulations.\n\nSo far, what accidents that have been reported by the company and authorities involving Waymo cars largely been the fault of human drivers hitting the Waymo car, typically from behind after they thought the Waymo car was going to proceed.\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech writer Marco della Cava on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/mark-phelan/2022/05/19/lincoln-navigator-activeglide-hands-free-driving-review/9798982002/", "title": "Lincoln Navigator ActiveGlide: Comparing it to Super Cruise, Autopilot", "text": "Hands-free highway driving takes a major step forward with Lincoln’s ActiveGlide hands-free highway driving assistant.\n\nI just used the feature to drive hands-free for about 900 miles of an 1,100-mile drive from New Orleans to Detroit.

The announcement came as the industry reeled from Thursday's news that a Tesla Model S owner was killed while the car's Autopilot feature was engaged.\n\nThe deal reflects a significant step forward for autonomous vehicles, marking the first time a major automaker has committed to a timeline for a car that doesn't require human interference. It's a bold step for engineers who face significant engineering hurdles in the race to deliver self-driving cars. A few models have semiautomated highway driving, such as Tesla Motors' Model S sedan and General Motors' upcoming Cadillac CT6.\n\nWithout addressing Tesla directly, BMW, Intel and Mobileye said in a statement that they \"are convinced that automated driving technologies will make travel safer and easier.\"\n\nTraffic deaths jump 8% in 2015 to most since 2008\n\nBMW said its goal is to reach a level where drivers can take their \"eyes off\" the road altogether.\n\nAmnon Shashua, Mobileye's chairman, co-founder and chief technology officer, said that by 2021, the partnership will deliver a vehicle that can operate without a driver in a \"geofenced\" area — that is, a virtual district or city that has been fully mapped or technologically outfitted to foster autonomous driving.\n\nBMW's engineering and manufacturing heritage, Mobileye's expertise in sensors, location and road imagery and Intel's algorithm expertise and processing power collectively fuel the partnership.\n\nThe first self-driving car will be dubbed the BMW iNEXT, but the companies said their goal is to create a technological platform that will be offered to other automakers for the advancement of self-driving vehicles.\n\n\"Our goal is already clearly defined: to be No. 1 in autonomous driving,\" BMW CEO Harald Krüger said Friday. \"This collaboration underscores our commitment to achieve that goal.\"\n\nTesla's 'Autopilot' feature probed after fatal crash\n\nThe partnership reflects the auto industry's increasing acceptance of outside technological partners to accelerate self-driving vehicles. It also reflects the technology industry's need for auto manufacturing and engineering expertise. For instance, Fiat Chrysler recently reached a deal with Google to manufacture 100 self-driving minivans.\n\n\"For this technology to work, it takes all those resources to bear,\" Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nMobileye's broadly recognized advancements in the field of self-driving car technology won a significant validation in the BMW deal.\n\n“This collaboration is about a commitment for serious production,\" Shashua said.\n\nIntel CEO Brian Krzanich said the company would spend several hundred million dollars on the project.\n\n\"Cars are rapidly becoming what we believe are the world’s most intelligent connected devices,\" he said.\n\nQuestions about the fallout from the Tesla accident cast a cloud over BMW's announcement, threatening to undermine public confidence in autonomous cars before the technology even gets going.\n\n\"This probably wasn’t a surprise that this happened, and it’s an opportunity to learn and focus on the challenges of the upcoming autonomous environment,\" AutoTrader.com analyst Krebs said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/07/06/tesla-motors-nhtsa-autopilot/86742616/", "title": "Tesla told regulators of crash 9 days later", "text": "Nathan Bomey\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nA deadly crash involving a Tesla Motors sedan that had its automated steering function engaged has thrust the Silicon Valley automaker's actions into the spotlight over whether it promptly disclosed the matter to federal regulators and investors.\n\nTesla Motors said Wednesday that it had notified U.S. auto-safety regulators about nine days after a deadly crash in which the driver was using the Model S vehicle's automated steering feature.\n\nThe company said it had informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on May 16 about the May 7 accident that killed Ohio resident Joshua Brown. The report was relayed two days before the company raised nearly $1.5 billion in capital from investors, without mentioning the episode in offering documents.\n\n\"Tesla then provided NHTSA with additional details about the accident over the following weeks as it worked to complete its investigation, which it ultimately concluded during the last week of May,\" Tesla said in a statement.\n\nThe statement comes amid questions about whether the Palo Alto, Calif.-based electric-vehicle automaker disclosed the incident to investors promptly. After Fortune magazine raised questions about the company's decision not to reveal the matter publicly until June 30, Tesla CEO Elon Musk retorted that the accident was \"not material\" to Tesla's finances.\n\nElon Musk: Driver's death 'wasn't material' to Tesla finances\n\nAs it happens, Tesla said in a May 10 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it could face significant financial liabilities in the event of \"any misuse or failures of new technologies that we are pioneering, including Autopilot in our vehicles.\" Autopilot is Tesla's name for the feature that allows its electric sedans and SUVs to drive themselves on highways.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who tracks automotive liability issues, said that Tesla's reporting to NHTSA appears \"fairly timely\" but that investors may object about their lack of knowledge about the matter.\n\nPublicly traded companies like Tesla (TSLA) have an obligation to inform investors of major issues that could affect their finances.\n\n\"I'm certain investors could feel that this is a problem and they really weren't notified,\" he said. \"It is raising questions about Autopilot and Tesla. It's uncharted waters, but it always seems like we're there with Tesla because they're on the cutting edge.\"\n\nNHTSA is probing whether Brown's death was connected to the Autopilot feature that was activated in his Model S when he crashed into a truck.\n\nMeanwhile, a second crash involving a Tesla vehicle is drawing scrutiny after reports surfaced that a Southfield, Mich., art gallery owner told police his 2016 Tesla Model X was in Autopilot mode when it crashed and rolled over on the Pennsylvania Turnpike last week.\n\nTesla said in a statement that it had collected \"no data to suggest that Autopilot was engaged at the time of the incident\" in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Anytime there is a significant accident, Tesla receives a crash detection alert. As is our practice with all collisions, we immediately reached out to the customer to make sure he was safe. Until the customer responds, we are unable to further investigate,\" the company said.\n\nNevertheless, NHTSA says it has asked Pennsylvania State Police for information on that crash as well, and is seeking to \"determine whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash.\"\n\nTesla has billed the Autopilot system as the first real-world application of a partially self-driving feature. But the accident could dampen public enthusiasm for self-driving cars and draw attention from regulators. It may also call into question Tesla's introduction of the system in beta-test form.\n\nWill concern over Tesla death close self-driving 'loophole'?\n\n\"It wasn't ready to go out on the road,\" Rosemary Shahan, president of the advocacy group Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, told USA TODAY this week. \"If you have a system called Autopilot that cannot distinguish between the side of a truck and the open sky, it's not ready.\"\n\nBut Tesla said the fact that drivers have traveled 130 million miles with Autopilot enabled \"lends credence to the safety of the system.\"\n\nThe intersection of self-driving vehicles with liability laws and disclosure requirements comes as NHTSA regulators are pushing for federal standards on self-driving cars to establish concrete boundaries for manufacturers and eliminate the prospect of a patchwork of state regulations.\n\nAs a matter of policy, NHTSA is trying to accelerate the development of self-driving cars, which U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx has said could eventually eliminate roadway deaths.\n\n\"You want the technology to continue to develop. You don’t want to cut it off,\" Tobias said.\n\nContributing: Chris Woodyard of USA TODAY and Greg Gardner of the Detroit Free Press.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/11/06/donald-trump-presidency-impact-detroit-three-automakers-uaw-car-buyers-ev/76088343007/", "title": "Experts: Trump presidency may help Detroit automakers, cost car ...", "text": "As if the U.S. auto industry's transition to electric vehicles hasn't been rocky enough, President-elect Donald Trump's victory over Democratic rival Kamala Harris adds uncertainty to the Detroit Three's push toward an all-electric future, industry watchers said.\n\nStill, some say the domestic automakers will see some wins from Trump taking over. For example, he is expected to ease some of the environmental regulations that have pressured the Detroit Three to make a fast push toward EV adoption.\n\nBut it's a mixed bag because Trump has also set his sights on scaling back or eliminating EV initiatives. Auto analysts said it would be difficult for him to completely gut President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act initiatives, but through executive orders, Trump could defund or limit some of the EV subsidies included there. Many parts of the IRA, such as expanding EV charger infrastructure, were in place to help the Detroit Three encourage EV adoption.\n\nAdd to that the impact of Trump's promise to impose bigger tariffs to imported goods. Sure, that keeps cheap Chinese vehicles off U.S. shores. But it also could affect parts and U.S.-brand cars built elsewhere, such as in Mexico, and could lead to higher new-vehicle prices — just when sky-high sticker prices were finally cooling off and keeping demand for new vehicles stable, experts said Wednesday.\n\nThen there is the union. While UAW members were divided in their support for Trump and Harris, President Shawn Fain endorsed Harris and vocalized his disdain for Trump. Trump is likely to be unfriendly in return, which some say plays to Fain's own combative style.\n\nAll in all, expert forecasters, such as Cox Automotive, predict U.S. auto sales will hold up and finish the year up 2% with 15.7 million new vehicle sales this year compared with 2023, regardless of the upcoming U.S. leadership change.\n\n\"Presidents come and go, but the auto industry motors on,\" Mark Schirmer, director of Industry Insights & Corporate Communications at Cox Automotive, said in a Wednesday morning newsletter.\n\nAutos 'one of the biggest beneficiaries' of the Trump win\n\nSome analysts say the Trump win is a boon for the Detroit auto industry. Higher tariffs — which are the taxes put on goods that cross national borders — would keep the Chinese from flooding the U.S. market with cheaper EVs than U.S. automakers offer.\n\nTrump has promised to scale back or eliminate many of the Environmental Protection Agency's emissions standards as well as incentives to promote production and adoption of EVs. Some experts said less regulation would ease carmakers' costs.\n\n\"I think autos are among the biggest beneficiaries — not sure why more people aren’t talking about it,\" Michael Ward, managing director of research for Freedom Capital Markets, told the Detroit Free Press of Trump's victory. \"Five things I looked at: Lower fuel is always good news for the autos, less inflation from the lower fuel prices leading to lower interest rates ... autos (are) among the most capital-intensive industries and lower rates benefit the consumer.\"\n\nWard said he also expects personal and business taxes to go down, giving consumers more purchasing power.\n\nBank of America Securities analyst John Murphy also said in a Wednesday investor note cited by CNBC that General Motors and Ford will be \"the main beneficiaries from the Trump administration.\" He cited the Biden-Harris \"environmental regime\" as pressuring the core business of the automakers to \"decarbonize by the end of the decade while shifting quickly to an EV portfolio.”\n\nThe impact of tariffs for buyers and carmakers\n\nMany of the industry experts also see some uncertainty under a Trump presidency.\n\n\"It’s very mixed in terms of the implications in this 313 area code,\" Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday.\n\nUnder Trump, Ives agreed there will be less pressure for GM, Ford and Stellantis — which makes Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat brands — to continue pursuing a speedy EV transition. But while tariffs will keep the Chinese out, tariffs also complicate the supply chain of auto parts imported to the states.\n\nPut another way: \"Tariffs will lead to more jobs for U.S. workers at component suppliers and higher costs for car buyers, who already suffer from sticker shock,\" said Erik Gordon, business professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. \"People will keep cars longer, and that will be good for the replacement parts and service industries.\"\n\nOthers doubt that Trump will put large tariffs on every imported vehicle. Morningstar Autos Analyst David Whiston told the Free Press that large tariffs on all imports would violate the USMCA agreement for Canadian and Mexican production. That would severely hurt American automakers, especially GM and Stellantis, who make some of their pickups in Mexico, he said. Ford also makes cars in Mexico.\n\n\"I don’t think Trump would do tariffs (that) will hurt the Detroit Three, at least not severely,\" Whiston said in an email Wednesday. \"Things like the steel tariffs that took low billion-dollar profit amounts from earnings years back are probably a bigger tariff threat than one on all vehicle exports to the U.S.\"\n\nHe said China tariffs for now won’t make a big impact because few Chinese-made vehicles are imported currently.\n\nJoe McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, told the Free Press that tariffs are not a long-term solution to building a domestic economy and manufacturing base, noting that tariffs become a tax on the consumer and ultimately prices go up. He pointed to an argument that the 60-year old “Chicken Tax” — a 25% tariff on imported light trucks imposed over European tariffs on American chicken — helped create Detroit automakers' truck dominance. But in doing so, it gave domestic-built trucks a monopoly, making them too expensive without competition.\n\n\"With that said, (the tariff strategy) is currently the only hammer in the U.S. toolbox until we find a more balanced solution,\" McCabe said. \"The goal is to buy time for our domestic market to improve efficiencies and competitive priced products.\"\n\nTrump impact on EV adoption\n\nOne of the first things Trump will likely do is revoke the $7,500 EV tax credit offered to buyers of EVs, Wedbush's Ives said. That would not only be \"a gut punch to the EV initiatives\" of the Detroit Three, but it would give EV-sales leader Tesla an advantage. Tesla, led by Trump ally Elon Musk, does not need the tax credit as much as GM and Ford does, Ives said, because Tesla has the sales volume to lower prices and other cost advantages.\n\nBut Whiston said axing the EV tax credits would be tough because they are statute as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Also, if the credits went away or got much harder to obtain, it hurts every EV maker, Whiston said.\n\n\"Though it hurts Tesla the least because they have a deep cost advantage in EV production versus legacy automakers,\" Whiston said.\n\nTrump has promised Musk a quasi-Cabinet position. Musk's access to the White House does not bode well for the Detroit carmakers, Ives said.\n\nBut there is a catch. Trump has said he won't allow California to require that all vehicles in the state go electric in a decade. With Trump's pal Musk running the world's most valuable EV company, Trump's anti-EV stance might soften.\n\n\"A rising tide raises all boats. So to the extent that Elon is able to hamper the vilification of EVs by a potential Trump administration, all the better,\" James Chen, former head of policy for Rivian and Tesla, told Reuters.\n\nWayne State University business professor Marick Masters said that ultimately Trump will want to grow jobs in manufacturing generally and motor vehicle and parts specifically.\n\n\"Since June of this year, US manufacturing has lost nearly 150,000 jobs and the auto industry (vehicles and parts) has lost over 30,000 jobs,\" Masters said. \"His policies will focus on lowering the cost of doing business and pushing China to engage in more 'fair' trade policies.\"\n\nU-M's Gordon believes that Trump will warm up to EVs, as long as they are U.S.-made.\n\n\"But he is unlikely to push them via regulation,\" Gordon said.\n\nEV industry responds\n\nTrump has made it clear that he wants to reduce or cut vehicle electrification mandates, saying consumers should drive the market. Masters predicts that a major shift will occur in policy, but it will give automakers more flexibility in transitioning to EVs.\n\nThe problem is that carmakers have invested billions to transition to EVs and they can't just \"pivot on a dime\" to change course, McCabe said.\n\n\"A balanced portfolio approach needs to be the direction,\" McCabe said. \"Growth in electrification (not just battery electric vehicles) with less punitive actions and longer carbon footprint targets need to be considered. Extended-range options in pickup trucks, for example, help a consumer determine if a plug is not a disruptor in their lives. Trump has always had California in his sights, but it will not be a stroke of a pen to change their ZEV mandates.\"\n\nSteven Greenhouse, a longtime labor writer at The New York Times and currently a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, noted that Trump “seemingly moderated his antipathy to EVs as he sidled up to Musk” during the campaign, but that he might still try to pull EV subsidies, “and that would certainly mess up Detroit's automakers' plans — and probably hurt many autoworkers.”\n\nElectric Drive Transportation Association President Genevieve Cullen said in a statement Wednesday that the group will continue to work with both parties to \"secure the economic and environmental opportunities presented by electric drive technologies.\"\n\nCullen said more than 130 EV models are currently available with nearly 6 million sold and 362 companies investing $320 billion in the U.S. EV market. Last year, the electrified vehicle segment — which includes hybrids, plug-in hybrids, all-electric EVs and fuel cell vehicles — supported 373,605 jobs in America, she said. Cullen noted another 850,000 anciliary jobs supported the EV industry.\n\n“Electrification is the future of transportation, and our nation cannot cede the opportunity to lead in this critical market,\" Cullen said.\n\nFederal regulations likely to be affected\n\nOne other area of the auto industry where a second Trump administration could have a big impact is in safety regulations.\n\nMichael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, which advocates for improved vehicle safety and fuel efficiency, said he expects the auto industry will be pleased with what is likely on the way at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\n“If the first Trump presidency is any indication, we will see NHTSA’s now-active rulemaking division come to a screeching halt. I think we only saw two relatively minor final rules make it across the finish line from 2017-2020 in Trump’s first term, whereas the Biden NHTSA has been far more active in rulemaking efforts,” Brooks said, noting that that dozens of rules are in the review process. “Most of those rulemaking efforts will be hitting wet concrete under the Trump administration, including important rules on impaired driving tech, pedestrian protection, autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. Also likely would be attempted rollbacks of fuel economy standards and electric vehicle policy.”\n\nNHTSA’s work related to vehicle recalls is also likely to be affected. Brooks noted that under the previous Trump administration, the agency’s defect investigations were near “all-time lows,” which made it difficult to uncover defects and influence safety recalls. That stands in contrast to the agency’s current “far more active” work to pursue defect investigations and see them through to timely conclusions, he said.\n\n“If Trump follows through on making Elon Musk a leader in the administration, we could also see NHTSA enforcement investigations influenced, particularly those involving Tesla, which is currently facing an investigation into the capabilities of its 'Full Self-Driving' tech,” Brooks said of Musk.\n\nThe UAW and a 'new reality of American politics'\n\nU-M's Gordon said that while UAW members have had mixed support for Harris and Trump, \"Shawn Fain is going to be happy as a clam because Trump is a useful target for (Fain's) retro 'us versus them' name-calling style. Fain does better with a good enemy than he does with a friend.\"\n\nIn a statement to the news media Wednesday, Fain said regardless of who is president, UAW members continue to face \"unchecked corporate greed destroying\" lives by shipping jobs overseas to boost shareholder profits.\n\n\"We’ve said all along that no matter who is in the White House, our fight remains the same. The fight to fix our broken trade laws like the USMCA continues,\" Fain said. \"The fight for good union jobs and U.S. leadership in the emerging battery industry continues. The fight for a secure retirement for everyone in this country continues. The fight for a living wage, affordable health care and time for our families continues. It's time for Washington, D.C., to put up or shut up, no matter the party, no matter the candidate.\"\n\nFain said the key issue facing autoworkers is if the government will \"stand with the working class, or keep doing the bidding of the billionaires.\"\n\nWayne State's Masters said this election represents a continuing realignment of the political parties, eroding some of the union's past political prowess.\n\n\"The Republican Party has the chance to expand its base as the party of the working class across gender and race, literally turning the parties upside from their positions since the New Deal,\" Masters said, \"In this transition, organized labor has much less of a political voice than it has in the past, due to declining ranks across numerous industries.\"\n\nMasters believes that Trump will appeal directly to unionized and nonunion employees, going over the heads of union leaders, calling it \"the new reality of American politics.\"\n\nGreenhouse, the former labor writer, said it’s not clear what a second Trump term will mean for the UAW, but it’s not likely to be good.\n\n“Considering how Trump has often talked of retribution against his critics, he may pressure some prosecutors to launch investigations of the UAW and Fain,” he said. “Trump will no doubt appoint a National Labor Relations Board that is more hostile, less friendly toward unions than Biden's NLRB, and that could make it harder for the UAW's ambitious plans to unionize more auto plants.”\n\nFor Bob King, what Trump’s win will mean for the UAW and labor does prompt some worries, in large part because of those who are believed to be advising Trump. King, who served as UAW president from 2010-14, pointed to Project 2025, the expansive conservative presidential transition playbook pushed by the Heritage Foundation.\n\n“I think every leader and activist in the labor movement is concerned about attacks on workers' rights to organize, workers' rights to collective bargaining, keeping jobs in this country,” he said, noting that in regard to Trump’s advisers, “I think everybody in the labor movement is very, very concerned about that.”\n\nThose plans “all sound pretty negative about unions and pretty opposed to unions,” he said.\n\nThe Detroit 3 react\n\nIn a statement, Ford spokeswoman Robyn Jackson said the company congratulates President-elect Trump and the newly elected officials across the government.\n\nFord will remain \"steadfast in our strategy to provide customers choice of gas, electric and hybrid vehicles,\" the statement said. \"We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on policies that strengthen the U.S. automotive industry, which supports 9.7 million American jobs and drives more than $1 trillion into the economy each year.”\n\nMore:UAW's Fain says strike will cripple Stellantis\n\nMore:GM recalls some Chevy Bolts once again due to fire risk\n\nAt GM, spokeswoman Liz Winter said in a statement, \"We congratulate and look forward to working with the president-elect, Congress, and all elected officials to ensure that the U.S. continues to lead the world in technology and innovation, to the benefit of American workers and consumers alike.\"\n\nStellantis spokeswoman Shawn Morgan provided a statement, noting that \"Stellantis congratulates former President Donald J. Trump on being elected the 47th President of the United States.

If several warnings go unheeded, the vehicle will begin to slow itself down.\n\nAnother new system available on three upper-end grade levels of the new Altima is rear automatic braking, which stops the vehicle if the driver fails to respond quickly to audible warnings about unseen approaching objects. Automatic emergency braking to avoid forward-facing collisions is standard on the Altima.\n\nA system that monitors road signs will inform drivers about the speed limit.\n\nAnd in a new move for Nissan, the company will offer all-wheel drive as an option on the Altima. The option is geared to appeal to drivers who live in northern markets. Call it the Subaru effect. The Nissan competitor has had enormous success with its all-wheel-drive offerings.\n\nSay goodbye to the 6-cylinder engine option on the Altima. The redesigned Altima comes with a standard 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder engine boasting 188 horsepower. The system is 80% new and gets better fuel economy, Nissan said, without revealing specifics.\n\nThere's also an optional 2-liter, turbocharged, variable-compression engine that gets 248 horsepower and serves as the replacement for the 6-cylinder.\n\nThe design of the new Altima follows recent industry trends. It's lower, wider and longer than its predecessor.\n\nThe car is based on the Nissan Vmotion 2.0 concept vehicle revealed at the Detroit auto show in 2017.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/23/cameras-inside-outside-new-cars/3506205002/", "title": "Where are the cameras in your car and what are they looking for?", "text": "In 2018, drivers asked for hi-tech, onboard cameras and now they’re getting them.\n\nThe New York International Auto Show, open to the public through April 28, is ground zero for next-generation car technology and also home to several vehicles that offer in-car and exterior monitoring systems.\n\nFrom upgraded blind spot cams to facial recognition software installed in the dash, cars on display are equipped with several sets of digital eyes that can improve vehicle security, safety and convenience.\n\nSome of the cameras can help propel cars closer toward an autonomous future by enabling the vehicle to see what's around it. Others are installed to combat drunk driving by analyzing the driver's face and behavior.\n\nRetire early: Can ordinary Americans find financial independence and stop work by 50?\n\nSize 9-3/4:Vans announces Harry Potter-themed shoes, apparel and accessories are coming soon\n\nLast year, onboard cameras were on the top of motorists' wishlists, according to auto trends search data released by Google. Auto companies like Kia, BMW, Tesla and General Motors are positioning themselves to meet the increasing demand.\n\nWhere are the cameras?\n\nAlmost everywhere.\n\nCadillac's new CT5 compact sedan has a hands-free driving assistant that can navigate most U.S. highways on its own, as long as the driver stays attentive. Unveiled at the auto show, there's a camera on top of the steering column that monitors the driver’s awareness.\n\nThe 2020 Hyundai Sonata, which made its first stop in North America at the auto show, has five cameras installed throughout the car – four of which are used to provide the driver with an enhanced bird’s eye view of the vehicle’s exterior.\n\nThe sedan has front-facing cameras, mirror mounted cameras, a rearview camera and ultrasonic sensors that project sound waves to detect the proximity of objects to the vehicle.\n\nBMW has an optional driver monitoring camera in its new 2019 X5 SUV. The video camera is mounted in the digital dashboard as part of BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant system to make sure the driver is paying attention to the road ahead.\n\nTesla cars are also bespeckled with cameras, both internally and externally.\n\nEight surround-cameras give new Tesla's 360 degrees of visibility, helping the semi-autonomous cars see the world around them.\n\nDisplays confuse the cops:Tesla Model 3 confuses police officer who thinks a computer is mounted on the dashboard\n\nWhere do images, videos and data end up?\n\nSome go straight to the manufacturer.\n\nWith all these cameras and sensors, modern cars can collect details about driving habits that some automakers use for future innovations like digital road maps that can help with autonomous driving.\n\nBMW, for example, provides real-time vehicle data to the mapping software company HERE. The data is being used to develop a range of connected vehicle services, according to HERE.\n\nSome of the data and images never leave the car.\n\nThe computers on Tesla vehicles house information that drivers voluntarily save. The information can be erased through a factory reset.\n\nStill, the autonomous car maker came under scrutiny last month after a hacker discovered that Teslas found in junkyards still contained the driver’s stored videos, location and navigational data.\n\nBig savings, but there's a catch:T-Mobile gets into banking, offering 4% interest and no fees on its free checking account\n\nWind in your hair?

The software required to use the hardware is free.\n\nModern cars:Is your car hackable? Cybersecurity experts say it might be\n\nWhat can the cameras be used for?\n\nConsumers want onboard cameras that go beyond recording the road ahead, according to Google’s auto trend data, and that’s precisely what car makers are offering.\n\nWith 16 cameras and sensors, the 2019 Kia K900 was built to eliminate blind spots. Cameras on the outside of the car offer a clear view of your blind spots on the digital dashboard.\n\n\n\nThe 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLS SUV uses forward-scanning cameras and mapping data to tilt the car into corners for a smoother ride on and off road. Mercedes says it \"ensures superior suspension comfort, agile handling and good off-road capabilities.\"\n\nIn 2016, the Cadillac CT6 introduced a video recording system for added sedan security and a head tracking system that helps make sure your eyes stay on the road. Captured footage is stored on a standard SD card in the truck of the vehicle.\n\nCameras might also soon be able to reduce risky behavior.\n\nVolvo announced in March that it “believes intoxication and distraction should be addressed by installing in-car cameras and other sensors that monitor the driver and allow the car to intervene.”\n\nEarly next year, the company will be installing in-cabin cameras in all of its vehicles.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to explain why there’s a tiny camera installed above the rearview mirror in Model 3s.\n\nMusk said that the camera will help the Palo Alto-based company compete with ride-sharing giants in the future.\n\n\"It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video,\" Musk said in a tweet.\n\nHow permanent are the cameras?\n\nUnlike dashboard cameras you can stick on your windshield, automakers are building extra sets of eyes directly into the car’s body.\n\nSo one of the only ways to avoid them if you want 21st-century vehicle safety is to buy a car that doesn’t use them or opt out of optional advanced safety features.\n\nHowever, finding a new vehicle that doesn't have at least one onboard camera may be more difficult as time goes on.\n\nNew cars sold in the U.S. are required to have backup cameras to help drivers avoid accidents under a federal regulation that took effect last year.\n\nThe regulation requires rearview cameras and video displays on all new models to prevent accidents in which pedestrians are run over because a driver can't see them as they back up their vehicles.\n\nThe global automotive camera market is expected to almost double in the next 6 years, increasing to a 15 billion-dollar industry, according to a new global forecast report by Research and Markets.\n\nWorried about privacy?

And that's appealing to many Americans who already know they want to sleep, send emails or play video games as they zip down the road in a car that operates itself.\n\nWith self-driving vehicles on the horizon, automakers are rethinking what the future of car interiors will look like. And because these completely autonomous cars, called Level 5 vehicles, will free drivers from focusing on the highway, companies are now free to experiment.\n\nAnd that means premium cars could be loaded with tech that makes workers' commutes more posh, passive and personalized than ever before. Picture a pod hotel room – on wheels.\n\nAutomakers like BMW, Nissan and General Motors, for example, have shown off prototype vehicles with onboard voice assistants, smart temperature controls and modular seating, suggesting there will be little difference between your car interior and your smart home.\n\n\"It's fair to say that living room environments, very personal home environments and boutique hotels are inspiring (us) when we design the interior of the car in the future,\" says Holger Hampf, president of BMW Group's Designworks.\n\nWhen will self-driving cars be available?\n\nAnd while the timeline for self-driving cars is unclear and their costs appear high – perhaps adding six figures to the price tag of a vehicle – at least one study shows Americans are willing to pay more to let their cars drive themselves.\n\nFully autonomous vehicles aren't on the roads yet. But some smart cars are already letting drivers ease up behind the wheel by offering collision avoidance features. Most notably Tesla’s Autopilot is a driver-assistance system that has lane centering, adaptive cruise control and lets the car navigate autonomously on limited-access freeways.\n\nBMW, Nissan, GM reveal self-driving prototypes\n\nTwo examples of the trend toward mobile living rooms appeared in January at CES in Las Vegas, one of the world's largest tech shows. BMW's i3 Urban Suite concept car featured a seating layout configured for the rideshare trips of your sci-fi fantasies.\n\nThe driving seat, dashboard and steering wheel inside the concept car looked unremarkable. But the German carmaker had transformed the passenger seat into a cozy, personalized sitting room that harked back to fancy airline cabins.\n\nThe car has room for two people: a driver in the traditional steering position and a rear passenger who has most of the car to lounge in. Instead of a second rear seat, there's a side table and hi-tech lamp. There's also an adjustable footrest.\n\nThe company also showed an automobile called the i Interaction EASE, which was a bridge between a camper and a car. The exterior looked like a futuristic microwave – a sleek, white rectangle with a semitransparent glass door. The cockpit, however, was designed for a time when self-driving cars become mainstream.\n\nGesture controls replaced buttons. The seats were touch-sensitive and there was an Ease Mode, which lets the seats back into a \"zero-gravity\" reclining position so they lean 60-degrees.\n\n\"As soon as you allow someone to take their hands off the steering wheel for an extended period of time, we, as humans, want to do other things,\" Hampf said. BMW's approach is to embed tech that entertains, enables people to sleep or check emails once they become the passengers of their own car.\n\nGM showed the world that it's rethinking how seats will be positioned when it debuted its Cruise Origin in January. The van-like concept vehicle has seats facing each other so riders can \"relax, work or connect,\" the automaker said.\n\nAir taxis, Hyperloop, self-driving cars:What your commute could look like in 2030\n\nShould I get a smart lock? The pros and cons of going digital on your door\n\nIn 2019, Nissan created an elevated sports sedan concept that the company calls a \"premium hotel lounge-like space.\"\n\nThe Nissan IMs' exterior silhouette looks like a car that could be on the road today. But the convertible interior is something completely new.\n\nThe sedan could seat up to five people. The sides of the rear seat fold-down, giving the center passenger armrests in a more executive-style arrangement. When the car is in self-driving mode, the driver can shift to this space to relax or get some work done.\n\nEach of these vehicles is a concept, a vehicle built to show off new technology or styling. And while they may never go into production, they illustrate what these brands have in mind for the future.\n\nMany cars on the road today have features that display Level 1 and Level 2 autonomy, or short bursts of automated capabilities. Level 3 and Level 4 vehicles are highly automated in certain circumstances, while Level 5 cars can drive themselves around without human intervention.\n\nFully autonomous adds $100,000 or more\n\nFully autonomous technology could add at least $100,000 to the price of a vehicle, according to the car insurance provider Esurance, putting the features out of reach for most Americans. Still, more than half of car buyers (56%) would be willing to pay a premium of up to 20% for a self-driving vehicle, a 2019 study by the consulting group Capgemini has found.\n\nUncertainty about regulatory approval and questions about infrastructure and battery innovations make the availability of self-driving cars difficult to predict. However, studies suggest that automakers are being pushed to crank up the homeyness of car interiors anyway.\n\nInteriors matter more than outsides\n\nDrivers want more privacy, greater comfort and connectivity, making car cabins more important to buyers than powertrain and exterior appearance, a 2018 McKinsey survey found.\n\nThe research firm polled over 2,000 consumers, and 70% of people said the ability to customize the interior of a car to meet their needs will become a major decision point within the next 5 years. The company also polled automotive experts and executives, of which 90% said that interior features will have a great impact on the premium car market.\n\nCar buyers said they wanted more control over internal environments, smarter traffic alert systems and the ability to be productive from the back seat. They also want multipurpose cabins that support their evolving lifestyles, which could include driving for a ride-hailing company or thinking about leasing the car into a fleet of smart taxis.\n\nRobotaxis:Can Elon Musk's plan help Tesla owners make $30,000 a year?\n\nConsumers clamoring for smarter interiors gives automakers an opportunity to differentiate themselves from the pack, said Ben Ellencweig, a partner at McKinsey & Co., who advises automotive companies on retail and mobility.\n\n\"It's hard to predict whether we will have multipurpose vehicles, or will there be vehicles for different use cases. But it is clear that (car) usage is becoming differentiated and interiors are the best way to showcase those differences,\" Ellencweig said.\n\nThe option to sleep promises to become a popular pastime in autonomous cars, a Harris Poll commissioned by Erie Insurance found. Licensed drivers also said they'd like to text, send emails and play video games in their cars.\n\nBefore motorists can completely turn attention away from the road ahead, cars need to be able to connect to surrounding infrastructure. That’s where 5G connectivity and smart cities fit into the equation, enabling vehicles to make instantaneous and complex decisions based on their surroundings.\n\nSlow shift from car to connected living room\n\nThe transition from a mundane car to an autonomous connected room will be slow and gradual, says Thom Rickert, a risk and insurance specialist at Trident Public Risk Solutions.\n\nAs cars shift closer toward Level 3 and 4 autonomy, seating arrangements would have to allow drivers to reengage into a traditional steering position once vehicles move away from urban centers or off designated freeways, Rickert said.\n\nBMW imagines that cars will make active suggestions, perhaps through voice commands, to let the driver know its time to wake up and focus on steering. The car would also let drivers know when its safe to delve into other tasks.\n\nFor instance, once the driver makes it to a safe stretch of freeway, an AI-backed voice would call out to let them know its a good time to make a phone call.\n\n\"When the car needs you to take over again, you need to quickly readjust everything so you can grab the steering wheel,\" Hampf said. \"We're exploring this type of spectrum. We're looking for the sweet spot.\"\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/25"}]}

The final tally in the Senate was 86 to 11.\n\nBiden will sign the aid package while he is in South Korea, an official says, with the bill being flown overseas to the President’s location. Biden left Thursday on his first trip to Asia while president.\n\nThe legislation provides money for military and humanitarian aid, including funding to assist Ukrainian military and national security forces, help replenish stores of US equipment sent to Ukraine, and provide public health and medical support for Ukrainian refugees.\n\nAid to Ukraine has been a rare area of bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill with many Democrats and Republicans rallying around calls to help the embattled nation.\n\nNot all lawmakers are on board with the push to send an additional $40 billion in aid to Ukraine, however. Some Republican senators have taken issue with the high price tag of the legislation and the fact that the cost is not offset, and have expressed concerns that European countries are not contributing enough funds.\n\nEleven Republican senators voted against final passage of the bill: Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Boozman of Arkansas, Mike Braun of Indiana, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.\n\nAhead of the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell rebuked lawmakers “concerned about the cost” of helping Ukraine, making clear he thinks that voting against the roughly bill is a big mistake.\n\n“Anyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger cost should Ukraine lose,” he said in remarks on the Senate floor.\n\nWhat’s in the bill\n\nThe bill includes an increase in presidential drawdown authority funding from the $5 billion the Biden administration originally requested to $11 billion. Presidential drawdown authority funding allows the administration to send military equipment and weapons from US stocks.\n\nThe bill also provides $6 billion in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding, another way the Biden administration has been providing Ukraine with military assistance. The funding allows the administration to buy weapons from contractors and then provide those weapons to Ukraine, and as a result does not draw directly from US stocks.\n\nAccording to a fact sheet from House Democrats, the funding will be used to assist Ukrainian military and national security forces and will go toward weapons, equipment, training, logistics and intelligence support as well as other needs.\n\nThere will also be roughly $9 billion to help restock US equipment that has been sent to Ukraine, which comes as many lawmakers have raised concerns about replacing US stocks of weapons the US is giving to Ukraine, especially stingers and javelin missiles.\n\nThe bill provides $3.9 billion for European Command operations, which includes “mission support, intelligence support, hardship pay for troops deployed to the region and equipment, including a Patriot battery,” according to a House Democrat fact sheet. The Department of Defense has added additional US troops in Eastern European countries to bolster support for NATO allies near Ukraine since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.\n\nTo address humanitarian needs, the bill will include $900 million to bolster refugee assistance, including housing, trauma support and English language instruction for Ukrainians fleeing the country.\n\nThe measure provides an additional $54 million that will be used for public health and medical support for Ukrainian refugees.\n\nBiden administration announces $100 million security package as Biden set to sign aid bill\n\nThe Biden administration announced another $100 million security package for Ukraine on Thursday as Biden is set to sign the new bill authorizing billions more in assistance.\n\nIn a statement, Biden said the additional security assistance will “provide additional artillery, radars, and other equipment to Ukraine, which they are already using so effectively on the battlefield.”\n\n“These weapons and equipment will go directly to the front lines of freedom in Ukraine, and reiterate our strong support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country against Russia’s ongoing aggression,” Biden said.\n\nThe Biden administration has made it a top priority to get shipments into Ukraine as quickly as possible, cutting down the approval and delivery process from weeks to days. But officials had warned that money was running out from the last supplemental funding package and that Congress had to act quickly to keep the critical weapons shipments flowing.\n\nThe announcement of the latest security package comes as Biden is set to sign the new $40 billion aid bill into law.\n\nUkraine aid delayed in Senate\n\nBipartisan Senate leaders had hoped to approve the emergency funding bill last week to swiftly send billions in military aid to Ukraine as the war enters almost its third month.\n\nBut Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, blocked passage of the aid package until Thursday, which is the day the Biden administration said additional funds must be approved to avoid a lapse in support for Ukraine.\n\nPaul has demanded that language be added to the bill that provides a special inspector general new authority to oversee how the Ukraine aid is being spent. And while members from both parties broadly agree with that notion, forcing a change to the bill at such a late stage is time consuming and would slow getting the needed emergency aid to country.\n\nUnder Senate rules, any one senator can slow down the process. It took about a week to overcome Paul’s objection through timely procedural steps that the majority leader had to take on the Senate floor.\n\n“I think we should have an inspector general,” Paul told CNN earlier this week. “We have one out there and overseeing Afghan waste. He’s been very good at it. You don’t have to wait for an appointment. He’s got a team up and running. And I think that’s what we should do.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed Paul for delaying the emergency funding aid, arguing it was for “purely political motives” and only “strengthens Putin’s hand.”\n\nSchumer said ahead of the vote that he expects that on Thursday the Senate would “finish the critical task of approving another round of military, humanitarian and economic aid for the people of Ukraine.”\n\nHe continued to say, “This should already have been done and over with, but it is repugnant that one member from the other side, the junior senator from Kentucky, chose to make a show and obstruct Ukraine funding knowing full well he couldn’t actually stop its passage.”\n\nPaul said in a floor speech before objecting to the legislation’s passage last week that his “oath of office is the US constitution not to any foreign nation” and, “we cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy.”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated to reflect additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Ali Zaslav Clare Foran Ellie Kaufman", "Ali Zaslav", "Clare Foran", "Ellie Kaufman"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-security-assistance/index.html", "title": "Biden announces new Ukraine security assistance: 'We will speak ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday the US will send an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine as Russia’s war enters what he called a “critical window,” but warned congressional action is necessary for further shipments as the war grinds on.\n\nThe speech was Biden’s first public event dedicated to the war in weeks, and came just before he departed Washington for a two-day swing in the Pacific Northwest. While the issue has consumed his schedule, Biden’s advisers have hoped to pivot to domestic issues, like rising costs and gas prices.\n\nStill, Biden made clear neither he nor his allied partners would yield in their attempts to punish Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“Putin is banking on us losing interest,” Biden said. “Once again, we’re going to prove him wrong.”\n\nIn his speech, Biden sought to project momentum in Ukraine’s battle, saying Putin would “never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine.”\n\nStill, his pending request to Congress for additional funding was a signal he does not believe the conflict will end in the near-term. And an administration announcement it would accept tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees on humanitarian grounds was a sign the White House was planning for the future consequences of Russia’s war.\n\nBiden announced the new shipments – which includes heavy artillery and 144,000 rounds of ammunition – in a speech from the White House meant to update Americans on the state of the conflict, which is nearing its second month and entering what US officials have said could be a bloody new phase. He also said Russian ships would be banned from American ports.\n\nBiden said Russia has “refocused” its campaign to seize new territory in eastern Ukraine, making the flow of western military aid essential.\n\n“We’re in a critical window now of time where they’re … going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said of the Russian military plans. “The United States and our allies and partners are moving as fast as possible to continue to provide Ukraine … the weapons they need, the equipment they need, that their forces need to defend their nation.”\n\nThe new military aid package the President announced comes in at roughly $800 million following a similarly sized measure earlier this month. If approved, the latest package would mean the US has committed approximately $3.4 billion dollars in assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on February 24.\n\nThis would be the last presidential drawdown until Congress approves more money for weapons to Ukraine. In a presidential drawdown, the Defense Department pulls weapons and equipment from US inventories to send to Ukraine instead of purchasing new weapons from manufacturers.\n\nBiden said he will make a formal request next week for Congress to approve a second supplemental funding package to aid Ukraine, adding that he expected Congress to “move and act quickly” on the package.\n\n“In order to sustain Ukraine for the duration of this fight, next week I’m going to have to be sending to Congress a supplemental budget request to keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption to the brave Ukrainian fighters and continue to deliver economic assistance to the Ukrainian people,” Biden said.\n\nSpeaking about the importance of getting aid to Ukraine, Biden paraphrased a famous quote from former President Theodore Roosevelt, telling reporters: “Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we’re sending a lot of those in as well.” He was referring to an anti-tank missile the US has provided to the Ukrainian military.\n\nIn his speech from the White House, Biden updated Americans on US efforts to support the people of Ukraine along with unveiling the new assistance package, which has been finalized in recent days. Earlier in the day, Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and the President stopped by.\n\n“We had a good discussion,” Biden said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden tweeted this photo from the White House on Thursday, April 21. \"I met with Prime Minister Shmyhal of Ukraine this morning to convey our continued commitment to support Ukraine in the face of Russia's brutal war of aggression,\" Biden wrote. From President Joe Biden/Twitter\n\nBiden also announced the US is banning Russian-affiliated ships from American ports. While Russian ship traffic makes for a relatively small percentage of overall port activity in the US, the move is in line with a ban on Russian aircraft in US airspace the Biden administration previously announced.\n\n“No ship that sailed under the Russian flag, or that is owned or operated by Russian interests, will be allowed to dock in the United States port or access our shores,” Biden said.\n\nHe said it was “another critical step” the US was taking alongside its allies in Canada and Europe “to deny Russia the benefits of international economic system that they so enjoyed in the past.”\n\nThe latest package would come a week after the Biden administration authorized another $800 million security package, which included artillery and anti-artillery radars for the first time since the Russian invasion began.\n\nThe Biden administration is working to get the military assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible because it believes the war is at a critical stage and the continued US assistance could make a difference when Russia’s more aggressive assault on eastern Ukraine ramps up.\n\nThe more open terrain in that region favors the use of artillery and long-range systems, which is why the administration has placed a premium on getting those types of systems in quickly as the fighting moves away from Kyiv and into the Donbas region.\n\nBiden discussed additional western assistance to Ukraine with fellow world leaders in a secure video call Monday, where he also voiced a need to provide additional ammunition to Ukraine. Other countries, including Canada and the Netherlands, have announced their own shipments of arms to Ukraine this week.\n\nMeeting his top military officials at the White House on Wednesday, Biden touted the steady flow of American assistance into Ukraine as the war grinds on.\n\n“Weapons and ammunition are flowing in daily, and we’re seeing just how vital our alliances and partnerships are around the world,” Biden told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and US Combatant Commanders at a meeting in the Cabinet Room.\n\nBiden said the US force posture has to be “dynamic” as the strategic environment abroad is “evolving rapidly.”\n\n“We’re seeing this very day the need for adaptation as a consequence of us standing with Ukraine against Putin’s brutal and unjustified war. And I want to applaud the exceptional work you’re doing to arm and equip brave Ukrainians to defend their nation,” he said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/politics/trump-putin-ukraine/index.html", "title": "4 things to remember about Trump, Ukraine and Putin | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine didn’t just happen out of nowhere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has ratcheted up tensions with the West for the better part of the last decade – he annexed Crimea, meddled in US elections, poisoned an ex-spy on British soil, and more. Nearly every step of the way, former President Donald Trump parroted Kremlin talking points, excused Russian aggression and sometimes even embraced it outright.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that a few years ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wasn’t known for his steely wartime leadership, but for getting dragged by Trump into the US political scandal that led to Trump’s first impeachment.\n\nExperts say Trump’s actions weakened Ukraine, divided NATO, emboldened Putin and helped get us to where we are today. And even with Trump no longer in office, his impact lives on in the form of Putin-friendly commentary in conservative media and from some Republican lawmakers.\n\n“One of the key reasons Putin probably felt comfortable launching the invasion of Ukraine was the extent to which the West has been weakened and destabilized, and democracy undermined, and political divisions sown, in the five years since he attacked our election in 2016,” said Garrett Graff, a historian and journalist with expertise in national security and Cold War issues.\n\nHere are four things to remember about Trump, Ukraine and Putin.\n\nTrump took Russia’s side when the conflict began\n\nA popular revolution in 2014 ousted the pro-Russia regime in Kyiv, which was led by President Viktor Yanukovych, and replaced it with a Western-leaning government. Russian troops soon invaded the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, initiating the armed conflict that escalated this year.\n\nWithin weeks, Trump praised Putin for how he handled the takeover of Crimea and predicted that “the rest of Ukraine will fall … fairly quickly.” Echoing Kremlin propaganda, Trump said in a TV interview that the Crimean people “would rather be with Russia,” a position he also pushed in private. One of his 2016 campaign aides falsely claimed that “Russia did not seize Crimea.”\n\n“Trump said that Crimea is Russian, because people speak Russian,” said Elena Petukhova of Molfar, a Kyiv-based business intelligence firm, who called it an “absolutely pro-Kremlin” view. “According to this logic, the entire territory of the United States should belong to Great Britain.”\n\nWhen Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine shot down a commercial airliner in 2014, killing 298 people, Trump sowed doubt about Russia’s involvement. He embraced Putin’s denials, even after US and European officials publicly concluded that Russia was complicit.\n\nTrump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort – who had spent a decade advising Yanukovych in Ukraine – collaborated in 2016 with a Russian spy on a secret plan for Trump to help Russia control eastern Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. The proposal envisioned that Yanukovych would return to lead a Russian puppet state in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThis pro-Russian rhetoric didn’t always translate into policy for the Trump White House. For instance, his administration said sanctions would continue until Russia returned Crimea. But the rhetoric gave Putin an unexpected cheerleader in DC and created tensions within NATO.\n\nTrump’s mixed record on arming Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden has dramatically increased the flow of arms to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft systems, drones, rifles and other weapons. Importantly, it was Trump who first sent lethal aid, in a major reversal from the Obama administration, which refused to send offensive weapons to Ukraine during the early stages of fighting in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nBut Trump has a checkered past on this topic. As a candidate, his position was unclear at best. Trump campaign aides intervened during the 2016 Republican National Convention to block language from the GOP party platform that called on the US to send lethal arms to Ukraine.\n\nAnd in 2019, Trump infamously withheld nearly $400 million in military aid as part of his attempt to pressure Zelensky into announcing sham corruption investigations into Biden and his family’s business dealings. The weapons in the stalled aid package included the Javelin missiles that have emerged as a crucial part of Ukraine’s surprisingly robust defenses against Russian tanks.\n\nThis led to Trump’s first impeachment, but he was acquitted by the GOP-run Senate. Some of the Republicans who opposed his impeachment are now urging Biden to send more weapons.\n\n“The GOP is the party of the Russia hawks. For a half-century, one of their central organizing principles was opposing the Soviet threat,” Graff said, adding that Trump upended that history and made some Republicans go soft on Putin. “But in this last month, a lot of Republicans who became wishy-washy on Russia have come back to their natural position as Russia hawks.”\n\nTrump led an anti-Ukraine smear campaign\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump pushed a litany of false claims about Ukraine – in public and private. He rarely missed an opportunity to criticize the country. A widely respected diplomat testified to Congress that Trump believed “Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible people.”\n\nTrump’s biggest lie was about the 2016 election. He rejected the reality that Russia interfered to help him win. Instead, he falsely claimed it was Ukraine who meddled, and that he was the victim. These lies, which he repeated dozens of times, were a double boon to the Kremlin: they downplayed Russia’s brazen attack on US democracy, while simultaneously smearing Ukraine.\n\nThese views quickly became the party line for GOP lawmakers and conservative pundits, even though top Russia experts like Fiona Hill publicly warned that it was all Russian propaganda.\n\nThis was a break from decades of warm US policy toward Ukraine, especially when dealing with leaders like Zelensky who tried to reorient the country toward the West. Former President George W. Bush praised the Ukrainian people in 2004 for protesting a rigged election, and Obama celebrated the 2014 revolution that ousted a Kremlin-friendly government in Kyiv.\n\n“When Trump muddies the water by praising Putin, or undermines Zelensky and spreads falsehoods about Ukraine, this has real implications for how this crisis plays out,” said Jordan Gans-Morse, a Northwestern University professor who was a Fulbright Scholar in Ukraine. “It shapes public opinion in ways that tie Biden’s hands when he’s a de facto wartime president.”\n\nTrump repeatedly undermined Zelensky\n\nGQ magazine recently wrote about Zelensky’s “endless heroism” and Time magazine said he “united the world.” But the mythos of Zelensky as a Churchill-like figure is a new development.\n\nLess than three years ago, Zelensky was a fledgling politician that Trump and his cronies took advantage of as part of a ham-handed attempt to smear candidate Biden. The US-Ukraine relationship was put on the backburner and replaced with Trump’s personal and political needs.\n\nZelensky’s top priorities were to get more shipments of American weapons and to meet Trump at the White House. Veteran US diplomats in Kyiv shared this goal. But they were smeared and sidelined – and replaced by a band of Trump loyalists who made his demands clear: Zelensky could only get these things if he announced that Ukraine was investigating Biden for corruption.\n\nThis strong-arming by Team Trump forced Zelensky, in his first months in office, to navigate a surprisingly hostile relationship with the US, a supposed top ally in his fight against Russia.\n\n“Zelensky had more than enough on his plate when he came to power,” Gans-Morse said. “The country was already at war with Russia. He’s a political novice. And then, on top of that, the most powerful person in the world essentially extorted him, and he had to devote time and energy to deal with that. It’s unclear what the full impact was, but it definitely tested Zelensky.”", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/biden-congress-soviet-made-weapons-ukraine/index.html", "title": "White House under pressure from Congress and Zelensky to find ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nNearly three weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration is still assessing the most effective way to get military aid into the country without triggering a wider war.\n\nWhile administration officials say the effort to provide Ukrainian forces with American-made weapons such as Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles has been largely successful, the White House is under intense pressure to do more.\n\nSpecifically, both Congress and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have pressured Biden officials to help broker the transfer of heavier Soviet-made weaponry to Ukraine, including MiG fighter jets and S-300 surface-to-air missile systems. It’s a message that Zelensky could echo on Wednesday when he addresses Congress.\n\nBut so far the Biden administration has not helped provide those heavier, Soviet-made weapons systems. US officials continue to grapple with concerns about how Russia might respond if certain weapons transfers are approved. Officials have also raised questions about how useful MiG fighters would be, and whether they are worth the risk.\n\nThe State Department has been working to identify which countries currently have the Soviet-made S-300 air defense systems and is examining how they could be transferred to Ukraine, sources said. But it remains unclear how the US would backfill those countries’ supplies of surface-to-air missiles, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nA similar problem arose last week, when Poland indicated it would be willing to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, with the US telling Poland it would be unable to backfill the jets quickly.\n\nBut a Republican Senate aide told CNN on Monday that Congress had solved that problem for the White House when it passed a long-delayed $1.5 trillion spending bill last week. That package included more than $13 billion in money to respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including funding to directly backfill allies and partners who have delivered weapons to Ukraine from their own stocks.\n\n“That’s where we should urge the administration to work with allies and partners, not just in Europe but potentially around the globe, who are in a position to deliver more munitions for things like the S-300 or other advanced air defense systems that we can work with to backfill their own capabilities,” the aide added.\n\nTop House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to the State and Defense departments on Tuesday calling on the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with Soviet-made air defense systems and fighter jets.\n\nThe lawmakers said that the new funding Congress approved in an emergency supplemental should be used to deliver the military aid to the Ukrainians and help reimburse US allies who have also provided equipment and depleted their own stocks.\n\nLack of visibility\n\nAlmost all of the $350 million in weapons the Biden administration approved for Ukraine in late February have been delivered, according to multiple sources familiar with the status of the arms shipments. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden approved an additional $200 million military aid package for Ukraine, which includes more Javelin and Stinger missiles, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nSmoke rises from a Russian tank destroyed by the Ukrainian forces on the side of a road in Lugansk region on February 26, 2022. Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nUS officials have told Congress that the weapons they are sending to Ukraine are getting where they are supposed to go, according to sources familiar with the matter. But two sources tell CNN that the NATO alliance has very little idea what percentage of the military assistance is actually getting into the hands of Ukrainian forces after it crosses NATO and European territory.\n\nNATO doesn’t know because, deliberately, these shipments are being arranged by countries bilaterally – directly with Ukraine – and not through the alliance, the sources said. Nations have been told not to discuss with one another what they are sending and how.\n\nThis is partly for security reasons, because Western officials don’t want Russians to target the convoys, and informing the 30-country bloc of the transit points would increase the risk of such information leaking. But it also allows NATO to credibly say that as a bloc, it is not providing lethal assistance to Ukraine.\n\nWeekend strike\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Striking video from above shows devastation in Ukraine city where 2,500 are dead 01:01 - Source: CNN\n\nFunneling weapons into Ukraine may also prove to be more complicated going forward as the Kremlin made clear over the weekend that Russian forces will now target US shipments flowing into the country.\n\nThat warning, coupled with Russia’s recent strike on a military base in western Ukraine, is raising concerns about Moscow’s willingness to target aid shipments crossing the border from neighboring countries. NATO still does not believe, however, that Russia would target shipments still inside NATO or European Union member countries.\n\nTargeting arms shipments would be difficult for Russia, a source familiar with the intelligence added. It would need exact information on when and where the shipments are entering the country – and have to cope with the added challenge that many are likely being transported under cover of darkness.\n\nStill, the strike appeared to be part of a messaging campaign by Russia, the source said, warning the West against continuing its military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the base was not being used as a transit point for shipments of weapons and US efforts to provide security assistance were not disrupted. But a second NATO source told CNN that the strike was concerning to the bloc, due to its proximity to Western countries that are sending materials into Ukraine.\n\nWith the latest strike “it certainly appears as if the Russians are broadening their target set,” Kirby added, noting the weekend attack is just the latest sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not only sending a message about shipments of weapons into the country but also that he “clearly has the occupation of Ukraine in mind.”\n\nAs a result, the Biden administration now faces a delicate balancing act as it considers ways to expedite weapons shipments to Ukraine and address another concerted push by lawmakers to provide additional defense capabilities, including the S-300.\n\nPressure from the Hill\n\nIn the meantime, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are urging the Biden administration to step up its efforts to deliver more weapons to Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, told CNN he got an earful from Ukrainian American constituents this past weekend over the Biden administration’s decision to oppose providing Polish MiG-29 jets to Ukraine.\n\n“I went to a rally yesterday where that was the number one issue with the Ukrainian Americans, to give back the skies to the people of Ukraine and stop it,” Durbin said. “And I had to think in the context, as President Biden said in Philadelphia and said to us here in Washington, he doesn’t want to risk world war III. It’s a terrible, terrible decision that he faces, but I’m going to stand by him and work with him to do the right thing.”\n\nOne lawmaker said the public attention in Congress pushing for the Polish MiG-29 jets has been misplaced, arguing that Ukraine already has planes it isn’t flying, it doesn’t have enough pilots to fly more planes and the country’s runways have been damaged by Russian attacks.\n\n“The controversy over the MiGs is a classic case of Congress focusing on the shiny object instead of what will actually matter,” the lawmaker said. “The things that will really matter are the S-300s, SAMs (surface-to-air missiles) and drones. DoD is looking at ways to get them from allies, since we don’t have any we can give directly.”\n\nSenators have been publicly pushing for the Biden administration to change course on the Polish fighter jets since the opposition was announced last week. GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who was in Poland on Sunday on a congressional trip just miles from the Ukrainian border, pushed back on the notion that the MiG-29 fighters would cause an escalation with Russia during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n“I don’t know why that would be true,” Portman said. “You know, the Russians have complained about everything. Vladimir Putin has said that the sanctions are an act of war. They certainly complained when we provided Stingers directly from the US government, which can knock down an airplane and have been successful in doing that at lower altitudes.”\n\nPressure is mounting for the Biden administraion to find a way to provide Ukraine with S-300 air defense systems Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said the plan to provide Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets “would not be effective.”\n\n“They already have approximately 30 aircraft. They have problems with maintaining and flying those aircraft,” Reed said. “The real advantage would be to move in air defense missiles, which I hope they will do, because particularly some of the older ones, Soviet-era, they understand how to use them, since they’ve trained on them.”\n\nOperational security concerns\n\nThe source familiar with the intelligence also told CNN that providing MiG fighter jets does not make a lot of operational sense. The aircraft present a big target and they are hard to move, which creates a myriad of logistical, operational and security problems.\n\nThere are also operational security concerns around disclosing details about shipments of weapons to Ukraine, according to a senior defense official, who told reporters on Monday that the Pentagon is being very “careful and cautious about talking about this.”\n\n“We haven’t put out specifics on the inventory. There are certain systems we still have not acknowledged … that they’re getting. We don’t give out numbers, we don’t give out timing of the shipments, we don’t provide context on the locations or the ground routes on which it’s arriving, because we want to keep that security assistance flowing as much and as fast as it can to assist them in the fight,” the official said.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Natasha Bertrand Jeremy Herb Katie Bo Williams", "Zachary Cohen", "Natasha Bertrand", "Jeremy Herb", "Katie Bo Williams"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/us-ukraine-aid-weapons/index.html", "title": "US sees the aid its given Ukraine as effective, likely won't provide ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration is unlikely to significantly change its approach to helping Ukraine fight Russia, sources tell CNN, and is rebuffing some Ukrainian weapons requests for now – even as Ukrainian forces have made sweeping gains and recaptured thousands of miles of territory from Russia in recent days.\n\nUS officials broadly view Ukraine’s recent momentum as evidence that the types of weapons and intelligence that the West has been providing to Ukraine in recent months has been effective. And some caution that it’s too early to call Ukraine’s rapid progress in recent days a turning point in the war, warning that Russia is far from a spent force militarily.\n\nOfficials do not believe the battlefield landscape has changed enough to warrant a dramatic strategy shift in the short term despite recent Ukrainian requests to lawmakers and the Pentagon for long-range missile systems and tanks, which they assert can help them sustain the push for longer and keep the territory they have regained.\n\nBut for now, at least, the US is still not inclined to provide Ukrainian forces with the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, also known as ATACMS, that they have been requesting for months, officials told CNN. ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers, or around 185 miles. The administration still believes providing those systems could be escalatory because they could be used to fire into Russia itself. Currently, the maximum range of US-provided weapons to Ukraine is around 49 miles.\n\n“It’s our assessment that they don’t currently require ATACMS to service targets that are directly relevant to the current fight,” Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters in late-August.\n\nLast week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin intimated the US position hasn’t shifted. “The HIMARS, using the GMLRS rockets, have been extraordinary in terms of enabling the Ukrainians to service the targets that they need to service inside of Ukraine,” Austin said in Prague on Friday, making no mention of ATACMS.\n\nSince the beginning of the conflict in February, the Biden administration has taken an incremental approach to providing arms to Ukraine – in some cases, later agreeing to send weapons that earlier in the conflict would have been deemed far too escalatory. Its calculus has largely been based on avoiding systems that might be seen by Putin as too provocative, although those lines have moved over time and been criticized by some former officials as arbitrary.\n\nSome US military officials also acknowledged that systems currently considered too escalatory – like F-16 jets, for example – might eventually be provided to Ukraine. But those sources cautioned that such a decision is likely far in the future and isn’t linked to Ukraine’s recent, but nascent, successes. And there are no indications that such discussions are underway now.\n\n“Ukraine has made some progress, but there’s still a very tough fight, and a tough fight ahead, so I think we also need to keep that in mind,” Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Tuesday. “I think it is reasonable over time to continue, as we have, that dialogue to hear what their needs are, to work with the international community.”\n\nUS National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby echoed that, telling reporters that the US would likely announce additional military assistance to Ukraine in the coming days but declined to outline that aid in detail.\n\nAnother defense official told CNN on Tuesday that the longer-range equipment is likely still off the table for now because Ukraine is “still in the sweet spot on HIMARS,” or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems that the US and some of its allies provided to Ukraine over the summer. The munitions for those systems, provided by the US, are capable of using GPS-guidance to strike a target with precision some 40 miles away.\n\nUkrainian forces have received “thousands” of GMLRS rounds, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said last week, and used them to strike Russian ammo depots, logistical hubs and command posts.\n\nStill, some lawmakers disagree with the administration’s cautious approach.\n\nAsked whether he believes the US should send the ATACMS, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida told CNN, “I think we should send them anything they need to reclaim their territory, to the extent that we have it available, and it is reasonable.”\n\n“I think the concern some would say is that the longer-range missiles could target deep inside of Russia and trigger a broader conflict. I’m not sure I’m as troubled by that,” Rubio added.\n\nUS officials cautious on state of the war\n\nThe US has also been careful not to call the rapid Ukrainian territorial gains a turning point in the war, or a critical moment that will decide the outcome for good.\n\n“It’s more important than ever that we don’t appear to be spiking the ball,” a defense official said. The Russians still have a tremendous amount of firepower, manpower and equipment in the fight in Ukraine, and the victories this month of the Ukrainian military have not sealed the outcome of the war. In military terms, Russia still has “mass,” even if it has been unable to bring that to bear at a critical time and place to shape the outcome of a particular fight.\n\nStill, the Ukrainian counteroffensive – planned with US assistance – does appear to have been “expertly executed,” the official said.\n\nOne thing that has changed in the last several months is the Ukrainians’ willingness to share intelligence with the US, allowing American officials to better help the Ukrainians shape their battlefield operations.\n\n“There’s a lot more trust now than there was at the beginning of the war,” said one Ukrainian source close to President Volodymyr Zelensky. “And the Ukrainians recognize that the more they share, the more they are likely to get in return.”\n\nA US military source added that there has been “decent communication at varying levels about what’s being planned on the political side and the military side. There’s pretty good military transparency.”\n\nIn Kherson, where Ukraine telegraphed its intentions for months before the counteroffensive began, Russia had time to prepare, digging in to protect the territory around one of the first cities they occupied early in the war. Ukraine’s advances there have been incremental and deliberate, one official said, and there is no rapid advance through collapsing Russian lines.\n\nSome analysts have described the Kherson offensive as a “fixing” operation designed to keep Russian troops engaged away from the fight in Kharkiv.\n\nIn Kharkiv, however, the attack caught the Russians by surprise and without any well-prepared defenses, allowing the Ukrainian military to rapidly reclaim thousands of square miles of territory.\n\nRussia has so far failed to meaningfully stop the counteroffensive in Ukraine’s south or east as the problems they had early in the war – supply line issues, logistical problems, and a lack of effective command and control – still plague the Russian military, officials said. Russia proved unable to hold the territory it had seized, partially because of the high cost imposed on them by Ukrainian defenders.\n\nThe US is less concerned about Ukraine’s ability to hold reclaimed territory, officials said, even in the east, where Ukrainian forces have moved more than 60 kilometers within days in some cases. Ukraine’s supply lines are internal, whereas Russia’s were outside its own borders.\n\nIn addition, Ukraine’s forces will get a significant boost to morale and will from the recent victories, one official said, while Russia’s depleted forces will feel the opposite.\n\nIt’s “not a real concern of [Ukraine] overstretching supply lines,” an official said. Despite Russian claims of destroying the US-provided HIMARS, all of the 16 systems remain accounted for and the “overwhelming majority” of M777 howitzers also remain in operation, officials said.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Oren Liebermann Katie Bo Lillis Jim Sciutto", "Natasha Bertrand", "Oren Liebermann", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Jim Sciutto"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/us-weapons-ukraine-war/index.html", "title": "Why the Biden administration is giving new, heavier weapons to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago.\n\nThe $800 million list is driven not only by direct requests from Ukraine, but also in preparation for a new type of fight on the open plains of southeast Ukraine right next to Russia, terrain that plays into Russia’s natural military advantages.\n\nThe new weapons package represents the starkest sign to date that the war in Ukraine is shifting – and with it the weapons Ukraine will need if it hopes to continue to stymie a Russian military that has regrouped and resupplied after its initial failures in the opening weeks of the war.\n\nThe Biden administration announced the new package included 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had initially been earmarked for Afghanistan, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones, in addition to radar systems capable of tracking incoming fire and pinpointing its origin.\n\nThis package stands out from previous security assistance in part because this tranche includes more sophisticated and heavier-duty weaponry than previous shipments. A US official tells CNN that’s by design, arguing that because Russia, which was unable to capture Kyiv, has shifted its strategy to concentrate forces in eastern Ukraine, the US is shifting its own strategy in what it gives Ukraine.\n\n“The contours of what they need is very different,” the US official said.\n\nThe newly authorized package was announced days after national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley spent more than two hours on the phone with their Ukrainian counterparts reviewing requests. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov twice in the last week. Reznikov gave an update of the situation on the ground, which allowed Austin to determine what weapons Ukraine most needed.\n\nBiden delivered the news of the assistance package during a 58-minute phone call with Zelensky from the Oval Office on Wednesday. There was one item Zelensky asked Biden for directly: Mi-17 helicopters. According to a source familiar, the helicopters had initially not been included in the package as of Tuesday night because US officials weren’t clear on whether the Ukrainians wanted or needed them at this time. Zelensky made clear to the President on Wednesday that they did.\n\n‘A little bit like Kansas’\n\nThe weapons being provided are focused on the type of fighting that’s likely to take place in the Donbas region – open terrain rather than the close fighting in urban and wooded areas that’s occurred in areas around Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. The region also borders southwest Russia, allowing Russian forces to avoid the sorts of sustainment, logistics and communication problems that derailed their all-out invasion of the country nearly from the beginning.\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday that the package was tailored to the fight in Donbas, a topography he described as “a little bit like Kansas.”\n\n“It’s a little bit flatter. It’s a little bit more open. And it’s the kind of place where we can anticipate that the Russians will want to use tanks and long-range fires, artillery and rocket fire to achieve some of their objectives before committing ground troops,” Kirby said.\n\nThe new weapons package, Kirby added, was “very much an effort to give the Ukrainians every possible advantage in this fight that’s coming.”\n\nThe Biden administration has faced bipartisan pressure to do more to help Ukraine, particularly in calls to send more powerful weapons. But the administration resisted for weeks, wary of how Russian President Vladimir Putin, with his forces already deployed, would respond. Officials warned the Kremlin may see it as escalatory or an indication that the United States was joining the fight.\n\nThe issue was most acutely felt with the MiG-29 fighter jets Ukraine requested. The administration refused to take part in a transfer of the Soviet-era jets from a third country to Ukraine via the United States, rejecting a proposal from Poland.\n\nThe US worried, Kirby said on March 9, that “the transfer of combat aircraft right now could be mistaken by Mr. Putin and the Russians as an escalatory step.” A large part of the concern internally was over the proposal to fly them into Ukraine from a NATO air base.\n\nNow the rhetoric of the Biden administration appears to have shifted along with the scope of the war. As the US prepares to send in the types of weapons it has not sent since the invasion began, the Pentagon insisted this was part of the US commitment “from the very beginning” to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\n“How that gets interpreted by the Russians – you can ask Mr. Putin and the Kremlin,” Kirby said Wednesday.\n\n‘Very quickly in a different place’\n\nFor weeks, Zelensky pleaded with world leaders for more arms and equipment. In March, he spoke with the parliaments of 17 countries, as well as three international organizations. He never strayed far from his core message: Ukraine needs more weapons.\n\nHe asked Congress for new air defense systems to help defend Ukraine’s skies. He requested 1% of NATO’s tanks and planes to fight back against Russian forces. And he sought more weapons from Belgium, warning that if Ukraine loses, the European Union loses.\n\nBut his calls for heavier firepower went largely unanswered. For the most part, countries sent more small arms ammunition, anti-armor missiles and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as protective and medical equipment.\n\nNow, with Russian forces preparing for a massive assault on the Donbas region, the tide is turning.\n\n“The envelope of what people are prepared to provide has grown considerably in the last couple of weeks,” the US official said. Once Ukrainian forces were able to hold off the Russian invasion for the first few days, it put the options for security assistance “very quickly in a different place.”\n\nSlovakia provided Ukraine with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. The Czech Republic sent in T-72 tanks. The United Kingdom announced that it would ship 120 armored vehicles to Ukraine. And now the United States has authorized a range of new and more powerful weapons.\n\nAs a sign of the coordination on assistance to Ukraine, the European Union announced it would provide another $544 million in aid on the same day the White House authorized its own $800 million.\n\nPentagon says it’s working as quickly as possible\n\nThe package announced Wednesday marked the first time the US was providing Ukraine with howitzer cannons. Kirby said that several systems would require additional training for the Ukrainians to use them, including the howitzers and counter-artillery radars.\n\nMany of the weapons that are being directed toward Ukraine are heavier, making them more difficult to transport across the country. Ukraine has collected the weapons provided to date from the US and other countries at its western border before moving them to forces around the country.\n\nKirby said the Pentagon knows “time is not our friend” as Russia prepares its next offensive but that it’s working to move equipment into Ukraine’s hands as quickly as possible:\n\n“Even before this was announced, we had been moving at very, very fast speed all the other security assistance that we’ve been providing, frankly at an unprecedented rate.”\n\nThe Pentagon hosted the CEOs of the military’s eight largest prime contractors Wednesday to figure out how to arm Ukraine faster, according to a readout of the classified meeting. The roundtable discussion, led by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, focused on the Pentagon’s objectives to keep supplying Ukraine with arms while being able to maintain the readiness of US forces and support the defense of allies.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann Jeremy Herb Kaitlan Collins", "Oren Liebermann", "Jeremy Herb", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/biden-administration-ukraine-military-assistance/index.html", "title": "Biden administration announces $450 million in additional military ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration on Thursday announced an additional $450 million in military aid for Ukraine, with the US giving the war-stricken country four more multiple launch rocket systems and artillery ammunition for other systems.\n\nThe package, which will be drawn from existing Defense Department stocks, also includes 18 patrol boats for monitoring coasts and rivers, and small arms.\n\nThe most significant part of the package is the four additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, wheeled vehicles capable of launching barrages of guided rockets at targets up to approximately 40 miles away.\n\nThe US approved the first four rocket systems at the beginning of the month. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced Thursday on Twitter that they had entered the country. Training for 60 Ukrainian soldiers on the systems concluded last week.\n\nSince the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has approved more than $6 billion in security assistance.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications, said the additional security assistance serves “as part of our effort to help Ukraine defend its democracy in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.”\n\nKirby added that with the latest announcement, the total amount of security assistance the US has sent to Ukraine comes to approximately $6.1 billion since February 24 and $6.8 billion since President Joe Biden took office.\n\nThe new aid comes as Russia’s months-long invasion of Ukraine has reached a pivotal moment in recent days. Ukraine’s military has been burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems, and Western governments face a tough decision on whether they want to continue increasing their assistance to the country.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced it was providing an additional $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine to fight Russia, a package that includes shipments of additional howitzers, ammunition and coastal defense systems.\n\nCNN reported earlier Thursday that US assessments of the war increasingly envision a long and punishing battle in the eastern part of Ukraine, with high personnel and equipment losses on both sides.\n\nUS officials believe that Russian forces plan to maintain intense attacks in the east, characterized by heavy artillery and missile strikes, with the intention of wearing down Ukrainian forces and NATO resolve over time.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will virtually address the upcoming G7 and NATO summits, senior US administration officials have said, with the leader looking to shore up Western support for his country.

The US has provided more than $21 billion in defense assistance in less than a year. That includes $1.8 billion in a new weapons deal announced when Zelensky met President Joe Biden at the White House earlier Wednesday.\n\n“Is it enough? Honestly, not really,” Zelensky joked in his speech to Congress, drawing on his background as a comedian.\n\nLater he observed that Ukrainians will be celebrating Christmas by candlelight, “not because it’s romantic, no, but because there will be no electricity.” Russia has destroyed much of the country’s infrastructure and electrical grid.\n\n“Even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out,” Zelenksy said.\n\nInvoking US history, this time to hold the line\n\nZelensky previously spoke to US lawmakers by video back in March. “We need you right now,” he said at the time, early in the conflict, when he compared daily Russian strikes on Ukraine to Pearl Harbor and 9/11, attacks that shocked the United States.\n\nHe returned to US military history Wednesday, referring to the Battle of the Bulge during World War II, when US troops were surrounded in the snow after gaining a foothold in Europe on D-Day.\n\n“Just like the brave American soldiers, which held their lines and fought back Hitler’s forces during the Christmas of 1944, brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing this same to Putin’s forces this Christmas,” Zelensky said.\n\nEstablishing the US and Ukraine as allies\n\nThe historian Doris Kearns Goodwin compared Zelensky’s address to one given by Winston Churchill on Boxing Day in 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n“He’s already established in the American people’s mind we’re in this together, but then pointing out that they’ll do the fighting for us – ‘just give us the tools and we will finish the job.’ That’s what Churchill said,” Kearns Goodwin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday evening.\n\nThat’s an important perception for the US since Ukraine, importantly, is not an official member of NATO, the treaty alliance Putin fears. One major reason the US has not provided more direct aid to Ukraine is concern that Putin would be provoked against NATO.\n\nGiving Zelensky a singular platform\n\nAn address to Congress is the ultimate platform for a foreign president in the US and maybe around the world. It’s in contrast to Vladimir Putin, who canceled his annual year-end press conference.\n\nZelensky’s appearance was facilitated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as one of her final acts before relinquishing the speaker’s gavel. Earlier this year she took a surprise visit of her own to meet with Zelensky in Kyiv.\n\nHe handed over a simple Ukrainian flag signed by troops from the besieged area of Bakhmut to Pelosi, asking lawmakers to think of it and support Ukraine. She handed him an American flag that had been flown over the US Capitol, which he carried out of the chamber.\n\nWednesday’s White House reception could not have been the one Zelensky envisioned years ago when he faced then-President Donald Trump’s call for him to investigate Biden in exchange for military aid. And now Zelensky was thanking Americans for their help against Russia in the very chamber where Trump was impeached three years ago for pressuring Zelensky.\n\nMessage for Putin\n\nThe spectacle of Zelensky being celebrated in the heart of American power must be a nightmare for Putin, who thought this war, which started about 300 days ago, would be over quickly.\n\n“It was very important for him (Putin) and everyone else to see that President Zelensky and I are united, two countries together, to make sure he cannot succeed,” Biden said, standing alongside Zelensky at the White House during their joint news conference.\n\nBut at the same time, it’s clear to Zelensky, and also to Biden, that this is the time to re-engage the US public as Russia’s war drags toward its one-year marker with no indication there is an end to fighting on the way.\n\nNo obvious way out. And no specifics on a peace summit\n\nUkraine has performed better than anyone expected last February, when Russia invaded, but that brave fighting, with help from hardware from the US and other NATO countries has won Ukraine the beginnings of a stalemate, not the end of Russian occupation.\n\nWithout specifics, Zelensky endorsed the idea of a peace summit for this winter. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously floated the idea of Russia retreating out of areas it invaded since February. Zelensky has argued Russia should retreat even out of territory it claimed in 2014. Putin has not suggested he would retreat at all.\n\nUkraine’s No. 1 backer\n\nThe speech was importantly symbolic because this was Zelensky’s first trip outside of Ukraine since the war began and he came to “the country that more than any other, perhaps more than all the others put together, has enabled his country to defend itself so far,” said former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus before Zelensky’s remarks.\n\nPetraeus added it was substantive because of the new money pledged to Ukraine both at the White House and in a larger $1.7 trillion spending bill lawmakers need to pass before Friday.\n\n“Doing that before the next Congress is very important and I don’t think the timing of this is just purely coincidental,” Petraeus said.\n\nWhere the aid is helping\n\nThe Patriot missiles the Biden administration will send to Ukraine have gotten so much attention as a defensive system that could help protect Kyiv and the country’s electrical grid. But it’s the ammunition included in the new weapons package and the precision-guided rockets that will help Ukraine be on the offensive.\n\nIn addition to the money directly for Ukraine, the larger year-end spending bill includes an increase in US defense spending that will help American weapons and ammunition stockpiles depleted by support sent to Ukraine.\n\nPetraeus nodded to these realities when he said the timing of Zelensky’s speech – and his plea for continued support – is not by accident.\n\nOptics are important\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who wants to be House speaker and needs votes from Ukraine-skeptical Republicans to get there next month, did meet with Zelensky and the other three top congressional leaders.\n\n“I support Ukraine but I never support a blank check,” McCarthy said after the speech. “We want to make sure there’s accountability for every money that we spent.”\n\nA majority of Americans remain behind supporting Ukraine and keeping sanctions on Russia, according to recent polling, but in a December survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, the share of Americans who believe the US should support Ukraine for “as long as it takes” dropped 10 percentage points since the summer to about half. Just a third of Republicans supported indefinite support in the survey.\n\nThe only Ukrainian-born member of Congress, Indiana GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz, has expressed skepticism about some of the aid to Ukraine and concerns about corruption in Zelensky’s administration.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Without an influx of more weapons, some Ukrainian officials have said it will be increasingly difficult to halt Russia’s incremental progress or reclaim occupied ground in the region.\n\n“We hear what they’re saying, we absolutely hear what they’re saying,” said the senior defense official, who spoke of the “urgency” of the Ukraine Contact Group meeting Thursday in Brussels.\n\nThe official would not detail what countries would be announcing new security packages or what those shipments would include but noted that the US works “very closely” with allies to figure out what Ukraine’s armed forces need and then find those systems to send over.\n\nThe official would also not say whether the US would make a new announcement but said the Biden administration is already working on the next weapons package.\n\n“It’s a constant drumbeat because it’s a constant battle” with “constantly evolving urgent requirements,” the official told a group of reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n\nThe administration announced the last weapons package at the beginning of June, including High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HiMARS), a system capable of launching a barrage of rockets and missiles which Ukraine had urgently requested for weeks. The $700 million package was the first time the administration had drawn from last month’s $40 billion aid package for Ukraine, which received bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nA small group of Ukrainian soldiers began training on HiMARS almost immediately after the weapons package was announced. But the system, which requires three weeks of training, has not yet entered the fight. The senior defense official would only say that it will enter Ukraine “soon.”\n\nThe US has taken on “some risk” to its own military readiness in sending weapons and equipment to Ukraine, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said earlier this month, but it was “not an unacceptable level of risk at all.”\n\nThe senior defense official said the US and it allies have a significant amount of equipment still available to send to Ukraine.\n\n“We have far from exhausted the resource and the multi-country security assistance for this battle on Ukrainian territory,” the official said.\n\nZelensky asks for more\n\nUkrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky vowed in an evening speech on Monday that Ukraine would liberate all of the territories occupied by Russia, even the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed shortly after its takeover in 2014. But that could only happen, he said, if more weapons are sent to Ukraine.\n\n“It only takes enough weapons to make it happen. The partners have it. In sufficient quantities. And we work every day for the political will to give us these weapons to appear,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkrainian officials have said 100 to 200 soldiers a day are dying in the fighting, a number that raises some doubts about the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to sustain such losses. The US official said they don’t doubt the casualty figures.\n\n“The numbers are not out of line with what you would expect for this kind of artillery battle,” the official said. “It’s not surprising that the numbers the Ukrainians are reporting are that serious.”\n\nBut the official said the US has not seen a flagging of Ukrainian morale to remain in the fight, even as the conflict becomes a grinding, brutal battle of artillery that may favor the firepower and manpower of Russia’s military. The official sounded a more optimistic note about the state of the war, even as Russia appears to be gaining momentum in the Donbas region.\n\nProblems of morale, poor command, and supply issues have plagued the Russian military since the beginning of the invasion. Russia was able to paper over some of those issues when the focus shifted to eastern Ukraine, since the battlefield bordered Russia, making it much easier to send supplies over the short distance to units on the front line.\n\nA lot of Russia’s high-end equipment has already been destroyed, the official said, forcing them to rely on older models. At the same time, Russia’s stock of precision munitions is dwindling, leading to the use of more artillery, which has had devastating consequences with its lack of precision. Sanctions and export restrictions have also made it higher to resupply their high-end capabilities, the official said.\n\nDespite all the challenges the Russians have faced – both self-inflicted and as a result of Ukraine’s counterattacks – Moscow still retains its biggest advantage: the sheer size of its military. But that doesn’t mean Russia is guaranteed victory, even if Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no indication that he is considering scaling back his goals.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann"], "publish_date": "2022/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/05/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/9388548002/", "title": "Ukraine-Russia cease-fire talks to resume Monday; Israel PM ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Saturday, March 5.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that imposing a no-fly zone would be “escalatory” and is “not something the president wants to do.”\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nBlinken meets with Ukraine's foreign minister at Polish border\n\nKORCZOWA, Poland – U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday visited a welcome center set up by Polish authorities in what once was a shopping mall in Korczowa, close to the border with Ukraine, where roughly 3,000 refugees are taking shelter after the Russian invasion of their homeland.\n\nWhile at the border later, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba, who predicted Russia would be defeated but appealed for more military assistance to lower the cost in lives that he said victory will require.\n\nBlinken praised Kuleba, President Volodmyr Zelenskyy and other officials for their courage and “inspiring” leadership during the crisis. He said support for Ukraine and pressure on Russia to end the war would increase “until this war of choice is brought to an end.”\n\nAt the refugee center, America’s top diplomat heard harrowing tales from mothers and their children who described long and perilous journeys – and the shock of the sudden disruption and the fear for their lives – after fleeing the devastation of the war.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nPutin warns against no-fly zone over Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow would consider any third-party declaration of a no-fly zone over Ukraine as “participation in the armed conflict.”\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with female pilots on Saturday, Putin said Russia would view “any move in this direction” as an intervention that “will pose a threat to our service members.”\n\n“That very second, we will view them as participants of the military conflict, and it would not matter what members they are,” the Russian president said.\n\nZelenskyy has pushed NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that “all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you.”\n\nBoth U.S. officials and NATO have said a no-fly zone, which would bar all unauthorized aircraft from flying over Ukraine, could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy tells lawmakers to send more military, humanitarian aid\n\nZelenskyy personally urged a bipartisan group of Congress members Saturday to provide more military support and humanitarian aid to Ukraine in the aftermath of its invasion by Russia.\n\nThe Ukrainian president spoke to more than 280 senators and House members in a Zoom call that lasted about an hour. He thanked them for the sanctions the U.S. has slapped on Russia in retaliation for the invasion but underscored the need for more aid.\n\nZelenskyy reiterated his commitment to defeating Russia and “powerfully made his case for Ukraine and for the principles behind that: defending a sovereign democratic country,” said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., and co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus.\n\n“We must provide the Ukrainian people with the support they need in the face of this illegal invasion,” Quigley said. “As Congress is poised to pass additional aid for Ukraine in the coming days, I sincerely hope that this package receives unanimous, bipartisan support.”\n\nSen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Congress must swiftly pass $10 billion in emergency supplemental aid to give Ukraine and NATO allies the additional military, economic and humanitarian assistance needed to respond to Russian attacks on civilians and the rapidly growing humanitarian crisis in Eastern Europe.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the U.S. should send more airpower to Ukraine.\n\n“Zelenskyy’s message is simple: ‘Close the skies or give us planes,’” Sasse said in a statement after the call.\n\nEstablishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would mean sending American pilots into combat against Russian jets and air defenses in a battle that could quickly spiral out of control, Sasse said. But the U.S. should send planes, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles to Ukraine, he said.\n\nSens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Steve Daines, R-Mont. posted screenshots of the Zoom call on Twitter. The two drew criticism online after Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, a Democrat, tweeted that the Ukrainian ambassador explicitly asked Congress members to refrain from sharing on social media during the meeting for security reasons.\n\n– Michael Collins and Ella Lee\n\nState Department: Americans should leave Russia ‘immediately’\n\nThe State Department urged Americans on Saturday to leave Russia immediately, citing the “unprovoked and unjustified attack” by Russia against Ukraine and the potential for harassment of U.S. citizens by Russian government security forces.\n\nThe new travel advisory updated a notice issued Monday that said Americans should “consider” leaving Russia immediately.\n\nThe new advisory also said Americans should not travel to Russia. For those wishing to leave Russia, limited commercial flights are still available, and routes by car and bus are also still open, the advisory said.\n\nAmericans who wish to stay in Russia should understand the U.S. Embassy is limited in its ability to assist U.S. citizens and that transportation options and other conditions may change suddenly, the advisory said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWar has ravaged Mariupol for days\n\nMariupol became a focal point of the war in Ukraine on Saturday when evacuations were halted after Ukrainian officials reported continued shelling in violation of a cease-fire meant to give civilians enough time to flee.\n\nBut for days scenes of grief and terror have gripped the city in southern Ukraine.\n\nA bloodied 6-year-old girl in unicorn pajama pants was rushed to a hospital as her mother wailed.

We’ve seen it in Syria. We saw it, of course, in 2014 in Ukraine,” said Blinken, who is on a six-day tour of Europe.\n\nMore:US and allies look to seize Russian oligarchs' megayachts among sanctions for Ukraine war\n\nIn Ukraine, “what we’re seeing on the battlefield is Russian forces seeking to encircle the major cities, including Kyiv, and we’re seeing them use increasingly brutal methods, including going at civilians and civilian populations,” Blinken said.\n\n“The terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better for as long as Russia pursues these methods,” Blinken said.\n\nRussia risked a nuclear “catastrophe” with its “reckless” operation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was taken over by Russian forces late Thursday, Blinken said. He called on the Kremlin to cease all attacks around Ukrainian nuclear facilities and allow civilian personnel to do their work to ensure the facilities’ safety and security.\n\nIn a separate interview with the BBC, Blinken said he still believes Ukraine can win the war with Russia.\n\n“I can't tell you how long this will go on,” he said. “I can't tell you how long it will take.”\n\nBut, “if it's the intention of Moscow to try somehow to topple the government and install its own puppet regime, 45 million Ukrainians are going to reject that one way or the other,\" he said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nHundreds of Indian, Nigerian students stranded in Sumy, Ukraine\n\nEver since Russian tanks rolled into Sumy, a city in northeast Ukraine, on Feb. 24, hundreds of international students have been stuck inside university hostels with dwindling access to food, water and electricity.\n\nNow the students are pleading for help using the hashtag \"savesumystudents.\"\n\nShivangi Shibu, a fifth-year student at Sumy State University originally from Patna, India, said the students — including about 700 Indian students, 400 Nigerian students and others from Turkey, South Africa, Tanzania and elsewhere — were caught off guard by the sudden invasion.\n\nStudents rented a bus to attempt to leave the city but were shot at by Russian soldiers, said Samuel Olaniyan, a fourth-year student from Nigeria. Olaniyan said soldiers were positioned outside the hostels to prevent students from leaving.\n\nStudents gathered as much food as they could before the war began but are now out of food and water. Fourth-year student Precious Olawale said sometimes locals would bring them carrots and potatoes, \"but we're not getting proper food.\" Students are also gathering water by melting snow and catching water runoff from the roof. No students are injured, but some are falling sick.\n\n\"We just want to go home,\" Olawale said. \"We’re not asking for much. We’ll literally go with just the clothes on our back if it’s possible.\"\n\n— Grace Hauck\n\n'Welcome to hell’ becomes rallying cry for Ukrainian forces\n\nFrom spray painted road signs to impassioned speeches, Ukrainians have latched on to the phrase “welcome to hell” as a defiant mantra directed toward Russian invaders.\n\nThe latest example: Armed Forces of Ukraine on Saturday shared a video to Twitter purportedly depicting the fiery downfall of a Russian helicopter shot down by Ukrainian forces, goading Russian forces with the phrase.\n\nIn Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy’s hometown, the fervent expression was scribbled across a banner on a bridge over the entry road to the city.\n\nAnd on the outskirts of the nation’s capital, Kyiv, the phrase is painted on a concrete block, a warning sign for Russian troops to come\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nReport: 32 children killed and 70 more injured since invasion began\n\nUkrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova announced Saturday in an online post that, as of 11 a.m. (9 a.m. GMT), 32 children were killed and 70 injured since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began.\n\n“Russian troops continue to cynically violate children's right to life, as enshrined in Article 6 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,” she wrote in the post.\n\nMore:Where are the Ukraine protests?

The vaguely worded statement did not make clear how long the routes would remain open.\n\nA top official in Mariupol said the cease-fire there is to last until 4 p.m. (2 p.m. GMT) and an evacuation along a humanitarian corridor would begin at 11 a.m. (9 a.m. GMT.) Pavlo Kirilenko, head of the Donetsk military-civil administration that includes Mariupol, said the humanitarian corridor would extend from the city to Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe head of Ukraine’s security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had called on Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the older adults to get away from the fighting, calling such corridors \"question No. 1.\"\n\n— Associated Press\n\nUN agency: Ukraine exodus reaches 1.45 million\n\nGENEVA – The International Organization for Migration says the number of people who have left Ukraine since fighting began has now reached 1.45 million.\n\nThe U.N. migration agency, citing figures from government ministries in countries where they have arrived, said Saturday that 787,300 of them went to Poland.

He compared them to communications utilities regulated by the government.\n\nThomas wrote that Congress has given digital platforms some legal protection related to the content they distribute, “but it has not imposed corresponding responsibilities.”\n\nUnder Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, internet companies can moderate content on their platforms but are shielded from liability for content their users produce.\n\nSome social media posts, though, characterized Thomas’ opinion in stronger terms, saying that he had determined social media companies are not protected by the First Amendment in banning some speech and that Section 230 is unconstitutional.\n\n“BREAKING: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas finds social media companies do not have First Amendment right to ban protected speech and that Section 230 is unconstitutional,” conservative figure Jack Posobiec posted on Twitter shortly after the opinion was released on April 5.\n\nThat language was used verbatim in a Facebook post by Students for Trump founder Ryan Fournier.\n\nThomas was not joined by any of the court's eight other justices in the concurring opinion which carries no precedential weight.\n\nLegal and policy experts who reviewed the opinion said in interviews with USA TODAY that Posobiec's and Fournier’s posts mischaracterized what Thomas wrote.\n\n“I do not think that characterization is accurate, and I don’t think that is what Thomas is saying,” said professor Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law.\n\nPosobiec and Fournier could not be reached for comment.\n\nWhat is Section 230?\n\nSection 230 protects internet companies from liability when they transmit or remove user-generated content, with some exceptions. Its history stretches back to the early days of the internet.\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 of that legislation was in part a response to a New York state trial court’s decision to hold an early online service provider liable for statements a user posted about the Stratton-Oakmont investment firm, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nThe decision hinged on the service provider exercising editorial control over content on its website.\n\nLawmakers at the time argued that “they wanted to allow online service providers, working with concerned parents and others, to be able to take down offensive content without exposing themselves to liability,” according to the report.\n\nThe report points out that some have credited Section 230 with development of the modern internet.\n\nBut the rise of social media has fueled calls for change to the 25-year-old law, with some saying it gives too much power to social media companies to censor political views and others claiming those companies don’t do enough to stop the spread of misinformation.\n\nWhat did Justice Thomas say?\n\nThomas wrote in his opinion in the case of Trump blocking Twitter users from following him that “the disparity between Twitter’s control and Mr. Trump’s control is stark.” Twitter permanently suspended Trump’s account after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nWhile Trump blocked several people, Twitter barred all users from his messages when it banned him from the platform, Thomas wrote.\n\n“Today’s digital platforms provide avenues for historically unprecedented amounts of speech, including speech by government actors. Also unprecedented, however, is the concentrated control of so much speech in the hands of a few private parties,” Thomas wrote.\n\nThomas compares social media and other internet companies to utilities acting as “common carriers” or places of public accommodation, and lays out the potential for them being subjected to special regulations that would require them to allow everyone to access their services.\n\nBut legal and policy experts who reviewed the opinion pointed out in interviews with USA TODAY that such companies aren’t treated that way now.\n\n“He doesn’t say it’s unconstitutional,” said Mark MacCarthy, nonresident senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. “He says it might be unconstitutional if it were invoked to pre-empt a state law that gives users rights to be carried on social media.”\n\nKendra Albert, clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, said that Thomas’ opinion lays out “a series of hypotheticals” that could lead to a constitutional challenge but that it doesn’t expressly say that the law is unconstitutional.\n\nThomas could not be reached for comment. Last year, Thomas said lower courts interpreting Section 230 have given internet companies “sweeping protections” not intended by the statute.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe claim that Justice Clarence Thomas found that social media companies do not have a First Amendment right to ban protected speech and that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is unconstitutional is FALSE, based on our research. Thomas was alone in his concurring opinion in the case, which was about Donald Trump blocking Twitter followers, not the rights of social media companies. Legal and policy experts who reviewed the opinion said Thomas did not reach the conclusion stated in the claim.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Most immediately, it creates new legal risks for the tech giants, and opens them up to a possible wave of litigation that legal experts say would be costly and difficult to defend.\n\nTexas’s law makes it illegal for any social media platform with 50 million or more US monthly users to “block, ban, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, restrict, deny equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminate against expression.”\n\nThe law creates enormous uncertainty about how social media will actually function in Texas, according to legal experts, and raises questions about what users’ online spaces may look like and what content they may find there, if the companies are even able to run their services at all.\n\nThe ruling also sets the stage for what could be a Supreme Court showdown over First Amendment rights and, possibly, a dramatic reinterpretation of those rights that affects not just the tech industry but all Americans — and decades of established precedent.\n\nIn short, the decision has allowed Texas to declare open season on tech platforms, with huge ramifications for everyone in the country. It could reshape the rights and obligations of all websites; our relationship to technology and the internet; and even our basic, fundamental understanding of the First Amendment.\n\nA controversial law takes effect\n\nThe origins of Texas’s law, HB 20, lie in the longstanding Republican criticism that tech platforms discriminate politically against conservative users, a charge the companies have denied and which platform moderation researchers say there is little systemic evidence to support.\n\nThe law, which seeks to address the perceived imbalance, was blocked in December by a district court judge who ruled it was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. That decision came months after a similar law, in Florida, was also blocked for the same reason.\n\nBut that all changed this week, when in oral arguments at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel confused social media platforms with internet service providers; disputed that Facebook and Twitter are websites; and expressed surprise that a service such as Twitter could “just decide” what content appears on its platform as a matter of course.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton (2R) and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (2L) speak to reporters in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, on April 26, 2022. Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe result was Wednesday’s decision overturning the lower-court injunction that had kept Texas’s law from going into effect. The ruling promptly led Texas’s attorney general Ken Paxton — who is also empowered to sue tech companies under HB 20 — to declare victory.\n\n“My office just secured another BIG WIN against BIG TECH,” Paxton’s office tweeted.\n\nThe appeals court has not provided a written opinion explaining the decision, and it did not offer the tech advocacy groups who challenged the law time to seek an appeal.\n\n“Apparently, they do not think this is disruptive or something,” said Harold Feld, a senior vice president and communications lawyer at the consumer group Public Knowledge.\n\nWhatever happens next, legal experts appear convinced that the outcome will be chaos.\n\nUncharted waters\n\nWe are now in uncharted waters. For as long as the major US social networks have existed, they have been able to lean on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a liability shield for how platforms handle user-generated content. Section 230 has bailed tech platforms out of many a lawsuit over the years. But the Texas law is poised to change everything. The tech industry’s opponents have never had something like HB 20 on their side.\n\nThe scope of the law is truly vast, according to legal scholars. It is broad both in terms of its text — explicitly naming at least nine types of prohibited content moderation — as well as its subtext. What does it really mean to “de-boost” or “deny equal visibility”? The ambiguity of those terms provides carte blanche to creative plaintiffs willing to stretch the definitions of the English language, according to Jeff Kosseff, a law professor at the US Naval Academy.\n\n“Just think of all the actions that could be seen as ‘denying equal visibility’ to user content,” Kosseff tweeted.\n\nThe state law also forces tech companies to fight the same battles over and over again, prohibiting them from citing a successful defense in one court as a way of nipping similar cases in the bud in other courts.\n\n“Those are all things you’d do if you wanted to make litigation as attractive, expensive, and difficult to defend as possible,” said Ken White, a First Amendment lawyer better known as @Popehat on Twitter.\n\nIn theory, Section 230 may still preempt the state law and allow tech platforms to continue to escape liability. But the Fifth Circuit ruling throws much of that in doubt.\n\nHow social media platforms might respond\n\nSupposing the law is not hit with another injunction, social media platforms must now try to figure out how to comply with it, with the knowledge that the litigation is ongoing and things could still change — again.\n\nWhat does social media look like in a post-HB 20 world? It isn’t obvious. (Facebook and Twitter declined to comment for this story; YouTube didn’t respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOne option for tech platforms is to halt all algorithmic content filtering or ranking entirely. While it’s tempting to imagine all social media looking like the clean, reverse-chronological feed you can actually find on Twitter today (if you know where to look), that is merely the best-case scenario and not the likeliest one, according to Daphne Keller, a platform liability expert at Stanford University.\n\nThe Texas law opens the door to residents suing social platforms including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for allegedly censoring their content. Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nThe reality might look more like email before the advent of spam filters. Because algorithms would be prohibited from removing or down-ranking material, social media platforms would have to host spam, porn, or hate speech indiscriminately – an “unmoderated garbage dump,” as Keller described it in a tweet.\n\nThat may not protect tech platforms from lawsuits either, however. Thanks to the law’s broad language, a plaintiff could try to argue Facebook has silenced a user because her speech is now no longer visible underneath a mountain of spam. In this world, Facebook gets sued no matter what it does: Sued for taking down content and sued for not promoting content.\n\nAfter all, removing algorithmic amplification of some content could itself be seen as a kind of demotion, which is illegal under HB 20, Kosseff told CNN. “Who knows!” he said, emphasizing how wide open the possibilities are.\n\nIn the face of all this uncertainty, tech platforms could simply throw up their hands and stop offering services in Texas altogether. But even pulling out of Texas might not save them. Buried in the law is a prohibition on discriminating against Texans based on their geographic location. By withdrawing from Texas, tech companies could expose themselves to allegations they have geographically discriminated against Texans in violation of HB 20.\n\nAnd that’s without getting into all the ways people could try to maliciously game the law. With virtual private networks, it’s trivial for your computer to become a “Texan” even if your physical body is sitting in Mississippi or Massachusetts. Could someone in those states avail themselves of HB 20 even if they don’t live in Texas? As Kosseff might say: Who knows!\n\nA possible Supreme Court showdown\n\nAfter Wednesday’s decision, the dispute over HB 20 could well end up at the Supreme Court. The groups that challenged HB 20 have at least two obvious options before them: They could turn to the Supreme Court directly, or they could ask for a rehearing in front of a wider panel of appellate judges in hopes of a different outcome — which could eventually lead to a Supreme Court appeal anyway.\n\nAt least one justice, the conservative Clarence Thomas, has previously expressed interest in hearing a case that might allow the Court to rule on the issue of platform liability. A case involving HB 20 would present a ripe opportunity. If that happens, it’s not a stretch to say that decades of First Amendment precedent may suddenly be on the line.\n\nA fundamental question at the heart of the case is whether the state of Texas — a government entity — is forcing social media companies to host speech with HB 20.\n\nThis concept of “government-compelled speech” has long been held unconstitutional under the First Amendment. But a Supreme Court ruling upholding HB 20 may throw that longstanding precedent into doubt. Historic decisions that deal with compelled speech and protections for editorial curation might be substantially narrowed if not overruled in that scenario, said Kosseff.\n\nBecause of the law's broad language, a plaintiff could theoretically try to argue Facebook has silenced a user because her speech is now no longer visible underneath a mountain of spam. In this world, Facebook gets sued no matter what it does: Sued for taking down content and sued for not promoting content. Chesnot/Getty Images\n\nIn light of the Court’s apparent willingness to overturn decades of precedent in Roe v. Wade, it’s not difficult to imagine the Court revisiting some of its most basic First Amendment convictions.\n\nThen there is the fate of Section 230, the quarter-century-old liability shield. Because Section 230 is a federal law that affirms websites’ rights to manage their platforms (on top of the First Amendment), a Supreme Court ruling upholding Texas’s state law could create a conflict, raising questions about federal preemption. Might the Court take this opportunity to curtail or strike down Section 230 in the process? It’s anyone’s guess.\n\nAnother issue that could have far-reaching consequences involves HB 20’s attempt to define social media platforms as “common carriers” akin to phone companies, railroad operators and electric utilities. Whether you agree social media platforms ought to be considered utilities or not, a finding upholding that classification would give states everywhere a roadmap for regulating online platforms like never before in the history of the internet, with vast implications for the wider digital economy.\n\nOf course, it’s possible the Court may not even attempt to weigh in on some of these issues and simply leaves them unresolved — perhaps by giving HB 20 a thumbs-up or thumbs-down using the much-maligned shadow docket, CNN legal analyst Steve Vladeck suggested.\n\nDepending on how it turns out, this scenario could be the worst of all worlds — the legal equivalent of blowing things up and leaving everyone else to pick up the pieces.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/12/17/congress-deal-government-funding-extension/77052822007/", "title": "A government shutdown before Christmas? Congress reaches ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Lawmakers have reached a bipartisan deal to temporarily avoid a major shutdown, keeping the government open through at least mid-March and boosting disaster relief efforts after hurricanes devastated the Southeast this year.\n\nGovernment funding is set to run out at midnight Friday. Thousands of federal employees would be furloughed, and other important resources could be delayed or put on pause if Congress is unable to pass the funding extension in time.\n\nThe bill extends government funding through March 14, which Republican leaders have argued will allow President-elect Donald Trump to weigh in on the final deal. Republicans also will control both chambers of Congress next year.\n\nThe deal includes $100 billion in disaster relief that can go to cleanup for the aftermath of two hurricanes, Helene and Milton, and other disasters. It also provides $10 billion in aid for farmers and ranchers and a one-year extension of the farm bill, the basis of American agricultural policy that encompasses nutrition programs like SNAP.\n\nIt also would bring sweeping changes to the pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) industry and other health care provisions in an effort to lower drug prices.\n\nBut before lawmakers can jet off for their holiday vacations, they'll have to pass the agreement. It comes as House Republicans are frustrated with both the process to reach the deal and the contents of the extension, called a continuing resolution.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters Tuesday that the bill originally was supposed to keep the government open only until next year. But leaders changed course to provide support for farmers and the areas across the Southeast struck by deadly hurricanes in the fall.\n\nSeveral of the House's right-wing members who have been frustrated with Congress repeatedly kicking funding deadlines down the road have remained opposed to the latest effort.\n\n\"I think that our current path is a mistake,\" said Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., especially because the incoming Department of Government Efficiency, led by Trump allies Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, will try to cut spending next year. \"I'll be surprised if (the continuing resolution) has a majority of Republican support.\"\n\nOgles added that he's hearing \"a lot of chatter and frustration\" about Johnson's approach to the deal, but \"I don't know if that manifests itself into an actual challenge come January.\"\n\nLawmakers will vote to formalize the next House speaker next month. Though Johnson has the backing of Republicans in the lower chamber, a handful of GOP rebels helped oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in 2023 after he worked with Democrats to dodge a government shutdown at the time.\n\nThe deal announced Tuesday also was met with frustration from more moderate Republicans, including GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, who represents a district President Joe Biden won in 2020. He raised concerns that lawmakers have been left out of the process and that it included too many additional provisions, Punchbowl News reported.\n\nBut if wrangling lawmakers to support the most recent government funding extension seems challenging, think ahead to next March, when this deal will expire. House Republicans will have an even smaller margin than they now hold as they work to fill the seats vacated because Trump pulled a few House members into his Cabinet.\n\nSeveral Republicans have raised concerns that will make it more challenging to enact Trump's agenda for his first 100 days in office. They also suggested the three-month extension simply serves to avoid a battle over Johnson's leadership position, given the speaker promised not to pass big year-end spending bills dubbed \"Christmas trees,\" which leverage lawmakers' desire to leave Washington so they can secure spending for pet projects.\n\nJohnson argued Tuesday that the bill is \"not a Christmas tree\" and the funding addresses things that were \"out of our control,\" such as natural disasters.\n\nSenate Democrats and Republicans have pushed to complete their existing spending bills by the end of the year.\n\n\"Across all of our funding bills, there are real consequences for real people, for our economy, and for our national security,\" said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington. \"So, yes, it’s disappointing to be here again at the eleventh hour waiting to simply kick the can down the road with another CR rather than passing our bills into law that meet the needs of our country.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/10/15/trump-section-230-facebook-twitter-google-conservative-bias/3670858001/", "title": "Section 230 under attack: Why Trump and Democrats want to rewrite it", "text": "What is Section 230?\n\nThe Communications Decency Act is an obscure law passed by Congress in 1996 that has profoundly shaped today’s internet.\n\nIt's a provision of that law that's so hotly contested. Section 230 was intended to protect free expression on the internet by shielding internet companies from liability for much of the content their users post on their platforms, and granting companies legal immunity for good faith efforts to remove content.\n\nThat provision helped fuel the rise of the modern internet. Companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube say they could not exist in their current form without its protections.\n\nThere are exceptions to the law, such as federal crimes and intellectual property claims. Also, lawmakers in 2018 chipped away at Section 230 protections by passing a law that makes it easier to sue internet platforms that knowingly aid sex trafficking.\n\nBut generally speaking, internet companies have broad latitude to decide what can stay on their platforms and what must come down.\n\nWhy does Trump hate Section 230?\n\nSection 230 has critics on both sides of the aisle. Democrats and Republicans generally agree that social media platforms should be held more accountable for how they police content, and the parties have introduced a number of bills, none of which has gained traction on Capitol Hill.\n\nDemocrats including presidential nominee Joe Biden have urged Congress to revise Section 230 to make tech companies more accountable for hate speech and extremism, election interference, misinformation and disinformation.\n\n'It's already having a massive effect':Corporate America demands Trump rescind executive order on diversity training\n\nWalmart CEO:Business Roundtable members have new plans to fight historic racial injustice\n\nRepublican critics accuse tech companies of censoring conservatives and limiting their reach on social media. There is no clear evidence to support those claims, which tech companies deny.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his surrogates have been the loudest critics of Section 230. Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to repeal it. The Justice Department has asked Congress to adopt a new law that would hold Facebook, Google and Twitter legally accountable for how they moderate content.\n\nTrump’s attacks on Section 230 have intensified in the final weeks of his re-election campaign as social media companies label or remove posts they deem false or misleading or that could cause harm or incite violence.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Hunter Biden?\n\nCharges of anti-conservative bias raged again this week when Facebook and Twitter limited access to a dubious article about Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nFacebook said it slowed the spread of the article to fact-check its claims. Twitter said it blocked the article because it included people’s personal information and relied on hacked materials, both violations of its policies. The Senate Judiciary Committee said it plans to subpoena Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify about his company’s handling of the matter.\n\nWith the presidential election just weeks away, social media companies are moving aggressively to remove misinformation that could sway voters or tilt the election.\n\n“(Biden) and his family are crooked, and they got caught. And now they are being protected by Big Tech,” Trump said Thursday. “We must immediately strip them of their Section 230 protection.\"\n\nWhat’s the latest? Clarence Thomas, FCC\n\nOn Thursday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said he plans to craft new rules to limit Section 230's scope.\n\nThe Commerce Department asked the FCC to look into “ambiguities” in Section 230 after Trump issued an executive order in May. That executive order came after Twitter put fact-check labels on his tweets for the first time.\n\nThe FCC’s two Democratic commissioners, Geoffrey Starks and Jessica Rosenworcel, challenged Pai’s decision. The Internet Association, an industry group, also criticized Pai.\n\n\"The First Amendment protects every private enterprise’s ability to set and enforce rules for acceptable content on their services,\" deputy general counsel Elizabeth Banker said in a statement.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said this month that lower courts have interpreted Section 230 too broadly, giving internet companies “sweeping protections” that were not intended by the statute.\n\nWhat's next for Section 230?\n\nFacebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Twitter's Jack Dorsey are scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee later this month.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/chuck-schumer-economic-bill-saturday/index.html", "title": "Kyrsten Sinema says she will 'move forward' on economic bill ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema on Thursday night offered critical support for President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals at her request, indicating she would “move forward” on Democrats’ sweeping economic package that has been the product of intensive negotiations for more than a year.\n\nSinema’s support means Democrats likely will have 50 votes in their caucus to push the bill through their chamber by week’s end, before it moves to the House next week for final approval.\n\nAnd while the plan is scaled back from Biden’s initial Build Back Better package, the latest bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest investment in energy and climate programs in US history, extend expiring health care subsidies for three years and give Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate prescription drug prices. The legislation would impose new taxes to pay for it.\n\nA remaining hurdle for Democrats: A review by Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, who must decide whether the provisions in the bill meet strict rules to allow Democrats to use the filibuster-proof budget process to pass the legislation along straight party lines.\n\nBut after days of talks with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sinema indicated she was ready to vote to proceed.\n\n“Subject to the Parliamentarian’s review, I’ll move forward,” she said in a statement after maintaining silence over the bill for more than a week.\n\nIn the statement, Sinema indicated that she won several changes to the tax provisions in the package, including removing the provision that would have tightened the carried interest loophole, which aimed to raise the taxes paid by hedge fund and private equity managers. That proposal would have raised $14 billion. She also suggested that she won changes to Democrats’ plans to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes – a key demand by manufacturers that had lobbied Sinema over their concerns this week.\n\n“We have agreed to remove the carried interest tax provision, protect advanced manufacturing, and boost our clean energy economy in the Senate’s budget reconciliation legislation,” Sinema said.\n\nTo make up for the lost revenue, Democrats agreed to add a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks as part of the agreement, raising another $73 billion, according to a Democratic aide.\n\n“The agreement will include a new excise tax on stock buybacks that brings in far more revenue than the carried interest provision did, meaning the deficit reduction figure will remain at $300 billion,” a Democrat familiar with the agreement told CNN.\n\nThe $300 billion target in deficit reduction had been a key priority of Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who signed onto the deal after negotiations with Schumer last week.\n\n“The agreement preserves the major components of the Inflation Reduction Act, including reducing prescription drug costs, fighting climate change, closing tax loopholes exploited by big corporations and the wealthy, and reducing the deficit by $300 billion,” Schumer said in a statement. “The final version of the Reconciliation bill, to be introduced on Saturday, will reflect this work and put us one step closer to enacting this historic legislation into law.”\n\nHigh-stakes negotiations\n\nEarlier Thursday, top Senate Democrats engaged in high-stakes negotiations with Sinema, actively discussing potential changes to major tax components in order to secure the Arizona moderate’s support.\n\nIn private discussions, Sinema had expressed concern over key parts of the Democrats’ plan to pay for their climate and health care package – imposing a 15% tax minimum tax on big corporations and narrowing the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to pay a lower tax rate on much of their compensation.\n\nAs a result, Democrats had been scrambling to find new revenue sources to meet the goal of saving $300 billion over a decade.\n\n“Failure is not an option,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, expressing the view of much of his caucus earlier Thursday that Sinema would eventually get on board.\n\nSchumer announced earlier on Thursday that the Senate will reconvene on Saturday and plans to take the first procedural vote to proceed to the bill. If the vote gets the backing of all 50 members of the Democratic caucus, there would then be up to 20 hours of debate. Following debate time, there would be a process colloquially referred to on Capitol Hill as “vote-a-rama,” which is the marathon series of amendment votes with no time limit before the final vote. If the bill ultimately passes, the House would need to act.\n\nDemocrats are trying to wrap up negotiations and pass their economic passage before leaving town for a month-long August recess. The measure would invest $369 billion into energy and climate change programs with the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. For the first time, Medicare would be empowered to negotiate the prices of certain medications, and it would cap out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 for those enrolled in Medicare drug plans. It would also impose penalties on drug companies if they increase their prices faster than inflation and extend expiring enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage for three years.\n\nIt’s not clear if all these provisions will survive the parliamentarian’s review.\n\nHeavy pressure on Sinema\n\nSinema was not part of the deal, learning of it when the news broke last week. She had refused to comment publicly on the deal, with her aides only saying she would wait until the Senate parliamentarian’s review is done before taking a position. Yet she had been making her demands clear with Democratic leaders, including seeking to add $5 billion to help the Southwest cope with its multi-year drought, according to multiple sources.\n\nAs Democrats courted her, Republicans and business groups made their concerns known. In a private call this week, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, urged Sinema to press to change the corporate minimum tax. The president of the Arizona business group, Danny Seiden, told CNN that he expressed the business community’s opposition to the 15% tax provision, noting it would particularly hit manufacturers that take advantage of an accelerated depreciation tax deduction that lowers their tax burden.\n\n“Is this written in a way that’s bad?” Sinema asked, according to Seiden, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, who relayed the call to CNN.\n\n“It gave me hope that she’s willing to open this up and maybe make it better,” Seiden said.\n\nTwo sources told CNN that Sinema had privately relayed those concerns to top Democrats, arguing it would hurt manufacturers including in her state.\n\nIn an effort to break the logjam, Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper, a freshman Democrat, proposed the excise tax on stock buybacks to Schumer as a way to make up for the revenue lost by Sinema’s requests, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nAt issue are changes proposed by Democrats on bonus depreciation that the GOP enacted in the 2017 tax law, which allows companies to deduct 100% of the cost of an asset the year it is placed in service. The new legislation proposed to phase that down starting next year.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how the new language is structured on this issue.\n\nDefending the new tax, the Democratic-led Senate Finance Committee released data on Thursday from the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation showing that up to 125 billion-dollar companies averaged only a 1.1% effective tax rate in 2019. The committee argues in its release that this shows the “rock-bottom tax rates” that some companies are able to pay.\n\n“While we know that billion-dollar companies are avoiding paying their fair share, these tax rates are lower than we could have imagined,” said Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. “We’re going to put a stop to it with our 15 percent minimum tax.”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.", "authors": ["Manu Raju Ali Zaslav", "Manu Raju", "Ali Zaslav"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/12/04/fast-moving-brush-fire-reaches-100-acres-near-santa-paula/921986001/", "title": "Thomas Fire 2017: Live updates", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nThomas Fire:\n\nAcres: 281,893 • Containment: 92 percent • Buildings destroyed: 1,063\n\nHere are the latest updates:\n\nTuesday noon Very little has changed in the Thomas Fire. Fire crews took advantage of the cooler weather and increased humidity Monday to seek out and extinguish areas of heat within the fire’s perimeter.\n\nThe trouble spots remain near Bear Heaven and Cherry Creek, in steep and rocky terrain of Los Padres National Forest. Firefighters continue to keep close watch on the slow burning and smoldering areas of fire there but they cannot safely access it.\n\nMonday 10 a.m. Just under 500 firefighters and support personnel continued working the Thomas Fire Sunday into Monday, with much of the work focused on restoring and repairing suppression lines, said Kerry Greene, a spokesperson with the U.S. Forest Fire.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, crews had repaired about 112 miles of 279 miles of fire containment lines.\n\nFire activity is minimal, and limited to the area of Los Padres National Forest around Rose Valley Falls and Bear Heaven. Cooler temperatures and higher humidity are helping things, Greene said.\n\nSome of those working the fire rang in 2018 with a “Happy New Year” and small cheer. It was a couple of hours before midnight, because crews typically finish their day earlier than that to get ready for the next day’s work, Greene said.\n\nSaturday 9 a.m. Highway 33 north of Ojai was reopened Friday evening after what had been a lengthy closure at Fairview Road. Some National Forest land in the burn area remains closed to the public.\n\nThree areas where the active fire is still lingering in rugged terrain along the blaze's northern front are being monitored by U.S. Forest Service officials, according to an online morning briefing. Authorities expect containment lines to hold but are prepared to catch any significant flareups with aircraft.\n\nIn Santa Barbara County, suppression repair work is going well, they said. With a chance of rain in the forecast raising erosion concerns, it will be important to get that work done.\n\nA fire that started off Gibraltar Road Friday morning that put off a cloud of smoke visible from downtown Santa Barbara is still being investigated, said officials, who added they are not sure if it is related to the Thomas Fire. It was kept to about a quarter acre.\n\nSaturday's update will be the last daily briefing on the fire unless something significant takes place, officials said.\n\nFriday 6:30 p.m. Tribune Content Agency reported that this morning, a smoldering area of the fire came back to life when light winds ignited a patch of unburned vegetation, sending plumes of smoke into the air over Santa Barbara, according to U.S. Forest Service public information officer Jim Mackensen.\n\nInitial reports indicated the fire was started by a burning log that had rolled down into brush, but officials said Friday afternoon that that appeared not to be the case.\n\nThe flames spread near Gibraltar Road, a windy mountain pass loaded with million-dollar homes surrounded by grass, bushes and trees. No homes were immediately in danger but crews weren’t taking any chances, Mackensen said.\n\nTwo firefighter hand crews, one engine and two helicopters worked to put out the flames before they posed a significant threat, he said.\n\n“Probably the biggest takeaway from this is it’s indicative of the very dry conditions,” Mackensen said. “It’s not out till it’s out.”\n\nThe progress of the fire — estimated to be between a tenth- and a quarter-acre — was stopped by 1 p.m., Mackensen said.\n\nFriday 1 p.m. An Air Quality Watch issued for Santa Barbara County during the Thomas Fire was lifted Friday. The Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District canceled the watch after air quality in the county has been good-to-moderate in recent days, and the fire in nears 100 percent containment.\n\nThe control district did warn residents about the presence of ash and its potential for harm. Officials with the district advised residents not to use leaf blowers. If the ash is stirred up in the air, people are advised to take precautions to reduce exposure to the air pollution. A broom may be used to gently sweep up ash. Anyone with hear or lung problems should avoid ash cleanup, control district officials said.\n\nFriday noon Los Padres National Forest officials announced revised closures Friday, allowing access to the Mt. Pinos Ranger District.\n\nOnly areas within the Thomas Fire perimeter remained off-limits as crews were still performing suppression repair.\n\nFriday 10:45 a.m. As the Thomas Fire nears full containment, command of the incident will be transferred Saturday evening from the Incident Command Team to the Los Padres National Forest.\n\nIncident officials said around half of the 620 personnel still assigned to the fire were expected to be released in the coming days.\n\nFriday 7:45 a.m. California Highway Patrol officials said that Highway 33, north of Fairview Road, was expected to be fully open by 6 p.m. Friday.\n\nThursday 8:30 p.m. Crews continue to finish off the Thomas Fire, raising containment of the 281,893-acre blaze to 92 percent. There are 620 personnel working the fire, a number that's down several thousand from the height of the blaze. Venture County Fire Department crews in Upper Ojai spent a second day trying to extinguish natural oil seepage spots that were still smoldering from the fire.\n\nThursday 8 a.m. The Thomas Fire stayed right where it had been last night — at 281,620 acres and 91 percent containment. No forward progress is expected, according to the U.S. Forest Service, which is overseeing the remainder of the fire.\n\nThe day’s plan involved “patrol, mop up, and hold what we’ve got,” said Operations Section Chief Alex McBath.\n\nThe fire has little active heat, and the identified heat sources have been well inside of the fire perimeter, the forest service said.\n\nThe morning report also says:\n\nWest of Cherry Creek Road still contains large areas of unburned fuels, and active fire is expected when weather conditions that support fire return. In the coming days, people may see smoke, firefighters, and helicopters in this area, but there is no expectation that the fire will make any movement outside established containment lines. Hotspots also remain in the Bear Heaven area. Air support is implementing water drops in that area due to steep, rugged terrain with limited access. Additional aircraft remain available in the event there are flare-ups or new fire starts in the area.\n\nWednesday 6 p.m. In an evening tweet, Los Padres National Forest officials updated the Thomas Fire's size to 281,893 acres -- or more than 440 square miles -- and boosted containment figures to 91 percent.\n\nSome 655 personnel are still on hand to contain the blaze, Los Padres forest officials said.\n\nU.S. Forest Service officials now command the incident since it remains active mostly on national forest land.\n\nWednesday 10:30 a.m.: Thomas Fire officials said the blaze failed to grow for a second straight day, maintaining its size of 281,620 acres.\n\nAuthorities said there were still two areas with active fire though they posed minimal threat to established containment lines.\n\nVentura County fire crews were also working on oil seepage fires in the Upper Ojai area.\n\nTuesday 7:45 p.m. The American Red Cross opened two client service centers this week for victims of the Thomas Fire. The centers will operate from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday at Ventura County Credit Union, 6026 Telephone Road in Ventura, and at the Palazzio Event Center, 814 E Main St. in Santa Paula. They will also be open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on New Year's Eve.\n\nThe Ventura County Board of Supervisors met Tuesday to set rules for removing debris left by the Thomas Fire, waive fees for temporary dwellings on properties while homes are rebuilt, and move ahead with the second phase of cleanup from the fire.\n\nTuesday 9 a.m. Fire crews are slowly but surely finishing off the Thomas Fire. It has very little activity as of Tuesday morning and no forward progress is expected, fire officials said in their morning report. The fire is at 88 percent containment\n\nSome sections of Los Padres National Forest are closed for public safety. Hotspots remain in the forest’s Bear Heaven area, near Tar Creek.\n\n“Firefighters are building upon previous gains by strengthening established containment lines adjacent to communities and other infrastructure,” the report says.\n\nAircraft are available for any flare-ups or new starts.\n\nSunday 9 p.m. An evening update from Cal Fire boosted total acreage burned to 281,620, an increase of some 8,220 acres since Saturday's estimate. Containment had reached 86 percent. That upward bump followed a downgrade announced Sunday morning, when fire officials rolled back containment to 70 percent, saying a higher number provided Saturday -- 78 percent -- had been a typo.\n\nTotal counts for structures destroyed remained unchanged at 1,063, with another 280 damaged.\n\nMore than 1,500 personnel remained assigned as mop up and patrol efforts continue on some fronts while other crews work to strengthen containment lines and tamp down flare ups and new fire starts.\n\nSunday 12:45 a.m. Crews on Saturday night gained 70 percent containment of the Thomas fire, an increase from 65 percent 24 hours earlier.\n\nAs of Saturday night, the fire covered 273,400 acres. Officials said 1,573 personnel were assigned to the wildfire, down from well over 4,000 at the peak of the fire, which has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged 280, according to authorities.\n\nIn a Saturday night update, officials said the front-country fire perimeter is secure and that crews were building upon previous gains by securing established containment lines adjacent to communities and other infrastructure. Mop-up operations along the fire perimeter are ongoing and repair work is underway to mitigate impacts from fire-suppression activity.\n\nAs long as there was no significant wind, no major flare-ups were expected Saturday night, and an expected increase in relative humidity was expected to lead to diminished fire activity.\n\nSaturday 9:50 p.m. The Thomas Fire is now 78 percent contained, according to the United States Forest Service. The size of the fire remained at 273,400 acres.\n\nSaturday 5:55 p.m. The U.S. Forest Service said firefighters working the Thomas Fire during the holidays are appreciative of all the local community support they are receiving, but that they are \"well-cared-for\" and not in need of donations.\n\n\"The best gift you can give us is to give to those in need this holiday season, especially those folks who have been impacted by the Thomas Fire,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Give us a warm smile, a wave, a cute poster by the roadway, but please give your financial support and donated supplies to local assistance organizations.\n\n\n\n\"While we appreciate the public’s volunteer spirit and desire to donate, we simply don’t have the infrastructure to accept donations, especially food, which is carefully regulated in fire camp by health and safety ordinances.\"\n\n\n\nThe agency suggested a few organizations that could use your help, but added, \"there are also many others nearby who can really use your help. It’s always a good idea to call first to confirm specific needs.\"\n\nThe suggested organizations:\n\nHoliday food drive, Ventura Unified School District, 3777 Dean Drive, Ventura, 805-289-7961, ext. 2306\n\nFOOD Share, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays, 4156 Southbank Road, Oxnard, 805-983-7100\n\nSalvation Army, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week, 3451 Foothill Road, Ventura, 800-725-9005\n\nArc Thrift Store, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week, 265 E.

Santa Ana St., Ojai, 805-646-5122\n\nRescue Mission Alliance, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. seven days a week, 315 North A St., Oxnard, 805-487-1234\n\nSaturday 8 a.m. The memorial service for Cal Fire Engineer Cory Iverson will take place at 10 a.m. in San Diego. The event will be live-streamed at www.sdrock.com/iverson. Iverson, 32, died Dec. 14 while fighting the Thomas Fire in rough terrain outside Fillmore.\n\nAll mandatory evacuations have now been lifted and the fire's active presence has diminished in cities it once threatened from Fillmore to Santa Barbara. Still, more than 2,500 personnel remain to fight the blaze as it continues to burn in mostly National Forest lands. Mop-up operations and proactive containment efforts continue for what is now the largest recorded fire in California's modern history.\n\nFriday 9:30 p.m. It took the Thomas Fire only 2½ weeks to burn its way into history books as it became the largest blaze ever officially recorded in California. At 273,400 acres, it has eclipsed the 2003 Cedar Fire in San Diego County, which burned 273,246 acres.\n\nThe Cedar Fire had been recognized as the biggest California wildfire in terms of acreage since 1932. Some fires before that date undoubtedly were larger, but records are unreliable, according to state fire officials.\n\nComing on the heels of October's wine country wildfires, the milestone reaffirmed 2017 as the most destructive fire season on record in the state. Despite its size, the Thomas Fire has been less destructive than either the wine country fires or the Cedar Fire, which destroyed 2,820 structures and killed 15 people. The Thomas Fire has destroyed more than 1,000 structures and has been associated with two deaths.\n\nThe fire consumed tens of thousands of acres a day in its first week but is now nibbling up vegetation at a relatively slow pace — 288 acres on Wednesday, 770 on Thursday. As of Friday, while 18,000 homes and other buildings were technically still at risk, there was little flame showing in previously burned areas and the fire was moving slowly through remote wilderness.\n\nCrews are mopping the Camino Cielo to strengthen the fireline there. To the north of Camino Cielo, crews will patrol the fireline in the Zaca Fire area and monitor fire spread where line construction has not been possible due to very rough terrain. The controlled burning operation from the past few days will be mopped up and patrolled.\n\nNorth of Fillmore, fire behavior has been was minimal where it has backed into the Sespe drainage. The fire's spread east of Rose Valley to Bear Haven will be monitored by air. Fire spread has been minimal in this area for the past week, Cal Fire reported.\n\nCarpinteria, the Ojai Valley area and Highway 126 between Highway 150 and Fillmore are all in patrol status and will transition to unstaffed.\n\nCal Fire gave these statistics on resources in the battle against the blaze:\n\nFire engines: 171\n\nHelicopters: 26\n\nBulldozers: 21\n\nWater tenders: 38\n\nHand crews: 63\n\nTotal personnel: 2,841\n\nFriday 8:43 a.m. According to Cal Fire, the Thomas Fire grew to 272,800 acres and remained 65 percent contained as of Friday morning. The blaze is moving slowly through the Sespe Wilderness through and Bear Haven area. It is being closely monitored. Crews are patrolling for any smoldering in the areas of Carpinteria, Ojai Valley and Highway 126 between Highway 150 and Fillmore.\n\nFriday 1:30 a.m. Cal Fire reported that a dry cold front moved through the area and was replaced by a weak offshore flow. Winds gusting up to 50 mph produced no remarkable fire activity Thursday in the Montecito, Camino Cielo or Fillmore areas. Crews worked on mopping up the Camino Cielo area to strengthen the fireline there. To the north of there, direct and indirect fireline construction continued toward the footprint of the Zaca Fire. Controlled burning in Rose Valley will continue. East of there, crews will continue direct line construction, moving toward the Sespe Wilderness boundary.\n\nCal Fire released these statistics on resources being used against the fire:\n\nFire engines: 290\n\nWater tenders: 45\n\nHelicopters: 26\n\nHand crews: 133\n\nBulldozers: 26\n\nOther equipment: Six\n\nTotal personnel: 4,729\n\n\n\nThursday 6 p.m. Officials offered what they expect to be the final evening briefing on the Thomas Fire. They indicated that crews had a good day battling the fire, saying they had to \"work hard\" to find smoke and hot spots to take care of. Containment rose to 65 percent and the number of personnel working the fire declined to 4,729, down from more than 8,000 at the height of the fire. Here's more of what they said:\n\nThursday 2:30 p.m. The Red Cross also announced it will close its shelter 3 p.m. Friday at the Ventura County Fairgrounds. The nonprofit said the closure is decided at the request of local officials.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, the shelter was housing 164 people.\n\nTony Briggs, a Red Cross spokesman, said that the organization will put up in local hotels residents who lost their homes or whose homes were deemed unihabitable while they work out their recovery.\n\nHe said a large homeless population has also stayed at the shelter.\n\n“We’re working with the county to make them aware of county services If they’d like to take advantage of them,” Briggs said.\n\nSeparately, the winter warming shelter opened Thursday at the Ventura Armory.\n\nThursday 2:21 p.m. The House passed an $81 billion disaster aid measure that nearly doubles President Donald Trump's most recent request for hurricane-hit Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, along with regions of California ravaged by recent wildfires.\n\nThe 251-169 vote sends the measure to the Senate, where changes await and a vote isn't likely until next month.\n\nThe massive measure brings the total approved this year for disaster aid to more than $130 billion. Even more is possible, especially for Puerto Rico, where many areas are still without electricity months after Maria struck the island.\n\nMany Democrats opposed the bill, pressing for greater help for Puerto Rico and hoping to leverage their votes on the measure into victories elsewhere on the year-end agenda.\n\nThursday 2 p.m. The mandatory evacuation order in the Rose Valley community has been lifted, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office announced.\n\nResidents on Highway 33 between Rose Valley north to Hartman Ranch will remain under voluntary evacuation warning due to fire activity in the nearby area.\n\nDue to fire activity, debris and fire apparatus along the roadway, Highway 33, between Fairview Road and Lockwood, will remain closed to through traffic. Escorts may be required. Residents are asked to remain aware as fire equipment will continue to work in the area.\n\nFor information about returning home after a wildfire, please visit www.Readyforwildfire.org/after-a-wildfire/\n\nThursday 10 a.m. The one-stop center for Thomas Fire victims at the Poinsettia Pavilion will close Saturday, Ventura County officials announced.\n\nThe Local Assistance Center hours will be 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. The center is loated at 3451 Foothill Road, Ventura. County, city, state and federal agencies as well as nonprofits have had respresentatives available for questions and information.\n\nDan Paranick, Ventura assistant city manager, said the number of people using the center has dropped off.\n\nAfter the center at the Poinsettia Pavilion closes, residents will need to visit the agencies separately. Ventura has created a fire-related service counter at City Hall.\n\nThe county and the city opened the center Dec. 13 to help fire victims and as of Thursday morning has helped nearly 2,000 households.\n\nThe county has also opened Recovery Information Center trailers in Ojai and Santa Paula which will operate from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. until Friday.\n\nThursday 9 a.m. The California Highway Patrol in Santa Barbara said all closures in the Thomas Fire evacuation zones had been lifted. Residents are free to return to their homes.\n\nThursday 6 a.m. Overnight, the Thomas Fire grew by 200 acres, reaching a total of 272,200 acres since its start Dec. 4.\n\n“The past three days of reduced fire behavior has allowed crews to continue securing the Montecito area effectively with tactical patrol and line improvement,” says the Cal Fire’s incident report Thursday morning.\n\nIt’s still bone dry in the fire area, which hasn’t had rainfall greater than 0.1 of an inch since February. Longterm, there’s no precipitation in the forecast.\n\nLate Wednesday, a dry cold front reached the fire area, bringing strong north winds comparable to those that occurred Saturday when the fire marched toward Montecito. The north winds are expected to last into Thursday morning.\n\n“The current north wind event will wind test these areas, as remnant heat will be fanned by strong wind,” the report says. The Santa Anas are expected to return when the front leaves.\n\nIn Ventura County, fire operations in the Rose Valley is estimated to take four days to complete. Carpinteria, the Ojai Valley area, and the area within Highway 126 between Highway 150 and Fillmore are all in patrol status. Resources have maintained a presence along the Highway 101 area, to the east of Fillmore to Highway 150.\n\nThursday 2 a.m. According to Cal Fire, strong north winds will continue in the early morning hours, after which moderate Santa Ana winds will return the fire area.\n\nThe north winds will produce similar conditions to those experienced when the fire made its push into Montecito on Saturday, according to Cal Fire. With the introduction of these winds, critically dry fuels will spread the fire easily.\n\nMontecito will continue to be an area of concern, as north winds there are funneled through the Santa Ynez Range. Resources will maintain a strong presence in that area, continuing with tactical patrol and improvement of the fire perimeter. Firefighters will continue strengthening the fireline.\n\nIn the north, controlled burning operations will be ongoing based on weather conditions.\n\nIn the east, firefighters will patrol the fireline that has been established from Devil's Gate to Fillmore.\n\nThe area between Fillmore and Ventura along Highway 126 will remain in patrol status. Patrol and mop-up of isolated hot spots around the Ojai Valley area will continue. Contingency groups will continue to construct secondary lines to the west of Gibraltar Road and north of the Sespe drainage.\n\nFire suppression repair and damage inspection will continue as appropriate.\n\nCal Fire said resources on the fire include 416 engines, 54 water tenders, 34 helicopters, 160 hand crews, 34 bulldozers and six other piece of equipment. Personnel total 5,746.\n\nWednesday 6:50 p.m. State Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, has introduced legislation to protect residents from canceled insurance policies. The Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act would require companies to offer mitigation discounts to homeowners who invested in fire-resistant materials and seek approval from the Department of Insurance before reducing policies in high-risk areas.

Iverson, 32, is survived by his wife Ashley and daughter Evie, 2. His wife is pregnant with the couple's second child.\n\nIverson worked for the department's San Diego Unit as a member of a fire strike team. The apparatus engineer with Cal Fire's San Diego unit died from thermal injuries and smoke inhalation, according to the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nThousands of people paid their respects Sunday to Iverson as his body was carried from Ventura to his San Diego home during a procession that spanned five counties.\n\nDonations can be made to Cal Fire Local 2881 San Diego Chapter. For more information, visit http://l2881sd.org. Cards for the Iverson family are being accepted care of Cal Fire San Diego Unit Headquarters, 2249 Jamacha Road, El Cajon, CA 92019.\n\nWednesday 6:30 a.m. Containment grew to 60 percent but the acreage stayed at 272,000 acres in the third week of the Thomas Fire. It’s the first time since the fire started Dec. 4 that it didn’t expand. The cost to fight Thomas, however, can’t say the same. The estimated expense is pegged at $156.9 million. With the progress on the fire, more fire personnel have returned to their respective departments. About 6,500 are now assigned to the fire compared to 8,500 at the height of the blaze.\n\nThis afternoon, winds are expected to pick up from the north and east. These are the same types of patterns that pushed the fire toward Montecito late last week.\n\nFirefighters are on alert in Montecito, Ojai and Carpinteria. They are also on tactical patrol in the area between the rock formation Devil’s Gate and Fillmore and the area between Fillmore and Ventura along Highway 126.\n\nTuesday 9:55 p.m. The Santa Barbara Zoo’s visit from two of Santa’s reindeer has been cut short by the Thomas Fire, Tribune Content Agency reports. The zoo welcomed two male reindeer Nov. 22, an adult named Holiday and a first-year calf named Lightning. On Monday, Holiday and Lightning had to return home to the “North Pole” (by way of Windswept Ranch, near Tehachapi) as the Thomas Fire continues to burn nearby. The pair were originally slated to be at the zoo through the new year. “We’re sad to see our visiting reindeer Lightning and Holiday leave, but they have important work to do back at the North Pole,” the zoo wrote in a Facebook post. This was the first time in the zoo’s 54-year history that it exhibited reindeer.\n\nTuesday 6:02 p.m. The Thomas Fire has become the No. 2 recorded California wildfire in number of acres. The fire has reached 272,000 acres, authorities said at a briefing Tuesday evening. That put it higher than the previous No. 2, the Rush Fire of August 2012, which reached 271,911 acres.\n\nTuesday 6 p.m. Authorities held a briefing to offer updates on the Thomas Fire:\n\nTuesday 4:10 p.m. The weather outlook is prompting a red-flag fire warning for southern Santa Barbara County from 6 p.m. Wednesday to 10 a.m. Thursday and a fire weather watch for Ventura County from early Thursday to Friday morning. The National Weather Service expects sundowner winds in Santa Barbara County with isolated gusts up to 60 mph from Wednesday afternoon into Thursday morning. Winds could shift into Santa Ana winds from the northeast on Thursday and Friday in Ventura County with gusts up to 40-50 mph and humidity declining to 5 to 15 percent.\n\nTuesday noon More evacuation orders were lifted in Santa Barbara County:\n\nThe evacuation order has been lifted for all areas and residences north of Highway 192 (Foothill Road) to E. Camino Cielo in between Ladera Lane and Cravens Lane, including Toro Canyon, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office announced.\n\nThe evacuation order has been changed to an evacuation warning for all areas and residences north of Highway 192 (Foothill Road) to E. Camino Cielo in between Highway 154 and N. Ontare Road.\n\nTuesday 9:30 a.m. An information center will open Wednesday in Santa Paula to help residents of the city, the Santa Clara River Valley and the surrounding area who have been affected by the Thomas Fire.\n\nThe center, operated by the Ventura County government, will be in a trailer parked in Steckel Park, 8080 Mistletoe Road, near Santa Paula off Highway 150. The center will be open daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Friday.\n\nResidents can get information from Ventura County agencies about: debris removal and permitting information; applications for public assistance and housing/rental assistance and health education, resources and counseling.\n\nProof of residency is not required for most of the information\n\nThe center may reopen after Christmas if there’s a demand, officials said.\n\nTuesday 7 a.m. Fire activity slowed a bit overnight and fire crews managed “to strengthen containment lines and continue mop up,” according to Cal Fire. Winds coming from the southwest are expected to develop this afternoon and into the early evening.\n\nConditions are improving with a slight increase in relative humidity and weaker wind speeds, but vegetation is still “critically dry,” according to Cal Fire. Firefighters continue to focus efforts in Montecito and some hot spots within the Ojai Valley area.\n\nThe completion of a line from Fillmore to the rock formation Devil's Gate has lessened the threat to Fillmore. To the north and east, the fire continues to progress further into the Matilija and Sespe Wilderness and toward the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, Cal Fire said in its morning report.\n\nMonday 10 p.m. On the fire's 15th day, some out-of-area fire crews were being released back to their home departments, Ventura County Fire Department officials reported.\n\nThe fire's most active area Monday was the western flank, in Santa Barbara County, and the far northern area in wilderness areas above Ojai, where firefighters were proactively burning while weather was favorable, fire officials reported.\n\nThe fire was active Monday in the upper reaches of the Sespe River and is expected to spread into the footprint of the 2002 Wolf Fire, along the Highway 33 corridor north of Ojai.\n\nIn the Montecito area, Coast Village Road between Olive Mill and Hot Springs will reopen at 6 a.m. Tuesday, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff announced. Roads on the north side of Coast Village will remain closed.\n\nMonday 4:30 p.m. The city of Ventura announced it will have parcel record packets available to homeowners whose homes were either destroyed or suffered damage in the Thomas Fire. The packets will be available starting Tuesday, at 8 a.m. at Ventura City Hall, 501 Poli St. during City Hall business hours in room 124, lower level, west wing. City Hall is open 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays.\n\nProperty owners must bring identification and may pick up their individualized packet Residents may also request an electronic version of the parcel packet by emailing their request to CDTR@cityofventura.ca.gov.\n\nPackets will include:\n\nBuilding Permit Records - Including historic building permits and/or planning permits.\n\nProperty Zoning Information\n\nSubdivision Tract Information, if applicable.\n\nPackets will not include copyrighted plans or calculations/reports.\n\nThe City’s Ventura Community Development Department compiled all records for parcels with homes or structures that were damaged or destroyed. This information may assist homeowners with filing insurance claims and beginning the rebuild process.\n\nMonday 2:30 p.m. At last count, the Red Cross continued to house 405 people — 260 in Ventura and 145 in Santa Barbara, said Georgia Duncan, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit. Their efforts for displaced residents were going well at both sites, she said.\n\nNoon Monday Evacuation orders and warnings have been lifted for portions of Santa Barbara County:\n\nThe area defined within W. Mission Street at Highway 101, east to State St, north to Constance Ave, east to Garden Street, south to Los Olivos Street, east to Alameda Padre Serra, south to S. Salinas Street to Highway 101, and from Highway 101 east to Avenida Padre Serra.\n\nThe area South of Highway 101 to the Pacific Ocean, between Ninos Drive east to Sheffield Road.\n\nAll areas from Toro Canyon Road east to Casitas Pass Road and between Highway 101 north to Foothill Road / Highway 192.\n\nAll areas east of Cravens Lane to Casitas Pass Road, and Foothill Road north to E. Camino Cielo.\n\nThe evacuation order has been reduced to an evacuation warning in all areas from Toro Canyon, west to Olive Mill Road, from Highway 101 north to Highway 192.\n\nMonday 7 a.m. Overnight the Thomas Fire grew by 500 acres and weak northeast winds prevailed. They are forecasted to shift south to southwest in the afternoon.\n\nCal Fire said the areas of concern are above the coastal Santa Barbara County communities, including Santa Barbara, Montecito and Summerland. Other areas firefighters are watching closely are Matilija Wilderness, Rose Valley and Sespe river drainage north of Fillmore. The threat continues to Fillmore and surrounding agricultural values with fire being established in the Sespe drainage.\n\nSunday 7:45 p.m. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries Sunday, officials said. Airlifts were required in at least one case due to the remote location, they said.\n\nTwo homes were destroyed in Montecito over the weekend and another 7 damaged, Cal Fire officials said. A half-dozen outbuildings there were also damaged or destroyed during the firefight that erupted in Santa Barbara's front country starting Saturday morning when wind gusts up to 70 mph pushed flames down from canyons toward homes in the foothills.\n\nNo structures were lost or damaged over the weekend in the Fillmore area, where the fire was also most active.\n\nSunday 6 p.m. All evacuation orders have been lifted for:\n\nHall Road east toward Sespe Creek, Fillmore city limits to the south and Los Padres National Forest boundary to the north\n\nNorth of Fillmore city limits along Goodenough Road to Los Padres National Forest boundary to the north\n\nSunday 2:20 p.m. The funeral procession for fallen Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, left the Ventura County Medical Examiner's office in Ventura around 10 a.m. today and was scheduled to arrive at El Camino Memorial Park in the San Diego area in the afternoon. Iverson died Thursday near Fillmore while fighting the blaze.\n\nJail visitation was canceled Sunday at the pre-trial facility in Ventura and at Todd Road jail near Santa Paula due to fire impacts.\n\nEvacuation orders were lifted Sunday morning for residents along Highway 150 in Ventura County, from Santa Ana Road near Lake Casitas to State Route 192 east of Carpinteria, where the state highway is known as Casitas Pass Road.\n\nOrders were also lifted for Carpinteria residents living north of SR-192 between Cravens Lane and Casitas Pass Road, though the order remains for areas within Los Padres National Forest boundaries.\n\nAn evacuation warning was lifted for areas between Highway 101 and SR-192 stretching from Casitas Pass Road on the east to Cravens Lane on the west.\n\nHighway 154 reopened Sunday afternoon in Santa Barbara County. The route, also known as San Marcos Pass, is a widely used shortcut for travelers on Highway 101.\n\nEvidence suggesting an illegal marijuana butane honey oil extraction lab was uncovered in the fire area in Montecito, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's office reported Sunday. The lab in the 2200 block of Bella Vista Drive was being investigated Wednesday as flames were bearing down on the home and utilized highly flammable fuel that posed the risk of explosion, officials said.\n\nSunday 1:15 p.m. Red-flag fire warnings remain in place because of high winds and low humidity. Critical fire weather will continue over the Thomas Fire area, with north/northeast winds forecast, according to Cal Fire. Critical fire weather combined with very high fuel loading, critically low fuel moistures and single-digit relative humidities will continue to support fire growth on the west, east and north sides of the fire, Cal Fire said. Areas of concern are above coastal Santa Barbara County communities including Santa Barbara, Montecito and Summerland and also the Matilija Wilderness, Rose Valley and Sespe river drainage north of Fillmore. The threat continues to Fillmore and surrounding agricultural areas, Cal Fire said.\n\nSunday 3:15 a.m. Here are some direct links to Cal Fire's evacuation maps:\n\nVentura County: http://bit.ly/2CK8JPm\n\nSanta Barbara County: http://bit.ly/2oqR4JF\n\nSunday 12:30 a.m. A red-flag fire warning is in effect through Sunday evening, with declining humidity and the return of Santa Ana winds with gusts up to around 50 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nCal Fire released statistics about the resources battling the Thomas Fire as of Saturday night, with the numbers generally slightly increasing from 24 hours earlier.

The court found that the plaintiffs in the case couldn’t establish that they’d been injured by any conduct of the government officials.\n\nDuring the 2020 election season and the COVID–19 pandemic, social-media platforms frequently removed or fact checked posts containing allegedly false or misleading information. At the same time, federal officials, concerned about the spread of “misinformation” on social media, communicated extensively with the platforms about their content-moderation efforts.\n\nThe plaintiffs, two States (Louisiana and Missouri) and five social-media users, sued dozens of executive branch officials and agencies, alleging that they pressured the platforms to suppress protected speech in violation of the First Amendment. The 5th Circuit agreed, concluding that the officials’ communications rendered them responsible for the private platforms’ moderation decisions. It then affirmed a sweeping preliminary injunction.\n\nIn a decision authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the Supreme Court struck down the injunction. Justices John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined. Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented. The majority found that the plaintiffs couldn’t establish standing. They failed to show they suffered an injury caused by any of the defendants.\n\nAs initially filed, the suit appeared to be more of a political statement than a lawsuit. The gist of the suit was that the Biden administration, and agencies under its direction, were coercing social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, to shut down content related to misinformation about COVID and the 2020 election. The plaintiffs alleged, and the lower courts agreed, that the social media platforms “have engaged in censorship of certain viewpoints on key issues,” while “the government has engaged in a yearslong pressure campaign” to ensure that the platforms suppress those viewpoints. Great talking point. But the plaintiffs couldn’t back it up with any actual evidence. As the court noted, “[t]he primary weakness in the record of past restrictions is the lack of specific causation findings with respect to any discrete instance of content moderation.”\n\nStart your new business: Best LLC services\n\nThe court pointed out that: “[i]n fact, the platforms, acting independently, had strengthened their pre-existing content moderation policies before the Government defendants got involved. For instance, Facebook announced an expansion of its COVID–19 misinformation policies in early February 2021, before White House officials began communicating with the platform. And the platforms continued to exercise their independent judgment even after communications with the defendants began. For example, on several occasions, various platforms explained that White House officials had flagged content that did not violate company policy. Moreover, the platforms did not speak only with the defendants about content moderation; they also regularly consulted with outside experts. This evidence indicates that the platforms had independent incentives to moderate content and often exercised their own judgment. To be sure, the record reflects that the Government defendants played a role in at least some of the platforms’ moderation choices. But the Fifth Circuit, by attributing every platform decision at least in part to the defendants, glossed over complexities in the evidence.”\n\nDespite their bluster, plaintiffs could not establish a critical, threshold fact – that a particular defendant pressured a particular platform to censor a particular topic before that platform suppressed a particular plaintiff ’s speech on that topic. Failing that, plaintiffs failed to establish injury from the defendants’ past conduct. And this was problematic going forward as well, because the plaintiffs failed to show they needed injunctive relief to prevent specific conduct from reoccurring. Again, the court noted “[t]he plaintiffs treat the defendants as a monolith, claiming broadly that ‘the governmen[t]’ continues to communicate with the platforms about ‘content-moderation issues.’ ... But the plaintiffs could not show that any '[g]overnment defendant continues to engage in the challenged conduct, which is ‘coercion’ and ‘significant encouragement,’ not mere ‘communication.’”\n\nThe plaintiffs can (and likely will) continue to harp on their alleged grievances in the court of public opinion. But in a court of law, one needs actual evidence.\n\nJack Greiner is a partner at Faruki PLL law firm in Cincinnati.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe final 2022 primary elections, conducted Tuesday, saw more clear victories for the “Make America Great Again” wing of the GOP.\n\nThe more moderate Republican running for US Senate in New Hampshire, state Senate President Chuck Morse, conceded defeat Wednesday to the 2020 election-denying retired US Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc.\n\nIn fact, it was a sweep of House and Senate races in New Hampshire for the more Trump-aligned candidates.\n\nThe Senate race was yet another case of the candidate preferred by the Republican establishment in Washington, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, falling to a candidate who pushes conspiracy theories and was aligned with former President Donald Trump. It wasn’t enough that a super PAC aligned with McConnell had poured more than $4 million into the race to pump up Morse.\n\nIn this particular case, it should also be noted that Democrats helped Bolduc along by spending millions to run ads attacking Morse and tying him to McConnell.\n\nDemocrats’ cynical strategy of helping the Trumpier GOP candidates in multiple states and races is a dangerous gamble that could either help them keep control of the Senate or could put more election deniers in office, depending on what happens in November. It also undercuts their message of trying to protect democracy.\n\nAs CNN’s political team reported in takeaways from the New Hampshire primary, “Bolduc joins a list of candidates national Republicans worry won’t be able to appeal to the broader November electorate.” Read more takeaways.\n\nBolduc is the kind of candidate who has talked about abolishing the FBI and repealing the 17th Amendment, which requires states to directly elect their senators.\n\nWhile Trump didn’t technically endorse Bolduc and he ran unsuccessful primary campaigns in the past, he joins Georgia’s Herschel Walker, Arizona’s Blake Masters, Pennsylvania’s Dr. Mehmet Oz and Ohio’s J.D. Vance in the camp of Trump-endorsed, first-time candidates in danger of losing seats Republican leaders must win to get control of the Senate.\n\nThe Trumpier of two Trump aides wins\n\nThere was more evidence of MAGA-fication in a primary for New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, which pitted two former Trump administration aides against each other.\n\nThe one who expressed confidence in elections lost.\n\nFrom CNN’s report:\n\nWhere (Matt) Mowers had “confidence in New Hampshire elections,” (Karoline) Leavitt said she believed “the 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump.” Where Mowers suggested hearings to determine whether President Joe Biden should be impeached, Leavitt unequivocally said the President should be impeached. And where Mowers said he “supports science” when asked about the newly rolled out coronavirus vaccine, Leavitt said it was “none of your business.”\n\nCNN’s Daniel Dale writes Wednesday that more than half of Republican Senate candidates have “rejected, cast doubt upon or tried to overturn the 2020 election results.”\n\nNineteen of the GOP primary winners have questioned the 2020 results, according to Dale’s list, which includes five incumbent senators and 11 other candidates who could feasibly win in November.\n\nThere’s an even longer list of candidates for governor – at least 22 – and secretary of state – at least 11 – who have espoused similar theories and will be in a position to influence the way elections are carried out in their states if they win in November.\n\nThe key to Trump-critical Republicans surviving a primary\n\nOn the other hand, most of the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have been purged by GOP primary voters or had announced plans for retirement.\n\nMost notably, Rep. Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who has helped lead the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, insurrection, lost her primary in August.\n\nJust two of the 10 Republican House members who voted to impeach Trump, Reps. David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington state, will be on the ballot in November. So will Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the only Republican senator who voted for impeachment and is up for reelection this year.\n\nCNN’s Adam Wollner looked at how these few Republicans have survived and notes Murkowski is something of a political anomaly. She won reelection in 2010 with a write-in campaign after losing that GOP primary, which is the political equivalent of pulling a rabbit out of a hat.\n\nBut more importantly, he identified the one thing that ties the three surviving impeachment Republicans together:\n\n“Murkowski, Newhouse and Valadao did not face a traditional Republican primary,” Wollner wrote in August. “Instead, they participated in contests where all candidates, regardless of party, appeared on the same ballot. In California and Washington, the top two finishers move on to the general election, while the top four advance in Alaska.” Read more of Wollner’s analysis.\n\nMore one-sided polarization\n\nThe Brookings Institution did a more holistic review of primary candidates from both parties and found that Republicans have embraced Trump and his brand of conservatism far more completely than Democrats have embraced their most progressive ideas.\n\nTrump endorsed less than 13% of GOP candidates, but more than 96% of those he endorsed won their primaries.\n\nMost Republican candidates – nearly 60% in the Brookings review – put no mention of Trump or his MAGA and America First mantras on their website. But only 30% of those candidates who didn’t push Trumpism won.\n\nBrookings compared those figures with the percentage of Democrats who embraced the left wing of the party. Most – 72% of Democratic candidates – had no endorsement from left-wing groups and no mention of left-wing issues – anything from Medicare for all to defund the police – on their website. Nearly half of these won their primaries.\n\nA small minority of Democrats, just about 6%, were endorsed by extremely progressive leaders like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or groups that share his priorities. Half of them won their primaries.\n\nBrookings’ conclusion: “On the Republican side, candidates have embraced Trump – even when he has not embraced them – and done very well in the primaries because of it. On the Democratic side, the impact of Bernie Sanders’ revolution has been smaller, more muted, and less successful in primaries.”\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect which candidates former President Donald Trump has endorsed.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Given the current pace of opinions, the term could likely slip into early July, something that has not happened since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAnd the opinions will be dropping in the lead up to the first presidential debate, on June 27, between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden has already tried to make the Supreme Court a major issue in the campaign.\n\n“The Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today,” Biden said during a recent star-studded Hollywood fundraiser. “I mean never.”\n\nTrump has touted the three appointments he made that gave the court a supermajority of conservatives as one of his top accomplishments as president. But his campaign was circumspect last week when commenting on the court’s decisions to strike down a ban on bump stocks imposed by his administration and to throw out a challenge to a widely used abortion pill.\n\nHere's a look at the major pending decisions.\n\nCan Trump be prosecuted over accusations of trying to steal 2020 election?\n\nThe biggest outstanding decision is whether criminal charges alleging Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election can go forward.\n\nCritics charge that the court has taken so long to decide the case that it will likely to be impossible for a trial to conclude before the November election − even if a majority rule Trump is not immune from prosecution.\n\nThat’s particularly true if the court finds Trump has some immunity and requires the judge overseeing the trial to conduct additional proceedings to determine how that applies to the specific charges he faces. The high court could also say Trump must be given a chance to appeal that determination, which would further delay a trial.\n\nWhat charges can be brought against Jan. 6 defendants?\n\nAnother case deals with an obstruction charge wielded against one-fourth of the defendants in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021 – and against Trump.\n\nJoseph Fischer, a former police officer in central Pennsylvania, entered the Capitol and was charged with obstructing Congress, which was counting Electoral College votes that confirmed Biden won the election.\n\nThe issue is whether the law making obstruction a crime was meant to apply only to the destruction of documents rather than interrupting a public meeting.\n\nThe decision could have broad impact. About 350 out of the first 1,350 defendants from Jan. 6 were charged under the obstruction law.\n\nTwo of the four federal charges in Trump’s election interference case fall under the obstruction law. He could potentially benefit if the justices overturn the law or restrict its application for interrupting Congress.\n\nAre emergency abortions allowed in states with strict bans?\n\nThe Biden administration challenged Idaho’s strict abortion ban, arguing it conflicts with a federal law that requires hospitals provide stabilizing care.\n\nIdaho allows abortions to save the life – but not the health – of the mother.\n\nDoctors in Idaho say they can’t treat women who might lose organs or their reproductive ability, have uncontrollable bleeding or suffer other serious health consequences without an abortion − unless her life is clearly in danger.\n\nThe decision will be the first time the court has weighed in on abortion bans passed since it overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nIs a law banning domestic abusers from having guns constitutional?\n\nAfter a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was involved in five shootings pleaded guilty to the federal crime of possessing guns while subject to a restraining order, an appeals court threw out his conviction.\n\nThe New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied on the Supreme Court’s blockbuster 2022 decision that gun regulations must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation\" to survive court challenges.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday morning upheld the law banning domestic abusers from owning guns. Despite the Supreme Court's recent history of siding with gun rights the justices said some limits are permissible. Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenter.\n\nThe decision showed that a conservative court that has expanded gun rights also sees areas for limitations.\n\nCan social media content moderation be restricted?\n\nThe high court is considering a trio of cases about content moderation on social media that grew out of concerns from conservatives that their views were being stifled.\n\nIn one case, the court is deciding whether the Biden administration improperly leaned on social media platforms to remove postings on COVID-19, the 2020 elections and other issues that it considered disinformation.\n\nIn the other cases, the court is deciding if laws passed by Texas and Florida to limit the ability of powerful social media companies to moderate content are constitutional.\n\nTrade groups representing the nation's social media companies argue the laws violate the First Amendment and would make it impossible to keep sites free from objectionable or harmful content.\n\nCan a homeless person be penalized for sleeping outside?\n\nAs the nation struggles to respond to an affordable housing crises, the high court is deciding whether an Oregon city can bar people who are homeless from sleeping outside if shelter is not available.\n\nAn appeals court said the ban amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. But city officials say they’re being forced to surrender their public spaces.\n\nA record number of Americans lack permanent housing and both Democratic and Republican leaders have complained past court rulings have hamstrung their ability to address homeless encampments that threaten health and public safety.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless saying fining or throwing in jail someone with no where else to go will not solve the problem.\n\nWill the federal government's regulatory powers be curtailed?\n\nA conservative court that’s been increasingly skeptical of federal power could make it harder for agencies to issue regulations. The court is expected to weaken, and possibly overturn, a 40-year-old precedent that has guided how federal agencies protect the environment, workers, consumers and more.\n\nUnder what’s known as the Chevron doctrine, courts have deferred to an agency’s interpretation of a law if the statute isn’t clear and the interpretation is reasonable.\n\nCritics say that’s given the executive branch too much authority.\n\nDefenders of the doctrine say Congress cannot anticipate every circumstance when, for example, writing laws to protect the environment and subject matter experts at the agencies are needed to fill in the blanks.\n\nIn a separate case, the Supreme Court is deciding if the Biden administration can enforce a “good neighbor” plan to reduce smog-forming pollution while its legality is being challenged.\n\nWill a multibillion-dollar settlement over opioid crisis survive?\n\nA high-profile bankruptcy settlement with the company that made oxycontin could be saved or scuttled by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision will have sweeping implications for states, which intend to use settlement money for drug treatment programs. It will also have big implications for the Sackler family, which made its fortune selling a drug that fueled the nation's opioid epidemic.\n\nThe vast majority of victims supported the settlement with Purdue Pharma, the company that marketed OxyContin as a less addictive painkiller than other opioids. But the Justice Department stepped into the case to question whether courts could shield the Sacklers from future civil lawsuits − a practice that has been used in major bankruptcies dealing with harms caused by asbestos and silicone breast implants.\n\nWhile the case deals with a technical question of bankruptcy law, there are wrenching stories not far below the surface involving Americans who had lost children, spouses and parents to a crisis that claimed about 80,000 lives in 2022.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/15/iowa-caucus-live-updates-2024/72192316007/", "title": "Iowa Caucus replay: Catch up after Trump won, DeSantis followed", "text": "Former President Donald Trump clinched victory in the Iowa Caucuses on Monday, celebrating a quick win over his Republican rivals.\n\nFlorida Gov.

Precinct chair Jim McClure said he heard some say they were previously Democrats or Independents, while others said they had just never registered with the party before. In the past, this new registration number has been closer to 20% of caucusgoers, McClure said. There were 244 Iowans attending the caucus at Beaver Creek Elementary School on Monday night. McClure said the delay was minimal, though, as a school employee quickly photocopied additional forms.\n\n–Savannah Kuchar\n\nDisruption at Des Moines-area caucus site\n\nA video posted to X, formerly Twitter, appeared to show a disruption at a caucus site at Timberline School in Waukee, Iowa.\n\nThe video, posted by Republican Florida state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, showed a man who shouted “How dare you do this on Martin Luther King Day,” before he was grabbed by people and escorted out.\n\nRep. Wesley Hunt of Texas later posted on X he was making a speech in support of Trump when the man interrupted and shouted Trump was \"racist.\"\n\n\"But on this day, of all days, Martin Luther King Day, the people of Iowa, just like President Trump judge me not by the color of my skin but by the content of my character,\" Hunt said.\n\n–Phillip Sitter\n\nDonald Trump 'honored' by the early call – and says nice things about opponents\n\nThe former president didn't mind the quick call of the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\"I feel great,\" Trump told Fox News Digital in a post-win interview. \"I am greatly honored by such an early call.\"\n\nTrump was in such a good mood that he had some nice things to say about his rivals (though not by name).\n\n\"It really is an honor that, minutes after, they’ve announced I’ve won - against very credible competition- great competition, actually,\" Trump said.\n\n–David Jackson\n\nHow did Donald Trump win so fast?\n\nNot even an hour after doors closed, the Associated Press called the 2024 Iowa Caucuses for Donald Trump at just 7:31pm local time. With just eight counties reporting their results, the winner was determined by a combination of entrance polling and results from a survey of planned voters run by AP.\n\nThe eight counties with results in were, according to AP, similar in demographics and political ideology of other large precincts yet to be counted.\n\nThe AP made their call based on this data as well as analysis from elections experts, researchers, and professional race callers.\n\nUSA TODAY called the Iowa victory for Trump based on AP’s analysis and call.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nRon DeSantis spokesperson alleges early race calling is 'election interference'\n\nRon DeSantis' campaign immediately criticized Trump's quick victory on Monday.\n\n\"It is absolutely outrageous that the media would participate in election interference by calling the race before tens of thousands of Iowans even had a chance to vote.

And then if he does one point less than that – which would be an absolute drubbing – they’ll say, ‘He underperformed! There’s blood in the water!’”\n\n–Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nNikki Haley and Donald Trump Jr. give dueling speeches at Des Moines caucus site\n\nNikki Haley and Donald Trump Jr. addressed caucusgoers Monday night with competing speeches at Franklin Jr. High in Des Moines.\n\nHaley urged caucusgoers to choose “a new generational leader” to lead the party, saying “You don’t defeat Democrat chaos with Republican chaos.”\n\n“I trust all of you. Iowans do their homework. They know their issues,” she added. “But more than that, you’re patriotic, God-fearing, hardworking Americans and this is your chance to show the power of your voice. And this is your chance to lead the way to get our country back on track.”\n\nTrump spoke after Haley at the caucus site, telling the crowd that the country was in good shape when his father was president. He accused Haley of wanting to involve the U.S. military in conflicts around the world.\n\n“If they want to be in every war in the history of the world, they should vote for Nikki Haley,” he said. “If they want to get back to peace and prosperity the choice is clear that it’s Trump.”\n\n– Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nDonald Trump wins Iowa Caucus\n\nDonald Trump is projected to win the Iowa Caucus, according to the Associated Press and a slate of other outlets.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is my Iowa precinct number?\n\nIowans can find their designated caucus precinct through the Iowa Secretary of State website here.\n\nThey will be asked to enter their home ZIP code and address.

He went on to say that while some sites have had to change locations due to weather and icy roads, they have not had any closures.\n\n“I’m perfectly comfortable with what is going on right now,” Kaufmann said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump motorcade arrives at caucus site\n\nDonald Trump is set to speak at a caucus site at Horizon Events Center in Clive, Iowa, with his presidential motorcade arriving just after 7 p.m.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson also were to address caucusgoers there.\n\n– Galen Bacharie\n\nWhat time is it in Iowa right now?\n\nThe entire state of Iowa is in Central time.\n\nVoting will begin there at 7 p.m., meaning 8 p.m. Eastern time and 5 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nThe state’s GOP chair has said it could take hours to know the ultimate outcome of the Iowa caucus, potentially until midnight in the Hawkeye State.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRon DeSantis speaks at caucus sites in Dubuque, Iowa\n\nRon DeSantis blitzed the state on last time on Caucus Day and is ending an Iowa campaign that could make or break his presidential ambitions with pitches to voters at two Caucus sites in Dubuque.\n\nDeSantis was scheduled to speak at the Dubuque Roosevelt Middle School and Dubuque Table Mound Elementary School Caucus sites.\n\nHe also held campaign events in Seargent Bluff, Council Bluffs, and Cedar Rapids Monday.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nDoes every state have a caucus?\n\nNot every U.S. state holds a caucus.

Most of the state is under a windchill warning, continuing into Tuesday.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation reports most northern parts of the state are having normal winter conditions. In areas around Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, roads are covered in snow, slush and ice. Most roads in the southern part of the state are partially covered in snow with windy conditions expected to drift.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nWhy is the Iowa caucus so important for the election?\n\nFor 50 years, Iowans have gathered in school gymnasiums, community centers and family living rooms to kick off the nation's presidential nominating process, wielding their outsized influence to winnow and shape the field of contenders.\n\nAhead of each caucus, presidential candidates flood the state for months, if not years, to try to woo Iowans and gain their support. The national and international media descends on the state, ready to derive meaning from caucus night results.\n\n– Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWho is winning the election so far?\n\nDonald Trump has long led the Republican field, both in state and national surveys.\n\nIn a Real Clear Politics average of national Republican polls, Trump leads the group of GOP hopefuls with 61.4% Nikki Haley trails the former president with 12%, and DeSantis has garnered 10.7%\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIowa poll finds a Donald Trump conviction would be no big deal to most GOP caucusgoers\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is running an unprecedented campaign for the White House as he faces 91 criminal charges, bouncing between rallies and court appearances.\n\nDepending on how his four ongoing court battles proceed, he could be convicted of a crime before the general election in 2024. But just ahead of the first-in-the-nation Iowa Caucuses Monday, a majority of likely Republican caucusgoers say a Trump conviction would not affect their support, a new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll finds.\n\nSixty-one percent say a potential conviction “does not matter” in determining their general election support for him. Nineteen percent say a conviction would make them more likely to support Trump, and 18% say it would make them less likely. Two percent say they are not sure.\n\n–Galen Bacharier\n\nDonald Trump stays low-key on caucus night\n\nUnless you count social media, Donald Trump spent the daylight hours of Iowa caucus day out of the public eye.\n\nReporters did catch the former president briefly at a hotel, where he predicted that \"we're going to have a great night.\"The Trump campaign, meanwhile, set up a post-caucus party at the Iowa Events Center.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley on immigration, the economy\n\nNikki Haley is trailing frontrunner Donald Trump in the race for the Republican nomination for president by 34 percentage points, a recent Suffolk University poll showed.\n\nThe former U.N. ambassador has cited her deep knowledge of world affairs and record of economic growth as governor throughout her campaign. She stays true to traditional Republican views on reducing government regulation, calling for tax cuts and a balancing the nation's budget, even coining the slogan “it’s time for an accountant in the White House.”\n\nHaley has vocalized that she views China as America’s biggest adversary by calling to end trade relations and eliminating Chinese investment in U.S. companies and universities. She has also distinguished herself from some of her rivals with her unapologetic support in continuing to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia.\n\nAs the daughter of two Indian immigrants, Haley has vowed to improve legal immigration pathways and address the over 11 million estimated undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. As president, she pledges to crack down on illegal immigration at the U.S. southern border by once again requiring asylum seekers stay in the bordering country during their immigration proceedings and defunding cities that don’t enforce certain immigration laws.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nRon DeSantis's campaign promises\n\nRon DeSantis entered the 2024 race last May, casting himself as an alternative to Donald Trump and a staunch conservative not afraid to partake in culture war battles.\n\nDeSantis has marked his time as governor with sweeping education bills adding fire to the flame of culture wars surrounding gender identity and parents’ rights in the state and more. He has been outspoken in his opposition against critical race theory, signing legislation to ban it and saying he had a mission to dismantle the so-called “woke” agenda in schools.\n\nHis support for Ukraine stops short of sending troops overseas and instead proposes to send them to the southern border. DeSantis said he supports the use of deadly force to secure the area from some illegal immigrants entering through the Mexican border.\n\nOn the first day of his potential presidency, DeSantis said he would reverse President Joe Biden's signature \"Bidenomics\" policies by slashing government spending and extending Trump-era tax cuts to achieve a goal of 3% economic growth for the country.\n\nAs governor, DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nIs there a Democratic caucus in Iowa?\n\nYes, Democrats will hold a caucus in Iowa this year too, which President Joe Biden is currently expected to win.\n\nBut Democrats will not be choosing a presidential candidate in-person on Jan. 15. Instead, they will be conducting party business, including electing delegates and alternate delegates to county conventions, electing county central committee members and submitting platform resolutions for county conventions.\n\nIn an effort to simplify their process and make it more inclusive, Iowa Democrats have moved to an entirely mail-in system of casting their presidential preferences. Iowa Democrats can request an absentee presidential preference card, which functions like a ballot, that they can fill out and return to the state party until March 5, when results will be announced.\n\nThe last day to submit a request for a preference card is Feb. 19. Cards can be requested online at iowademocrats.org/caucus.\n\n− Des Moines Register staff\n\nDonald Trump on the issues\n\nDonald Trump is the clear frontrunner in the race to secure the Republican nomination for president, even as he faces 91 charges across four criminal cases.\n\nTrump has made the cases a central focus of his reelection campaign, arguing he is being targeted and pledging to use the powers of the federal government to investigate alleged wrongdoing by his political opponents.\n\nHe has also pledged to ramp up deportations and arrests at the southern border, institute a more isolationist foreign policy approach and rejuvenate the economy by increasing oil drilling and reducing regulations.\n\nTrump has slammed crime in cities and floated using the military to crack down on protestors. He is opposed to most legislation aimed at slowing climate change. In Iowa, he has been more moderate on abortion, calling a six-week abortion ban like one that passed in the state a “horrible thing.”\n\nTrump has largely left the Iowa Caucuses famous retail politicking to his competitors, making only 22 public visits to the state the entire campaign cycle. However, he remained 32 percentage points ahead of the rest of the field in a December Iowa Poll.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nVivek Ramaswamy's political views\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, 38, is aiming to win Monday's caucuses by holding the most events in Iowa, which he did by far — 323 scheduled public events, according to the Des Moines Register's Candidate Tracker.\n\nAn Ohio native, Ramaswamy is a biotech entrepreneur who founded Roivant Sciences. He has written multiple books, including “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam” which describes capitalism as an invisible force in politics. He has criticized what he calls a “national identity crisis,” instead touting “faith, patriotism and hard work.”\n\nRamaswamy has also often noted on the campaign trail that he is the first millennial to run for president as a Republican.\n\nHe has proposed shutting down the Department of Education and redistributing that money back to parents. On immigration, he supports deporting swaths of undocumented immigrants and has balked at a path to legal citizenship for them. Ramaswamy has repeatedly opposed a federal abortion ban but has supported six-week bans in individual states with exceptions for rape, incest and severe medical emergencies.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWhy Nikki Haley's supporters aren’t worried – but excited – about a potential second-place finish in Iowa\n\nRepublican presidential candidates made their final pushes in Iowa this weekend as the state gears up for Monday’s critical caucuses.\n\nNikki Haley enters caucus day with a 4-point lead ahead of Ron DeSantis, according to the latest Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom poll. But she still trails Iowa’s expected winner, former Donald Trump, by almost 30 percentage points.\n\nHer likely barrel towards a second-place finish is not concerning her most fervent supporters, who came out to see her in treacherous weather that swept below zero degrees.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nDonald Trump risks a loss in Iowa – even if he wins the 2024 caucus. Here's how.\n\nAfter years of investigations, indictments and other unprecedented legal and political problems, former President Donald Trump on Monday will start to find out whether actual voters will validate his huge leads in polls.\n\nAs the Iowa caucuses roll around Monday night, Trump and his aides say they hope to win by a record margin − and maybe even exceed 50% support.\n\nBut at the same time, they know anything short of a blowout will be seen by opponents as a sign of potential weakness in the former president's bid to reclaim the White House. Trump on Sunday seemed to both set his own goal of 50% support in Iowa, while also downplaying the potential target.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat is a caucus and how does it work?\n\nIn an election, a caucus refers to a group of party supporters meeting to choose their candidate in the months leading up to an election. They are run at the district, county or precinct level.\n\nCaucus participants give speeches and work to persuade other party members to support their candidates. Then, participants cast their votes either via secret ballot or as they're divided into groups based on who they support. Votes are counted in front of all caucus participants, tallied and sent to the state party.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nWhat’s the difference between a caucus and a primary?\n\nStates can choose whether to have a caucus or a primary to allow voters to choose their party’s nominee for president. In both cases, a candidate gets a number of delegates at the national party convention based on a percentage of the vote they received in that state.\n\nPrimaries are elections organized by the state, whereas caucuses are in-person meetings organized by political parties. Voters have to be a registered party member to participate.\n\nWhile primary voters fill out a secret ballot much like a general election, caucusgoers hear speeches from their neighbors on behalf of the candidates.\n\nAfterward, caucus attendees write down their preferred candidate on a slip of paper usually left blank. Each precinct tallies ballots and reports the total to the state party.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhen will Iowa caucus results be in?\n\nIowa Republicans are expecting a smooth night on Monday as they report caucus results from 1,657 precincts around the state, in contrast to issues that plagued Democrats' caucuses in 2020 and prevented reports of timely and accurate results.\n\nPatrick Stewart, a consultant for the Republican Party of Iowa, told reporters ahead of the 2024 contest that results from the smallest precincts, where only a few people show up to caucus, should be available about 30 minutes or so after their 7 p.m. start. Results from larger precincts should begin coming in over the next few hours.\n\nBut, historically, Iowa's caucus results haven't always been known right away on night.\n\n− Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nHow does the Iowa caucus work?\n\nIowa caucusgoers on Monday will hold a binding vote for the party's presidential nominee and elect delegates to county conventions.\n\nVoters can visit 1,657 caucus sites throughout Iowa.\n\nVoting is done with a secret ballot with no set list of candidates to choose from. Some caucus sites provide pre-printed names of major candidates and a write-in option but most of the time voters write the name of the candidate on a blank paper sheet.\n\nThe event does not require a minimum threshold to qualify for delegates. Delegates will attend this summer's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the Republican Party's official nominee will be chosen.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nYes, there's Iowa Caucus merch\n\nDes Moines-based retailer Raygun once again has merchandise related to the Iowa Caucuses ready for shoppers wanting to memorialize the day with a witty T-shirt. Raygun, a popular stop for Iowa Caucus-visitors, has several new sarcastic designs available for purchase online and in stores.\n\nThose include a T-shirt with the phrase, “What the hell is a caucus? And where the hell is Iowa?” Other designs include shirt “Election 2024: Welp, I guess we’re doing this again\" and a button that reads “Iowa Caucuses: They’re Letting Us Do This Again?!”\n\nOwner Mike Draper told the Des Moines Register last week that the designs were inspired by a quote overheard on a New York subway and emailed to Raygun.More merchandise will be dependent on what happens out of the Iowa Caucuses, Draper explained.In 2020, Raygun produced a shirt faster than the Iowa Democratic Party was able to announce results after widespread reporting problems caused a significant delay.\n\n– Paris Barraza\n\nWhen does the Iowa caucus end?\n\nThe Iowa Caucus doesn't have a pre-set time when election officials are expected to announce a winner. The caucuses will start at 7 p.m. CT, and officials and organizers across the state are expected to give regular updates on their progress.\n\nBut keep in mind that, historically, Iowa's caucus results haven't always been known right away on election night.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky, Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nWhat happens after the Iowa Caucus?\n\nThe Iowa Caucus is a pivotal presidential contest, but it leads into other primaries and caucuses across the country.

During a briefing with reporters Sunday morning after an event in Ankeny, Ramaswamy called Trump's attack bad campaign advice.\n\nRamaswamy, 38, told reporters that he respects \"the heck out of Donald Trump\" and would support Trump if he gets the Republican nomination.\n\n“It was probably an unfortunate move by his campaign advisers,” Ramaswamy said of Trump’s post. “I think he probably got bad advice. I don’t think friendly fire within our America First movement is helpful, and I’m not going to hold it against him. I’m not going to criticize him in response because he was an excellent president.\"\n\n-Philip Joens\n\nWho are the Republican candidates?\n\nRon DeSantis: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida.

The Iowa Poll offers a snapshot of the state of the race\n\nFormer president Donald Trump shows a commanding lead among Republican candidates, but a Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday showed Haley pulling ahead of DeSantis for the second-place spot for the first time. She has shown more upward momentum than any other candidate in the caucus cycle.\n\nIn addition his strides ahead of the other candidates, Trump may have more dedicated supporters. Poll results show that 82% of respondents who picked Trump as their first choice candidate said their mind was made up. For DeSantis and Haley supporters, that contingency came in at 64% and 63% respectively.\n\nStill, polls show man Republican caucusgoers aren't wild about MAGA, a movement referencing Trump's \"Make American Great Again\" slogan.

But before that can happen, space agencies like NASA need to ensure that the right conditions exist on Earth's sole natural satellite to establish lunar settlements.\n\nAnd one crucial component to make outposts on the moon feasible? The presence of water.\n\nFor years, NASA had been developing and preparing a rover designed to find and study water ice on the moon's mysterious south pole, where the substance is thought to be abundant. The half-billion dollar price tag for its Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, was thought to be well worth the investment to essentially conduct reconnaissance ahead of future crewed missions.\n\nThen in July, the unexpected happened: $450 million and multiple delays later, NASA scuttled the VIPER launch altogether.\n\nIn a press release, the U.S. space agency promised it was still dedicated to exploring the moon as part of its ambitious Artemis campaign – NASA's first lunar program since the Apollo era. But the setback came as China, a major lunar competitor, seeks to become a dominant spacefaring force in its own right.\n\nLast month, Chinese scientists analyzed soil samples that the nation's lunar probe brought back in 2020 to find water and other minerals in the soil – a potentially groundbreaking discovery that could have implications for lunar habitation.\n\nHere's what to know about the international race to study water on the moon ahead of crewed lunar missions.\n\nStudying the moon:What sustains the lunar exosphere? Being 'bombarded' by meteorites, study says\n\nWhat to know about NASA's VIPER\n\nSpace agencies across the world view the moon as a valuable destination due to the resources it provides to aid further deep space exploration.\n\nFor the United States, American astronauts have not set foot on the moon since the last Apollo mission in 1972. NASA's Artemis program hopes to return the nation back to the lunar surface in order to establish a base of operations ahead of crewed trips to Mars.\n\nThe water ice thought to be present in the unexplored lunar south pole, where NASA plans to one day land its astronauts, would not only help sustain them on the surface, but it also would be a source of hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel.\n\nAhead of those crewed missions, NASA had planned to send its robotic VIPER on a 100-day mission to explore the moon's south pole to locate, record and map images of water ice.\n\nVIPER was originally targeted for launch in late 2023, but the mission was first pushed back to 2024 before it was once again delayed until 2025. On July 17, NASA decided to cancel VIPER's journey due to rising costs, delays and potential disruptions to other commercial payload missions to the moon.\n\nIn a move protesting the decision, the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization promoting space exploration, circulated a letter signed by more than 1,000 individuals addressed to more than 200 congressional staffers. Calling NASA's decision \"both unprecedented and indefensible,\" the letter urged Congress to intervene, emphasizing the importance of VIPER for future lunar exploration.\n\nBut before NASA disassembles and reuses VIPER’s parts for other lunar missions, it has offered a chance to revive the rover's hopes of liftoff: Commercial space companies were given the chance to submit proposals to NASA by last Thursday with ideas for how the project could be saved.\n\nMeanwhile, the possibility remains that lawmakers in Washington, D.C. – who have already raised public concerns that China could beat the U.S. back to the moon – could intervene to reverse NASA's decision, CNN reported this week.\n\nChina lunar probe brings back soil samples\n\nAround the same time that NASA closed the door on VIPER, Chinese scientists who analyzed lunar soil samples collected by the nation's Chang’e-5 probe in 2020 unveiled the presence of water.\n\nPublished July 16 in the journal Nature, the findings were the first time that water in its molecular form, H2O, had been found in physical lunar samples.\n\nWhile it may be still too early to tell if the discovery will alter plans for future resource extraction or the location of lunar bases, it was the latest lunar breakthrough for a nation hoping to send its own astronauts to the moon by 2030.\n\nTwo months earlier, China had launched its Chang’e-6 lunar probe as it sought to become the first nation to ever retrieve samples from the far-side of the moon. That ambitious mission comes years after China completed its latest orbital space station, the Tiangong – a rival to the International Space Station, which will in the coming years be retired.\n\nWhat to know about Artemis and US' return to moon\n\nFortunately, VIPER is not the only NASA-led project designed to search out water on the moon ahead of the arrival of astronauts.\n\nFor instance, NASA has hired three companies to create preliminary designs for lunar vehicles that can be driven and can also operate autonomously on the moon's surface to allow for scientific tests and exploration even when astronauts are not there.\n\nNASA is also paying private companies billions of dollars to carry scientific payloads on private robotic landers bound for the moon, one of which –the Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment-1 (PRIME-1) – is scheduled to land at the south pole by the end of 2024 to search for water ice.\n\n“The agency has an array of missions planned to look for ice and other resources on the moon over the next five years,” Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. “Our path forward will make maximum use of the technology and work that went into VIPER.”\n\nArtemis has been mired in delays and controversy as elected officials and other aeronautics experts have expressed concerns about the scope and cost of the ambitious program.\n\nNASA had intended to launch its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon, ahead of a moon landing itself in 2025 for Artemis III. But both Artemis missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues, including a battery flaw on the vehicle that will ferry astronauts to the moon.\n\nIn the meantime, preparations have continued to ensure the program stays on track.\n\nIn mid-March, SpaceX conducted its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket that will one day ferry U.S. astronauts to the moon's surface. NASA had awarded the company a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the first commercial human lander for its Artemis III mission.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

But scientists at NASA are seeking to prevent such a catastrophe with the launch years ago of a probe that will allow them to study and prepare for how a solar storm could effect the planet's infrastructure.\n\nSo, how likely is it that humankind could face what many have deemed the \"internet apocalypse?\"\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nUFO hearing:Craving more aliens? Here are 3 UFO docuseries streaming now\n\nSolar flares lead to threatening solar storms\n\nSolar wind is created by the outward expansion of charged particles from the Sun's corona on the outermost atmosphere, according to NASA. Though much less dense than wind on Earth, it is much faster — typically blowing at speeds of one to two million miles per hour.\n\nDue to the winds that solar storms generate near the sun, the atmospheric impacts can potentially be felt on Earth. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections drive the storms, which release solar particles and electromagnetic radiation toward our planet, according to NASA.\n\nAs the frequency of coronal mass ejections increases at the height of its 11-year cycle, which NASA said is expected to be in 2025, electromagnetic activity on the sun peaks. What that so-called \"solar maxiumum\" means for us earthlings is that the risk for disruption on our planet increases.\n\nThe activity has the potential to cause geometric storms, which could hinder satellite signals, radio communications, internet and electrical power grids — resulting in a technological collapse.\n\nA small chance exists that the solar storm could trigger an outage\n\nThe chances of a storm triggering a cataclysmic internet outage are minimal, according to one study from two years ago. But the threat is still nothing to scoff at.\n\nA 2021 study — published by Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi, a computer science expert at the University of California, Irvine — concluded that a 1.6% to 12% chance exists that an extended disruption to the internet could occur within the next decade due to a solar storm.\n\nThe study goes on to estimate that a failure of that magnitude could cost the U.S. economy — where the risk of internet disruption is higher than in Asia — as much as $7 billion per day.\n\nTo the moon and back:Astronauts get 1st look at Artemis II craft ahead of lunar mission\n\nThis sort of disruption is not unprecedented\n\nA destructive solar storm in 1989 caused electrical blackouts across Quebec for 12 hours, according to NASA, plunging millions of Canadians into the dark and closing schools and businesses.\n\nBut it was in 1859 when the most intense solar storm on record, the Carrington Event, wreaked its havoc. The storm sparked fires at telegraph stations and prevented messages from being sent.\n\nA NASA probe could be key to staving off internet failure\n\nYears ago, the space agency released the Parker Solar Probe in an effort to avert what the Weather Channel referred to in a June report as the \"internet apocalypse.\"\n\nThe spacecraft launched in 2018 on a journey that in 2021 brought it close to the sun's surface, entering its upper atmosphere, the corona, where the solar wind is generated, according to NASA. It was there where the probe endured harsh conditions to gather vital information about the sun, which NASA researchers said lead to new insights about how solar winds reach supersonic speeds and impact the larger space weather system.\n\n\"Just as landing on the Moon allowed scientists to understand how it was formed, touching the very stuff the Sun is made of will help scientists uncover critical information about our closest star and its influence on the solar system,\" the agency said in a statement at the time.\n\nBecause of the probe mission, NASA also earlier this year learned that the solar wind could be largely fueled by small-scale jets of energy, known as “jetlets,” at the base of the corona.\n\n“The findings make it much easier to explain how the solar wind is accelerated and heated,” Craig DeForest, a solar physicist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in NASA's report. “We’re not finished with the puzzle yet, but this is a major step forward for understanding a central mystery of solar physics.”\n\nMore recently, NASA created a new computer model that combines artificial intelligence and satellite data that \"could sound the alarm for dangerous space weather\" like a cosmic tornado siren. The new technology can predict where an impending solar storm will strike Earth with a 30-minute warning, vital minutes that could be the time needed to prepare and prevent severe impacts on power grids and other critical infrastructure.\n\nAn international team of researchers at the Frontier Development Lab — a public-private partnership that includes NASA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Department of Energy — have been using artificial intelligence to look for connections between the solar wind and geomagnetic disruptions that wreak havoc on technology. An AI method called “deep learning,” allows researchers to trains computers to recognize patterns based on previous examples.\n\n\"There could one day be solar storm sirens that sound an alarm in power stations and satellite control centers around the world,\" NASA researchers predict, \"just as tornado sirens wail in advance of threatening terrestrial weather in towns and cities across America.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

It marked the fifth test to gauge whether authorities are prepared to defend Earth from space. This year's exercise was the first to include \"international collaborators on planetary defense.\"\n\nIn the hypothetical scenario, an asteroid collides with the Earth in 2038. The collision would have a 47% chance of affecting more than 1,000 people, and an 8% chance of affecting more than a million. It could strike a swath of cities across the U.S., Europe, and Africa, including Washington, Dallas, Madrid, and Algiers.\n\nIn the scenario, participants weren't told \"the asteroid’s size, composition, and long-term trajectory,\" according to the news release. Further observations about the asteroid would also hypothetically have to be delayed by at least seven months as the asteroid passed behind the Sun – \"a critical loss of time.\"\n\nEven with years to prepare, agencies would still have to work efficiently to respond to an approaching asteroid, Fast said. \"When you talk about planning a mission, any kind of spacecraft mission, it doesn't happen on a dime,\" she said.\n\n\"Even though 14 years sounds like a long time, it actually might not be when you think of developing missions,\" Fast added.\n\nSpace officials have only one tested method of heading off an asteroid on its way toward Earth – \"kinetic impact,\" or crashing a spacecraft into the asteroid to change its trajectory. In 2022, NASA crashed a spacecraft into Dimorphos, a small \"moonlet\" orbiting the asteroid Didymos around 6.8 million miles from Earth, successfully shortening the moonlet's orbit by 32 minutes, according to NASA.\n\nFast said scientists would need to tailor a space mission to respond to a particular asteroid collision scenario.\n\n\"It all depends on the asteroid,\" she said. \"A single kinetic impactor might work for a smaller asteroid but not for something much larger.\"\n\nSome participants were also skeptical that enough federal funding would be available to deal with the threat, according to the presentation.

The rocket that got the mission off the ground, the Space Launch System or SLS, became the most powerful rocket ever to reach orbit — boasting 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rockets behind the Apollo program.\n\nUpon reaching space, the Orion capsule, which flew empty save for a few test mannequins, captured stunning images of the Earth and moon. And Orion’s orbital path swung farther out beyond the far side of the moon than any spacecraft designed to carry humans has traveled before.\n\nNASA's Orion spacecraft captures an image of the \"Earth rise\" as it emerges from the far side of the moon. NASA\n\nThe trial run has paved the way for future Artemis missions, with the aim of returning humans to the lunar surface before mapping out a pathway for the first human spaceflight to Mars.\n\nWebb telescope reveals the invisible universe\n\nIn partnership with international space agencies, NASA not only made strides in its human exploration program, but it also notched steps forward in scientific endeavors. After decades of anticipation, the James Webb Space Telescope finally began observing the universe in July.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope captured this image of the spiral galaxy IC 5332. ESA/NASA/CSA/J. Lee\n\nSince then, the world’s most powerful space observatory has turned its gaze on planets, stars and galaxies in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nThe telescope has spied unseen aspects of the universe and previously hidden features, including the most distant galaxies ever observed. Webb has also shared new perspectives on some of astronomy’s favorite cosmic features and captured them in a new light, such as the Pillars of Creation.\n\nThe telescope’s images have already gone beyond what astronomers expected — and the best news: Webb is just getting started.\n\nObserving astronomical wonders for the first time\n\nThe Webb telescope, however, wasn’t the only space observatory expanding our understanding of deep space. The Hubble Space Telescope spied the most distant single star ever observed, faintly shining 28 billion light-years away. The star existed just 900 million years after the big bang created the universe, and its light has traveled nearly 13 billion years to reach Earth.\n\nAstronomers nicknamed the star Earendel, derived from an Old English word that means “morning star” or “rising light.”\n\nMeanwhile, astronomers used the Event Horizon Telescope to capture an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy for the first time. This first direct observation confirmed the presence of the black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, as the beating heart of the Milky Way.\n\nWhile black holes don’t emit light, the shadow of the cosmic object was surrounded by a bright ring — light bent by the gravity of the black hole.\n\nShifting an asteroid’s trajectory in space\n\nIn late September, NASA successfully completed the first test mission for planetary defense. The space agency slammed a spacecraft into Dimorphos, a small asteroid that orbits a larger space rock named Didymos — and yes, the collision was intentional. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, was a full-scale demonstration of deflection technology.\n\nThe rocky surface of Dimorphos was the last thing DART saw before crashing into the asteroid. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nNeither Dimorphos nor Didymos poses a threat to Earth, but the system was a perfect target to test a technique that may one day be used to protect the planet from an asteroid strike.\n\nThe DART mission marked the first time humanity intentionally changed the motion of a celestial object in space. The spacecraft altered the moonlet asteroid’s orbit by 32 minutes.\n\nNASA announces plans to study UFOs\n\nAnd that’s not all 2022 offered when it came to the study of unusual objects in the skies. In June, NASA announced it would delve into the mysteries surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena, more popularly known as unidentified flying objects or UFOs. The space agency later selected a team of experts across numerous disciplines — including astrobiology, data science, oceanography, genetics, policy and planetary science — for the task.\n\nOfficials at NASA aren’t suggesting aliens may be responsible for such phenomena. The goal is merely to take a serious look at the as-yet-unexplained — but much publicly debated — topic of UAPs and how they might be studied through a scientific lens.\n\n“Without access to an extensive set of data, it is nearly impossible to verify or explain any observation, thus the focus of the study is to inform NASA what possible data could be collected in the future to scientifically discern the nature of UAP,” according to a NASA news release.\n\nMilestones on Mars\n\nMeanwhile on the red planet, the InSight lander’s mission came to an end due to a surplus of dust on its solar panels (and no whirlwinds to vacuum them clean), but the stationary spacecraft made history in 2022. InSight detected the largest quake on Mars and captured the sounds of space rocks slamming into the planet — which created craters that revealed treasure troves of subsurface ice.\n\nThe NASA InSight lander acquired this image of the area in front of the spacecraft on Mars on December 11. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nAs InSight winds down, the Perseverance rover’s sidekick has continued to take to the Martian skies, above and beyond its original five-flight mission. The Ingenuity helicopter broke its own altitude record and has aced 37 flights on the red planet since April 2021. The little chopper has acted as an aerial scout for Perseverance, which collected an incredible diversity of Martian rock and sediment samples.\n\nNow, the rover is setting up a depot of samples that will be stored on the Martian surface. The samples will be retrieved and returned to Earth in 2033 via the ambitious Mars Sample Return program, which will send a lander and a duo of retrieval helicopters to the red planet later this decade.\n\nInterstellar meteor visits our cosmic neighborhood\n\nSpeaking of space rocks, a rare specimen traveled to Earth in 2014. But scientists just put its puzzle pieces together this year, and the discovery was announced in a US Space Command document.\n\nThe first known interstellar meteor to hit Earth crash-landed along the northeast coast of Papua New Guinea in January 2014.\n\nInterstellar meteors are space rocks originating from outside our solar system, such as ʻOumuamua, the first known interstellar object in our solar system that was detected in 2017.\n\nDebris from Space Shuttle Challenger disaster discovered\n\nTo be sure, NASA has seen many successes this year but also faced reminders of tragedy and disaster. Investigators set off in March to search suspected shipwreck sites in the Bermuda Triangle, a swath of the northern Atlantic Ocean said to be the site of dozens of shipwrecks and plane crashes, for a TV docuseries. But the crew stumbled upon something unexpected at another site off Florida’s east coast: a 20-foot-long (6-meter-long) piece of debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which broke apart shortly after takeoff in 1986 and killed all seven crew members aboard.\n\nDivers discovered a lost piece of the Space Shuttle Challenger while scouring the ocean floor off Florida's east coast. The History Channel/\"The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters\"\n\nIt was the first debris to be discovered since pieces from the shuttle washed ashore in 1996.\n\n“This discovery gives us an opportunity to pause once again, to uplift the legacies of the seven pioneers we lost, and to reflect on how this tragedy changed us,” Nelson, the NASA administrator, said in a statement. “At NASA, the core value of safety is — and must forever remain — our top priority, especially as our missions explore more of the cosmos than ever before.”\n\nNascent satellite system provides internet to war-torn Ukraine\n\nAs Russia launched its invasion in February and some areas of Ukraine lost internet access, a space-based internet system that barely existed a few years ago began to provide crucial connectivity.\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX designed and launched the system, called Starlink. It makes use of thousands of small satellites orbiting a few hundred miles above Earth. The satellites work in tandem to blanket the globe in internet connectivity, and all that’s needed to get online is an easy-to-use Starlink satellite dish.\n\nMusk and SpaceX sent thousands of those dishes to Ukraine. Though a funding controversy later ensued, the use of Starlink in the Eastern European country was hailed as a game changer in strategic communication for its military, allowing Ukraine to fight effectively, even as the ongoing war disrupted cellular phone and internet networks.\n\nFirst all-private mission to the space station\n\nStarlink, however, is one small part of SpaceX’s booming business. The company routinely launches not only satellites but also astronauts into space on NASA’s behalf. And this year, SpaceX even flew a few wealthy thrill-seekers to the International Space Station on a mission brokered by Axiom. The event marked the first space station mission that was fully paid for by paying customers and included only private citizens.\n\nThe AX-1 crew is shown (from left): Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría, Mark Pathy, Michael López-Alegría and Eytan Stibbe. Courtesy SpaceX\n\nThere were four crew members. Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee, was mission commander. And the three paying customers were Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe, Canadian investor Mark Pathy and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor.\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, launched on April 8 and was originally billed as a 10-day trip. Delays, however, extended the mission by about a week.\n\nAllowing private missions to the space station is part of NASA’s plan for more commercial activity in low-Earth orbit as it turns its focus to exploring deep space.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/09/why-is-the-april-2024-total-eclipse-a-big-deal/72853143007/", "title": "Why is the solar eclipse such a big deal? What makes April 8 so rare", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nThe sky is filled with breathtaking wonders, but one occurring on April 8 is causing people to plan trips in droves, prompting fears of snarled highways and generating headline after headline.\n\nThe total solar eclipse on April 8 is causing such a stir because the rare event — where the shadow of the moon will plunge a narrow strip of land into darkness in the middle of the day — is an astronomical experience like no other that will be unusually accessible to millions of people.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse will fall over more places in the U.S. than the total eclipse before and after it. And the broad length of the path of totality – where Americans have the best shot of getting a clear view – is \"much wider\" than it was for the eclipse in 2017, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nA total solar eclipse is also far more impressive than a lunar or an annular solar eclipse. During an annular eclipse, the moon covers the Sun but leaves an outside ring some call a \"ring of fire\" — it darkens the sky instead of plunging Earth into a night-like darkness, which is what happens during a total solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse – the appearance of a red moon – happens when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, according to NASA.\n\n\"The eclipse in 2024 could be even more exciting due to differences in the path, timing, and scientific research,\" reads a post from NASA. And like past similar natural phenomena, the eclipse is expected to elicit a strong emotional reaction from the people who see it, including from those who identify with its cultural significance.\n\nTotal solar eclipses over the US are rare: The next one won't happen for 20 years\n\nThe next visible total solar eclipse to cross over the U.S. after April will come in more than two decades on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nAnd that eclipse won't be as accessible as the 2024 one: The path of totality in 2044 will only touch the states of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. Another total eclipse will pass over the U.S. in 2045 that will be more accessible to Americans, including for people who live in California, Florida and Nevada.\n\nSolar eclipses are rare in part because they can only occur during a new moon and when \"the moon's orbit is tilted five degrees to Earth's orbit around the Sun,\" according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThis eclipse will pass over millions of people and be a short drive for millions more\n\nNASA estimates 215 million adults in the U.S. saw the 2017 solar eclipse either in person or electronically and even more people will likely see April's eclipse.\n\nThe eclipse's path of totality will pass over cities like Dallas, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York. And those places will attract sky gazers from all over the country.\n\nSearches for short-term Airbnb rentals around those areas have surged. Transportation officials in areas along the path of totality are warning residents and travelers that the eclipse could create dangerous and busy traffic conditions on roads around places with the best view.\n\nClouds could ruin total eclipse:This map shows how likely that is by city.\n\nTotal solar eclipses are awe-inspiring experiences\n\nThis year's total solar eclipse is expected to cause emotional reactions.\n\nA study of the social effects after an eclipse shows people who viewed the 2017 eclipse in its path of totality experienced feeling like part of a collective more than those who were outside of that path.\n\nResearchers found \"that astronomical events may play a vital collective function by arousing awe and social tendencies that orient individuals toward their collectives.\" They used Twitter, now X, data from millions of users to come to their conclusion.\n\nMore:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nAfter a total solar eclipse in Australia last year, The Guardian reported on a range of emotions among people who experienced the natural phenomena. One woman was near tears.\n\nThe silence and darkness during the eclipse will also create uncertainty for animals.\n\nInterpretations of a total solar eclipse vary across cultures, experts say.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse:Will bring a surreal silence and confuse all sorts of animals\n\n\"Across the ages, cultures from around the world have interpreted eclipses in myriad ways,\" reads a post from the San Francisco based nonprofit organization The Exploratorium. \"Sometimes eclipses cause fear, awe, or a sense that the cosmic order has fallen out of balance.\"\n\n\"A recurring and pervasive embodiment of the eclipse was a dragon, or a demon, who devours the Sun,\" reads the post, for example. The ancient Chinese and Incas, for example, used different tactics to \"help the Sun fight off the dragon\" during an eclipse, according to the nonprofit organization.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauarui, Eric Lagatta, Elizabeth Weise, Cheryl McCloud; USA TODAY Network\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

But perhaps the most exciting information will have to do with water. Three of Jupiter’s moons – Europa, Ganymede and Callisto – are home to large, underground oceans of liquid water that could support life.\n\nMeet Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto\n\nJupiter has dozens of moons. Four of them in particular are of interest to planetary scientists.\n\nIo, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto are, like Earth’s Moon, relatively large, spherical complex worlds. Two previous NASA missions have sent spacecraft to orbit the Jupiter system and collected data on these moons. The Galileo mission orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003 and led to geological discoveries on all four large moons. The Juno mission is still orbiting Jupiter today and has provided scientists with an unprecedented view into Jupiter’s composition, structure and space environment.\n\nThese missions and other observations revealed that Io, the closest of the four to its host planet, is abuzz with geological activity, including lava lakes, volcanic eruptions and tectonically formed mountains. But it is not home to large amounts of water.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nEuropa, Ganymede and Callisto, in contrast, have icy landscapes. Europa’s surface is a frozen wonderland with a young but complex history, possibly including icy analogs of plate tectonics and volcanoes. Ganymede, the largest moon in the entire solar system, is bigger than Mercury and has its own magnetic field generated internally from a liquid metal core. Callisto appears somewhat inert compared to the others, but serves as a valuable time capsule of an ancient past that is no longer accessible on the youthful surfaces of Europa and Io.\n\nMost exciting of all: Europa, Ganymede and Callisto all almost certainly possess underground oceans of liquid water.\n\nOcean worlds\n\nEuropa, Ganymede and Callisto have chilly surfaces that are hundreds of degrees below zero. At these temperatures, ice behaves like solid rock.\n\nBut just like Earth, the deeper underground you go on these moons, the hotter it gets. Go down far enough and you eventually reach the temperature where ice melts into water. Exactly how far down this transition occurs on each of the moons is a subject of debate that scientists hope to resolve with JUICE and Europa Clipper. While the exact depths are still uncertain, scientists are confident that these oceans exist.\n\nThe best evidence of these oceans comes from Jupiter’s magnetic field. Saltwater is electrically conductive. So as these moons travel through Jupiter’s magnetic field, they generate a secondary, smaller magnetic field that signals to researchers the presence of an underground ocean. Using this technique, planetary scientists have been able to show that the three moons contain underground oceans. And these oceans are not small – Europa’s ocean alone might have more than double the water of all of Earth’s oceans combined.\n\nAn obvious and tantalizing next question is whether these oceans can support extraterrestrial life. Liquid water is an important piece of what makes for a habitable world, but far from the only requirement for life. Life also needs energy and certain chemical compounds in addition to water to flourish. Because these oceans are hidden beneath miles of solid ice, sunlight and photosynthesis are out. But it’s possible other sources could provide the needed ingredients.\n\nOn Europa, for example, the liquid water ocean overlays a rocky interior. That rocky seafloor could provide energy and chemicals through underwater volcanoes that could make Europa’s ocean habitable. But it is also possible that Europa’s ocean is a sterile, inhospitable place – scientists need more data to answer these questions.\n\nUpcoming missions from ESA and NASA\n\nJUICE and Europa Clipper are set up to give scientists game-changing information about the potential habitability of Jupiter’s moons. While both missions will gather data on multiple moons, JUICE will spend time orbiting and focusing on Ganymede, and Europa Clipper will make dozens of close flybys of Europa.\n\nBoth of the spacecraft will carry a suite of scientific instruments built specifically to investigate the oceans. Onboard radar will allow JUICE and Europa Clipper to probe into the moons’ outer layers of solid ice. Radar could reveal any small pockets of liquid water in the ice, or, in the case of Europa, which has a thinner outer ice layer than Ganymede and Callisto, hopefully detect the larger ocean.\n\nMagnetometers will also be on both missions. These tools will give scientists the opportunity to study the secondary magnetic fields produced by the interaction of conductive oceans with Jupiter’s field in great detail and will hopefully give researchers clues to salinity and volumes of the oceans.\n\nScientists will also observe small variations in the moons’ gravitational pulls by tracking subtle movements in both spacecrafts’ orbits, which could help determine if Europa’s seafloor has volcanoes that provide the needed energy and chemistry for the ocean to support life.\n\nFinally, both craft will carry a host of cameras and light sensors that will provide unprecedented images of the geology and composition of the moons’ icy surfaces.\n\nMaybe one day, a spacecraft will be able to drill through the miles of solid ice on Europa, Ganymede or Callisto and explore oceans directly. Until then, observations from spacecraft like JUICE and Europa Clipper are scientists’ best bet for learning about these ocean worlds.\n\nWhen Galileo discovered these moons in 1609, they were the first objects known to directly orbit another planet. Their discovery was the final nail in the coffin of the theory that Earth – and humanity – resides at the center of the universe. Maybe these worlds have another humbling surprise in store.\n\nMike Sori, Assistant Professor of Planetary Science, Purdue University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The collision shattered windows and pelted startled residents with shards of glass and debris. In the aftermath, the world was transfixed by extraordinary videos of the huge fireball as it streaked across the sky. Many wondered, why on earth did no one see it coming?\n\n\"The odds of asteroid impacts are much higher than people realize,\" said Ed Lu, a former astronaut and chief executive officer of the B612 Foundation, which searches for asteroids that could potentially hit the Earth and cause human devastation. He said that there is a 30 percent chance of a city-destroying asteroid hitting the Earth in the next 100 years.\n\nThe primary source of meteors like the one that exploded over Russia is the asteroid belt between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. The gravitational pull of giant Jupiter causes space debris to collide repeatedly, breaking into smaller and smaller fragments that became asteroids.\n\nJupiter interacts with these asteroids gravitationally, periodically throwing them out of their orbit and sending them further out into the reaches of the solar system. Or they can be tossed inward, toward the sun and Earth. These projectiles are the asteroids that pose a threat to Earth.\n\nIt's only recently that scientists even knew the scope of the threat posed by asteroids. \"Fifty years ago, scientists, when they looked at the moon, they thought those craters were volcanic,\" said James Green, director of planetary science at NASA. Now, common knowledge holds that most of the craters on the moon were caused by asteroids. If they can hit the moon, they can hit the Earth, too.\n\nBut how will we know where the asteroids are in space? That's a question that has plagued scientists for a generation. Computer models were able to give estimates of how many asteroids were out there and with what frequency they were likely to hit the Earth. But simulations can't always tell us where actual asteroids are, nor when they will show up. Unlike stars or planets, asteroids are incredibly difficult to see—most look like dark lumps of rock or metal set against the shadowy backdrop of space.\n\nIn 1998, NASA began searching for potentially dangerous \"near-Earth objects\" such as asteroids and comets. The agency identified more than 90 percent of objects that are larger than one kilometer, and at least 90 percent of debris that spans more than 140 meters. Luckily, the trajectories of those asteroids aren't due to menace Earth for another 200 years.\n\nThe hunt is now on for smaller asteroids that can still cause immense amounts of damage. So far, scientists have found only a fraction of the city-destroying asteroids that are larger than 40 meters. There are estimated to be about 1 million of them in our area of the solar system.\n\nOne of those caused the Tunguska event in 1908. An asteroid approximately 37 meters in diameter exploded over the Siberian Wilderness, leveling more than 1,000 square miles of forest, an area larger than Washington, D.C., or New York. The recent Chelyabinsk meteor, by comparison, was only 17 meters in diameter and still caused considerable damage.\n\nThe likelihood of one of these city-killing asteroids actually hitting a city is low (most of the Earth is covered by oceans, not major metropolitan areas) but the effects could be devastating regardless. If an asteroid of that size did hit the ocean, it would certainly have the potential to cause a tsunami, but scientists are still trying to create accurate models for such an event.\n\nTo try to prevent such an incident, the nonprofit B612 Foundation is currently raising $450 million to send the Sentinel Space Telescope to orbit. Designed to search for asteroids, the telescope will be positioned in a way that mirrors Venus' orbit. The launch is planned for 2017-18.\n\nThe Sentinel is an infrared telescope that will search for heat signatures of asteroids, instead of relying on the faint reflections of sunlight cast off an asteroid's surface. Once in place, the telescope should be capable of locating nearly all of the million or so asteroids within range of Earth. By mapping their trajectories, scientists will be able to figure out which asteroids are capable of doing damage to the Earth.\n\n\"We're going to have far and away the most capable telescope in the world, and that's because it has been optimized for finding asteroids,\" Lu said.\n\nLu compares the need for these asteroid-detecting programs to the need for hurricane preparedness in cities like New Orleans.\n\nCity leaders and the Army Corps of Engineers once claimed that it was unnecessary to fix levees for 100-year floods. Then Hurricane Katrina struck.\n\nIn the same way, we need to prepare now for an asteroid event. \"A hurricane is really child's play compared to an asteroid impact,\" Lu said. \"You can't just hope for the best every year.\"\n\nIn August, NASA announced plans to reactivate the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and take up the hunt for asteroids. While not as specialized as the proposed Sentinel, the WISE telescope has already had asteroid-hunting success as part of a project called NEOWISE. The telescope was originally built to create a map of the night sky but has since been tasked with finding near-Earth objects. The NEOWISE mission ended in 2011. In the next mission, NASA hopes the telescope will locate 150 more near-Earth objects.\n\nNASA also announced the Asteroid Grand Challenge. The agency hopes this program will be an interdisciplinary venture that brings together private businesses, amateur astronomers, space agencies and universities around the world to tackle the threat of asteroids.\n\n\"This is one of the only natural disasters that we have the ability to solve. We have the ability to prove that we are smarter than the dinosaurs,\" said Jason Kessler of NASA's Office of the Chief Technologist.\n\nKessler hopes to inspire people around the world by merging two topics that are almost universally beloved in science classrooms: dinosaurs and space.\n\n\"This is a marrying of the two. We can prove that we are smarter than the dinosaurs, and take our fate into our own hands,\" Kessler said. \"They (the dinosaurs) didn't have the technology to defend themselves from planetary threats of this nature.\" j\n\nNASA's ASTEROID RETRIEVAL MISSION\n\nThe NASA plan to lasso an asteroid might seem to be a punchline to a space cowboy joke, but the people at work on the program are serious about it.\n\n\"The president has set an objective that Mars is our ultimate destination, and asteroids are along that path,\" said James Green, NASA's director of planetary science.\n\nInstead of hunting one down in the asteroid belt, the plan would be to find an asteroid in near-Earth orbit, target it and bring it between the Earth and the moon. It would be located and harnessed initially by an unmanned spacecraft. Once securely in place between the Earth and the moon, astronauts would be sent up to visit the asteroid, taking samples and bringing them back to Earth. The exercise might seem frivolous, but the astronauts would be practicing with technologies and developing skills essential to any future Mars missions, when explorers would have to rely on resources gathered from asteroids or the surface of Mars.\n\nBudget decisions made by Congress this summer have stymied work on NASA's Asteroid Retrieval Mission.\n\nThe House Appropriations committee, concerned about the feasibility and cost of such a mission, called the proposed mission \"premature\" and refused to include any budget increases associated with the mission. They recommended that NASA \"complete further concept studies, pursue the support of Congress through the authorization process and line up support from potential international partners before seeking new resources to carry out the mission.\"\n\nThis article is excerpted from USA TODAY's special publication NASA's Future in Space, available on newsstands or at nasa.usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/26/nasa-announce-an-exciting-new-discovery-moon-monday/6039412002/", "title": "NASA's moon water discovery: Find on sunlit part has big implications", "text": "Water has been discovered on the sunlit surface of the moon, NASA announced Monday, an important revelation that indicates water may be distributed across the lunar surface – and not just limited to its cold, shadowed places such as the poles.\n\nThis is good news for astronauts at future lunar bases who could tap into these resources for drinking and rocket fuel production.\n\n“We had indications that H2O – the familiar water we know – might be present on the sunlit side of the moon,” Paul Hertz, director of the astrophysics division in the science mission directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington, said in a statement. “Now we know it is there. This discovery challenges our understanding of the lunar surface and raises intriguing questions about resources relevant for deep space exploration.”\n\nWater is a precious resource in deep space and a key ingredient of life as we know it. Whether water on the moon is easily accessible for use as a resource remains to be determined, NASA said.\n\n\"We don’t know yet if we can use it as a resource, but learning about water on the moon is key for our Artemis exploration plans,\" NASA tweeted.\n\nThe Artemis program is a plan to send the first woman and next man to the lunar surface in 2024.\n\n\"If we can use the resources at the moon, then we can carry less water and more equipment to help enable new scientific discoveries,\" said Jacob Bleacher, chief exploration scientist for NASA’s human exploration and operations mission directorate.\n\nThe discovery was made by NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), which analyzes the atmospheres of distant planets and moons.\n\nDubbed the world’s largest airborne observatory, SOFIA is a modified 747 that flies high in the Earth's atmosphere to provide its nearly 9-foot telescope with a clear view of the universe and objects in our solar system, NASA said.\n\nFlying above 99% of our atmosphere’s obscuring water vapor, SOFIA observes in infrared wavelengths and can detect phenomena impossible to see with visible light.\n\nScientists believe water on the moon came from comets, asteroids, interplanetary dust, the solar wind or even lunar volcanic eruptions. They will have a better idea of the sources “if we can get down on the surface and analyze samples of the ice,” the University of Colorado’s Paul Hayne said.\n\nThe lead researcher, Casey Honniball, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said at a news conference that she wanted to make it clear the SOFIA study had not found puddles on the moon. Rather, the identified hydrogen and oxygen molecules are so far apart they are neither in liquid or solid form, she said.\n\nThe findings were published Monday in a pair of studies in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/26"}]}

From Brad Pitt to Laura Dern to Joaquin Phoenix to Awkwafina, many of film and TV’s biggest stars took home the top honors. What else went down? \"1917\" surprised with a Golden Globe win for best drama, beating out \"Joker\" and \"The Irishman;\" Jennifer Lopez didn’t win her category, and her dress also failed to impress; Host Ricky Gervais didn’t cause as much of a ruckus as expected; and “Succession” scored wins for best drama series and a best actor win for lead Brian Cox.

The crash occurred at about 3:30 a.m. ET Sunday near mile marker 86 on the westbound side of the highway. Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson Stephen Limani said the bus was struck by two tractor-trailers, then another truck and a passenger car.

And the toll has been high: At least 24 people killed and 2,000 homes destroyed. Authorities in New South Wales estimated that 500 million birds, reptiles and other animals have died in the blazes. Sunday brought a brief respite with calmer winds and a break in the heat. But, authorities warn the fires will continue their rampage for months.\n\nNicole Kidman and Keith Urban pledge $500,000 to fight Australia's wildfires.\n\nNFL playoffs: Patriots go home early, Brady calls retirement ‘unlikely’\n\nThe NFL playoffs kicked off with two nail-biting games on Saturday. First, a back-and-forth, overtime thriller saw the Houston Texans overcome a 16-0 third quarter deficit to beat the Buffalo Bills, 22-19. Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson orchestrated a 73-yard game-winning drive in overtime to add to the Bills’ history of postseason heartbreaks. The New England Patriots were shown up by running back Derrick Henry and the Tennessee Titans in the Saturday night game, losing by a final of 20-13. After the game, legendary Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said he’s uncertain on his future, but called retirement “pretty unlikely.” The New Orleans Saints' title hopes were dashed Sunday in the biggest upset of the wild card round. The Minnesota Vikings used quarterback Kirk Cousins' overtime touchdown pass to escape New Orleans with a 26-20 win.\n\nP.S. Like this round up of stories? We send it to inboxes every afternoon.

Starring Van Johnson, John Hodiak, Ricardo Montalban and George Murphy.\n\nMore: Meet the division that fought Nazis, terrorists in the last 75 years\n\nScreaming Eagles (1956)\n\nThe 101st Airborne prepares for the WWII Normandy Invasion and the air-drop into France. Starring Tom Tyron and Jan Merlin, but with appearances by several up-and-coming actors, including Robert Blake and Edward G. Robinson.\n\nThe Longest Day (1962)\n\nThis John Wayne classic recounts the D-Day landings at Normandy by the 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne Divisions.

The film, based on the novel by Cornelius Ryan, won two Academy Awards.\n\nA Bridge Too Far (1977)\n\nThis epic war film directed by Richard Attenborough recounts the Allied forces' Operation Market Garden, including the role of the 101st Airborne. The ensemble cast includes James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Elliott Gould, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford and more. The movie, like \"The Longest Day,\" is based on the book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan. It took a hard look at Allied failures during World War II.\n\nHamburger Hill (1987)\n\nOne of a series of 1980s films that tackled the Vietnam War experience, this recounts the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne assault on Ap Bia Mountain, what was later designated \"Hamburger Hill,\" for reasons you can imagine. It stars Dylan McDermott, Steven Weber, Courtney B. Vance, Don Cheadle and Michael Boatman. Definitely not an easy one to watch, and, like Vietnam itself, no one comes out unscathed.\n\nSaving Private Ryan (1998)\n\nSet during the Normandy Invasion, this fictional portrayal of WWII by Steven Spielberg has Tom Hanks playing a Ranger captain on a mission to bring home 101st Airborne Pfc. James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who has lost three brothers to war. The film opens with the D-Day invasion and follows the action as troops move through France. It took home five Academy Awards.\n\nBlack Hawk Down (2001)\n\nDirected by Ridley Scott, this film recounts the Battle of Mogadishu, in which a 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment helicopter was shot down in Somalia.

While not technically a movie, it's one of the best-known depictions of the 101st on screen, and it won Emmy and Golden Globe awards.\n\n12 Strong (2018)\n\nThis film by Jerry Bruckheimer, based on the book “Horse Soldiers” by Doug Stanton, tells the story of the Green Berets of 5th Special Forces Group who entered Afghanistan immediately after the 9/11 attacks. Fifth SFG is based at Fort Campbell, and they had assistance in Afghanistan from the 160th SOAR, also from Fort Campbell.

Major movie releases will include a star-studded \"Superman,\" several offerings from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a third installment of the \"Avatar\" franchise at the end of the year.\n\nThe year will also see major criminal trials, including those of Diddy and Luigi Mangione, and a potential ban on one of the most popular social media apps in the country.\n\nHere's some of what you can expect in 2025.\n\nThe demure social media trends of 2024:'Who TF Did I Marry,' brat summer and Moo Deng\n\nJimmy Carter's funeral\n\nOn Sunday, former president and Nobel Prize winner Jimmy Carter died at age 100 in Plains, Georgia, in the home he shared with his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, who died in November 2023.\n\nFuneral services for the former president will be held in Georgia and Washington, D.C., from Saturday, Jan. 4, through Thursday, Jan. 9.\n\nIn Americus, Georgia, a motorcade will pick up Carter's casket and progress to Plains, then Atlanta, where Carter will lie in state for mourners to pay respects. He will eventually make his way to the U.S. Capitol and the Washington National Cathedral, where a national funeral service will be held.\n\nFlags will also remain at half-staff for 30 days after his death, a timeline that overlaps Trump's inauguration.\n\nTikTok ban?\n\nThis spring, President Joe Biden passed legislation that would ban the hugely popular social media app TikTok in January if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, does not sell it. The legislation has been in the works for several years because of fears that TikTok compromises national security.\n\nIf ByteDance does not sell TikTok by Jan. 19, the app will be illegal for distribution through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Internet service providers also will be required to make the app inaccessible on U.S. internet browsers.\n\nIn a last-minute decision, however, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments from TikTok and its parent company about why a ban could be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court is set to review TikTok's arguments on Jan. 10, just over a week before the ban could be put in place.\n\nThough China has been vocal about its opposition to selling TikTok, billionaire Frank McCourt has expressed his interest in purchasing the U.S. portion of the platform with a group of associates. McCourt, founder of Project Liberty and executive chairman of McCourt Global, said a consortium of associates has verbally pledged up to $20 billion for the purchase.\n\nBut if McCourt purchased TikTok, it would be only the U.S. portion and would not include TikTok's algorithm, which China sees as its intellectual property, McCourt told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" earlier this month.\n\nPresidential inauguration of Donald Trump\n\nIn January, Trump will begin his second, nonconsecutive term as the 47th president of the United States.\n\nTrump will officially take over executive control of the country amid highly choreographed ceremonies on Jan. 20, which coincides with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nIt starts in the morning when Biden is expected to welcome Trump to the White House, as is custom. Around noon, the chief justice of the United States will administer the oath of office in a public ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Trump will then deliver his inaugural address.\n\nAfter the swearing-in, a traditional parade moves along Pennsylvania Avenue, featuring military bands, civic organizations and representatives from across the nation.\n\nThe day ends with inaugural balls and receptions.\n\nCriminal trials: Diddy, Luigi Mangione\n\nAmerican rapper and superstar Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will face the start of his federal sex crimes trial on May 5. He was indicted on sex trafficking and racketeering charges and faces claims from more than 100 accusers.\n\nCombs was arrested at a Manhattan hotel Sept. 16 and arraigned the next day. He has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty on all federal criminal charges, despite mounting civil lawsuits over the past year. He has been incarcerated in the Special Housing Unit at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center since his arrest.\n\nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the court the prosecution's case would last at least three weeks. The defense case is expected to take a week, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said.\n\nLuigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson to death on Dec 4, also faces a criminal trial in 2025. Mangione has been charged in federal court, Pennsylvania state court and New York state court.\n\nIn the New York case, Mangione faces 11 charges, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, two counts of second-degree murder, including one as an act of terrorism, and a slew of weapons charges. In Pennsylvania, he was charged with forgery and illegally possessing an unlicensed gun, among others, while his federal charges include murder and interstate stalking.\n\nThe federal charges could bring a death sentence if Mangione is convicted.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\n\n'Wicked' Part 2\n\nThe second part of the two-act release, called “Wicked: For Good,” is set for release on Nov. 21 − one year (minus a day) after the first installment.\n\n\"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: Part 2\" were shot back-to-back from December 2022 to January 2024, according to Forbes, which means the second installment of \"Wicked\" has already been filmed.\n\nThe third Avatar installment\n\nThe third installment of the \"Avatar\" series, \"Avatar: Fire and Ash,\" hits theaters Dec. 19, three years after \"Way of Water\" was released and just about 15 years after the original 2009 film.\n\nLike \"Way of Water,\" \"Fire and Ash\" will introduce viewers to a whole new tribe of Na'vi called \"The Ash People,\" according to multiple outlets, including Parade and Variety. As the name suggests, this tribe has a culture that revolves around fire, a direct contrast to the water tribe of the previous film.\n\n“You’ll see a lot more Pandora that you never saw before,” director James Cameron told Variety.\n\nStars include Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Kate Winslet and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nMore movie and TV releases\n\nThere is no shortage of media releases to anticipate in 2025, from revamps of classic shows to long-awaited new seasons and big-screen premiers.\n\nDates TBD: “Stranger Things,\" \"You,\" “Squid Game\" Season 3 (Season 2 arrived in December), \"Wednesday,\" \"Monster,\" \"The Last of Us,\" “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” “Welcome to Derry,\" “The Handmaid’s Tale,\" “What Not to Wear” reunion, “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" \"The Bear\" and “Welcome to Wrexham.\"\n\nJan. 2: A modern revamp of \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" will air on ABC.\n\nJan. 27: \"The Bachelor\" returns to ABC.\n\nFeb. 14: Season three of \"Yellowjackets\" comes to Parmount+ with Showtime.\n\nFeb 16: \"White Lotus\" returns to HBO.\n\nFeb 26: Season 48 of \"Survivor\" begins on CBS.\n\nApril 22: \"Andor\" Season 2 comes to Disney+.\n\nSpace exploration\n\nSpace agencies like NASA and SpaceX have some major missions planned for the upcoming year.\n\nElon Musk is pushing for SpaceX to significantly ramp up Starship test launches in 2025, a proposal that would quintuple the flight tests of the SpaceX megarocket from five demonstrations in 2024 to 25 next year. Musk's request would need approval from federal regulators.\n\nSpaceX envisions the powerful spacecraft being a fully reusable transportation system that can carry humans and cargo to Earth's orbit, the moon and even Mars. Though SpaceX is rapidly preparing for its flight test, the company has not yet announced a target date.\n\nAlso, a commercial lunar lander will soon be heading to the moon with a fleet of scientific instruments for a $93.3 million NASA mission to study the moon's environment before humans return.\n\nThe lander's instruments will examine the lunar subsurface and global navigation satellite abilities, among other questions. The data NASA hopes to collect also should provide insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect Earth.\n\nNASA's cutting-edge SPHEREx telescope is also on the cusp of launching on a mission to solve some of the universe's oldest mysteries – including how it came to be. The telescope, which has a $242 million price tag, was developed to survey more than 450 million galaxies and 100 million stars in our own Milky Way. Some galaxies it will observe are so distant that their light has taken 10 billion years to reach Earth.\n\nThe two-year mission will launch no earlier than late February.\n\nLikewise, the first step in establishing the world’s first commercial space station will come as early as August. Vast, a space company based in Long Beach, California, announced in 2023 that it plans to launch its space station, called Haven-1.\n\nThe mission will be quickly followed by Vast-1, the first human spaceflight mission to Haven-1. The four-person crew will ride a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to dock with the station for up to 30 days while orbiting Earth, according to Vast.\n\nBoeing Starliner astronauts to return on SpaceX vehicle\n\nNASA's Starliner astronauts will make their long-awaited homecoming to Earth as early as the end of March.\n\nSuni Williams and Butch Wilmore weren't supposed to be at the International Space Station beyond a few days in June when they reached the orbital outpost on the inaugural flight test for Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. But their return was delayed multiple times until NASA finally decided in August that the safest route would be to send the pair back to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon vehicle.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner undocked in September without the astronauts and landed in the New Mexico desert.\n\nThe Starliner astronauts were set to return in February with two spacefarers who are part of a SpaceX mission called Crew-9. But earlier in December, NASA opted to delay that return until late March to give time to ready the Dragon vehicle that will ferry their replacements to the space station.\n\nNo historic eclipse, but more space events to come\n\nThe year will begin with a \"planet parade\" during which Venus, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars all shine brightly every night after sunset in January and February. In January and February, look for Venus and Saturn in the southwestern sky and Jupiter and Mars toward the southeast.\n\nOn Jan. 13, a lunar occultation of Mars will be visible in the U.S. A lunar occultation occurs when the moon passes in front of a star or planet and blocks its light for about an hour before moving on its way around the Earth.\n\nMarch 13-14 will see the only total lunar eclipse visible from the United States in 2025. A total lunar eclipse occurs when Earth comes directly between the sun and full moon and casts a shadow onto the lunar surface.\n\nOn April 22-23 and Oct. 21-22, the annual Lyrid and Orionid meteor showers will appear in the night sky.\n\nThe year's lunar events will wrap on Nov. 5 with a supermoon.\n\nAward shows\n\nOne consistent we know we can look forward to every year without fail: awards season. This year's shows will play out on the following schedule:\n\nSunday, Jan. 5: 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 2: 67th Grammy Awards\n\nSaturday, Feb. 8: Director and Producer Guild of America Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 16: BAFTA Film Awards\n\nSunday, Feb. 23: 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\nSunday, March 2: 97th Academy Awards\n\nSeptember (TBD): 77th Emmy Awards\n\nContributing: J.
