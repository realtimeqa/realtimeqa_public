The US Mint won't make any more. Here's ...", "text": "Change is coming to how we make change, thanks to the impending demise of the penny.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered the Treasury Department, back in February, to stop minting pennies. His argument – that pennies cost more to mint than they are worth – echoed a January 2025 recommendation from the then-Elon Musk-directed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to put an end to the penny because producing 4.5 billion pennies in Fiscal Year 2023 cost taxpayers more than $179 million.\n\nThat’s not an alternative fact: The U.S. Mint said in its annual report that each penny costs 3.69 cents to make.\n\nAlready, some stores have begun running short of pennies and have had to round cash transactions up or down to the nearest five cents when customers don’t have exact change. The coin shortage has even hit some McDonald’s locations.\n\n“Some businesses are asking cash-paying customers to voluntarily round up for donations to avoid needing pennies to make change and to stay compliant with state and local laws, while other places are rounding down for everyone (not just cash payers),” said Brandon Sheridan, associate professor of economics at Elon University, in a statement.\n\nRounding down will “become costly for businesses over time,” Sheridan said. Retailers have told congressional leaders a federal law is needed because at least 10 states (and some localities) have laws prohibiting rounding transactions to the nearest nickel.\n\nThousands of retailers and stores across the United States cannot get pennies, “leaving businesses to try to sort out the complicated issues that have arisen as the coins have become scarce,” said Austen Jensen, senior executive vice president for government affairs for Retail Industry Leaders Association, in a statement to USA TODAY. “Congress understands the magnitude of the problem and we’re optimistic once the government reopens, lawmakers will move to take up this issue and provide businesses with the needed clarity.”\n\nThe challenges go beyond individual cash transactions. Retailers need to assess how the currency changes may affect their point-of-sale systems and sales tax calculation, collection, and reporting, noted a June 2025 brief from accounting, tax and consulting firm PwC. “The lack of enforceable federal or state rules on rounding and transaction processing creates compliance risks, particularly for multistate operations. Inconsistent practices could increase sales tax audit exposure risk,” it read.\n\nAre pennies going away? Can I still use pennies?\n\nEven though the U.S. Mint has stopped making pennies, they won’t go away anytime soon. That’s because there are about 250 billion pennies in circulation, according to the American Banking Association.\n\n“There will still be tons and tons of pennies out there, but their circulation will slow” because nearly two-thirds of the about 165 Federal Reserve coin terminal facilities, which circulate coins, are no longer taking or distributing pennies, said Bill Maurer, dean of the School of Social Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, and director of UCI’s Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion.\n\n“As those coin terminals close to pennies, the circulation of pennies is slowing down. Pennies will remain legal tender, however,” Maurer said in an email exchange.\n\nBut the penny shortage “will likely accelerate the decline of penny usage,” Sheridan said. “I also expect more and more businesses to move to a cashless model in the next 10 years, while strongly encouraging card usage in the interim. This would negate the need for businesses to round transactions to the nearest nickel.”\n\nSpeaking of nickels, that coin’s days may be numbered, too. Each nickel costs more than 13 cents to produce, the U.S. Mint says.\n\nBut there’s a reason it may not happen soon, Sheridan said. “The cost to consumers of rounding transactions to the nearest nickel is estimated to be around $6 million, the cost to round to the nearest dime is closer to $56 million,” he said. “Therefore, the cost-benefit analysis for taxpayers is not nearly as clear for nickels as pennies.”\n\nWho first proposed getting rid of pennies?\n\nTrump wasn’t the first to suggest pitching the penny. U.S. Representatives Jim Kolbe of Arizona and James Hayes of Louisiana co-sponsored The Price Rounding Act of 1989, which would have done away with the penny and required prices to be rounded to the nearest five cents. Neither that bill nor several subsequent bills were passed.\n\nAmong the other proposed measures: the Currency Optimization Innovation and National Savings (COINS) Act in 2017, proposed by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Mike Enzi, R-Wyoming. That legislation proposed not minting pennies for 10 years, after which the Government Accountability Office would study whether to resume minting them or maintain the suspension, according to The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nWhen were the first pennies made?\n\nThe first pennies, which the U.S. Mint began making after its establishment in 1792, featured an image of a woman representing liberty. In 1909, in honor of President Abraham Lincoln’s 100th birthday, Lincoln became the first president to be featured on U.S. coins.\n\nAre pennies more valuable now?\n\nNot necessarily. Headlines this spring hyping the “Lincoln Wheat Penny Worth $124M You Could Have at Home” had many folks sifting through their coin stockpiles. But most pennies are worth one cent or possibly a bit more.\n\nThe most valuable pennies – they are very rare, but could still be in circulation – are 1943 copper Lincoln wheat pennies. A few of them were produced accidentally when the U.S. mints were supposed to use zinc to save copper for the World War II effort, John Feigenbaum, publisher of rare coin price guide Greysheet, told USA TODAY recently.\n\nDepending on their condition, any 1943 Lincoln wheat pennies still circulating would likely be worth between $100,000 and $250,000, said Feigenbaum, who is also the executive director of the Professional Numismatists Guild (PNG), a nonprofit organization composed of many of the nation’s rare coin experts.\n\nWhile you may not have any rare, valuable pennies, those coins sitting in cups, drawers and various containers around your house do have value. The typical household has $60 to $90 in neglected coins at home, according to the Federal Reserve. You can take them to the bank or a coin-exchange kiosk to give yourself a nice monetary prize.\n\nContributing: Daniel de Visé\n\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach spoke at the event and said the last time the U.S. discontinued a coin was the half cent in 1857, ABC News reported.\n\nThe move comes 9 months after President Donald Trump ordered the discontinuation of the penny. But why, exactly, did he do so?\n\nWhy are pennies being discontinued?\n\nTrump ordered the Treasury Department to stop minting pennies as a budget-cutting measure.\n\n\"The Department of the Treasury and President Trump no longer believe the continued production of the penny is fiscally responsible or necessary to meet the demands of the American public,\" Beach said Wednesday.\n\n\"The cost savings of ending penny production will save the American taxpayer approximately $56 million a year in just production cost alone,\" he said.\n\nPresident Trump wrote on Truth Social in February that minting pennies costs more than 2 cents.\n\n\"This is so wasteful,\" he wrote.\n\nHow much does it cost to make a penny?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Mint's annual report, it takes about 3.7 cents to produce and distribute one penny, a 20% increase from the previous year. The increase has been partly driven by the rising costs of metals like zinc and copper, according to the report.\n\nCan I still use pennies?\n\nAlthough the U.S. Mint will no longer create new pennies, Americans can still use the coin as currency.\n\n\"Although today we say goodbye to our copper one-cent coin, let me be crystal clear, the penny remains legal tender,\" Beach said, according to ABC News. \"We have over 300 billion pennies that remain in circulation and we encourage you to use them.\"\n\nHowever, retailers are already experiencing a penny shortage.

This is so wasteful!” Trump wrote. “I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.”\n\nThe penny has been in the crosshairs of Trump officials since he took office. Last month, DOGE, the department run by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, said that producing 4.5 billion pennies in Fiscal Year 2023 cost taxpayers more than $179 million.\n\nThat works out to over 3 cents per penny. Trump's latest 2-cent cost estimate gives the penny a break, but not enough to keep it from being axed from the mint's production.\n\n“Let’s rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it’s a penny at a time,” Trump wrote.\n\nFor the 2024 fiscal year, the annual U.S. Mint report said that it takes about 3.7 cents to produce and distribute one penny, a 20% increase from the previous year. The increase has been partly driven by the rising costs of metals like zinc and copper, according to the report.\n\nRising production costs have spurred other countries to eliminate small denomination coins. Canada stopped making pennies in 2012, and Australia stopped circulating one and two-cent coins back in 1992. In the U.S., discontinuing the penny entirely may require congressional approval.\n\nContributing: Fernando Cervantes Jr.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/954127/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-15-september-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 15 September 2021 | The Week", "text": "1. PM ‘risking 7,000 daily hospitalisations’\n\nUp to 7,000 people a day could be hospitalised with Covid in England next month unless the government urgently implements a “basket of measures”, scientific advisers have warned Boris Johnson. After the PM said he hoped increasing vaccinations meant a “Plan B” of fresh restrictions could be avoided, the Sage committee said a “relatively light set of measures” ushered in early enough could curb infections.\n\n2. North Korea fires ‘ballistic missile’\n\nNorth Korea fired an unidentified projectile towards the Sea of Japan, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Agreeing that an object was fired, the Japanese Coast Guard said it may have been a ballistic missile, which would contravene UN resolutions designed to curb the North’s nuclear activities. The development comes just days after North Korea tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan.\n\n3. Newsom prevails in California\n\nCalifornia’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has prevailed in a rare recall election that could have ended his political career. Although election officials have 30 days to count all the ballots, the Associated Press projected the results about 45 minutes after polls closed, signalling that voters have rejected the change to replace Newsom with his most popular challenger, the rightwing radio host Larry Elder. Republicans launched the election over Newsom’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

Taliban leaders in ‘major row’\n\nA “major row” broke out at the presidential palace between leaders of the Taliban over the make-up of the group’s new government in Afghanistan, senior Taliban officials told the BBC. The news comes after two senior Taliban leaders went missing from public view, leading some Afghans to question whether the group’s supreme leader and new deputy prime minister are alive.\n\n5. PM criticised for Saudi prisons joke\n\nBoris Johnson is under fire for a quip that the UK could become “the Saudi Arabia of penal policy” under Priti Patel. The remark, made during a speech behind closed doors at a Conservative party fundraiser event on 10 September, has been condemned as “disgusting” and a “new low” by opposition politicians. The Guardian said that Saudi Arabia is one of the most punitive regimes in the world.\n\n6. Anger over Faroe dolphin slaughter\n\nLocal and global anger has erupted over what was believed to be a record slaughter of dolphins in the Faroe Islands after 1,400 were killed in one day. The pod of white-sided dolphins was driven into the largest fjord in the North Atlantic territory. The BBC reported that the dolphins were then herded into shallow waters, where they were killed with knives. The carcases were pulled ashore and distributed to locals for consumption.\n\n7.

The appointment comes after industry bosses warned that consumers should prepare for permanent shortages in supermarkets because of a lack of lorry drivers and food-processing workers, which disrupts “just-in-time” supply chains. Announcing Gove’s role to rapidly increase the number of HGV drivers and work with food suppliers, Boris Johnson joked that he “doesn’t want to have to cancel Christmas again”.\n\n9. 1p coins back in production\n\nOne penny coins were back in production last year, data from Royal Mint shows.

Roosevelt. That year, the United States Mint produced 2.84 million proof sets, according to Ian Russell of GreatCollections, the California auctioneer who handled the sale.\n\nWhat sets the dime apart from others of its time is that it lacks the “S” mark needed to be on all proof coins struck at the U.S. Mint in San Francisco, Russell confirmed to USA TODAY Friday morning.\n\nIt’s one of two coins made erroneously without the marking, Russell said in a news release about the sale.\n\nThe dime that sold last weekend garnered over 200 bids Sunday night and sold for $506,250, nearly 30 times what the previous owners paid for the coin 46 years ago in 1978. The sale set a new record, Russell said.\n\nAccording to Russell, it was a Los Angeles customer who discovered the coin lacked the marking in 1977. The customer ordered five sets by mail and noticed that two of the five sets were missing the \"S\" marking.\n\nThe customer sold the first coin to a dealer, waited a few months and then sold the second coin, Russell said.\n\n“At the time, there was already news of the 1968 and 1970 Proof Dimes lacking the ‘S’ mint mark in error, as well as the 1971 No S Proof Jefferson Nickel, so each year, it was fairly normal at the time to check proof sets to see if any coins had errors,” Russell wrote in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nSame family owned rare coin for decades\n\nWhile collectors have known about the two coins for some time, no one knew where they were since the late 1970s, Russell told USA TODAY.\n\nChicago dealer F.J. Vollmer sold the two coins in 1978 and 1979, Russell said.\n\nThe second coin resurfaced in a 2011 auction and sold for $349,600, then again in 2019, selling for $456,000. That coin is now with a collector who specializes in Roosevelt Dimes, Russell said.\n\nAccording to Russell, an Ohio collector and his mother bought the recently sold coin in 1978 from Vollmer for $18,200. The owner kept the dime in an Ohio bank vault for more than 40 years. Once he died, his three sisters inherited the coin.\n\n“The owner … always considered the coin a family asset,” Russell told USA TODAY. “It was bittersweet for (his sisters) – they knew how important it was to their brother – but also recognized he was getting closer to selling it - and that another coin collector should have the opportunity to own the coin.”\n\nRussell said valuable coins are sometimes kept in vaults, sold once collectors have all the coins they need, and some coins are saved for future generations.\n\n\"The collector who bought the coin in 1978 and stored it for 46 years in a bank really had confidence in the rarity and long-term desirability of the coin,\" Russell said. \"He took a risk that more would be discovered, but he told me he had a feeling that it was going to continue to be a major rarity. He bought it three years after it was minted, so it gave him some confidence there would not be others.\"\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

Heads lags behind at 27.\n\nDid you know: the Super Bowl coin is minted in East Central Florida, and has been for more than 30 years?\n\nThe Highland Mint in Melbourne has provided the Super Bowl flip coin since prior to Super Bowl XXVIII on Jan. 30, 1994, when Dallas faced Buffalo. If you’re wondering, the flip was “Tails.”\n\nHow the Super Bowl flip coin gets made\n\nAs soon as the AFC and NFC championships are over, the Highland Mint springs into action.\n\n\"Right after the last game Sunday we start the presses, the coins start getting minted and we start shipping out merchandise,\" said Vince Bohbot, longtime executive vice president of the Highland Mint. \"The coin for the actual coin toss (prior to the Super Bowl), it actually takes three days to get made after the fact.\"\n\n\"We'll ship coins No. 1 to 100 to the NFL. We'll ship them to NFL on-field operations and then they take care of distributing them.\"\n\nThe other 9,900 are sold to the general public.\n\n\"That's a limited edition of 10,000 coins, and the coin is minted just like a like real currency,\" Bohbot said. \"It's silver plated and it has 24 karat gold highlights.\"\n\nWhat will it be? Heads? Tails?\n\nHighland Mint coins have come up “tails” 18 times and “heads” 12 times.\n\nIn last year’s Super Bowl, Kansas City won the coin toss and called “Tails.”\n\nTails it was, and the Chiefs deferred their choice to the second half.\n\nThe prior year, it was “Heads.”\n\nThe Chiefs return to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in five years, this time to take on the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIt's a rematch of Super Bowl 54, won by the Chiefs. San Francisco won the coin toss, choosing Tails. They deferred and kicked off to the Chiefs.\n\nDemand for the Highland Mint coins\n\nSo, do coins sell out faster depending on which teams play in the Super Bowl? It depends.\n\n\"You know the Chiefs fans, they have a huge collection going right now,\" Bohbot said. \"They've been in it four times in the past five years.\n\n\"We also find that there's a lot of non-team fans that are buying this and want the flip coin. It's part of the game. It's something that's being used on the field. So it's something that you could own and we make sure that when we take orders this week that the fans will get theirs by early next week so that they could use it for festivities before their own Super Bowl parties.\"\n\nWhat happens to the actual flip coin?\n\nCoin No. 1 will be flipped prior to Super Bowl 58 on Feb. 11 to determine which team will kick and which one will receive the ball on the game's opening series.\n\nThe coin then gets shipped to the Pro Football Hall of Fame at Canton, Ohio.\n\nBohbot has been to the Hall of Fame to check out his creation.\n\n\"It's really neat to be part of this because I've always wanted to be in the Hall of Fame somehow. Well, I guess that's how you get into the Football Hall of Fame, right, is to have the coin that your company mints that is in there,\" Bohbot said. \"They have different displays. At one point they had all the coins out and another time there was a Super Bowl display and it had a player's jersey, the coin and all sorts of artifacts from the game.\"\n\nWhat's the history on the Super Bowl coin toss\n\nWith this being the 31st Super Bowl in which the Highland Mint has made the coin, it begs the question: What was the NFL using before the Highland Mint began providing coins?\n\n“That's a question that nobody really knows the answer to,\" Bohbot said. \"It was a quarter or a silver dollar, whatever the referee had in their pocket. And I think that's where the NFL decided to make it official. And it really gained traction.\"\n\nYou might also be wondering how the Highland Mint came to be the official coin maker for the NFL.\n\n\"Originally, the company that had the the license to mint the Super Bowl coin was a company called Balfour. You might know them by the class rings they make,\" Bohbot said. \"They weren't a mint, so they came to us to mint the coin. We happened to be an NFL licensee as well and at one point, the NFL asked us to take over and be the official licensee so we've been a licensee of the NFL now for over 30 years.\"\n\nThere's another interest in the coin\n\nThe deciding coin flip isn't just big for the two teams in the game. It's also big for those who like to wager (responsibly).\n\nThe coin flip is always one of the biggest prop bets on the Super Bowl.\n\nThe longest streak has been for “Heads” — five consecutive years from 2009-13.\n\nWhen it comes to Highland Mint coins, “Tails” has had streaks of four in a row on a trio of occasions: 1998-2001, 2003-06 and 2014-17.\n\nThe flip coin is about the size of a silver dollar. Each 1.5-inch diameter coin is individually numbered and protected in an acrylic capsule to preserve its condition and presented in a custom booklet case, allowing one to flip the center page to view both sides.\n\nEach coin’s base metal is copper that is fine silver-plated and flash plated with 24 karat gold. The cost is $99.99.\n\nIf you want your own coin\n\nFans of the Chiefs and 49ers — and everyone else, of course — can order their own coins at highlandmint.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/05"}]}

The White House Office of Management and Budget said in a recent email that workers whose activities are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” are a target, and Vice President JD Vance told reporters that the administration will \"have to lay people off\" if a shutdown extends for weeks.\n\nThe shutdown blame game also is ratcheting up. The White House website features a clock counting the amount of time \"Democrats have shut down the government,\" while the Democratic National Committee wrote on social media early Wednesday that \"Republicans own this shutdown.\"\n\nKeep up with live coverage across the USA TODAY Network.\n\nMass federal layoffs will begin in 'a day or two,' budget chief says\n\nRuss Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told House Republicans in a private call Wednesday that mass layoffs of federal workers will begin in \"a day or two,\" according to a lawmaker on the call.\n\nVought's timeline for so-called \"reductions in force\" of federal workers comes as President Donald Trump has warned Democrats that he could choose to eliminate “vast numbers\" of federal workers under a government shutdown, which started Wednesday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, during a briefing with reporters, did not elaborate on which federal departments could be affected but said layoffs are \"imminent.”\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nStatue of Liberty may go dark, New York governor warns\n\nThe Statue of Liberty may go dark during the federal government shutdown, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Wednesday.\n\nWith Lady Liberty as a backdrop, the New York Democrat stood alongside state elected officials and union representatives to call out Republicans in Washington, D.C., for the shutdown’s effects on entitlement programs, as well as closures to services and parks. This may include Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island, the historic entry to the United States for millions of people who became Americans. Lady Liberty, dedicated nearly 140 years ago in New York Harbor, has symbolized the country’s embrace of immigrants.\n\nHochul said New York wouldn’t pay to keep the Statue of Liberty open during Washington's budget fight as the state had done before.\n\n“Today, the torch she holds — as a beacon to others, a symbol — could literally go dark,” Hochul said. “Not because of an act of God or a horrific storm, flood or hurricane. But literally because Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington forced a government shutdown.”\n\nNeither the National Park Service nor the Department of Interior immediately responded to emailed questions about keeping Liberty and Ellis islands open.\n\nDuring previous government shutdowns, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo used state funds to keep the Statue of Liberty open. The federal shutdown in 2018-19 cost about $1.5 million to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, Gothamist reported.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhy are lawmakers fighting over health care?\n\nRepublicans are claiming Democrats shut down the government to demand free health care for undocumented immigrants. But these migrants are largely ineligible for federal health benefits, said Leo Cuello, a professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\nThey don't qualify for comprehensive Medicaid coverage, Medicare or the Children's Health Insurance Program. And they can't purchase federally subsidized health plans on exchanges backed by the Affordable Care Act. There are legal immigrants on Medicaid in the United States, so-called \"qualified aliens\" who were previously eligible for Medicaid coverage.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, they included only lawful immigrants: legal permanent residents, refugees, people granted asylum, people granted humanitarian parole including Ukrainians and Afghans, certain Cubans and Haitians; and certain victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, among others.\n\nThe new tax and spending law Trump signed in July restricts eligibility only to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents – i.e. green card holders – as well as some Cuban and Haitian immigrants.\n\nThere is no proposal to provide free health care to people living in the country illegally.\n\n– Lauren Villagran and Sarah Wire\n\nShutdown stalls case against ICE in Chicago\n\nThe shutdown has also stalled a case against the Department of Homeland Security over the agency’s immigration enforcement crackdown known as Operation Midway Blitz.\n\nThe National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois filed documents in federal court over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in the Chicago area. The arrests violated a settlement agreement with ICE dating back to 2022 that barred many vehicle stops and arrests made without a warrant, according to defense attorneys.\n\nA spokesperson for the Northern District of Illinois federal court confirmed that a hearing set for Oct. 3 over potential violations to the Castañon Nava consent decree was delayed following the shutdown.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, urged the court to take up the case again: \"We urgently need the court to weigh in to hold the Trump administration accountable for its ongoing immigration raids in the Chicago area, where federal agents are detaining people, including children, without warrants or probable cause, and using increasingly violent tactics to do so.\"\n\nThe case comes as parts of the region say that Trump’s Midway Blitz amounts to a siege and as Illinois leaders fear masked federal agents will spark protests the White House will use the National Guard to quell.\n\nJeffries says Trump behaving 'erratically,' hits back over sombrero videos\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says he had not heard from the White House since congressional leaders left the property after a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday.\n\nJeffries said Trump, who has been posting AI-generated videos of the Democratic leader in a mustache and sombrero, has been behaving \"somewhat erratically\" since the meeting and does not seem to be interested in coming up with a resolution to the government shutdown that began on Wednesday.\n\n\"It would seem to me that as the president of the United States, on the brink of a government shutdown, if you actually wanted to bring everyone together to try to get to a resolution in a common-sense, bipartisan way, that's not the type of behavior that we would see,\" Jeffries said on The Lead with Jake Tapper on CNN.\n\nVice President JD Vance told reporters at the White House earlier in the day that Trump was \"joking\" when he shared the memes that Jeffries and others have criticized as racist.\n\nBut Jeffries said he did not want to dwell on the videos. \"The broader problem is it's deeply unserious, and this is a serious moment. We need to reopen the government,\" Jeffries told CNN.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nFirst DOGE. Now shutdown. Federal workers see tough year.\n\nIt’s been a tough year to be a federal worker.\n\nPotential widespread layoffs under the government shutdown are just the latest in a tough year for federal workers that’s already seen over 200,000 civil servants leave the workforce, according to the Partnership for Public Service.\n\nEarly cuts to the federal workforce came at the hands of Elon Musk’s \"U.S. Department of Government Efficiency”, a project Trump established on Jan. 20 to reduce spending and eliminate “waste, bloat, and insularity” in the federal bureaucracy. Among those who left were 150,000 federal workers who took the White House’s \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, provided early in the Trump administration.\n\nBut some are pushing back. In response to potential layoffs under the shutdown, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees on Sept. 30 filed a lawsuit challenging the administration’s threats of a mass firing saying it was designed to “inflict punishment on, and further traumatize, federal employees throughout the nation.”\n\nThese actions are a “cynical use of federal employees as a pawn in Congressional deliberations should be declared unlawful and enjoined by this Court,” the lawsuit said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nFederal spending cuts to Democratic states\n\nFor the second time today, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced a cut to federal funding to Democratic led states.\n\nOn social media Vought said that he would cancel funding for green energy projects in 16 Democrat-led states.\n\n\"Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,\" Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a social media post.\n\nHe said the cuts would impact California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nEarlier in the day Vought announced that $18 million for two of New York city’s largest projects in decades — the 2nd Avenue subway expansion and the Hudson River rail tunnel — were on hold.\n\nWashington's Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriation's Committee, decried the \"mafioso tactics.\"\n\n\"We're less than a day into this shutdown, and Trump & Vought are illegally punishing Democrat-led states,\" Murray said on social media.\n\n- Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhite House plays AI videos of Jeffries in sombrero\n\nPresident Donald Trump is doubling down on his portrayal of House Democratic Leader of Hakeem Jeffries in a fake mustache and sombrero.\n\nOn the first day of a government shutdown, the White House on Tuesday afternoon started playing the controversial AI-generated videos featuring Jefferies in a mustache and sombrero on loop in the press briefing room.\n\nVice President JD Vance earlier in the day brushed off criticism from Jeffries and other Democrats who have called the videos racist. The videos, which are playing on a pair of large television screens in the briefing room, also include made up audio of Schumer making derogatory comments about immigrants, as mariachi music played in the background.\n\n“The president's joking,” Vance said when asked about the videos. “And we're having a good time.”\n\nThe vice president added: “Hakeem Jeffries said it was racist, and I know that he said that, and I honestly don’t even know what that means. Like, is he a Mexican-American that is offended by having a sombrero meme?”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for student loans? What about FAFSA?\n\nIn the event of a government shutdown, borrowers would still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt.\n\nThe Department of Education will continue to disburse Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans, according to the department’s contingency plan. As available, permanent and multi-year appropriations will also be used to continue processing Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, the plan said.\n\nDuring a lapse in funding, the department would cease any new grantmaking activities; however, grant programs typically make awards over the summer.\n\nBorrowers with a question or dispute related to their loan may have a tougher time reaching the department, as it plans to furlough the majority of its staff.\n\nExperts say while most borrowers won’t “feel” a short shutdown, more issues could arise the longer it takes those in Washington to make a deal.\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nFederal agency websites blame Democrats for shutdown\n\nThe websites of several Cabinet-level agencies now have banners blaming Democrats for the government shutdown rather than the routine language noting that a “lapse in funding” has occurred and response times might be slower.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development was the first to take a political approach, putting up its banner Tuesday.\n\nThe USDA’s website blames “Radical Left Democrat shutdown” for the page not being updated.\n\nThe DHS website says “Mission-critical activities of HHS will continue during the Democrat-led government shutdown. Please use this site as a resource as the Trump Administration works to reopen the government for the American people.”\n\nThe Justice Department claims “Democrats have shut down the government.”\n\n“Due to the Democrat-led shutdown, website updates will be limited until full operations resume,” the State Department’s site says.\n\nThe Treasury Department states “The radical left has chosen to shut down the United States government in the name of reckless spending and obstructionism.”\n\nSeveral agencies including the Education, Labor and Transportation departments simply refer to a lapse in funding.\n\n- Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhat does it mean to be furloughed?\n\nA furlough is the \"placing of an employee in a temporary nonduty, non-pay status because of lack of work or funds, or other non-disciplinary reasons,\" according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\nWhen an agency does not have enough funds, such as in the case of a government shutdown, a “shutdown” furlough occurs and those employees not categorized as \"excepted,\" or essential, pause their work.\n\nTSA warns of possible delays\n\nTravelers heading to the airport don’t need to worry about TSA disruptions from the government shutdown – at least for now.\n\nThe agency said on X that about 61,000 of its 64,000 employees are considered essential and will continue screening passengers, though their paychecks may be delayed until funding resumes. TSA warned that an extended shutdown could eventually lead to longer wait times, with past shutdowns showing rising absences among TSA and FAA employees can snarl air travel.\n\nFor now, flights and security operations are expected to run normally, but travelers should monitor flight status and security line updates if the shutdown continues.\n\n– Zach Wichter\n\nMillions of Medicare recipients could lose access to telehealth, in-home care\n\nSeniors who rely on Medicare could face major changes and new barriers to receiving medical care during the shutdown. Two COVID-era programs that expanded access to healthcare expired on Tuesday, despite having largely bipartisan support: One provided greater flexibility around telehealth and another allowed hospitals to continue high-level care at home.\n\nAs part of the shutdown, Congress missed the deadline on extending telehealth programs for Medicare beneficiaries, meaning previous restrictions will go back into place.\n\nTherefore, patients can no longer receive telehealth from home unless they meet specific criteria. Telehealth flexibility will again be limited to rural areas; audio-only visits will no longer be reimbursed for most services; and physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists and audiologists will be excluded from telehealth reimbursement.\n\n– Mary Walrath-Holdridge\n\nYes, Congress and the president receive salaries during a government shutdown\n\nCongressional lawmakers and the president continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown under Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution.\n\n“The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States,\" the Constitution states.\n\nHowever, some lawmakers such as New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, say they will not take compensation during the shutdown. Trump also receives a salary as president, but the one-time real estate mogul has historically donated his pay.\n\nWill there be layoffs during the government shutdown? OMB director huddles with GOP lawmakers\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought would brief House Republican lawmakers Wednesday about federal government layoffs planned under the shutdown.\n\nTrump has warned “vast” layoffs are possible. Leavitt confirmed a time frame that layoffs are “imminent” and could begin in as little as two days.\n\n“We have to put a plan in place,” Leavitt told reporters.\n\nIs the DMV impacted by the government shutdown?\n\nNo. It's business as usual at Department of Motor Vehicles offices across the country. Like the U.S. Postal Service, the agency's operations are not contingent on Congress passing a funding package.\n\nMotor vehicle departments, which are state-run agencies, are largely funded through state budgets and supplemented by fees charged to drivers.\n\n– Amaris Encinas\n\nVance takes center stage in shutdown fight\n\nVance made a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Wednesday, placing himself at the forefront of the administration's fight with Democrats over government spending.\n\nIn remarks to reporters, Vance repeatedly blasted Schumer, who he accused of acting in his own political interests, and threatened mass layoffs for federal workers if the shutdown continues.\n\n\"We need to reopen the government,\" Vance said. \"Let's fix America's problems, let's work together to solve them, but let's reopen the government before have our negotiation about healthcare policy.\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWhat government services will be impacted by shutdown?\n\nSocial Security checks will still be delivered. Medicare and Medicaid benefits also will still be paid, but many other aspects of the federal government will grind to a halt during the shutdown.\n\nAll federal agencies and services that officials do not deem \"essential\" must stop working during a shutdown.\n\nEssential services include the U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security services and air-traffic control. \"Nonessential\" work, however, must pause, which affects thousands of federal employees and millions of Americans.\n\nDo you have Medicare or Medicaid? Your doctor will see you, for now\n\nIf you have Medicare or Medicaid, you should be able to see your doctor without disruption. But if the shutdown drags on several weeks, problems could surface, experts said.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue operations during the shutdown.\n\nDoctors, hospitals and other health providers could see delays in Medicare and Medicaid payments during a longer-term shutdown, said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nDoctors might be reluctant to schedule appointments for new or existing patients if their payments are delayed, Burks said. Federal law requires hospitals to assess and stabilize anyone who seeks care at an emergency room.\n\n– Ken Alltucker\n\nTrump is no stranger to shutdowns\n\nA shuttered government is familiar territory for Trump, whose first term saw three shutdowns, including a 35-day closure spanning the end of 2018 into early 2019. It remains the longest in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Congress failed to pass new spending authority Tuesday, it prompted the 4th shutdown of the federal government during a Trump presidency.\n\nWhen will the government reopen? Here's what would need to happen\n\nThe government will remain shut down until Congress can agree on federal funding allocations.\n\nTo reopen the government, Congress will need to pass funding appropriations. Trump will then have to sign the appropriations bill into law.\n\nLawmakers could also pass a temporary spending bill, known as a continuing resolution (or CR, for short), to buy more time for negotiations.\n\nStocks little changed on shutdown’s first day\n\nU.S. stocks were mixed in the late morning in New York as investors digested the first day of the government shutdown and a weaker-than-expected report about hiring.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 66 points, about 0.1%, to trade near 46,464, while the broader S&P 500 index was down 2 points near 6,687. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off 25 points, or 0.1%, trading near 22,635. Gold, which investors snatch up during periods of uncertainty, was up $22 near $3,895.\n\nBefore the market opened, payroll processor ADP said that private employers had shed a net 32,000 jobs in September. Economists had expected a gain of 50,000 jobs. ADP’s report will likely be the only read on the state of hiring until the shutdown ends, and with the Federal Reserve set to meet during the last week of October, it takes on outsize importance.\n\nThe lackluster reading “makes the Fed more likely to cut rates a quarter percent at their next decision in late October,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Dallas-based Comerica Bank, in an email.\n\nHow is the IRS impacted by the government shutdown?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will not immediately be impacted by the government shutdown. More than 74,000 IRS employees are expected to report to work for the first day days after the shutdown's start, per the IRS' government shutdown contingency plan.\n\nThe federal government agency will continue operating under the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides supplemental appropriations to the IRS through Sept. 30, 2031, according to the contingency plan. However, the plan does not outline the agency's next steps after Oct. 5.\n\n– Greta Cross\n\nAOC: ‘This is so not about me’\n\nProgressive firebrand New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday that Republicans who are speculating the government shutdown is her fault should negotiate with her on a deal directly.\n\nHer remarks come as some Republicans have argued that Schumer opposed a temporary short-term bill to fund the government because of pressure from progressive Democrats and a potential primary challenge from Ocasio-Cortez in 2028.\n\nSchumer received backlash in March after voting in favor of a Republican-crafted short-term funding bill. Ocasio-Cortez told reporters then that there was \"a deep sense of outrage and betrayal\" and said Senate Democrats must \"correct course.\" Other House Democrats and New York politicos urged her to mount a primary challenge to him when he is next up for re-election in 2028.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez said just hours before the government shut down that, “This is so not about me in this moment.”\n\nShe added, “I saw some senators speculating about this, and I saw some Republican members of Congress saying, ‘Oh, well, if we have this shutdown, it's because of AOC.’ Well, if that's the case, my office is open and you are free to walk in and negotiate with me directly.”\n\nSchumer shutdown becomes key phrase for congressional Republicans\n\nCongressional Republicans adopted two key phrases at a Wednesday news conference to accuse Democrats of holding the American public “hostage” and blast what they called the “Schumer shutdown.”\n\nSchumer of New York has become the face of the Democratic Party as he negotiates federal funding with Trump. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota; Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming; and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, each called it a “Schumer shutdown.”\n\n“The reason the government is shut down this morning is because the Democrats decided they would rather hold our government hostage and issue a $1.5 trillion random note,” said Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota.\n\nSchumer has highlighted that many people will lose health insurance if federal subsidies aren’t extended under Obamacare as the renewal period begins Nov. 1.\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said subsidies could be debated in December before new insurance rates go into effect Jan. 1.\n\n“That is not a decision that has to be made before the end of the year,” Johnson said. “Don’t buy it. They’re grasping at straws.”\n\nMike Johnson says shutdown ‘opportunity to downsize’ government\n\nJohnson told Fox Business that he has spoken to Trump about using the shutdown to cut the federal government.\n\n“The president and I have talked about this at great length,” Johnson said Wednesday. “While a shutdown is very damaging for real American people who depend on government services, it can provide an opportunity to downsize the scope and the scale of government, which is something that we’ve all always wanted to do.”\n\nTrump is threatening mass layoffs of federal workers. Johnson said the shutdown is an opportunity to do things “we would not otherwise be able to do because we would never get Democrat votes for them.”\n\n‘No way out’: Congressional Republicans push for short-term funding\n\nRepublican congressional leaders urged Democrats to support a short-term extension of funding through Nov. 21 and reopen the government while lawmakers continue to debate spending levels.\n\n“There’s no way out,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said at a Wednesday news conference outside the Capitol. “Everybody’s asking the question how does this end.”\n\nThe House previously approved the short-term funding extension. Another Senate vote is expected about 11 a.m. on Wednesday. But a 55-45 vote on Tuesday fell short of the 60 votes needed to approve the bill.\n\n“They have taken the American people hostage,” Thune said of Democrats. “This could all end today.”\n\nDoes the military still operate during a government shutdown?\n\nMilitary operations are necessary to national security, so service members will continue to work during the shutdown, according to a Saturday contingency plan published by the Department of War.\n\nHowever, military members won't get paid while working during the shutdown because their compensation is funded through annual personnel appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security and Department of War, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nIt's possible that Congress will act to ensure active duty members continue to get paid as they have in past shutdowns. For example, the Pay Our Military Act allowed military members to be paid during a government shutdown in 2013.\n\nNational Park site operations will vary during the government shutdown.\n\nNational Park operations will vary during the government shutdown.\n\nIn general parks will remain open and “park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,” according to newly published contingency plans on the Department of Interior’s website.\n\nParks with accessible areas that collect fees under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are to use balances from those fees to continue providing basic visitor services like restroom maintenance and trash collection.\n\nHowever, the plan says the National Park Service will not operate nor offer visitor services in parks without accessible areas, though essential services like law enforcement and border safety will continue. Also facilities and areas that are typically locked or secured after business hours will largely remain so during the shutdown.\n\n– Eve Chen\n\n'There’s going to be some pain' Vance says shutdown could hurt.\n\nVance in a Wednesday appearance on CBS Mornings said Americans could be harmed by the shutdown’s impact on government services.\n\n“There are critical, essential services that the people rely on that are going to suffer because of this,” Vance said, adding: “There’s going to be some pain.”\n\nVance also appeared on Fox News, where he criticized Democrats’ focus on including an extension of health care subsidies in any government funding bill, saying “you don’t shut down the government because you have a policy disagreement about a totally separate issue.”\n\nCongressional Democratic leaders – Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York – issued a joint statement at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday saying Trump and Republicans shut down the government “because they do not want to protect the healthcare of the American people.”\n\nWill a government shutdown impact my flight?\n\nFor the most part, no. Air passengers should still be able to continue with their flights during a partial government shutdown.\n\nThose workers who screen at airport security checkpoints, give flight clearance, and verify at border control are deemed essential, so they are still required to work.\n\nHowever, a group representing major U.S. airlines warned that a partial federal government shutdown could strain American aviation and slow flights, as air traffic controllers and security officers would be forced to work without pay and other functions would be halted.\n\nAirline trade group Airlines for America, which represents United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others, warned that if funding lapses \"the system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency\" and impacting travelers.\n\n– Kathleen Wong\n\nAbout $18 billion in NYC infrastructure funds frozen amid shutdown\n\nThe Trump administration has frozen about $18 billion in infrastructure project funds to New York City amid the federal government shutdown. Federal officials on Wednesday alleged discrimination from a city program meant to help underrepresented groups obtain federal contracts.\n\nThe federal Department of Transportation said two of the city’s largest projects in decades — the 2nd Avenue subway expansion and the Hudson River rail tunnel — are on hold pending administrative review. An agency news release called the projects “arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nIn an X post, Russ Vought, the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, said the hold is meant to “ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”\n\nThe Transportation Department cited the city’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation in federally assisted contracts. Projects, for now, can’t reimbursed, an agency news release said.\n\nA spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a New York Democrat, called the hold “political payback and an attack on New York and its residents.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nSmithsonian museums remaining open this week\n\nThe Smithsonian Institute’s museums, research centers, and the National Zoo remain open this week despite the government shutdown.\n\nThe organization posted on its website that it will use money from the last fiscal year’s budget to stay open at least through Monday, Oct. 6.\n\nThe Smithsonian has 17 museums and a zoo in the Washington area plus two museums in New York City.\n\nWhat does the government shutdown mean for mortgage borrowers?\n\nAmericans who are hoping to close on a mortgage soon – whether for a purchase or a refinance – may experience some delays as government functions are curtailed. Here are a few things to know:\n\nMost mortgages that will be assumed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be unaffected, industry participants say. However, if your Social Security number needs to be verified, you may encounter delays.\n\nIf your mortgage comes from a rural housing program like those from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, expect delays. As the National Association of Realtors explains in an online memo to members, “new direct and guaranteed home loans, and any scheduled direct‑loan closings will be postponed. Pending conditional commitments for guaranteed loans are still being reviewed.”\n\nIf your mortgage comes from the Department of Veterans Affairs, you should also expect delays. “Some VA staff and support functions may be reduced, which may slow down approvals, appraisals and certificate of eligibility requests,” NAR says.\n\nIf you are working with a housing counselor affiliated with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, that agency may need to scale back or halt their activities, NAR says.\n\nBuyers in flood-prone areas like Florida and Louisiana might encounter delays because the National Flood Insurance Program will not be funded. Some lenders may allow the purchase to proceed anyway, but that can create problems if a storm happens before insurance can be written, said Jeff Lichtenstein, president and broker of Echo Fine Properties in south Florida.\n\n“Uncertainty in the marketplace might have some buyers just wanting to back out,” Lichtenstein told USA TODAY in an email. “Nothing good ever comes out of these things.”\n\nWhite House website features shutdown clock\n\nTrump is doing everything he can to blame Democrats for the shutdown, including featuring a shutdown clock on the White House website.\n\nThe top of the website displays the amount of time since “Democrats have shutdown the government.” There’s also a link to a video with clips of Democrats criticizing past shutdowns.\n\nThe Trump administration has used other government channels to blast out highly partisan shutdown messages, including a banner on the Department of Housing and Urban Development website declaring the “radical left” is shutting down the government.\n\nDemocrats say blame for the shutdown lies with the GOP.\n\n“Republicans own this shutdown,” the Democratic National Committee posted on social media early Wednesday.\n\nMassive furloughs expected in federal government\n\nAbout 750,000 federal employees ranging from workers at national parks to financial regulators could be furloughed each day under a shutdown, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, withholding about $400 million in daily compensation.\n\nOther workers in government services that are considered “essential,” such as the military and law enforcement, will continue to work but won’t be paid until a deal is reached.\n\nTrump warns of government layoffs\n\nTrump has also warned Democrats he may lay off federal workers under a shutdown. \"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them ‒ cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things they that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said in the Oval Office, hours before the shutdown.\n\nThe president later said: “A lot of good can come down from shutdowns. We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want. They’d be Democrat things.”\n\nThe shutdown is the first since 2019, which came during Trump’s first term following Democratic objections over funding Trump’s border wall. It was also the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 35 days, costing the U.S. economy about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nDemocrats hold out for health-care demands\n\nDemocrats have demanded the reversal of Medicaid cuts that Republicans passed this year and the extension of health care subsidies be included in a funding measure.\n\n“He doesn't understand that if the government shuts down, people's healthcare premiums will go up,” Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said of Trump from the Senate Floor on Tuesday.\n\nTrump and Republicans have countered by accusing Democrats of wanting to provide health care for immigrants who are in the country illegally. “That’s what they’re insisting, and obviously, I have an obligation to not accept that,” Trump said. Democrats have called the president's claims a lie, noting that undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible for payments from Medicare, Medicaid, or the Affordable Care Act.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/02/federal-government-still-shut-down-october-2/86472188007/", "title": "Is the federal government still shut down?

As of Thursday, Oct. 2, the federal government is still shut down.\n\nThere’s no immediate end in sight as congressional Democrats demand health care policy changes that Trump and Republicans have refused to entertain.\n\nWhat happens during a government shutdown?\n\nDuring a government shutdown, all federal agencies and services deemed non-essential must stop working, affecting thousands of federal employees and, in turn, millions of Americans.\n\nEssential services, like military and law enforcement, remain working.\n\nHow to follow updates on the government shutdown\n\nUSA TODAY is following the shutdown in daily live blogs. Find stories about the shutdown's impact and everything you need to know below.\n\nHow does a government shutdown end?\n\nA government shutdown starts when Congress cannot agree on how to allocate funding for federal agencies to operate before a pre-established deadline (in this case, Sept. 30, 2025).\n\nMeaning, the shutdown will end and the government will fully reopen once Congress passes funding appropriations. President Donald Trump will then have to sign the appropriations bill into law.\n\nLawmakers could also pass a temporary spending bill, known as a continuing resolution (or CR, for short), to buy more time for negotiations, according to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nContributing: Saman Shafiq, Melina Kahn\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

Even so, the Senate will reconvene at 10 a.m. Wednesday. Votes are expected at 11 a.m., and again later in the afternoon.\n\nThe House of Representatives, meanwhile, won't be in session at all. Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, is keeping lawmakers in recess in order to pressure Democrats. - Zach Schermele\n\nWhat’s on President Trump’s schedule Wednesday?\n\nPresident Donald Trump is planning on the first day of the government shutdown to sign executive orders in the Oval Office at 4:30 p.m., according to the White House.\n\nEarlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to be on 'CBS Mornings' at 7 a.m. EST, according to the network.\n\nAt 1 p.m., White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is scheduled to address reporters during a press briefing. - Sarah D. Wire\n\nAs shutdown creeps closer, all is quiet at the Capitol\n\nThe halls were quiet in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday night, even as the White House instructed federal agencies to prepare for a partial government shutdown.\n\nUnder no illusion of breaching their differences before midnight, lawmakers scurried out from the Senate chamber not long after voting against dueling funding measures. Once those bills failed – as expected – Republican and Democratic leaders retreated to press conferences, at which they blamed each other for the impending fiscal crisis.\n\nThe Senate adjourned at 8:24 p.m. - Zach Schermele\n\nTrump turns whitehouse.gov into countdown clock\n\nThe official website for the White House and presidency, whitehouse.gov, now declares a “Democrat shutdown is imminent” and displays a ticker clock more normally seen in the corner of cable news shows.\n\nThe page also includes a red ticker across the top of the page directing people to previous comments Democrats have made about shutdowns.\n\nEarlier in the day the Department of Housing and Urban Development took a political approach, posting a pop-up message on its website that blamed Democrats in Congress for the impasse. As of 9 p.m. ET it was the only Cabinet-level agency to change its website in such a way. -Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhite House directs government to ‘execute their plans’ for shutdown\n\nThe White House directed federal departments to begin carrying out their plans for a government shutdown after Democrats blocked a Republican-backed proposal Tuesday night that sought to keep the government funding through Nov. 21.\n\n“It is now clear that Democrats will prevent passage of this clean (continuing resolution) prior to 11:59 p.m. tonight and force a government shutdown,” White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought wrote in a memo to department heads. “As such, affected agencies should now execute their plans for an orderly shutdown.”\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to be placed on furloughs during a shutdown, while workers in essential services such as the military and law enforcement won’t be paid while they work.\n\nTrump has warned Democrats that his administration might also lay off “vast numbers” of federal workers and cut programs supported by Democrats under a shutdown.\n\nDemocrats on Congress have demanded the reversal of Medicaid cuts that Republicans passed this year and the extension of health care subsidies be included in a funding measure. The Republican-backed continuing resolution would have kept spending at current levels. - Joey Garrison\n\nHUD website blasts Democrats for shutdown in pop-up banner\n\nWhile other federal agencies were rolling out their contingency plans in the event of a federal shutdown, the Department of Housing and Urban Development took a political approach, posting a pop-up message on its website that blamed Democrats in Congress for the impasse.\n\n\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands. The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people,\" the message says.\n\nThe message came under quick criticism and was pegged as a violation of a federal law that prevents federal workers from using government resources to engage in political activity.\n\n\"It is COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE, not to mention ILLEGAL, to use an agency web page for such a partisan message. No previous administration, Republican or Democrat, would ever have done this,\" Paul Jargowsky, a professor of Public Policy at Rutgers University – Camden said on X. - Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump says ‘a lot of good’ can come from a government shutdown\n\nHours before the government is set to close its doors, Trump said “a lot of good” can result from a shutdown because it would allow his administration to scrap programs and other spending it doesn’t want.\n\n“We’re doing well as a country, so the last thing we want to do is shut it down,” Trump said from the Oval Office in response to a question from a reporter. “But a lot of good can come down from shutdowns. We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want. They’d be Democrat things.”\n\nTrump has warned that his administration could lay off federal workers under a shutdown – an action that hasn’t historically been taken during temporary stoppages of the federal government.\n\nThe president has showed no signs he will concede to demands of congressional Democrats, who have pushed for extending federal subsidies for Obamacare as part of a measure to fund the government. −Joey Garrison\n\nDoes Social Security stop in a government shutdown?\n\nThe Social Security Administration is projected to pay out $1.6 trillion to 72 million beneficiaries this year, making it a vital economic lifeline for much of the country.\n\nA shutdown won’t disrupt those payments.\n\nSocial Security is a mandatory spending program that is not subject to annual appropriations. However, staffing and some services could be impacted if they have a discretionary spending component, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonprofit that studies federal fiscal policy.\n\nSen. John Kennedy: No way out of a shutdown\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, gave a candid assessment from the Senate floor of the prospects of any shutdown off-ramps.\n\n\"Once you shut the government down, you've got to get it back open,\" he said. \"How are they going to get it back open? We're not going to agree to their demands.\"\n\nThough he characterized his colleagues across the aisle, including Schumer, as \"smart people,\" he said pressure from the Democrats' base has blinded them to the harsh realities a shutdown will bring to Americans' lives.\n\nHow is Veterans Affairs impacted by a government shutdown?\n\nThe VA estimates that 97% of its employees continue work during a shutdown. But according to the department's contingency plan, here's what services would be impacted:\n\nVA will stop providing transition program assistant and career counseling.\n\nVA's GI Bill and National Cemetery Applicant Assistance hotlines will be closed.\n\nVA benefits regional offices will be closed.\n\nPublic affairs and outreach to veterans will cease, including social media, VetResources emails and responses to press inquires.\n\nNo grounds maintenance or placement of permanent headstones at VA cemeteries.\n\nApplications for pre-need burial at VA cemeteries won't be processed.\n\nNo printing of new Presidential Memorial Certificates.\n\nNot outreach to state, county, tribal, municipal, faith-based and community-based partners by VA Center Office.\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for student loans?\n\nIn the event of a government shutdown, borrowers would still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt.\n\nThe Department of Education will continue to disburse Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans, according to the department’s contingency plan. As available, permanent and multi-year appropriations will also be used to continue processing Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, the plan said.\n\nDuring a lapse in funding, the department would cease any new grantmaking activities; however, grant programs typically make awards over the summer.\n\nBorrowers with a question or dispute related to their loan may have a tougher time reaching the department, as it plans to furlough the majority of its staff.\n\nExperts say while most borrowers won’t “feel” a short shutdown, more issues could arise the longer it takes those in Washington to make a deal. − Rachel Barber\n\nUnions sue Trump administration over mass firing threats\n\nTwo unions say they are suing the Trump administration for threatening mass firings of federal workers in the event of a government shutdown.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees filed a federal lawsuit in San Francisco on Tuesday. They are accusing the Office of Management and Budget and its director, Russ Vought, of violating the law with their threats to fire federal workers during a shutdown.\n\nThe lawsuit also names the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and its director, Scott Kupor. The suit alleges that the OPM and Kupor issued \"unlawful and unprecedented instructions\" to federal workers to perform work during the federal government shutdown in order to carry out layoffs.\n\n− Terry Collins\n\nWhat does it mean to be furloughed?\n\nA furlough is the \"placing of an employee in a temporary nonduty, non-pay status because of lack of work or funds, or other non-disciplinary reasons,\" according to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nWhen an agency does not have enough funds, such as in the case of a government shutdown, a “shutdown” furlough occurs. Those employees not categorized as \"excepted,\" or essential, pause their work.\n\nJob-matching and hiring site Indeed describes a furlough as mandatory time off, typically implemented by companies as a cost-saving measure. Furloughs are temporary and the length of a furlough leave can vary, \"from a reduction of hours per week to several months without work,\" according to Indeed's definition.\n\nWhat is a government shutdown? Here's what it means and how it works\n\nEach fiscal year, Congress appropriates funds for federal agencies to operate. If Congress does not agree on appropriations or a temporary spending bill (called a continuing resolution), federal agencies must effectively shut down or stop normal spending, according to the United States Office of Personnel Management.\n\nAn exception is made for certain jobs or services deemed essential, which continue to operate.\n\nWho is Russ Vought?\n\nRuss Vought leads the White House Office of Management and Budget. He is expected to play a major role in how the government functions during the expected shutdown, including whether there are mass layoffs of federal employees instead of furloughs.\n\nAccording to reports first published by Politico, Vought instructed agencies to prepare reduction in force plans, or layoffs, for all employees whose work “is not consistent with the President’s priorities.” Democrats dismissed it as an intimidation tactic. The administration has begun rehiring some of the tens of thousands of federal employees laid off earlier this year.\n\nVought, who also lead the agency during Trump’s first term, is responsible for overseeing the president’s budget, reviewing federal regulations and setting funding priorities for executive agencies.\n\nHe was the key architect of the controversial policy blueprint known as Project 2025, much of which has been implemented during Trump’s second term. Vought is credited with authoring the chapter on executive power.\n\nDoes the military get paid during a government shutdown?\n\nAll active-duty U.S. military personnel stay on the job, but nearly half of the Department of War's 741,477 civilian employees could face furloughs, according to a contingency plan released by the department.\n\nAnother part of the military that would remain on the job would be the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees nuclear weapons.\n\nHow many government shutdowns have there been? When was the longest government shutdown?\n\nThere have been 20 government shutdowns lasting at least one full day since 1975, with most taking place before 1995 and half being very brief.\n\nPrior to the 1980’s government shutdowns where agencies shut down didn’t really exist if Congress didn’t approve a new spending authorization. Instead, agencies would often continue to operate with the expectation that funding would be provided in the future, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThen, in 1980 and 1981 U.S. Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti wrote a series of legal opinions that established the basis for government shutdowns, saying that agencies needed to strictly follow the Anti-deficiency Act, a longstanding law that prohibits government agencies from spending money more than the amount Congress provided them by law.\n\nThe longest shutdown since those opinions began at the end of the day on Dec. 21, 2018, and lasted 35 days.\n\nThe second longest lasted 21 days from Dec. 16, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996.\n\nThe third longest shutdown began October 1, 2013 and lasted for a total of 16 days.\n\nDoes a government shutdown affect flights?\n\nFor the most part, no. Air passengers should still be able to continue with their flights during a partial government shutdown.\n\nThose workers who screen at airport security checkpoints, give flight clearance, and verify at border control are deemed essential, so they are still required to work.\n\nInstead, a shutdown puts federal funding on hold for agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration, and Customs and Border Protection. As a result, actions like hiring or training are put on hold, and workers aren't paid until the issue is resolved. – Kathleen Wong\n\nWhat happens to Medicare and Medicaid during a shutdown?\n\nThe federal Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs are also considered mandatory spending, meaning benefits won’t be impacted if the government shuts down.\n\nNearly 71 million people were enrolled in Medicaid for lower-income families and the disabled as of May 2025. And 69 million enrolled in Medicare for the elderly.\n\nTrump expects shutdown over health care impasse\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office a shutdown is “probably likely” because of what he described as Democrats insisting on providing Medicaid health insurance for undocumented immigrants.\n\n“We’ll probably have a shutdown,” Trump said. “Nothing is inevitable but I would say it’s probably likely.”\n\nRepublican leaders said their aim is to prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving Medicaid benefits and to require 80 hours of work or volunteer service per month to receive benefits.\n\nAbout 10 million people are expected to lose coverage under the changes, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The figure includes 7.5 million losing Medicaid and 2.1 million losing coverage under Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDemocrats focused after meeting with Trump on Sept. 29 on extending federal subsidies for Obamacare. Schumer said middle-class families could see premiums rise $400 per month as they begin signing up Nov. 1 for next year's coverage.\n\nSchumer: Republicans lying about our demands\n\nSenate Democrats pushed back hard Tuesday as top Republicans allege that their health care demands would benefit undocumented immigrants.\n\n“Not a single sentence or clause or comma in our bill does that,” Schumer told reporters.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, was more frank.\n\n“If it seems like the only sentence that Republicans can form these days consists of a noun, verb, and illegal immigrant, that’s because they have to resort to outright lies to defend their truly God-awful health care policies,” she said.\n\nTrump warns of layoffs, program cuts\n\nTrump warned Democrats that he could take “irreversible” actions such as layoffs of federal workers, rather than furloughs in a traditional shutdown, and the elimination of federal programs.\n\n“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people and cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “They’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.”\n\nMore Americans view Trump, congressional leaders unfavorably: poll\n\nAmericans view Trump and each of the four congressional leaders more unfavorably than positively, according to a Pew Research Center poll of 3,445 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 22 to 25.\n\nA majority of 58% of respondents viewed Trump unfavorably, compared to 40% favorable, according to the poll.\n\nBut congressional leaders fared not much better − and were less well known. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, had a 38% unfavorable rating and 25% favorable, according to the survey. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, had a 26% unfavorable rating to 16% favorable.\n\nJeffries had a 30% unfavorable rating and 24% favorable, according to the survey. Schumer had a 50% unfavorable rating and 21% favorable.\n\nThe remainder of respondents said they had never heard of the lawmakers.\n\nDo rockets still launch during a government shutdown? How NASA could feel the effects\n\nNASA is far from immune to the effects of a looming government shutdown if congressional leaders fail to reach an agreement before midnight to prevent one.\n\nAt stake for the U.S. space agency if the federal government grinds to a halt? The progress of many of its science missions and access to its public outreach arm. NASA’s contingency plan for a shutdown, outlined in a guide from 2018, emphasizes that only \"activities which are necessary to prevent harm to life or property\" would be exempt from ceasing operations during a shutdown.\n\nThat means the vast majority of NASA's employees would be sent home without pay and all but its most critical operations – including management of the International Space Station – would be paused.\n\nThe potential for a shutdown also comes as the agency is already bracing for severe funding cuts and layoffs under Trump's latest budget proposal. – Eric Lagatta\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/21/when-will-government-shutdown-end/86814877007/", "title": "When will the government shutdown end? 10 key dates to watch.", "text": "WASHINGTON − The federal government shutdown is already one of the nation's longest at 22 days, with no end in sight, as Democrats and Republicans in Congress remain locked in a bitter stalemate.\n\nThe shutdown has placed 750,000 federal workers on furlough, forced air traffic controllers and other essential workers to work without pay, and closed national parks, federal offices and museums.\n\nIn an escalation from past shutdowns, President Donald Trump has also laid off thousands of government employees and paused infrastructure projects in Democrat-led cities to try to pressure Democrats to act.\n\nWhen will the shutdown end? Watch for these 7 things\n\nDemocrats continue to demand the extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of Republicans' recent Medicaid cuts in a funding measure to reopen the government. Republicans insist the government should reopen with a \"clean bill\" that keep spending levels the same.\n\nA handful of Senate Democrats have broken with their party to vote for a Republican-backed bill to fund the government, but not enough to reach the 60-vote threshold to overcome a Democratic filibuster.\n\nLive updates: Government shutdown hits 3 weeks as furloughs mount\n\nHere are key dates to watch as the shutdown marches on:\n\nOct. 22 ‒ Shutdown becomes second longest\n\nOn Tuesday, the shutdown tied the 1995-1996 shutdown as the second-longest in history. And on Wednesday, Oct. 23, it becomes the second-longest at 22 days, now trailing only the 35-day shutdown in 2018 during Trump's first term in office.\n\nThe 1995-95 shutdown, during the presidency of Bill Clinton, was sparked by a spending disagreement between Clinton and Democrats and Republicans led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich. It was not a continuous shutdown but rather two separate shutdowns, from Nov. 14 to Nov. 19, 1995, and later from Dec. 16, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996.\n\nOct. 24 ‒ first full paychecks of federal workers missed\n\nFederal employees are set to miss their first full paychecks on Friday, Oct. 24, if the government remains closed.\n\nDepending on their agencies, federal employees' next paychecks are scheduled for Oct. 24, Oct. 28 or Oct. 30. In all, more than 1.8 million paychecks will be withheld from civilian employees of federal agencies if the shutdown lasts through October, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nFederal workers received their Oct. 10 paychecks, but it was only their partial salaries because the pay period included three days of the shutdown, Oct. 1 to Oct. 4.\n\nOct. 25 ‒ Trump leaves for Asia\n\nTrump is set to depart Washington on Saturday, Oct. 25, for a multiday, multicountry visit to Asia.\n\nThat means if a deal to reopen the government is not reached by the weekend, it probably would extend until Trump's return to the United States. Not only is Trump's involvement in negotiations widely seen as crucial for a resolution, there's also a more practical consideration: Trump must sign any funding bill to end the shutdown.\n\nIt's unclear how long Trump will be out of the country, but the trip is expected to wrap up at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in South Korea, which is set for Oct. 31 and Nov. 1. There, Trump is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nOct. 31 ‒ Next paycheck for military members due\n\nMembers of the military received their Oct. 15 paychecks, but it is unclear whether the government has the money for their next paychecks on Oct. 31.\n\nThe nation's service members are considered essential employees who work without assurances of pay during shutdowns. The Department of War, at Trump's instruction, altered the Pentagon's budget to ensure they received their most recent paychecks Oct. 15.\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson said Trump’s action to pay the nation's 1.3 million active-duty military members Oct. 15 was only a \"temporary fix.\"\n\n\"If the Democrats continue to vote to keep the government closed, as they have done so now so many times, then we know that U.S. troops are going to risk missing a full paycheck at the end of this month,\" Johnson said.\n\nOct. 31 and Nov. 5 ‒ next checks for congressional staff\n\nStaff members of U.S. senators missed their first paychecks on Monday, Oct. 20. They will miss their next checks, scheduled for Nov. 5, if the shutdown is still going on.\n\nHouse aides are paid once a month and are at risk of missing their Oct. 31 paychecks.\n\nNov. 1 ‒ Open enrollment for Obamacare begins\n\nDemocrats have circled Nov. 1 as a key deadline for Congress to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act credits as part of a bill to reopen the government.\n\nNov. 1 is when open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, begins and millions of Americans begin shopping for their 2026 health coverage plans.\n\nIf the subsidies are not extended by November, healthcare.gov consumers could experience sticker shock when they start searching for their health care plans. Premiums are expected to double for millions of Americans if the subsidies are not renewed, according to the research organization KFF.\n\nRepublicans have argued Democrats should vote to reopen the government now and debate health care policy afterward.\n\nNov. 1 ‒ Head Start funding at risk\n\nEarly childhood Head Start programs for low-income families will be at risk of disruptions if the government is not reopened by Nov. 1.\n\nAn additional 135 Head Start centers across 41 states would miss federal grant funding they would typically receive Nov. 1, jeopardizing services for about 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association.\n\nSix Head Start programs serving about 6,500 children are already operating without federal funding after missing grant dollars on Oct. 1, the first day of the shutdown.\n\nNov. 5 ‒ Record for longest shutdown\n\nIf the shutdown lasts until Nov. 5, it will break the record for the federal government's longest shutdown.\n\nThat mark now belongs to the 2018-2019 shutdown during Trump's first presidency, in which Republicans and Democrats battled over funding Trump's wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nNov. 21 ‒ Thanksgiving travel begins before the holiday\n\nCongress could face increasing pressure to reopen the government by Friday, Nov. 21, when traveling starts to spike before Thanksgiving on Nov. 27.\n\nLike other essential government workers, about 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration officers have worked during the government shutdown without pay.\n\nIn 2019, during the 35-day shutdown, the number of absences by controllers and TSA officers rose as workers missed paychecks, extending checkpoint wait times at some airports. Authorities were forced to slow air traffic in New York and Washington, which pressured lawmakers to quickly end the standoff.\n\nNov. 24 ‒ Holiday break for lawmakers\n\nMembers of Congress could be motivated to reopen the government before their weeklong Thanksgiving vacations begin Nov. 24.\n\nBut if the shutdown continues beyond the nation's turkey and football holiday, then lawmakers are set to return to Washington to work for the first three weeks of December.\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/10/01/are-banks-closed-today-see-if-banks-open-during-government-shut-down-impact-affected-shutdown-2025/86453451007/", "title": "Are banks closed today?

Essential offices, like the National Security Council, will continue operating, while others will be scaled back.\n\nIs the president paid during government shutdown?\n\nThe president’s salary of $400,000 per year is generally not affected by a shutdown.\n\n\"With regard to the President’s pay, Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution forbids the salary of the President to be reduced while he or she is in office, thus effectively guaranteeing the President of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" reads a 2018 Congressional Research Service report.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump donated his presidential salary to various departments and agencies and says he plans on doing the same during this term as well.\n\nDo members of Congress get paid during government shutdown?\n\nLawmakers will continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown under Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution, which protects Congress' pay.\n\n“The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States,\" the Constitution states.\n\nWhile members of Congress are expected to receive their paychecks, some lawmakers such as Sen. Andy Kim (D-New Jersey), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-New Jersey) and Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Florida), say they will not take compensation during the shutdown.\n\n“It’s wrong that the President and Members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown when our military and public servants don’t,” Kim said in a statement to NBC News. “I will be refusing my own pay if we end up in a shutdown.

We’ve got extreme partisan polarization, we have extreme gridlock, and now we have a government that is not being funded,\" said Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University.\n\nThe shut down comes as President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats blamed each other for failing to reach an agreement in a bitter standoff over funding the government.\n\nIt marks the 15th government shutdown since 1981, and there’s no end in sight as Democratic lawmakers demand health care policy changes that Trump and Republicans have refused to entertain, USA TODAY reported.\n\nHere's what we know about how shutdown will impact the region, its national parks, national forests and more.\n\nAre Blue Ridge Parkway, Great Smoky Mountains NP open?\n\nIf the shutdown drags on, the region could see impacts to its national parks, including the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Cooper said he is watching to see to what degree the parks will close or reduce facilities.\n\nThis was of particular concern as WNC approaches the peak of fall color season, with October among Asheville’s highest visitation months. Last year’s leaf peeping was halted by Tropical Storm Helene, a significant blow to area tourism.\n\nAccording to its website, the parkway is open as of Wednesday morning, except for Helene-related closures near Linville and Little Switzerland. There are also closures in northern sections near the Virginia state line due to multi-year road construction projects.\n\nClosed signs hung on the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center in Asheville. A parkway spokesperson sent an out-of-office email reply, stating they were not authorized to work and that questions should be directed to the National Park Service office in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"The National Park Service will continue to keep parks as accessible as possible during the lapse in appropriations,\" a park service spokesperson told the Citizen Times Oct. 1. \"Critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response.\"\n\nEastern National, which runs the gift shops in the Folk Art Center and the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center in Asheville, did not respond to Citizen Times requests for comment.\n\nIn the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the following facilities are closed, according to the park's website:\n\nCades Cove Loop Road\n\nCades Cove Picnic Area\n\nCades Cove Visitor Center\n\nChimneys Picnic Area\n\nSugarlands Visitor Center\n\nMost park roads, lookouts and open-trail memorials will remain open, according to the NPS' contingency plan. Sanitation, trash collection, road maintenance, campground operations, staffing entrance gates, law enforcement and emergency operations will continue as necessary.\n\n\"Park websites and social media will not be maintained, except for emergency communications. Parks will not provide regular road or trail condition updates,\" the document reads.\n\nAs Cooper considered possible impacts, he also referenced the about 750,000 people that could be furloughed each day, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, withholding about $400 million in daily compensation.\n\n“Those workers might have been planning a trip to Western North Carolina during the height of tourist season, and they might not be in a financial position to do that anymore,” Cooper said.\n\n“Just the uncertainty that a shutdown like this can provide will reverberate through the economy at the worst possible time for our region.”\n\nThe NPS is expected to furlough 9,296 employees, per their contingency plan. The parkway only resumed services to one of its most popular stretches in mid-September after the National Park Service announced the completion of landslide repairs caused by Helene near Mt. Mitchell State Park.\n\nThough parkway gates have remained open during previous shutdowns, it has led to significant service impacts along the iconic scenic byway.\n\nIn 2019, the last federal government shut down, some gates were closed, the Citizen Times reported, blocking vast swathes of the road. Maintenance staff were furloughed, and trees fell blocking sections.\n\nIs the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site open?\n\nAn answering machine message at the Carl Sandburg Home Oct. 1 said that staff will be out of office until federal funding for the site resumes.\n\nAn NPS spokesperson declined a Sept. 30 interview request regarding how the federal shutdown will affect operations at the site.\n\nAre WNC's national forests open?\n\nThe United States Forest Service will have an estimated five days to complete shutdown activities, according to the department’s Lapse in Funding Plan. But Pisgah and Nantahala national forests will remain open to visitors, at least for now.\n\nA spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the forest service, said national forests and grasslands will remain open to visitors. Wildland firefighting and disaster response will continue. However, this may change depending on the length of the shutdown, the spokesperson said.\n\n“Roads, campgrounds and other sites throughout all of North Carolina’s four national forests — Pisgah and Nantahala in the mountains, Uwharrie in the Piedmont and Croatan on the coast — remain open at least for the short term,\" according to Visit NC.\n\nNaventure, which manages campgrounds and recreation areas in the Pisgah National Forest, does not anticipate any of their sites will be impacted by the government shutdown, according to General Manager Cindy Pearce.\n\n\"However, we are awaiting official guidance from the U.S. Forest Service. If there are any closures, we will share updates on our social media channels as well as through recreation.gov for any reservation holders,\" Pearce said in a statement to the Citizen Times.\n\nShould there be a closure, the campground host will contact those on site directly, she added.\n\nChecking the weather before going to the parks?\n\nThe National Weather Service will continue issuing weather watches and warnings as normal, spokesperson Erica Grow Cei told the Citizen Times via email.\n\nWhen asked if any employees were furloughed, she said NWS “cannot provide further comment at this time.\"\n\nWNC representatives weigh in\n\nU.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, a second-term Republican representing much of Western North Carolina, said in an Oct. 1 statement that the government “must reopen.”\n\n\"Democrats in the House and the Senate have chosen partisan politics over the safety and security of the American people — a true injustice to millions of Americans,” he said.\n\nEdwards said that votes against the temporary spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, “halts payments to the men and women of our armed forces, weakens border security, opens the door to hardship on America’s seniors, and blocks much-needed relief for the victims of Hurricane Helene in Western North Carolina.”\n\nBoth U.S. senators representing North Carolina, Ted Budd and Thom Tillis, voted for the Republican proposal to keep the government at existing funding levels through Nov. 21.\n\nBudd said Oct. 1 on social media platform X, that Democrats are “holding the nation hostage to appease their radical left base.”\n\nDemocrats demanded concessions to health care in exchange for their votes to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold, such as the reversal of Medicaid cuts and the extension of enhanced health insurance subsidies, USA TODAY reported.\n\nOf the shutdown’s impact on Helene recovery efforts, Budd said while debris removal and emergency protective programs will continue, other reimbursements may be delayed, like road and bridge repair and work on dams and levees.\n\nIn an Oct. 1 statement to the Citizen Times, Tillis spokesperson Daniel Keylin said “this shutdown couldn't come at a worse time for Western North Carolina.”\n\n“It is especially reckless for Democrats to vote for a shutdown considering we are in the midst of hurricane season and FEMA doesn't have the money it needs to respond to another devastating storm like Helene,” the statement said.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nRyley Ober is the Public Safety Reporter for Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA Today Network.

And there’s no end in sight, as Democratic lawmakers demand health care policy changes that Trump and Republicans have refused to entertain, USA TODAY reported.\n\nAs a result, many federal employees are furloughed in the Asheville-area, including those at the Blue Ridge Parkway, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, U.S. Forest Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAbout 95% of employees have been furloughed from National Centers for Environmental Information’s 30-person staff in Asheville, which was hit hard earlier this year by staffing cuts, according to Brandee Morris, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 446. With headquarters in Asheville, the NCEI office manages a massive archive of climate data collected by NOAA scientists, researchers and others.\n\nOther workers, including National Park Service law enforcement rangers, are forced to report for work without pay, Morris said. While those employees will eventually get back pay, there is no clear indication of when that might happen. Morris said she’s seen cases where that’s “taken months” after a shutdown ended.\n\nMorris said she is concerned this will exacerbate an already diminished workforce and group morale, following a federal hiring freeze, probationary worker terminations, and the rollout of a deferred resignation program.\n\nAbout 300 Asheville employees with the Department of Veterans Affairs resigned this year through the federal government’s voluntary buyout or deferred resignation programs, according to Morris. However, the department is under a continued resolution, meaning their budget was passed last year and employees will not be furloughed during this shutdown, Morris said.\n\nNearly 60 others took the resignation deal at Asheville’s NCEI, the Citizen Times reported. At least a dozen parkway employees also did, according to James Jones, a parkway maintenance staffer and an AFGE Local 446 member.\n\n“People are quitting like crazy. It’s exhausting, and they’re scared for their livelihood,” Morris said.\n\nAnd now, with the shutdown, Morris’ biggest fear is that the administration will follow through on further reductions in force, or “RIFs.”\n\nRussell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Republican lawmakers in a private call on Oct. 1 that mass reductions in force will begin in “a day or two.” Morris said she has not heard of any RIFs being sent to local employees as of Oct. 3.\n\n“In this shutdown, we’ve been used as political pawns. It’s setting a bad, dangerous precedent for the future,” Jones said.\n\nThe parkway is already “down to the bare minimum,” Jones said. Should a reduction in force hit, Jones believes it would be “devastating for the parkway” and its visitors.\n\n“We’re barely staying afloat as is, trying to keep things moving and maintain.”\n\nSome Blue Ridge Parkway maintenance continues\n\nJones, a combat veteran who has worked maintenance on the parkway for 28 years, said this shutdown is different in one important way. A couple of maintenance staffers are getting paid through the park service's user fee fund to keep operations going at a minimum.\n\nOn a rotating shift, these employees will work a couple of hours a day to clean bathrooms, pick up trash, and other maintenance work.\n\nTravelers can still drive to scenic overlooks, hike trails, camp out, and picnic on the parkway. The last direction Jones said he received was that the parkway will operate at “status quo.”\n\nThe Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation announced Oct. 3 that it will fund the reopening of three parkway facilities that had closed due to the shutdown, including the Parkway Visitor Center in Asheville and the Museum of North Carolina Minerals in Spruce Pine. The opening will last for seven days, starting Oct. 4.\n\nNonprofits like the Friends of the Smokies, local governments and the state of Tennessee coordinated a plan to reopen the Great Smoky Mountains National Park until at least Oct. 10, after the shutdown caused services to go offline as well as popular sites like Cades Cove.\n\nOctober is one of the busiest months for the parkway and the Smokies as visitors seek fall colors, especially as last year’s leaf peeping was halted by Tropical Storm Helene, a significant blow to area tourism. Even though law enforcement are still working, Jones said it’s still going to be a challenge to keep people safe with limited staff.\n\nThe Blue Ridge Parkway is the most-visited unit of the National Park Service, drawing nearly 17 million visitors in 2024. About 2 million of those visitors come in October. Great Smoky Mountain is the busiest national park, with some 12.1 million visitors last year.\n\nThe Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks conducted surveys of national parks across the country during the partial government shutdown. The coalition found that there was no removal of invasive species, no routine or preventative maintenance, ongoing research was minimized or compromised and parks suffered from resource damage.\n\n“The resources are going to take a hit,” Jones said.\n\nRyley Ober is the Public Safety Reporter for Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA Today Network.

The aurora could be seen in parts of Iowa, North Dakota and Kansas.\n\nWhat are the northern lights?\n\nThe northern lights, according to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, are a luminous glow seen around the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. Known for creating ribbons of colorful light in the night sky, the aurora borealis are polar lights, or aurora polaris, that appear in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe southern hemisphere has its own polar lights known as the southern lights, or aurora australis, which create their own dazzling display.\n\nWhat causes the northern lights?\n\nPut simply, auroras a result of the sun interacting with the earth’s atmosphere. A collision between electrically charged particles from the sun and gases in Earth’s atmosphere produces a series of minuscule flashes which appear like moving lights in the sky. The charged particles are pulled towards the North and South poles due to earth’s magnetic field.\n\nWhile that magnetic field usually protects the earth from solar winds, the winds can occasionally get strong enough to bypass the field, allowing particles and gases in the magnetosphere to interact and generate the colorful displays, according to the Geophysical Institute and the Canadian Space Agency.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/07/northern-lights-video-shows-minnesota-sky/75554704007/", "title": "Northern lights seen on video dancing across Minnesota night sky", "text": "A photographer in Minnesota was able to capture video of a mesmerizing northern lights display as swirls of red and green danced across the night sky.\n\nAnother geomagnetic storm made the colorful phenomena known as aurora borealis visible during the weekend across the Midwest region of the United States, and Carol Bauer was there to document it Sunday in Grand Marais.\n\n“My husband and I traveled to Grand Marais to see the fall colors and were thrilled to get a great view of the northern lights too,” Bauer told Storyful.\n\nBauer is among millions of Americans who should expect to have more opportunities in the coming months to catch the striking display as the sun reaches the height of its 11-year cycle.\n\nWatch the video Carol Bauer captured of the Northern Lights:\n\nNorthern lights visible across Midwest\n\nLast week, a massive solar flare accompanied by coronal mass ejections – clouds of plasma and charged particles – made their way toward our planet, driving a geomagnetic storm that made the auroras visible in multiple northern U.S. states.\n\nThough the the natural light display in Earth's sky is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, the northern lights became visible during the weekend across the U.S. In addition to Minnesota, the stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers could be seen in places along the U.S.-Canada border and even as far south as Oregon and Pennsylvania, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center.\n\nPeak northern lights activity: What to know as sun reaches solar maximum\n\nPeak aurora activity to coincide with height of solar cycle\n\nFortunately for aurora chasers, there will be far more opportunities to catch the northern lights soon.\n\nElectromagnetic activity is increasing as the sun continues to reach the height of its 11-year solar cycle, which NASA said is expected to be in 2025.\n\nAs the sun reaches the peak of Solar Cycle 25, sunspots located in regions of intense magnetic activity should increase, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The Space Weather Prediction Center updates its aurora forecast every 30 minutes at swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast.\n\nWhen will the northern lights be visible?\n\nAssuming the weather is clear, the best time to see the northern lights is usually within an hour or two of midnight, so between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. This time tends to be the best for viewing as geomagnetic actively increases toward evening and morning.\n\nFolks hoping to catch a view should also find the darkest spot, away from city lights. Artificial lights and even the moon diminish the apparent brightness of the northern lights.\n\nWhat causes the northern lights?\n\nAccording to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, the northern lights are caused by collisions between electrically-charged particles that enter Earth's atmosphere from space and collide with molecules and atoms of gas, like oxygen and nitrogen. As a result, the molecules gain energy. To return to their normal state, the molecules release energy in the form of light.\n\nAs for the colors of the northern lights, these are determined by Earth's atmosphere and the altitude of the molecular collisions, according to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. Typically, the northern lights give off a \"striking green,\" but reds, pinks, blues, purples, yellows and oranges can also be visible.\n\nWhy is northern lights activity increasing?\n\nThe northern lights are often associated with the Earth's poles but recently, the natural display has been more visible throughout the United States.\n\nNow that our solar system's sun is at the height of its 11-year solar cycle, there is an increase in solar activity that produces the right conditions for northern lights to flourish.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, some of this solar activity includes solar flares. Sometimes, solar flares are accompanied by highly-charged bubbles of the sun's plasma, which comes from the sun's outer atmosphere, the corona. As the bubbles radiate outward, they carry the sun's magnetic field with them. When one of these bubbles collides with Earth's magnetosphere, the barrier that protects the planet from space weather, a geomagnetic storm occurs. A geomagnetic storm tends to result in a visible northern lights.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, USA TODAY\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

But thanks to the solar storm, which could pose a minimal threat to things like satellites, GPS signals and power grids, the display may be more widely visible than normal.\n\nThat's because when the solar particles interact with Earth's magnetosphere, the powerful eruption should make the vibrant northern lights visible to more of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nHere's what to know about the northern lights and how to see them this weekend from Minnesota.\n\nWhere will the auroras be visible?\n\nFor most of the time, auroras are best seen around the magnetic poles of the Northern and Southern hemispheres in Europe, Asia and North America. In the U.S., Alaska is well known to have the best viewing opportunities for the northern lights.\n\nBut an incoming solar storm should make the auroras visible farther from the poles, according to NOAA’s three-day forecast. The geomagnetic activity detected by NOAA has a Kp index of 5, meaning the northern lights will also be brighter, according to the agency.\n\n\"If you are in the right place, these aurora can be quite pleasing to look at,\" NOAA says.\n\nIn the U.S., the auroras may become visible in more than a dozen northern states, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center's experimental Aurora view line. The visibility for viewing also will depend on local weather conditions and city lights.\n\nNorthern lights forecast: Auroras may be visible in more than a dozen northern US states\n\nStates that may have a decent view of the auroras on Friday are:\n\nMinnesota\n\nWashington\n\nIdaho\n\nMontana\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWisconsin\n\nMichigan\n\nA thin red 'viewline' representing the southern-most locations from which you may see the aurora on the northern horizon extends to:\n\nWyoming\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nIowa\n\nNew York\n\nVermont\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMaine\n\nWhen is the best time to see the northern lights?\n\nSolar storms send particles flowing from the sun that get caught up in Earth's magnetic field, causing colorful auroras to form as they interact with molecules of atmospheric gases. This weekend, the resulting glowing auroras may be quite a sight – if you look up at the right time.\n\nEven though conditions are prime for more impending aurora shows, experts have long struggled to accurately forecast exactly when and where the phenomenon will ever occur. Even the best predictions can accurately be made only a few days or even hours in advance.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if the weather is clear, the best aurora is usually visible within an hour or two of midnight, according to NOAA. And if it looks as if the northern lights will flare up near you, you should get away from cities and travel to dark locations free from light pollution so you can best see them.\n\nThe agency also maintains an aurora dashboard that should help skygazers track the phenomenon.\n\nWhat causes the northern lights?\n\nThe auroras are a natural light display in Earth's sky that are famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nThe phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with molecules and gases like oxygen and nitrogen, causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks Geophysical Institute website, which tracks the phenomenon.\n\nAs auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and even pink dance about in the sky depends on the altitude where the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time.\n\nWhy northern lights activity is increasing\n\nNow that the sun is at the height of its 11-year cycle, the increase in solar activity has more frequently fueled \"space weather\" that produces the right conditions for northern lights to flourish.\n\nRegions of intense magnetic activity known as sunspots are proliferating on the solar surface and are capable of releasing intense bursts of radiation resulting in solar flares that can hurtle toward Earth at the speed of light, according to NOAA. Some of the flares can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections, or clouds of plasma and charged particles, that emerge from the sun's outermost atmosphere, the corona.\n\nThese ejections can collide with Earth’s magnetosphere, the barrier protecting humanity from the harshest effects of space weather, to produce geomagnetic storms that unleash spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible.\n\nWhat's more, because NASA expects the solar maximum to continue into 2025, aurora chasers should have plenty more opportunities to catch the northern lights.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

For millions of Americans and others across the globe, that became abundantly evident in May when a record powerful solar storm helped create optimal conditions for the auroras to put on a light show for far more spectators than usual.\n\nWhat's more, as the sun reaches the height of its 11-year cycle, skygazers across the world may only be treated to better and more frequent opportunities to witness the northern lights.\n\nFor aurora chasers, those opportunities should continue this year and well into 2025. Here's everything to know about the northern lights and how to see them as the sun reaches its solar maximum.\n\nNorthern lights activity to increase during solar maximum\n\nElectromagnetic activity is increasing as the sun continues to reach the height of its 11-year solar cycle, which NASA said is expected to be in 2025.\n\nAs the sun reaches the peak of Solar Cycle 25, sunspots located in regions of intense magnetic activity should increase, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. When that magnetic activity is released, it creates intense bursts of radiation resulting in solar flares – considered by NASA to be our solar system's largest explosive events.\n\nSolar flares emit radiation, mostly in the form of ultraviolet light and X-rays, that can hurtle toward Earth at the speed of light. Some of these flares can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections, or clouds of plasma and charged particles, that emerge from the sun's outermost atmosphere, the corona.\n\nThese ejections can collide with Earth’s magnetosphere, the barrier protecting humanity from the harshest impacts of space weather, to produce geomagnetic storms.\n\nGeomagnetic storms can spark northern lights to appear\n\nThat may sound scary, and due to the elevated risk for things like disrupted satellite signals, radio communications, internet and electrical power grids, it could be.\n\nBut the heightened potential for more geomagnetic storms also may mean more impressive northern lights displays.\n\nIn May, a powerful geomagnetic storm was responsible for some reports of power grid irregularities and interference with GPS signals – even farming equipment. On the bright side, it did also unleash spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible.\n\nThe celestial show came after NOAA issued a rare storm watch for the first time in 19 years for a geomagnetic storm classified as a G4 – a single level away from being the most severe solar storm possible. Amid the solar activity, the sun even emitted an explosive burst of radiation that became the largest solar flare detected since 2017, according to the NOAA.\n\nThe phenomenon, which has made several recent appearances across the U.S. was also notably visible again in August during the Perseids, considered among astronomers to be the best meteor shower of the year.\n\nWhat causes the auroras?\n\nThe auroras are a natural light display in Earth's sky that are famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nThe phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with molecules and gasses like oxygen and nitrogen, causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute website, which tracks the phenomenon.\n\nAs auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that has fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and even pink dance about in the sky is due to altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time.\n\nWhere and when can the northern lights be seen?\n\nThe solar storms send particles flowing from the sun that get caught up in Earth's magnetic field, causing colorful auroras to form as they interact with molecules of atmospheric gases. In the months ahead, the resulting glowing auroras may be quite a sight to see – if you look up at the right place and time.\n\nThe auroras are best seen around the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres in places like Europe, Asia and North America. In the United States, Alaska is well known to have the best viewing opportunities for the northern lights.\n\nEven though conditions are prime for more impending aurora shows, experts have long struggled to accurately forecast exactly when and where the phenomenon will ever occur. Even the best predictions can only accurately be made a few days or even hours in advance.\n\nNOAA, however, does maintain an aurora dashboard that should help skygazers track the phenomenon.\n\nAnd if it looks like the northern lights will flare up near you, it's advised to get away from cities and travel to dark locations free from light pollution. If the weather is clear, the best aurora is usually visible within an hour or two of midnight, according to NOAA.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Will the weather in ...", "text": "Skygazers may get a chance to view the signature dancing glow of the northern lights this week from several U.S. states.\n\nThe phenomenon will be viewable two nights in a row this week, including late Tuesday into early Wednesday and again Wednesday night, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center.\n\nCaused by solar eruptions that sent charged particles towards Earth's magnetic pull over the weekend, the coveted light display will be most viewable by lucky Canadians and residents of Alaska. However, a solid handful of Northern U.S. states may also have a chance to steal a glimpse.\n\nHere's what to know about this week's chance to view the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights.\n\nWhat are the 'northern lights' aka aurora borealis?\n\nThe northern lights are a luminous glow seen around the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres, according to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. Known for creating ribbons of colorful light in the night sky, the aurora borealis are polar lights, or aurora polaris, that appear in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe southern hemisphere has its own polar lights known as the southern lights, or aurora australis, which create their own dazzling display.\n\nPut simply, auroras are a result of the sun interacting with the Earth’s atmosphere. A collision between electrically charged particles from the sun and gases in Earth’s atmosphere produces a series of minuscule flashes that appear like moving lights in the sky. The charged particles are pulled toward the North and South poles due to Earth’s magnetic field.\n\nWhile that magnetic field usually protects the Earth from solar winds, the winds can occasionally get strong enough to bypass the field, allowing particles and gases in the magnetosphere to interact and generate the colorful displays, according to the Geophysical Institute and the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nWhen will the aurora borealis be viewable?\n\nPeople in Canada and some parts of the Northern U.S. may get chances to see the aurora display on the nights of Tuesday, April 15 and Wednesday, April 16.\n\nPredicting the timing to view is a less-than-perfect science, as experts rely on NASA satellites to measure the impacts of the solar wind and magnetic intensity. Check NOAA's 30-minute Aurora forecast to get regular updates on the best times for viewing.\n\nWho will be able to see the aurora borealis?\n\nIn the U.S., the celestial display will only be viewable in the northernmost region. According to NOAA's projection, this could include at least some visibility from:\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMontana\n\nMinnesota\n\nWashington\n\nMichigan\n\nWisconsin\n\nMaine\n\nOregon\n\nIdaho\n\nWyoming\n\nIowa\n\nNew York\n\nNebraska\n\nIllinois\n\nVermont\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPennsylvania\n\nAccuWeather estimated that, if the geomagnetic storm is strong enough, the lights could be visible even farther south than these states. Plus, according to the weather source, you may be able to use long-exposure photography to capture images of the lights even if you can't see them with the naked eye.\n\nWeather forecast for viewing the northern lights in Greencastle\n\nUnfortunately for some, Accuweather is predicting conditions that may get in the way of optimal viewing.\n\nAs of Tuesday, its meteorologists said the Northeast and eastern Great Lakes region is expected to get some wintry weather characterized by cloudy conditions, rain, cold temperatures and even snow, though cloud cover is expected to improve Wednesday night.\n\nAccuweather forecasts cloudy skies over much of Franklin County on Tuesday, but mostly clear on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Midwest and northern Plains region will probably have the best weather for viewing Tuesday night, said AccuWeather, though cloud cover is expected by Wednesday night. The Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains are also expected to contend with cloudy weather on Tuesday night, though conditions may clear in Washington and Oregon by Wednesday night.\n\nAs with most celestial phenomena, the best viewing is during the darkest hours of the night and early morning in less densely populated areas away from light pollution.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/15"}]}

Satellite imagery showed a massive ash cloud and shockwaves spreading from the eruption. Ash was falling from the sky in the Tonga capital, Nuku’alofa, Saturday evening and phone connections were down.\n\nThe eruption caused a severe tsunami on Tongatapu, where the capital is located, with waves flowing onto coastal roads and flooding properties on Saturday.\n\nSo far, New Zealand authorities have not received any reports of deaths or injuries in Tonga related to the eruption, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Expert explains what's happening in 'jaw-dropping' eruption video 02:12 • Source: CNN Expert explains what's happening in 'jaw-dropping' eruption video 02:12\n\nThe tsunami had a “significant impact” on Nuku’alofa, with boats and large boulders washed ashore, and shops along the coast damaged, she added.\n\nRNZ reported that residents fled for higher ground as waves swept the waterfront, main street and grounds of Tonga’s Royal Palace. Though it was early evening, videos show the sky already dark from the ash cloud.\n\nTonga’s King Tupou VI was evacuated from the palace, RNZ said, citing local media reports of a convoy of police and troops rushing the monarch to a villa at Mata Ki Eua.\n\nTelecommunications were affected, though it’s not clear how widespread the damage is yet, Ardern said, adding that the main undersea cable has been impacted likely due to loss of power.\n\nThe New Zealand government has committed an initial $340,000 in relief supplies, technical support, and supporting local responses, with the country’s Defence Force sending assistance to Tonga, Ardern said.\n\nShe added that while conditions in the area seem stable, further eruption activity cannot be ruled out.\n\nImpact in Japan\n\nThe eruption also had effects across the Pacific, as tsunami warnings and advisories were issued from parts of New Zealand and Japan to the United States and Canada’s British Columbia.\n\nPer the National Weather Service, a tsunami warning means those nearby should get inland or seek higher ground immediately, while an advisory means they should stay away from the shore and out of the water.\n\nJapan’s Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami advisory for the country’s coastal areas early Sunday morning, with the northeastern prefecture of Iwate seeing waves as high as 2.7 meters (9 feet). Multiple smaller tsunamis were reported in numerous other locations, according to public broadcaster NHK.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, all tsunami advisories had been lifted, the meteorological agency said. Weather agency officials ruled out the possibility of further tsunamis across the country, but said there might be some tidal fluctuations.\n\nJapan’s coast guard was out assessing damage, but so far none had been reported, NHK said, noting it was still dark and more waves were expected. Officials continued to ask people to stay alert and away from beaches.\n\nFootage shared on NHK from a viewer in Setouchi town, on Amami Oshima Island, showed bumper-to-bumper traffic as cars evacuated to higher ground. Other footage showed people sleeping on floors in evacuation centers in Iwate.\n\nA tsunami has hit Tonga's largest island, Tongatapu. @sakakimoana/Twitter\n\nElsewhere, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said it recorded a tsunami wave of 1.2 meters (about 4 feet) near Nuku’alofa at 5:30 p.m. local time on Saturday. And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said tsunami waves of 2.7 feet (0.8 meters) were observed by gauges at Nuku’alofa and waves of 2 feet at Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, Reuters reported.\n\nThe nearby island of Fiji also issued a public advisory asking people living in low-lying coastal areas to “move to safety in anticipation of the strong currents and dangerous waves.” Footage from the ground shows people fleeing to higher ground in Suva, the capital of Fiji, as large waves hit the coast.\n\nIn Samoa, another Pacific island nation, a tsunami watch is in effect for all low-lying coastal areas, the Samoa Meteorological Service said, with residents and visitors advised to stay away from beach areas.\n\nAn earlier tsunami advisory for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu was discontinued, with the country’s National Disaster Management issuing an “all clear.” The office had earlier advised residents to move away from the coastline and seek higher ground.\n\nWaves seen in the US\n\nThe eruption also sent waves to the US West Coast, with some exceeding 3 and 4 feet in height, according to the National Weather Service office in San Diego.\n\nThe highest waves recorded were in Port San Luis, California (4.3 feet); King Cove, Alaska (3.3 feet); Area Cove, California (3.7 feet); Crescent City, California (3.7 feet); and Port Reyes, California (2.9 feet).\n\nThe first tsunami waves were felt on the West Coast early Saturday morning, according to Dave Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator at the National Weather Service’s National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska.\n\nA wave as high as 1.2 feet had been observed in Nikolski, Alaska, he told CNN via telephone, while waves as tall as 1 foot were observed in Atka, Adak and King Cove, Alaska.\n\n“This may not be the largest wave as this is coming in yet,” Snider told CNN, saying the event was not over.\n\nAsh rises into the air after a powerful underwater volcanic eruption in the South Pacific. Tonga Geological Services/EyePress/Reuters\n\nThe initial coastal tsunami advisory included the states of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. All of the advisories had been lifted by early Sunday morning, according the Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning tweeted no damage was reported thus far from the tsunami observed in the Hawaiian Islands. A tsunami advisory for Hawaii was canceled by the agency Saturday morning.\n\nAdam Weintraub, a spokesperson for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, told CNN there were “no reports of major damage so far,” though the effects had been felt across multiple islands. Officials were still assessing the damage.\n\nThe impacts were the equivalent of a “high King Tide,” Weintraub said earlier, telling CNN there had been flooding in parking lots and harbor areas he characterized as “nuisance flooding.”\n\nSpeaking by telephone, Snider said, “We don’t have a really good forecast because this event is based on a volcano rather than an earthquake.”\n\nNonetheless, the National Weather Service in Seattle urged caution along the US Pacific Coast on Saturday. “Move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas in these areas,” NWS Seattle tweeted.\n\nThe city of Laguna Beach, California, closed all beaches, boardwalks, harbors and piers until further notice in response to the tsunami advisory early Saturday morning, telling residents, “please stay out of the water and away from the shore.”\n\nSanta Cruz, California, also experienced some “minor flooding” at the harbor, city manager Elizabeth Smith told CNN.\n\nHigh tide comes into a harbor in Santa Cruz, California, seen in this still image from a video obtained by CNN. The water quickly drained out, Brad Anderson -- the person that provided the video -- said. Brad Anderson\n\nThe waves came right at high tide, Fire Chief Rob Young said. The initial wave occurred at approximately 7:40 a.m. local time, he said, bringing with it a 1 to 2-foot wave right at the peak of high tide. The largest wave came in at about 8:49 a.m. local time, prompting a surge of about 7 feet at the harbor. A subsequent surge just after 10 a.m. was “diminished.”\n\n“When it comes, it comes quickly,” he said. “Not just a 1-foot wave, but it comes in a surge because it draws all the water out first, and then it comes in.”\n\nThere was some damage in the harbor and to some docks, he said. There was also “light flooding” on the beaches and up to the city’s first surface street, Young said.\n\nAll beaches and the harbor will be closed until at least noon local time, Smith said, and people were evacuated from nearby stores and the area near the harbor, though no one has been evacuated from their homes. A surf contest has been postponed and is expected to resume later Saturday.\n\nNew Zealand on alert\n\nA tsunami advisory was also issued for coastal areas on the north and east coast of New Zealand’s North Island and the Chatham Islands, where “strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore” were expected, according to New Zealand’s National Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNew Zealand’s official weather service said its weather stations across the country had observed “a pressure surge” on Saturday evening from the eruption.\n\nA satellite image taken by Himawari-8, a Japanese weather satellite, and released by the agency, shows an undersea volcano eruption at the Pacific nation of Tonga Saturday, January 15, 2022. Japan Meteorology Agency/AP\n\nScientist Emily Lane, of New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, told the New Zealand Science Media Centre it was a “very significant” eruption.\n\n“The shock wave from it is clearly visible in satellite imagery and there are reports of the eruption being heard at least as far away as New Zealand,” she said. “The tsunami from the eruption has reached over 2,500 kilometers being recorded on gauges over all of Aotearoa.”\n\nTsunamis generated by volcanoes are much less common than tsunamis from underwater earthquakes, Lane said.\n\nA smaller eruption in late 2014 and early 2015 built up the crater of the volcano to above the surface of the water, Lane added, but it’s not yet clear exactly how Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai erupted on this occasion. “When we see what is left of the island after this eruption is over we can start to put together the pieces of what happened,” she said.\n\nProfessor Shane Cronin, from the School of Environment at the University of Auckland, told the New Zealand Science Media Centre research into historical eruptions by the same volcano suggested the current eruption episode could last for weeks or months “and further similar-sized eruptions to the 15 January 2022 event are possible.”\n\n“The eruption is likely to result in significant ash fall (up to 10 centimeters) in Tongatapu as well as the Ha’apai group of islands,” he said. “Help will be needed to restore drinking water supplies. People of Tonga must also remain vigilant for further eruptions and especially tsunami with short notice and should avoid low-lying areas.”\n\nAn earlier tsunami warning issued for American Samoa has since been canceled, according to the NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThere is no tsunami threat to Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands from a “distant eruption,” according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThe volcano had been active from December 20, but was declared dormant on January 11, according to RNZ.", "authors": ["Alex Stambaugh Laura Smith-Spark Rhea Mogul Sophie Jeong Dakin Andone", "Alex Stambaugh", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Rhea Mogul", "Sophie Jeong", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/06/22/us-iran-nuclear-trump-live-updates/84304617007/", "title": "US on high alert after strikes on Iranian nuke sites; Trump floats ...", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites for Sunday, June 22. For the latest news, view our story for Monday, June 23.\n\nThe United States went on high alert on June 22 over concerns of retaliation from Tehran after the bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites a day earlier.\n\nMajor U.S. cities from New York to Los Angeles stepped up their security as the weekend came to a close. Government agencies issued warnings to U.S. citizens at home and abroad. And with Mideast tensions heightened, all eyes stayed glued to Iran and its response.\n\nFrom the Department of Homeland Security came notice in the United States of a \"heightened threat environment.\" Hours later, the State Department blasted out a “worldwide caution security alert” advising U.S. citizens overseas to exercise increased vigilance amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\nU.S. officials have heaped praise on the military operation conducted June 21, saying U.S. bombers shattered Iran's nuclear program in precision strikes − ones planned for weeks that involved 125 warplanes.\n\nWhile Israel hailed the strikes, many world leaders urged speedy de-escalation over fears of a widening Mideast conflict. Some lawmakers in the U.S. − including key progressives and rigid conservatives − questioned President Donald Trump's authority to launch the attack.\n\nFor his part, Trump wrote on social media that \"regime change\" may be needed in Iran just hours after Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not aiming for a change in leadership in Tehran.\n\nPutin to meet with Iran's foreign minister in Moscow\n\nAs Tehran weighed its options, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi is expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday.\n\nThe Kremlin has a strategic partnership with Iran, but also close links with Israel. Speaking in Istanbul on Sunday, Araqchi said his country would consider all possible responses and there would be no return to diplomacy until it had retaliated.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the U.S. attacks, which it said had undermined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and warned of conflict spreading in the Middle East.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nIran's military warns US of heavy consequences for siding with Israel\n\nRecent hostile action by the United States expanded the scope of legitimate targets for Iran's armed forces, a spokesperson for its Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters said in a video shared on Monday.\n\nEbrahim Zolfaqari said the U.S. should expect heavy consequences for its actions.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,\" Zolfaqari said in English at the end of his recorded statement.-- Reuters\n\nTrump says he's open to regime change in Iran\n\nJust hours after Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States did not want “regime change” in Iran, President Donald Trump said that might be a desired outcome.\n\n“It’s not politically correct to use the term, “Regime Change,” but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 22 as Mideast tensions continued to escalate the day after the U.S. military bombed three Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nTrump's post signaling an openness to new leadership in Tehran followed Vance and Rubio appearing on the Sunday morning talk shows, arguing the U.S. focus was not on launching a war with Iran.\n\nIsrael carried out airstrikes on military infrastructure in western Iran\n\nThe Israeli military said on Monday that about 20 jets had conducted a wave of strikes against military targets in western Iran and Tehran overnight.\n\n⁠In Kermanshah, in western Iran, missile and radar infrastructure was targeted, and in Tehran a surface-to-air missile launcher was struck, the Israeli military said, Reuters reported. The Israeli military added that a missile launched from Iran in the early hours of Monday was intercepted by Israeli defenses.\n\n--Reuters\n\nHow attacks unfolded: Visual details of US bombing in Iran\n\nJapan calls for de-escalation of Iran conflict\n\nJapan called on June 23 for de-escalation of the conflict in Iran and said U.S. strikes demonstrated Washington's determination to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nJapan also said it was \"extremely regrettable\" the situation between Israel and Iran had escalated into a cycle of retaliation, according to Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.\n\n\"Japan continues to strongly hope that the path to dialogue will be reopened by efforts toward a resolution of Iran's nuclear issue through talks between the U.S. and Iran,\" Iwaya said in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. had \"obliterated\" Tehran's key nuclear sites, joining Israel in the biggest Western military action against the Islamic Republic since its 1979 revolution.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier this month condemned Israel's military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, saying deployment for military use \"cannot be absolutely condemned.\"\n\n-- Reuters\n\nTrump to meet with his national security team\n\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security team in the Oval Office at 1 p.m. on June 23, according to the White House. The huddle will come two days after the U.S. military struck three Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nThe president is set to travel on June 24 to The Hague for the annual NATO summit.\n\n-- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nNorth Korea condemns U.S. strike on Iran\n\nNorth Korea said on June 23 it strongly condemns the U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities as a grave violation of a sovereign state's security interests and territorial rights, state media reported.\n\n\"(North Korea) strongly denounces the attack on Iran by the U.S. which ... violently trampled down the territorial integrity and security interests of a sovereign state,\" a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement carried by KCNA news agency.\n\nIran and nuclear-armed North Korea have maintained friendly ties and have been suspected for decades of military cooperation, including in developing ballistic missiles. A now-defunct panel of experts monitoring U.N. sanctions said in 2021 that the two countries had resumed cooperation on long-range missile development projects, including the transfer of critical parts.\n\n\"Pyongyang could provide important assistance in helping Iran reconstitute destroyed missile production facilities, including at new sites to avoid scrutiny, perhaps,\" said Ankit Panda, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhether either country would be interested in substantively cooperating on any efforts to rebuild or accelerate Iran's nuclear weapons program is less certain, given the political and military sensitivities over such technology, Panda said.\n\n-- Reuters\n\n'Bullseye!!!': Trump again says Iran’s nuclear sites have been ‘obliterated’\n\nPresident Donald Trump doubled down on his assertion that Iranian nuclear sites had been obliterated by U.S. bombardments a day after the attacks amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\n“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 22. “Obliteration is an accurate term! The white structure shown is deeply imbedded into the rock, with even its roof well below ground level, and completely shielded from flame.”\n\nExperts have raised questions about the extent to which recent Israeli and U.S. strikes have thwarted Iran's nuclear program. But that hasn’t given pause to Trump’s assessment of the damage.\n\n“The biggest damage took place far below ground level,” wrote Trump. “Bullseye!!!”\n\n-- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nOil hits five-month high after US strikes key Iranian nuclear sites\n\nOil prices jumped on June 23, local time, to their highest since January as Washington's weekend move to join Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities stoked supply worries.\n\nBrent crude futures rose $1.88 or 2.44% at $78.89 a barrel as of 11:22 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude advanced $1.87 or 2.53% at $75.71.\n\nBoth contracts jumped by more than 3% earlier in the session to $81.40 and $78.40, respectively, five-month highs, before giving up some gains.\n\nThe rise in prices came after President Donald Trump said he had \"obliterated\" Iran's main nuclear sites in strikes over the weekend, joining an Israeli assault in an escalation of conflict in the Middle East as Tehran vowed to defend itself.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nState Department issues worldwide caution alert and travel advisory\n\nThe State Department issued a “worldwide caution security alert” advising U.S. citizens overseas to exercise increased vigilance on June 22, amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\nThe department cited periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East and the potential for “demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad.”\n\nTravel advisories with threat levels ranging from levels 1 (exercise normal precautions) to 4 (do not travel) by country are listed in a searchable database online on the department’s website: Worldwide Caution - United States Department of State.\n\nPortugal, for example, has been designated Level 1; France is Level 2 (exercise increased caution) and Lebanon is Level 4.\n\n-- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nAustralia says it supports US strike, calls for return to diplomacy\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on June 23 that Canberra supported the United States strike on Iran and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy.\n\n\"We support action that the U.S. has taken to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\" Wong said in a television interview.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Wong said the strike was a unilateral action by its security ally the United States, and Australia was joining calls from Britain and other countries for Iran to return to the negotiating table.\n\n\"We do not want to see escalation,\" she told reporters in Canberra.\n\nThere are around 2,900 Australians in Iran and 1,300 in Iraq who are seeking to leave.\n\nMeanwhile, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on June 22 he was examining the evidence surrounding Iran's nuclear enrichment program, while Prime Minister Christopher Luxon called for a return to dialogue, Radio New Zealand reported.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nLaw enforcement agencies on alert after US attacks on Iran\n\nSeveral law enforcement agencies across the United States are deploying additional forces to protect potential targets from retaliatory attacks.\n\nThe New York Police Department, the nation’s largest police department, said it issued an advisory and deployed more resources hours after the June 21 attack.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we’re deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC and coordinating with our federal partners. We’ll continue to monitor for any potential impact to NYC,\" the police department said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass echoed a similar message regarding the city's police department.\n\n\"There are no known credible threats at this time and out of an abundance of caution, LAPD is stepping up patrols near places of worship, community gathering spaces and other sensitive sites,\" Bass said in a statement. \"We will remain vigilant in protecting our communities.\"\n\n-- Terry Collins\n\nTrump congratulates B-2 pilots upon landing in Missouri\n\nPresident Trump congratulated the group of B-2 Spirit stealth bomber pilots who returned to the U.S. after conducting airstrikes against three nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nThe B-2s departed from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri early on the morning of June 21 for the flight to Iran and returned in the early evening on June 22.\n\n\"The GREAT B-2 pilots have just landed, safely, in Missouri,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Thank you for a job well done!!! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!\"In an earlier version of the same post, Trump misspelled his own name, calling himself “Donakd.” as he congratulated the pilots.\n\n- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nUS leaders vow to 'defend ourselves' if Iran attacks\n\nU.S. leaders said earlier on June 22 that they remain ready to defend the country from any retaliatory actions from Iran.\n\n\"Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice. We will defend ourselves. The safety of our service members and civilians remains our highest priority,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said at a Pentagon briefing.\n\nArmy Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, has elevated force protection measures in the region, Caine said, “especially in Iraq, Syria and the Gulf.” There are about 40,000 U.S. troops in the region.\n\nIran strikes raise concerns about oil prices\n\nInvestors are bracing for higher oil prices after the U.S. bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend. Brent crude oil, which is the global benchmark, closed at $77 a barrel on June 20, up about 10% over the previous week as Iran and Israel traded attacks. That’s the highest since January.\n\nOil trading begins at 11 p.m. UK time on June 22, and prices are likely to jump at the open, but then stabilize relatively quickly until it becomes more clear that there is a sustained supply shock, said oil analyst Rachel Ziemba in an interview.\n\nIran produces less than 5% of the world’s oil supply, and almost all of that is exported to China illicitly, said Ziemba, who runs Ziemba Insights. Analysts are more concerned about the country’s ability to choke off the Strait of Hormuz, a possibility Ziemba calls “low probability, high risk.”\n\nStill, energy investors will struggle to price in that risk, which could make oil prices more volatile over the coming days and weeks, she said.\n\n− Andrea Riquier\n\nNot what 'MAGA wanted to hear': Tensions within GOP remain about Trump's Iran strike\n\nUS officials say Iran's nuke program is 'obliterated.' But is it?\n\nTrump and his defense chief say American warplanes completely \"obliterated\" Iran's three major nuclear complexes at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan using bunker-busting bombs that have the ability to penetrate underground targets.\n\nWhile that may be the case, there has so far been no independent assessment of that assertion from nuclear watchdogs, international officials or others with direct information of the situation on the ground. And other U.S. officials have not used such definitive rhetoric.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the main agency that assesses the scale and evolution of Iran's nuclear program, said hostilities would need to cease for it to resume inspections. The organization, housed within the United Nations, said it would hold an emergency meeting on June 23.\n\nThe IAEA did say June 22 that craters were visible at the Fordow site, Iran’s main location for enriching uranium But said: \"At this time, no one - including the IAEA - is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.\" Read more here.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nIran almost certainly will retaliate: But when, where and how?\n\nEuropean leaders react to US strikes: We urge Iran to negotiate\n\nThe leaders of the UK, France and Germany said in a joint statement June 22 that they would continue their diplomatic efforts to try and defuse tensions and ensure conflict does not spread further. They urged Iran not to take any actions that would further destabilize the region and called for the country to negotiate to address concerns with the nuclear program.\n\n\"We have consistently been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon and can no longer pose a threat to regional security,\" the government heads of the three countries said.\n\nMidnight Hammer operation uses 'bunker busters,' a first in US history\n\nThe U.S. used more than a dozen multi-million-dollar, 30,000-pound \"bunker busters\" to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities in the strike, marking the weapon's first operational use, according to the Pentagon.\n\nU.S. bomber planes dropped 14 of the massive bombs on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine told reporters.\n\nThe bombs used in the strikes, called Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, weigh 30,000 pounds each and cost millions to produce. MOPs, also known as the Guided Bomb Unit, or GBU-57, are GPS-guided weapons designed to burrow deep into underground targets, like fortified tunnels or bunkers. The bombs are about 20 feet long and span 6 feet at their widest point.\n\nWhile Israel has bunker-busters a fraction of its weight, only the MOP has the capability to destroy or severely damage Iran's nuclear facilities, experts previously told USA TODAY.\n\nIran government might close Strait of Hormuz, a major oil route\n\nThe Iranian parliament backed a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz following the U.S. strikes on the country, but the final decision will rest with Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Iran's Press TV reported June 22.\n\nAbout 20% of global oil and gas flow through the strait, which lies between Oman and Iran, and its closure could mean rising fuel prices for American consumers. The strait is 21 miles at its narrowest point, and the shipping lane is 2 miles wide in either direction.\n\nAsked whether Tehran would close Hormuz, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi didn't give a straight answer, saying: \"A variety of options are available to Iran.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio criticized any decision to block the narrow channel between Iran and Oman.\n\n“That would be a suicidal move on their part, because I think the whole world would come against them if they did that,” Rubio said in an interview with CBS.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar and Reuters\n\nLawmakers push back on Trump’s strikes under War Powers Act\n\nTrump’s ordered airstrikes have attracted criticism from both sides of the political aisle, and some lawmakers are charging that the president did not have the authority to call for the attack.\n\n“Our framers did not believe in the old way that a king could order a nation to war,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, said in an interview on Fox News Sunday. “Instead, the framers gave the power to Congress so we would have a debate in front of all the American public whose sons’ and daughters’ lives could potentially be at risk.”\n\nThe Constitution puts the power to declare war in Congress' hands, and the War Powers Resolution of 1973 mandates that the president notifies Congress within 48 hours of military action. The law also limits the deployment of armed forces beyond 90 days, in the absence of a formal declaration of war.\n\nKaine has introduced a resolution in the Senate seeking to block Trump’s actions in Iran. In the House, Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, have filed a similar measure based on the War Powers Act.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\n'We're not at war' with Iran, Vance insists\n\nVice President JD Vance argued in interviews on June 22 that the U.S. is not entering an open-ended conflict in the Middle East. “We’re not at war with Iran. We’re at war with Iran’s nuclear program.” Vance told NBC’s Kristen Welker.\n\n“We do not want war with Iran,” Vance added while on Meet The Press. “We actually want peace. But we want peace in the context of them not having a nuclear weapons program.”\n\nSeparately, on ABC, Vance described the strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran as “targeted.” The Pentagon’s attack on Iran’s nuclear facility employed its most powerful bunker-buster bomb as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from submarines, according to Pentagon officials.\n\nPentagon planners coordinated the attack with Israel to enter Iran’s airspace, said the official who had been briefed on the mission but was not authorized to speak publicly. B-2 bombers dropped GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs, the first time they have been used in combat.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar and Francesca Chambers\n\nOperation Midnight Hammer used sophisticated weapons\n\nThe U.S. attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, called Operation Midnight Hammer, differs in character, scope and destructive power from those that Trump ordered in his first administration.\n\nThose missions included a missile attack in Syria to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons, the raid to kill ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the drone that killed Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian who led its Quds force.\n\nThe Iranian attacks on Saturday involved some of the most sophisticated weapons in the Pentagon’s arsenal and tapped into its commands overseeing operations from the Middle East to outer space, Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Sunday.\n\nIt took weeks to plan the Saturday attack, which involved 125 warplanes − including nearly one-third of its most sophisticated stealth bomber fleet – and submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles.\n\nInside the attack: Details revealed of secret US mission to bomb Iran\n\nStrikes weren't aimed at Iran regime change, US officials say\n\nThe goal of the U.S. strikes on Iran was not to prompt a regime change, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the news briefing on the morning of June 22.\n\n\"This mission was not, has not been about regime change,\" Hegseth said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't denied that an Iran regime change is part of Israel's military objectives, however.\n\n\"It could certainly be the result because the Iran regime is very weak,\" Netanyahu said in an interview on Fox News' \"Special Report With Bret Baier\" a week ago. \"I think it's basically left with two things. Its plans to have atomic bombs and ballistic missiles. That's basically what Iran has. They certainly don't have the people. Eighty percent of the people would throw these theological thugs out.\"\n\nNuclear energy head fears Mideast dynamic has changed\n\nThe head of an international agency that encourages the peaceful use of nuclear technology said June 22 that the U.S. decision to bomb Iran has completely reset what was once slowly simmering tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\n“This changes the whole dynamic,” Rafel Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview on CNN.\n\nGrossi said Iran’s current governmental regime, which has been in place since 1979, has been one of the few stabilizing forces in an otherwise “very very unstable” international scene.”\n\n“I think the unraveling of the nonproliferation regime would be a tremendously serious consequence,” he said. “I think that now we need to try to go back to the negotiating table as soon as possible.”\n\n-- Erin Mansfield\n\nIsraeli president says US involvement in Iran is Trump’s decision\n\nThe president of Israel said on June 22 that the United States is acting in its interests and declined to say whether Israel would need additional resources.\n\n“We are not dragging America into a war, and we are leaving aid to the decision of the president of the United States and to the team,” Isaac Herzog said in an interview on CNN.\n\nHerzog said the U.S. decision to bomb Iran was made “because the Iranian nuclear program was (a) clear and present danger to the security interests of the free world, and the United States is the leader of the free world.”\n\n-- Erin Mansfield\n\nWas Iran's nuclear material really 'obliterated'?\n\nTrump and his top defense official, Hegseth, say U.S. bombers completely \"obliterated\" Iran's three major nuclear complexes at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.\n\nThat may turn out to be the case, though there has so far been no independent assessment of that assertion from nuclear watchdogs, international officials or others with direct information of the situation on the ground. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the main window for how the world assesses the scale and evolution of Iran's nuclear program, has not commented.\n\nAll wars are information wars, as well as ones fought with conventional weapons. One example: Iran's IRIB state broadcaster claimed that its stockpiles of enriched uranium were \"evacuated\" from all three sites before the U.S. strikes, another assertion that has not been independently verified.\n\nHegseth: Trump seeks peace, urges Iran to do the same\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth lauded the U.S. strikes on Iran as an \"incredible and overwhelming success.\"\n\nThe strikes did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people, Hegseth said. Trump \"seeks peace, and Iran should take that path,\" Hegseth said.\n\nHe noted that fighter pilots and sailors aboard ships and submarines joined the attack.\n\nUS: All 3 nuke sites sustained 'severe damage'\n\nCaine said the U.S. was \"currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in.\"\n\nThe three nuclear targets were struck from 6:40 p.m. to 7:10 p.m. ET, Caine said. He said the U.S. was also unaware of any shots fired on the way out of Iran.\n\nAll three nuclear sites \"sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" initial assessments indicate, Caine said.\n\nPope Leo urges peace, international diplomacy\n\nIn a weekly prayer on Sunday, Pope Leo XIV, the Catholic Church's first pope from the United States, called for diplomacy and peace efforts, not \"violence and bloody conflicts,\" shortly after the U.S.' military action against Iran.\n\n\"Every member of the international community has a moral responsibility: to stop the tragedy of war before it becomes an irreparable abyss,\" Leo said.\n\n\"In this dramatic scenario, which includes Israel and Palestine, the daily suffering of the population, especially in Gaza and other territories, risks being forgotten, where the need for adequate humanitarian support is becoming increasingly urgent,\" he said.\n\nIranians disconnected from world\n\nIranians have been intermittently cut off from the world since the start of Israel's air war on its military and nuclear sites more than a week ago, now joined by the United States.\n\nIran's government has imposed a near countrywide internet blackout in recent days, saying it was necessary to prevent Israeli cyberattacks and for unspecified security reasons, though some residents have reported the shutdown's efficacy has varied and sometimes they were able to get online. There have also been reported disruptions to cellphone text messages in Iran.\n\nOn June 22, NetBlocks, an organization that monitors global Internet access, reported that connectivity in Iran \"again collapsed\" in the hours before the U.S. strikes. NetBlocks also reported that Trump's Truth Social platform was \"experiencing international outages for many users,\" a scenario it said was not related to \"country-level Internet disruptions or filtering.\"\n\nUN watchdog to hold emergency meeting\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog will hold an emergency meeting in Vienna on Monday following the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, created in 1957 amid growing concern over nuclear weapons, called for an end to \"hostilities\" so that it can continue inspections in Iran.\n\n\"In view of the increasingly serious situation in terms of nuclear safety and security, the Board of Governors will meet in an extraordinary session tomorrow, which I will address,” Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.\n\nThe sites targeted by the U.S. strikes contained nuclear material in the form of uranium enriched to different levels, the IAEA said, according to its most recent information before Israel's strikes on Iran on June 13. The material \"may cause radioactive and chemical contamination within the facilities that were hit,\" the IAEA said. Grossi said no health impacts outside the targeted sites are expected after the U.S. strikes.\n\n“I have repeatedly stated that nuclear facilities should never be attacked,” Grossi said.\n\nWorld reacts to US bombing of Iran\n\nIsrael hailed the United States' decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites as an action that would \"deny the world's most dangerous regime the world's most dangerous weapons.\"\n\nElsewhere around the world the reaction was far more constrained. The United Nations and some leaders from Britain to Mexico called for swift de-escalation while other longtime U.S. adversaries such as Cuba and Venezuela were deeply critical of the attacks.\n\n\"There is a growing risk that this conflict could rapidly get out of control − with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region and the world,\" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. Guterres said he was \"gravely alarmed\" by the use of U.S. force on Iran.\n\nRussia, China condemn US attacks on Iran\n\nRussia and China on Sunday condemned the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, the countries' foreign ministries said.\n\n\"The irresponsible decision to subject the territory of a sovereign state to missile and bomb attacks, whatever the arguments it may be presented with, flagrantly violates international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council,\" the Russian foreign ministry said in its statement. \"We call for an end to aggression and for increased efforts to create conditions for returning the situation to a political and diplomatic track.\"\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, launching a drawn-out conflict that is ongoing over three years later. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, recently suggested that the \"whole of Ukraine\" belongs to his country, even though Russia only controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said the move violates the United Nations Charter and would worsen tensions in the Middle East. The ministry urged an end to attacks for all parties to the conflict, particularly Israel.\n\nWhat we know about the US strikes on Iran\n\nTrump ordered the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, effectively joining a war that Israel started on June 13 when it started bombing Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure. One of the U.S. targets was Fordow, a uranium enrichment facility hidden deep inside a remote mountain in the desert.\n\nNuclear sites at Natanz and Isfahan were also struck. Israel said it helped the U.S. coordinate and plan the strikes.\n\nTrump said all three sites were \"totally obliterated\" but an independent assessment has not yet been carried out. The International Atomic Energy Agency − the United Nation's nuclear watchdog − released a statement saying that so far it had not detected an increase in \"off-site radiation levels,\" one of the feared consequences of the strikes.\n\nWhat will Iran do now?\n\nIran's next move is being closely watched. The country has already ramped up its rhetoric.\n\n\"Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said. Ahead of the U.S. strikes, Tehran signaled that if the Pentagon were to join Israel's war U.S. military bases and Navy ships in the region could be attacked.\n\nIran has a large arsenal of drones and ballistic missiles. It has been using these on Israel for days. It launched a fresh wave of missiles toward Israel hours after the U.S. bombing started. Iran might even opt for a diplomatic route, which Trump was encouraging before authorizing the U.S. attack.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/07/29/magnitude-8-7-earthquake-russia-tsunami-alert/85432493007/", "title": "Tsunami evacuation orders lifted in Hawaii, threat to West Coast eases", "text": "Tsunami waves reached Hawaii and the West Coast after a historically powerful earthquake struck off Russia's coastline, but evacuation orders and an advisory in Hawaii were later lifted and beaches in Los Angeles County reopened on Wednesday as the threat to U.S. shores eased.\n\nRussian officials reported little damage from the 8.8-magnitude temblor on Tuesday, the shaker creating tsunami waves that began arriving in Hawaii after 7 p.m. local time. Authorities braced for the possibility of major damage − tsunamis can cause a long series of waves, flood coastal areas and present other dangers for hours.\n\nLess than four hours later, however, the risk to Hawaii was downgraded from a tsunami warning to an advisory, which was dropped in the morning. There were no reports of serious damage. Coastal areas of California, Oregon and Washington also canceled their advisories.\n\n\"I spoke to Governor of Hawaii @GovHawaii and the evacuation order has been lifted for coastal inundation zones,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media July 30. \"Please be careful when returning and watch out for damage. We will continue to monitor in Hawaii, Alaska, and California.\"\n\nState emergency management officials in Hawaii said widespread flooding was not expected. But they urged residents to \"remain cautious in or near the water. ... Stay away from beaches, shorelines, and out of the ocean.\"\n\nWhere are tsunami warnings and watches issued in the US?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Chile and Colombia issued evacuation orders for their Pacific coastline, and Chile also extended the precautions to its Eastern Island, about 2,300 miles off the mainland. Likewise, Ecuador ordered evacuations for parts of its Galapagos Islands.\n\n∎ Automated alerts for the Axial Seamount, the underwater volcano off the Oregon coast, were triggered by the giant earthquake and subsequent tsunami. It was a false alarm. The volcano did not erupt, and it hasn't since April 2015.\n\n∎ The Marquesas Islands, part of French Polynesia in the South Pacific, were hit by smaller waves than previously feared. Officials canceled a tsunami alert.\n\nTsunami advisory canceled in California\n\nIn California, Los Angeles beaches reopened and a tsunami advisory was canceled for San Diego and Orange counties. Later in the day, an advisory for most of the state's coastline was lifted as well. However, the portion from the Oregon border south to the county line between Humboldt and Del Norte remained under an advisory.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Los Angeles said strong currents will continue along the state's coast, including those parts not under a tsunami advisory, at least through Wednesday. Although widespread inundation isn’t expected, localized damage at harbors is possible because of the water surging in and out.\n\nPort San Luis in the central coast, including Avila Beach, will be of “particular concern.”\n\nTsunami waves began arriving overnight at Crescent City and Humboldt Bay on California's northern coast. Crescent City is located along a stretch of the West Coast considered most vulnerable to tsunamis based on previous events, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The waves get amplified in the area and are higher in the city’s harbor than at other locations along the coast.\n\n\"A Tsunami Advisory is in effect for coastal Del Norte, Humboldt, and Mendocino Counties,\" the weather service in Eureka posted on X July 30. \"Tsunami waves of 1-3 ft are still ... observed early this morning. Avoid beaches and harbors.\"\n\nDrastic water level shifts in Hawaii, California\n\nWater levels continue to surge back and forth within minutes at tide gauges in Hawaii and along the U.S. West Coast.\n\nOne of the biggest surges was seen at Kahului Harbor on the northern coast of Maui, as the tsunami began to arrive. The NOAA tide gauge station shows the water receded to a level of minus 2.35 feet, then surged to 6.75 in just 18 minutes, a difference of more than 9 feet.\n\nSome nine hours later, the tide was still rising and falling as much as 3 feet within about 12 minutes, according to the preliminary measurements from the tide gauge.\n\nAt Port San Luis in central California, the tide level changed more than 2 1/2 feet in just 12 minutes, according to preliminary measurements from NOAA.\n\nTsunami waves or surf waves? What to know\n\nThe notion of a tsunami may inspire thoughts of long rides for some intrepid surfers, but its waves are nowhere close to surfable and quite different from the ones at Malibu beach or Oahu's North Shore.\n\nDuring tsunamis, the entire water column from the surface to the bottom of the ocean gets moved, generating an enormous amount of energy and rushing into land like a flood, often carrying debris.\n\nTsunami waves are much faster − around 500 mph at the deepest points. That's the speed of a commercial plane at cruising altitude, though they slow down considerably near the shore. They also don't break into a curl like surfing waves.\n\nThe time in between waves in a tsunami is measured in minutes and even hours, not seconds as with wind waves. Oh, and watch out when a tsunami wave recedes, leaving the seafloor exposed for a long stretch.\n\nNoem says FEMA was fully deployed if needed\n\nNoem, in Chile for meetings, said the tsunami was expected to have \"minimal impact\" in the U.S.\n\n“We were fully deployed and ready to respond if necessary, but grateful that that we didn't have to deal with the situation that this could have been,\" Noem said.\n\nShe said FEMA was at an \"enhanced level\" an that the Coast Guard was deployed. Noem, asked if FEMA is equipped to handle no-notice disasters, responded with a familiar refrain.\n\n“We should always remember that FEMA was established to be an agency that supports local authorities,\" she said. \"Our job with FEMA is to come in and support their efforts, and we will continue to do that. But these governors have done a fantastic job being prepared for the situation they faced yesterday, and then going into today.”\n\nTsunami waves reach Washington state\n\nTsunami waves began arriving along the coast of Washington state, where a tsunami advisory was in effect, shortly after midnight local time. The weather service said, \"strong and unusual\" currents were likely, but coastal inundation was not expected.\n\n\"We continue to see tsunami waves arrive along the coast as well as Strait of Juan de Fuca,\" the weather service office in Seattle posted seven hours later. \"Reminder: Do not attempt to go to the shore to observe the tsunami waves. Keep away until local officials say it is safe to return.\"\n\nA tsunami watch was downgraded to an advisory in Oregon. The weather service in Portland warned that \"while tempting, do not go to the coast to watch waves coming in. Currents can be unpredictable and it will be dark out.\"\n\nAlaska could feel impact for days, forecasters warn\n\nInitial tsunami warnings have been cancelled or downgraded in much of Alaska, but an advisory still exists along the state's Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula along an over 1,000-mile stretch from Attu Island to Chignik Bay, according to the National Weather Service in Anchorage as of 2:45 a.m. local time.\n\nCurrents at beaches and harbors, marinas, bays and inlets can be especially dangerous in the wake of tsunami waves and the danger can last for days, forecasters said.\n\nTsunami waves have been recorded at gauges along the Aleutian Islands, with the highest wave of 2.7 feet near Adak Island at about 10:21 p.m. local time on July 29.\n\n“Impacts from Tsunamis may continue for many hours to days after arrival of the first wave,” forecasters said.\n\nDetails on the historic Russian earthquake\n\nThe magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula is now among the ten largest ever recorded on the planet. With a depth of about 12 miles, the shallow quake was recorded at 7:24 p.m. ET approximately 78 miles east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Kamchatka and Russia's Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the geologically active region known for intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nIn a video posted to the Telegram messaging app, Kamchatka Gov. Vladimir Solodov said preliminary information indicates there were no injuries but added that a kindergarten building was damaged.\n\nSolodov described the quake as \"serious and the strongest in decades.\"\n\nQuake triggers volcano in Russia\n\nThe Klyuchevskoy volcano on the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's far east started erupting after a powerful earthquake in the Pacific, Russian state news agency RIA reported. According to preliminary information, hot lava is flowing down the western slope, explosions were heard and a bright glow was visible above the volcano, RIA said.\n\nLast week, rescuers recommended tourists not visit the volcano due to the increased activity. Klyuchevskoy volcano, 16,000 feet above sea level, last erupted in April 2025.\n\n− Dan Morrison\n\nAfter earthquake and tsunami, volcano erupts in Russia's far east\n\nWhat is the Pacific Tsunami Center?\n\nThe United States is served by two tsunami centers operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center serves the Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific and Caribbean territories and the British Virgin Islands. It also covers the international forecast for nations in the Pacific and Caribbean Basins. It’s located on Hawaii’s Ford Island, on the south side of Oahu near Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe other, the National Tsunami Warning Center, serves the mainland United States, Alaska and Canada. The warning centers are staffed 24/7 to monitor for tsunamis or earthquakes that could cause them, issue tsunami messages and work to improve warnings.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center was first established in the wake of official tsunami warnings that began in 1949, in response to a 1946 tsunami that devastated Hilo, Hawaii, known as the April Fools Day Tsunami.\n\nTrump warns of tsunami on social media\n\nShortly before 11:30 p.m. ET, a tsunami advisory was upgraded to a warning for the coastal areas of California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon-California border, the weather service said. A tsunami warning means significant inundation is possible.\n\nEarlier in the night, President Donald Trump took to social media to warn of the tsunami.\n\n\"Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,\" he posted on X. \"... STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!\"\n\nMost areas along the U.S. Pacific Coast can expect a tsunami of less than 1 foot, the National Weather Service said just after 10:30 p.m. E.T. But even a tsunami of that size can generate deadly currents, the weather service warned.\n\nWhat is a tsunami warning? What to know after huge earthquake.\n\nTsunami waves recorded in Hawaii\n\nAfter authorities urged residents and tourists to move to higher ground and evacuate from coastal zones, initial data showed waves arriving on the evening of July 29 were less than the potential projected maximum of 9.8 feet.\n\nTsunami waves in Hawaii reached amplitudes of up to 5.7 feet in Kahului, Maui, a measurement that compares the wave to height above normal sea level, the weather service said. In Hilo, the wave amplitude reached 4.9 feet.\n\n\"Look, everything has been OK so far. We haven't seen a big wave,\" Green said at around 8:30 p.m. But he said officials were concerned about an earlier pullback of water, which can signal a tsunami risk.\n\nHawaii has a long history with tsunamis\n\nThe state of Hawaii is one of the more tsunami susceptible spots in the world, thanks to its remote location in the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by the infamous seismic activity known as the \"ring of fire.\"\n\nTsunami waves can arrive in the islands from any location around the ocean, including Russia, South America and Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. On average, Hawaii experiences destructive tsunamis about once every 11 years.\n\nThe earliest historical accounts emerge from oral histories of the islands, including a 16th century chant about a wave that struck the coast of Molokai'i.\n\nWhen was the tsunami predicted to hit Hawaii?\n\nA tsunami warning was issued for Hawaii, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. The agency estimated that the first tsunami wave will arrive at around 7:17 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time.\n\n\"A tsunami has been generated that could cause damage along coastlines of all islands in the state of Hawaii,\" the agency said in a bulletin. \"Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property.\"\n\nThe Honolulu Department of Emergency Management called for the evacuation of some coastal areas in Hawaii. \"Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,\" the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.\n\nIn a video update at 5:50 p.m. local time, Green said authorities were prepared and noted that county officials were “fully involved” in emergency management. The governor warned residents and visitors to not be outside on all shorelines when the wave strikes, adding that warning sirens will be used within the next hour.\n\n“(The earthquake has) caused a wave we believe that will be significant,” Green said. “People need to evacuate — that’s very clear. They have to be out of the evacuation zone or up four stories.”\n\n'It’s always scary to get an alert like that': Hawaii residents rush to higher ground\n\nShortly after the initial tsunami warning sirens went off at around 3 p.m. local time in Hawaii, the streets of Honolulu, including the tourist hub Waikiki, were congested as people quickly tried to move to higher ground and away from coastal evacuation zones. Some reported long lines at gas stations, as sirens continued to go off on the hour to the estimated first wave.\n\nOahu local Megan Lee said she hit more traffic than usual on her commute home from work. “It’s nice to see everyone taking it seriously,” Lee told USA TODAY. “It’s always scary to get an alert like that.”\n\nSome felt desensitized to the warning following the 2018 false missile alert, when residents woke up to an emergency alert notification that a ballistic missle was headed their way. Residents across the islands scrambled to find shelter before learning it was sent as an error.\n\nLee, who was living on Oahu during the false missile alert, said she feels desensitized to these types of warnings. “It makes me not take the sirens as seriously, unfortunately,” she said. “We get a lot of alarms in Hawaii, and you see people going surfing because there’s a tsunami warning.”\n\nThose living more inland said they’re not as concerned about the warning, like Honolulu resident Julie Shimer. “I think it’s great (the state) is being more cautious,” Shimer told USA TODAY. “It’s always better being more prepared just in case.”\n\nIn a statement sent on the afternoon of July 29, Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said, “Residents and visitors are urged to monitor local media for updates and stay away from the coastline. For those flying in or out of Hawaii today please check with your airline for the status of your flight.”\n\n— Kathleen Wong\n\nSan Diego officials monitoring tsunami situation\n\nIn San Diego County, officials were monitoring the situation on the evening of July 29. San Diego County spokesperson Chuck Westerheide said the county would issue an alert if necessary, but stressed that so far, a tsunami advisory was all that was in place.\n\n“As of 8:08 p.m. (local time) we are in an advisory area, meaning strong currents and a tsunami are possible and waves and currents can kill or injure people who are in the water,” Westerheide said. “But that’s key — people who are in the water.”\n\n“Currents at beaches in harbors, marinas, bays and inlets may be especially dangerous,” he added.\n\nIlya Zaides, who lives on the beach in La Jolla, said he was monitoring X while also waiting to see if an official alert would be issued.\n\n“We’re going to wait and see if there’s an alert, and hopefully there will be enough time to leave if we need to,” Zaides said.\n\n— Will Carless\n\nTsunami activity possible in Alaska\n\nThe tsunami warning for Alaska includes coastal areas from Attu to Samalga Pass. The tsunami advisory has been expanded to areas from Samalga Pass to Chignik Bay. Expected tsunami start times in Alaska include the following: 6:45 p.m., Unalaska; 7:25 p.m., Sand Point and 8:00 p.m. Cold Bay.\n\nThe National Tsunami Warning Center advises that tsunami activity is possible at Shemya, Alaska beginning at 4:46 p.m., Alaskan Daylight Time, then at 5:46 p.m. at Adak and 7:06 p.m. at Saint Paul, about 760 miles west of Anchorage.\n\nA buoy south-southwest of Attu, Alaska detected a tsunami wave of 3 feet, the weather service reported. The measurements from DART buoys are from the deep ocean and are generally much smaller than the wave would be when it arrives at the coast, the weather service said.\n\nTsunami alerts issued in the U.S. Here's where.\n\nHazardous currents warned for coastal communities in California\n\nIn San Francisco and Monterey, California, the weather service expects to see tsunami heights of less than one feet, but advises it could present strong and hazardous currents.\n\n\"Move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas,\" the weather service said. \"Do not go to the coast to watch the tsunami.\"\n\nIn San Diego, the weather service said the area should not expect widespread inundation, but advised people in coastal areas under the advisory to stay off the beach and out of harbors and marinas.\n\n\"Dangerous and powerful currents are still expected within the ocean and along the coast,\" said Dial Hoang, a weather service meteorologist in San Francisco. \"In 2011, a man near Crescent City died after he was swept out to sea while trying to photograph the tsunami coming in.\"\n\nThe highest peak wave is forecast for Crescent City, California, where the height could peak at between 2.9 feet and 5.4 feet, with tsunami waves lasting for 36 hours. In Port San Luis, California, the waves could peak at 2 to 3.8 feet and last for 24 hours, the weather service warned.\n\nEstimated tsunami start times for West Coast\n\nPossible tsunami start times stretch from 8:20 p.m. local time in Kodiak, Alaska, southward along the coast to La Jolla, California, where tsunami activity would be expected to begin by 1:15 a.m. local time.\n\nEstimated tsunami start times, in local times, for selected sites are:\n\nAlaska : Kodiak - 8:20 p.m., Seward - 8:45 p.m., Sitka - 8:55 p.m., Homer - 9:40 p.m., and Craig - 9:55 p.m.\n\n: Kodiak - 8:20 p.m., Seward - 8:45 p.m., Sitka - 8:55 p.m., Homer - 9:40 p.m., and Craig - 9:55 p.m. British Columbia : Langara - 10:05 p.m. and Tofino - 11:30 p.m.\n\n: Langara - 10:05 p.m. and Tofino - 11:30 p.m. Washington state : La Push - 11:35 p.m., Port Angeles - 12:20 a.m. on July 30, Port Townsend - 12:45 a.m. on July 30, and Bellingham - 1:10 a.m. on July 30\n\n: La Push - 11:35 p.m., Port Angeles - 12:20 a.m. on July 30, Port Townsend - 12:45 a.m. on July 30, and Bellingham - 1:10 a.m. on July 30 Oregon : Port Oxford - 11:40 p.m., Charleston - 11:45 p.m., Brookings - 11:50 p.m., Seaside - 11:55 p.m., and Newport - 11:55 p.m.\n\n: Port Oxford - 11:40 p.m., Charleston - 11:45 p.m., Brookings - 11:50 p.m., Seaside - 11:55 p.m., and Newport - 11:55 p.m. California: Fort Bragg - 11:50 p.m., Monterey - 12:15 a.m. on July 30, San Francisco - 12:40 a.m. on July 30, Los Angeles Harbor - 1:05 a.m. on July 30, and La Jolla - 1:15 a.m. on July 30\n\nAlong the West Coast, the weather service warned after 10 p.m. ET that widespread inundation is not expected in most locations. The weather service office in Seattle, Washington has advised that the tsunami waves are expected to arrive on the coast at Moclips at 11:50 p.m. and last for nine hours. The forecast peak of the highest wave is .8 to 1.4 feet, the weather service said.\n\n\"This is a significant, real event,\" said Reid Wolcott, a meteorologist with the weather service in Seattle. \"The imminent threat is for Alaska and areas near the quake. The National Tsunami Warning Center needs additional observation information before more is known about the threat to the US West Coast.\"\n\nIt will take time for ocean buoys and other observations to come in so that the tsunami warning centers can make a forecast with real data, Wolcott said.\n\nWave heights expected along U.S. Pacific Coast\n\nThough the peak of the tsunami could be less than a foot, the weather service has warned that it could still be dangerous. Estimated wave heights for selected sites are:\n\nAlaska : Adak - 1.2 to 2.2 feet; and Unalaska, Saint Paul, Sand Point, and Cold Bay are all less than 1 foot.\n\n: Adak - 1.2 to 2.2 feet; and Unalaska, Saint Paul, Sand Point, and Cold Bay are all less than 1 foot.

California: Fort Bragg - 0.8 to 1.4 feet; Crescent City - 2.9 to 5.4 feet; Santa Barbara, 0.7- 1.3 feet; and Monterey, San Francisco, Los Angeles Harbor, Newport Beach, and La Jolla are all less than 1 foot.\n\n'Risk must be taken seriously until the threat has passed'\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists said they are monitoring the \"developing tsunami threat that may impact coastal areas of Hawaii, Alaska, and the western United States.\"\n\n“Any earthquake with a magnitude greater than 7.0 poses a tsunami risk, even thousands of miles away from the epicenter,” said AccuWeather Vice President of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin. “The force of water from tsunamis is incredibly violent and destructive.”\n\nPreliminary data currently indicates that strong currents, wave surges, and possible inundation in low-lying areas are possible in areas where tsunami warnings have been issued, according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"This earthquake is likely to be in the top 10 strongest ever recorded. The strongest was the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, which was 9.4-9.6 magnitude. The March 2011 earthquake that triggered the tsunami which devastated parts of Japan was a 9.0-9.1 magnitude,” DePodwin added. “Although not all major earthquakes lead to tsunamis, the risk must be taken seriously until the threat has passed.\"\n\nDePodwin noted that a tsunami would not reach Hawaii for at least several hours and advised the public to follow guidelines from local emergency officials.\n\nTsunami alerts issued for Japan, Pacific Islands\n\nThe Japan Weather Agency upgraded its warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 10 feet to reach large coastal areas starting around 10:00 a.m. local time. Much of Japan's eastern seaboard, which was devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011, was ordered to evacuate.\n\nTsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan's Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.\n\nThe U.S. Tsunami Warning System also issued a warning of \"hazardous tsunami waves\" within the next three hours along some coasts of Russia, Japan and Hawaii. A tsunami watch was also in effect for the U.S. island territory of Guam and other islands of Micronesia.\n\nIn Guam, the weather service is warning of sea level fluctuations and strong ocean currents that could be a hazard along beaches and in harbors. The weather service has advised people to get out of the ocean and move away from beaches and harbors, following the instructions of local government officials. The estimated time of the activity in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan is 2:37 p.m. local time.\n\nA tsunami advisory is in effect for American Samoa, where hazardous sea level fluctuations and strong ocean currents could occur beginning at 9:39 p.m. local time. Tsunami alerts also are in effect along the coast of Central and South America.\n\nVolcanoes are turning in their sleep: What does that mean for Washington?\n\nEarthquake in Russia was 'the strongest in decades of tremors'\n\nThe powerful earthquake generated a tsunami of up to 13 feet in Russia, prompting evacuations and damaging buildings, officials said.\n\n\"Today's earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,\" Kamchatka Gov. Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters.\n\nMultiple aftershocks were also recorded following the major quake, ranging between a magnitude of 5.2 and 6.9, according to the USGS. Kamchatka and Russia's Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nRussia's Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The area was evacuated.\n\nWhile a kindergarten was also damaged, no serious injuries or fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.\n\nWhat do tsunami alerts mean?\n\nThe National Weather Service said tsunami messages are issued by the tsunami warning centers to alert local authorities and the public of a possible tsunami. There are four levels of tsunami alerts, according to the weather service:\n\nTsunami Warning : \"Take Action—Danger! A tsunami that may cause widespread flooding is expected or occurring. Dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents are possible and may continue for several hours or days after initial arrival.\"\n\n: \"Take Action—Danger! A tsunami that may cause widespread flooding is expected or occurring. Dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents are possible and may continue for several hours or days after initial arrival.\" Tsunami Advisory : \"Take Action—A tsunami with potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is expected or occurring. There may be flooding of beach and harbor areas.\"\n\n: \"Take Action—A tsunami with potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is expected or occurring. There may be flooding of beach and harbor areas.\" Tsunami Watch : \"Be Prepared—A distant earthquake has occurred. A tsunami is possible.\"\n\n: \"Be Prepared—A distant earthquake has occurred. A tsunami is possible.\" Tsunami Information Statement: \"Relax—An earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away and the threat has not been determined. In most cases, there is no threat of a destructive tsunami.\"\n\nHow does NOAA track tsunamis?\n\nA real-time tsunami monitoring system created by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Washington placed buoys at strategic locations throughout the ocean and they play a critical role in tsunami forecasting, according to the NOAA. The buoys are named DART, for Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis.\n\nWhen a tsunami event occurs, the first information available is the seismic information from the preceding earthquake, according to NOAA. As the tsunami wave moves across the ocean, it reaches the DART systems, which report sea level information measurements to the Tsunami Warning Centers. That buoy data is used to refine estimates of the tsunami source and to make the forecasts for watches, warnings and evacuations.\n\nThe Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory is working on a third generation of the buoy system, but the laboratory is one of those proposed to be closed under the budget NOAA has proposed for the coming year.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/business/faa-ground-stop-norad-north-korea", "title": "US grounded planes as a 'precaution' after a North Korean missile ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nAn unusual ground stop was issued to some pilots for a short period of time following a North American Aerospace Defense Command alert of a launch of a North Korean missile, a US official said Tuesday.\n\nThe official says it was not a national ground stop and may have been issued by a regional air traffic control facility.\n\n“No warning was issued by NORAD HQ,” regarding a potential threat to the US, according to Captain Pamela Kunze, the chief NORAD spokesperson.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for the nation’s air traffic control system, said the ground stop was to err on the side of safety.\n\n“As a matter of precaution, the FAA temporarily paused departures at some airports along the West Coast on Monday evening,” the FAA said in a statement. “Full operations resumed in less than 15 minutes. The FAA regularly takes precautionary measures. We are reviewing the process around this ground stop as we do after all such events.”\n\nThe NORAD spokeswoman said the normal sequence following the launch was followed: The missile launch was detected, and it was assessed not to be a threat to the continental United States. The standard practice is for FAA to have a constant liaison in the NORAD ops center, therefore would have been aware of the quick assessment.\n\nLiveATC air traffic control recordings of the Burbank Airport in California detail a controller telling a Southwest flight “there’s ground stops all departures, all airports right now.

The last launch occurred Thursday when North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles, the latest in a spate of launches in the past two weeks.\n\nJapan’s Coast Guard instructed vessels to pay attention to information and to not approach any objects which have fallen in the sea. It also asked vessels to report any relevant information.\n\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Saturday “strongly condemned” the launches, calling them a “serious provocation” which harms peace and safety, it said in a text sent to reporters.\n\n“North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile launch is a serious provocation that harms peace and safety of the Korean Peninsula as well as the international community, and it is also a clear violation of the UNSC resolution,” the joint chiefs said, condemning and urging the North to immediately stop such actions of testing missiles.\n\nThe joint chiefs reported the missiles launched early Sunday morning had a flight range of about 350 kilometers and an altitude about 90 kilometers.\n\nSouth Korean military will continue to maintain “firm readiness posture” while tracking and monitoring related movements under close cooperation with the US, the joint chiefs added.\n\nOn Tuesday, North Korea fired another missile, without warning, which flew over and past Japan, causing Japan to warn its citizens to take shelter.\n\nThe missile Tuesday traveled over northern Japan early in the morning, and is believed to have landed in the Pacific Ocean. The last time North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan was in 2017.\n\nUS Indo-Pacific Command said Saturday the latest launches do “not pose an immediate threat to US personnel or territory, or to our allies.”\n\n“We are aware of the two ballistic missile launches and are consulting closely with our allies and partners,” the command said in a statement. “The missile launch highlights the destabilizing impact of the DPRK’s unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. The US commitments to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remain ironclad.”\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned if North Korea continues “down this road” of provocation following its ballistic missile launch Tuesday, “it will only increase the condemnation, increase the isolation and increase the steps that are taken in response to their actions.”\n\nThe US imposed new sanctions Friday, following North Korean recent ballistic missile tests, the US Treasury and State Department said.\n\nNorth Korea usually fires its missiles into waters off the coast of the Korean Peninsula, making Tuesday’s flight over Japan considerably more provocative.\n\nThe aggressive acceleration in weapons testing has sparked alarm in the region, with the US, South Korea and Japan responding with missile launches and joint military exercises.

It flew about 4,600 kilometers (2,858 miles) for 20 minutes at an estimated maximum altitude of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) over Japan’s Tohoku region on the main island of Honshu before falling into the Pacific Ocean, some 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) from the country’s shore, Japanese officials said.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida strongly condemned the launch and called North Korea’s recent ballistic missile launches “outrageous” in comments to reporters at his official residence.\n\nTuesday’s launch is the country’s 23rd such missile test this year, including both ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nThere were no reports of damage to aircraft or vessels near the missile trajectory, according to Japanese authorities, but the unannounced missile triggered a rare J-alert, a system designed to inform the public of emergencies and threats in Japan.\n\nIn such emergencies, alerts are sent out via sirens, through community radio stations and to individual smartphone users. On Tuesday, alerts were sent out at around 7:30 a.m. local time to people in Aomori prefecture, Hokkaido and Tokyo’s Izu and Ogasawara islands, according to Japanese officials.\n\nA tweet posted by Japan’s Prime Minister’s office urged residents to take shelter in buildings and to “not approach anything suspicious that is found and to immediately contact the police or fire department.”\n\nSouth Korea, US condemn missile launch\n\nOther governments were quick to decry the launch, with South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol branding it a “reckless” provocation, adding that North Korea will face a decisive response from the South Korean military and its allies.\n\nThe White House also “strongly condemned” the test, with National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson calling it a “destabilizing” action that shows North Korea’s “blatant disregard for United Nations Security Council resolutions and international safety norms.”\n\nThe allies conducted a precision bombing exercise in response, which involved a South Korean F-15K fighter jet firing two air-to-surface munitions at a virtual target in a firing range west of the Korean Peninsula, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. South Korea and the United States conducted a similar exercise in March in reaction to another ballistic missile launch by North Korea.\n\nKim Seung-kyum, chief of the JCS, and Paul LaCamera, the United States Forces Korea commander, held a meeting after the launch and reaffirmed the combined defense posture will be further strengthened against any threats and provocations from North Korea, the JCS said.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command also released a statement saying American commitments to the defense of Japan and South Korea “remain ironclad.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with both his Japanese and South Korean counterparts after the launch.\n\nAnkit Panda, a senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said regular missile testing was was part of North Korea’s plan to maintain its nuclear forces.\n\n“It is quite possible that the United States, South Korea and Japan will take away a message from this missile test that North Korea is continuing to assert itself to show that it has the ability to deliver nuclear weapons to targets including the US territory of Guam,” he said, adding that “risk reduction” to stop a crisis from escalating should be the current priority.\n\n“If such a crisis were to play out, it would play out under a significantly more advanced North Korean nuclear capability, which I think would significantly limit the options that the United States and South Korea would have, potentially to retaliate or manage escalation with North Korea,” he said.\n\nNorth Korea’s potential nuclear plans\n\nTuesday’s launch could herald an intensification of provocations by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, experts told CNN.\n\n“Pyongyang is still in the middle of a provocation and testing cycle and is likely waiting until after China’s mid-October Communist Party Congress to conduct an even more significant test,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n\n“The Kim regime is developing weapons such as tactical nuclear warheads and submarine-launched ballistic missiles as part of a long-term strategy to outrun South Korea in an arms race and drive wedges among US allies.”\n\nFour previous missile launches occurred in the space of a week in late September and early October, around the same time US Vice President Kamala Harris made an official visit to Japan and South Korea, and as US, Japanese and South Korean navies held joint exercises.\n\nNorth Korea’s tests also come as international attention remains firmly focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and as both Moscow and Beijing appear reluctant to side with the West to further censure Pyongyang.\n\nIn May, Russia and China vetoed a US-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution to strengthen sanctions on North Korea for its weapons testing, in a vote the US said was likely to fuel Pyongyang’s program to develop nuclear-capable missile systems.\n\nWashington and the International Atomic Energy Agency have both warned this year that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, which would be its first since 2017.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute, drew a connection between the missile tests and a potential nuclear test.\n\n“North Korea is going to keep conducting missile tests until the current round of modernization is done.

For the latest news on President Trump and the potential for Iran retaliation, follow USA TODAY's live updates for Sunday, June 22.\n\nThe United States joined Israel’s war with Iran after President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on three nuclear targets, winning praise and condemnation from members of Congress and new defiance from Tehran.\n\n\"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated,\" Trump said in a live address on June 21, threatening further U.S. strikes if Iran failed to accept a diplomatic solution.\n\nBombs and missiles launched from U.S. warplanes hit nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz. No U.S. personnel were injured in the operation, which struck Iran well after midnight on June 22 local time.\n\nWith 40,000 troops in the Persian Gulf region, the United States faces potential Iranian reprisals in the days ahead.\n\nAbbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, warned that the country \"reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people,\" saying America's strike was \"outrageous and will have everlasting consequences.\"\n\n\"Each and every member of the UN must be alarmed over this extremely dangerous, lawless and criminal behavior,\" he said on social media.\n\nTrump’s move was assailed by some conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats in Congress as illegal, while others praised him after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes on Iran and retaliatory missile fire wreaking havoc in Israel.\n\n\"There will either be peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,\" Trump said.\n\nIsrael says Iran launched another round of missiles\n\nMultiple explosions were heard in central Israel, including over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, in the early hours of June 22. Israel's military said sirens that sounded across the region were \"due to another Iranian missile launch.\"\n\nMillions of people in the country entered safe rooms and bomb shelters as explosions rang out. The health ministry said 86 people were injured overnight.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many missiles had pierced Israel's air defense systems, but police confirmed at least three impact sites in residential areas in central and northern Israel.\n\nVideo from Tel Aviv and the port city of Haifa further north showed rescue teams combing through debris, apartments reduced to rubble, mangled cars along a street filled with debris and medics evacuating injured people from a row of blown out houses.\n\nIranian foreign minister issues warning\n\nIran reserves all options to defend itself after U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, Araqchi shared on X, saying the attacks were \"outrageous and will have everlasting consequences.\"\n\n\"Each and every member of the UN must be alarmed over this extremely dangerous, lawless and criminal behavior,\" he said.\n\nWhat’s the risk of nuclear fallout from the Iran attacks?\n\nThe U.S. attacks against three of Iran’s nuclear facilities, following Israeli attacks over the previous week, prompted questions about the potential risks of radiological or chemical releases.\n\nBoth \"The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" and the International Atomic Energy Agency have previously stated the offsite risks are low from attacks at Fordow and Natanz. But in a June 20 post, François Diaz-Maurin, an associate editor for nuclear affairs at the atomic bulletin, termed the offsite risk at Isfahan \"moderate,\" because it’s one of the \"most important sites for Iran’s nuclear program.\"\n\nHowever, the International Atomic Energy Agency said June 22 there had been no increase in off-site radiation levels reported.\n\nThe nuclear complex in Isfahan, a key site of the Iranian nuclear program, has repeatedly been attacked and extensively damaged before June 21, said Rafael Mariano Grossi, agency director. \"Based on our analysis of the nuclear material present, we don’t see any risk of off-site contamination,\" Grossi said.\n\n– Dinah Pulver\n\nAttack used bunker-buster bombs\n\nThe Pentagon’s attack on Iran’s nuclear facility employed its most powerful bunker-buster bomb as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from submarines, according to a U.S. official.\n\nPentagon planners coordinated the attack with Israel to enter Iran’s airspace, said the official who had been briefed on the mission but was not authorized to speak publicly. B-2 bombers dropped GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs, the first time they have been used in combat.\n\nThe stealth bombers were accompanied by other aircraft, the official said, though it was unclear the type of warplane. The Pentagon’s most sophisticated fighter, the F-22, was a likely candidate.\n\nTrump declared the attack a success, saying Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities had been completely \"obliterated.\" The official, however, said battle-damage assessments had not reached a firm conclusion.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nAOC condemns Trump’s attacks, calling it a constitutional violation\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is the latest lawmaker to take to social media in the hours after Trump’s strikes on Iran to weigh in on the move, calling it \"grounds for impeachment.\"\n\n\"The President’s disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers,\" she said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, published shortly after Trump’s White House address.\n\nCongress is the only branch of government that has the power to declare war, however, presidents have engaged in foreign conflicts in recent decades under the executive authority to authorize defensive strikes.\n\n\"He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\"\n\n− Kathryn Palmer\n\nWill Iran counterattack?\n\nTehran could respond to Trump’s strikes by launching counterattacks on U.S. military bases in the Middle East, current and former U.S. officials say.\n\nAmerican bases in Gulf countries and Iraq and Syria could become targets, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro told USA TODAY before Trump attacked Iran.\n\nIran could also target regional energy facilities and block oil and gas shipments from crossing the Strait of Hormuz, said Shapiro, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East in the Biden administration.\n\nRoughly 40,000 American troops are stationed in the region. Trump warned in a Truth Social post of \"far greater\" force against Iran if it pursues retaliation.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nMuslim civil rights group condemns U.S. strikes on Iran\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, blasted Trump’s attack as an \"illegal and unjustified act of war\" that favors the wishes of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu over the American people and threatens to drag the United States into a wider conflict.\n\n\"We condemn President Trump’s illegal and unjustified act of war against Iran,\" CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement. \"This attack, carried out under pressure from the out-of-control Israeli government, took place despite the longstanding conclusion by our nation’s intelligence community that Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\"Just as President Bush started a disastrous war in Iraq pushed by war hawks, neoconservatives, and Israeli leaders like Netanyahu, President Trump has attacked Iran based on the same type of false information put forward by those who consistently seek to drag our nation into unnecessary and catastrophic wars,\" Awad said.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nPete Hegseth to hold a press conference from the Pentagon\n\nHours after the U.S. military launched strikes against three nuclear sites in Iran, Trump addressed the nation from the White House calling the operation a \"spectacular military success.\"\n\nHe said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will hold a press conference at 8 a.m. on July 22 at the Pentagon.\n\nTrump said the mission's objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the \"world's number one state sponsor of terror.\"\n\n\"If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill,\" said Trump. \"Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.\"\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCan Iran attack? Retaliation could happen anywhere, ex-official says\n\nTerror alert levels should be elevated in the near term, even in major cities outside the Middle East and anywhere Iran may have sleeper cells, said Andrew Borene, a former senior official at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\n\"What happens next is largely going to be driven by Tehran’s next moves. Their shadow wars have never been confined to missiles, drones, and cyber attacks,\" said Borene, who is now executive director for global security at private intelligence firm Flashpoint.\n\nOffensive cyber operations on critical infrastructure, or terrorist attacks by Iranian proxies, also could rapidly derail hope for de-escalation and diplomacy in the near term, Borene said.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nPeace or tragedy, Trump tells Iran\n\n\"There will either be peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,” Trump said.\n\nHe noted that there are many other targets in Iran.\n\n\"If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes,\" he said.\n\n– Sarah Wire\n\nNew York, Washington police boost security after strikes\n\nLaw enforcement in New York and Washington both increased police presence at places of worship and other sensitive sites as Americans reacted to the strikes.\n\n\"At this time, there are no known threats to the District,\" Washington's Metropolitan Police Department shared in a post on X. \"However, MPD has maintained an increased presence at religious institutions across the city.\"\n\nSimilarly, the New York Police Department said it's \"deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump says ‘future attacks’ could be worse\n\n\"Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,\" Trump said in his address to the nation. \"If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.\"\n\nHe then described tactics of the regime.\n\n\"For 40 years, Iran has been saying, 'Death to America,' 'Death to Israel,'\" he said. \"They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with roadside bombs. That was their specialty.\" The president appeared to be referring to attacks launched by Iran-backed militants in the years after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nNetanyahu congratulates Trump on Iran bombing\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump for bombing three Iran nuclear sites, saying the decision could lead the Middle East toward a future of \"prosperity and peace.\"\n\n\"America has been truly unsurpassed,\" Netanyahu said in a video statement. \"It has done what no other country on earth could do. History will record that President Trump acted to deny the world’s most dangerous regime the world’s most dangerous weapons.\"\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is Fordow?\n\nFordow is an Iranian underground uranium enrichment facility located about 80 to 90 meters deep inside a mountain, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.\n\nIt is located 20 miles north of the Iranian city of Qom.\n\nFordow was one of three nuclear sites, including Natanz and Isfahan, that were struck by US military operations on July 21 to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. \"A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBomb-carrying B-2 stealth fleet launched from Missouri base\n\nB-2 bombers took off from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri in the early morning hours of June 21. The warplanes are known not only for their stealth technology but also for their ability to fly long-range and carry the big \"bunker buster\" bombs used in the June 21 mission.\n\nWith design and materials that limit its ability to be detected by enemy radar, the B-2 is thought to be the only aircraft equipped to carry the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or GBU-57, known as the \"bunker buster.\"\n\nThe entire fleet of B-2 stealth bombers is based at Whiteman, southeast of Kansas City, with the 509th Bomb Wing, part of the Air Force Global Strike Command.\n\nFox News reported six bunker-buster bombs were dropped on Iran's Fordow nuclear site.\n\n– Dinah Pulver\n\nDemocrats in Congress erupt at Trump\n\nDemocratic members of Congress expressed outrage over the strikes, which they said they learned about from social media.\n\n\"According to the Constitution we are both sworn to defend, my attention to this matter comes BEFORE bombs fall. Full stop,\" said Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, in a post on X.\n\nVirginia Rep. Eugene Vindman said Trump's handling of the situation was \"disgraceful.\" He asserted in a post that the U.S. was now at war with Iran.\n\n\"And so the United States goes to war with Iran without so much as a by your leave to the American people,\" he said. \"No statement, other than on social media; no notice to Congress; no serious deliberation.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is the stuff of autocrats. Disgraceful.\"\n\nWar is something only Congress can formally declare. Lawmakers have also passed resolutions that authorized the use of military force like when the U.S. invaded Iraq. Trump has not said whether he plans to continue the bombing campaign, which he described as a \"military operation\" in a post on the attack.\n\nAt least one Democrat came to Trump's defense, however: Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"As I’ve long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS. Iran is the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities. I’m grateful for and salute the finest military in the world,\" Fetterman said.\n\nDemocratic Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement that was critical of Trump that Congress should \"fully and immediately\" be briefed in a classified setting.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nCan the president bomb a country without Congress?\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war. The president is the commander in chief of the military, which means he carries out wars that Congress approves.\n\nHowever, presidents of both political parties have perennially used the U.S. military to bomb or invade countries without formal approval from Congress. There have even been allegations that the Korean War and the Vietnam War were illegal. Congress attempted to limit presidents from using this type of power when it passed the 1973 War Powers Act.\n\nTrump was most recently criticized for potentially violating the War Powers Act when he bombed the Houthis in Yemen, notoriously discussed on the SignalGate chat that embarrassed top officials in his administration.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nB-2 bombers conducted strikes on Iranian targets\n\nB-2 bombers conducted a series of strikes on targets in Iran, according to a senior Defense Department official. There were no casualties.\n\nMeasures to protect the nearly 40,000 U.S. troops in the region have been incrementally increased over the last two weeks, said the official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Army has been at third of four levels of alert at most places in the region, the official said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nTrump to address nation at 10 pm ET\n\nPresident Trump posted on Truth Social that he will be speaking to the nation at 10 p.m. ET on June 21.\n\n\"I will be giving an Address to the Nation at 10:00 P.M., at the White House, regarding our very successful military operation in Iran,\" Trump wrote. \"This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU!\"\n\n– Swapna Venugopal\n\nRepublican lawmaker says Iran strike is 'not constitutional'\n\nTrump’s decision came under immediate criticism from at least one Republican in Congress: Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.\n\nThe lawmaker shared Trump’s post on social media with the message, \"This is not Constitutional.\"\n\nMassie had previously introduced a bill to prevent Trump from going to war with Iran without congressional authorization, which drew cosponsors that included progressive Democrats such as Rep. Ro Khanna of California.\n\nThe GOP lawmaker was one of two members of Trump’s political party who voted against his tax bill in the House of Representatives last month. Trump called him a \"grandstander\" ahead of the vote and said he should be \"voted out of office.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, an ally of Trump’s, publicly pushed for the United States to stay out of the war, a half hour before Trump announced the attack.\n\n\"Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,\" she said in a post on X.\n\nGreene has been one of the most outspoken opponent's within MAGA of American military involvement in the conflict that exploded on June 13 when Israel attacked Iranian nuclear sites.\n\n\"There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first,\" she said on June 21. \"Israel is a nuclear armed nation. This is not our fight. Peace is the answer.\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nState Department evacuations from Israel\n\nEarlier in the day, the State Department began evacuating American citizens and permanent residents from Israel and the West Bank, U.S Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee announced on social media.\n\n\"The Department of State has begun assisted departure flights from Israel,\" Huckabee wrote in a post on X on June 21 asking people seeking government assistance to fill out a form.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal\n\nHow the war started\n\nThe strikes followed days of Israeli bomb and drone strikes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu aimed at disrupting Iran's quest for a nuclear weapon, to which Iran responded by launching missiles at Israeli civilian targets. Netanyahu had been pressing Trump to enter the war, knowing the Pentagon possesses the ability to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capability.\n\nIn his first term, Trump pulled out of the Iran deal brokered by President Barack Obama in 2015, saying it did not do enough to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. As the war between Iran and Israel has spiraled in recent days, he has repeated that Iran \"cannot\" get a nuclear weapon.\n\nIran has threatened that the United STates would suffer \"irreparable damage\" if it becomes directly involved in the conflict.\n\nThe country \"should know that any U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage,\" Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on June 18.\n\nOnly US warheads could penetrate Iranian nuclear site\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has the unique capability to destroy deeply buried, fortified structures like those that house Iran’s nuclear facilities. The Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or GBU-57, has a \"high-performance steel alloy\" warhead case that allows the weapon to stay intact as it burrows deep into the ground, according to Pentagon documents.\n\nIn 2012, the Air Force conducted five tests of the weapon at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Data and visual inspections showed that each bombing run \"effectively prosecuted the targets.\"\n\nThere’s only one warplane in the Air Force that can carry the bomb. Each B-2 Spirit stealth bomber based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri can hold two of the penetrators.\n\nIsrael had sought the Pentagon to drop the bombs because their penetrating weapons cannot reach the depth necessary to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/asia/shinzo-abe-japan-nara-shooting-intl-hnk", "title": "Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in critical condition ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nFormer Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is in critical condition and fighting for his life after being shot in the street in broad daylight while making a campaign speech in the central city of Nara, in an attack that has shocked the nation.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said in a press conference on Friday that Abe is receiving emergency treatment at the Nara Medical University hospital, where medical staff are fighting to save him.\n\n“This is not a forgivable act,” Kishida said. “We will comprehend the situation and take appropriate measures.”\n\nAbe’s younger brother, Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters Abe was receiving a blood transfusion.

Check your carrots ...", "text": "November has been an active month for food recalls in the leadup to one of the biggest eating holidays of the year.\n\nFrom carrots and poultry to tortilla strips and ground beef, foodborne illness and outbreaks like E. coli and listeria have been the primary cause of the recurring recalls, some of which have resulted in hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nWhile it may seem food recalls are on a dramatic uphill slope, data from the Food and Drug Administration shows no major uptick in the recalls, most of which are voluntarily issued by companies. Instead, it seems more likely the public and health officials are simply paying more attention and getting better at identifying outbreaks quickly.\n\nEven so, with a new recall seemingly issued every day, that can be difficult for the average consumer to keep track of, especially when working on that Thanksgiving shopping list. Here is a recap of the major food recalls issued in November.\n\nFood recalls galore: Does America have a worsening food safety problem?\n\nGrimmway Farms carrots\n\nOn November 16, 2024, Grimmway Farms recalled multiple sizes and brands of bagged organic baby and whole carrots for possible E. coli contamination.\n\nAs of the latest CDC update on Nov. 17, a total of 39 people across 18 states became sick in the outbreak, resulting in 15 hospitalizations and one death in California.\n\nOther states reporting illnesses included Arkansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming\n\nThe affected baby carrots had best if used by dates ranging from 9/11/2024 to 11/12/2024. The whole organic carrots did not have use-by dates but were sold at stores between 8/14/2024 and 10/23/2024.\n\nThe recalled products were sold under brand names 365, Bunny Luv, Cal-Organic, Compliments, Full Circle, Good & Gather, GreenWise, Grimmway Farms, Marketside, Nature's Promise, O-Organic, President's Choice, Raley's, Simple Truth, Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Wegmans and Wholesome Pantry.\n\nSeveral individual brands like Whole Foods have issued their own separate recalls of related products. Any recalled products should be disposed of immediately.\n\nYu Shang Food poultry\n\nOn Nov. 9, Yu Shang Food issued an initial recall of 4,589 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products for listeria concerns. On Nov. 21, the recall expanded to include a total of 72,240 pounds, including all Yu Shang Food, Inc. products made before October 28, 2024.\n\nAs of the latest update provided by the CDC on Nov. 22, a total of 11 cases of listeria poisoning across 4 states, including nine hospitalizations and one death. Illnesses occurred in California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York. In California, one pregnant person and their twins became sick, resulting in both infants dying. Because listeria testing only came back positive for one infant, just one death is recorded in the official record as related to the recall.\n\nIf consumers have Yu Shang Food products with establishment numbers \"P46684\" or \"EST. M46684\" and/or that were produced before October 28, 2024, they should immediately be disposed of.\n\nSugar Foods tortilla strips\n\nOn Nov. 22, Sugar Food recalled 3.5-ounce pouches of Fresh Gourmet Tortilla Strips Santa Fe Style due to potential wheat contamination. According to the FDA, the brand was notified by a customer that a bag of the tortilla strips contained the company's Crispy Onion Strips. The onion strips contain wheat that the tortilla strips do not.\n\nThe recalled tortilla strips bear a UPC code of 7 87359 17504 6 and a best-by date of June 20, 2025.\n\nNo illnesses have been reported but the recall announcement states that \"people who have a wheat allergy or severe sensitivity to wheat run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the product.\"\n\nThe bags were sent to distribution centers between Sept. 30 and Nov. 11 in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington.\n\nWolverine Packing Co. ground beef\n\nOn Nov. 20, Wolverine Packing Co. recalled 167,200 pounds of fresh and frozen ground beef products over E. coli concerns.\n\nAccording to the USDA, over 100 products manufactured by Detroit-based company are subject to recall after illnesses were reported by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. While the products were distributed to restaurants nationwide, 15 cases of E. coli poisoning have been identified in just Minnesota.\n\nThe recall covers over 100 raw fresh and frozen ground beef products. Products are sold under other brand names in addition to Wolverine Packing Co., including 1855 Beef, Davis Creek Meals, Farmer's Choice, Heritage Restaurant Brands, and Cheney Brothers, Inc., according to a list of labels released by the USDA.\n\nFresh products have a “use by” date of 11/14/2024 and the frozen products are labeled with a production date of 10/22/24.

It just goes on and on and on.”\n\nThe former Democratic president criticized Trump’s platform on issues from immigration to reproductive rights, as well as his character.\n\n“The other day, I heard someone compare Trump to the neighbor who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day,” Barack Obama said. “Now from a neighbor, that’s exhausting. From a president, it’s just dangerous.”\n\nCalling Trump a “stale” act, former President Obama said the country is “ready” for someone different.\n\n“We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We’ve seen that movie – and we all know that the sequel is usually worse,” he said. “America’s ready for a new chapter. America’s ready for a better story.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nFormer President Barack Obama honors Joe Biden\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said choosing President Joe Biden as his running mate sixteen years ago turned out to be the best decision he made.\n\n“Other than some common Irish blood, Joe and I come from different backgrounds. But we became brothers,” Obama said. “And as we worked together for eight - sometimes pretty tough- years, what I came to admire most about Joe wasn’t just his smarts, his experience. It was his empathy and his decency and his hard-earned resilience; his unshakable belief that everyone in this country deserves a fair shot.”\n\nObama touted Biden’s handling of the economy and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“At a time when the other party had turned into a cult of personality, we needed a leader who was steady, and brought people together, and was selfless enough to do the rarest thing there is in politics: putting his own ambition aside for the sake of the country,” he said.\n\nHe said that history will remember Biden as an “outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger.”\n\n“And I am proud to call him my president, but I am even prouder to call him my friend,” he added. “Now the torch has been passed. Now it’s up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMichelle Obama's new catch phrase: Do something\n\nThe former first lady reminded her fellow Democrats on Tuesday that presidential elections are marathons, not sprints.\n\n\"If we see a bad poll, and we will, we’ve got to put down that phone and do something!\" she told the crowd, before chants of \"do something!\" broke out multiple times.\n\nIt appeared to be a new catch phrase for Michelle Obama. In her 2016 convention speech, her comments that “When they go low, we go high” instantly went viral.\n\n— Marina Pitofsky\n\nMichelle Obama: 'Something wonderfully magical is in the air'\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama kicked off her remarks by asking the Democratic crowd in Chicago \"Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn’t it?\"\n\n\"Not just here in this arena… but spreading all across this country we love,\" she said, adding \"It’s the contagious power of hope!\"\n\n— Marina Pitofsky\n\nMichelle Obama criticizes Trump during remarks\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama said that for years, Trump “did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.”\n\n“His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,” she said, referring to her and her husband former President Barack Obama.\n\n“Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those “Black jobs?” she added. “It’s his same old con- his same old con: doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better.”\n\nShe knocked the former president’s policies on healthcare, reproductive healthcare access, educational policies and book banning.\n\n“Going small is never the answer,” she said. “Going small is the opposite of what we teach our kids. Going small is petty, it’s unhealthy, and quite frankly, it’s unpresidential. So, why would any of us accept this from anyone seeking our highest office? Why would we normalize that type of backward leadership?”\n\nShe said that Americans “deserve so much better.”\n\n“That’s why we must do everything in our power to elect two of those good, big-hearted people. There is no other choice than Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” she said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMichelle Obama cautions against “Goldilocks” voters\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama said Tuesday this year’s election will still be an uphill battle for Democrats, and she offered the party a warning: “We cannot be our own worst enemies.”\n\n“The minute something goes wrong,\" Michelle Obama said, “the minute a lie takes hold, folks, we cannot start wringing our hands.”\n\n“We cannot get a Goldilocks complex about whether everything is just right.”\n\nWhile enthusiasm on the left has soared, evidenced by rally attendance and campaign donations, since Harris took over the ticket, some progressive voters have raise their concerns about the vice president’s record.\n\n“Kamala and Tim, they have lived amazing lives, and I am confident they will lead with compassion, inclusion and grace,” Michelle Obama said. “But they are still only human. They are not perfect. And like all of us, they will make mistakes.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nDoug Emhoff makes debut on convention stage Tuesday\n\nSecond Gentleman Doug Emhoff kicked off his remarks by acknowledging his family members in the audience, especially his mother.\n\n“A special shout out to my mother. I see you. My mother is the only person in the whole world who thinks Kamala is the lucky one for marrying me,” he joked.\n\nEmhoff recalls the time he connected with Harris: he got set up on a blind date and was given none other than Harris’ phone number.\n\n“Now for generations, people have debated when to call the person you're going to set up with. And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30am,” he said. “And yet that's when I dialed. I got Kamala's voicemail, and I just started rambling.”\n\nHe later added, “I was eating at my desk, which was not a regular occurrence for a busy lawyer like me who appreciated a good business lunch, but that's when she called me back and we talked for an hour and we laughed.”\n\nHe said that he loves her laugh, which has been criticized by Trump and other Republicans.\n\n“Maybe that counted as our first date, or maybe it was that Saturday night when I picked her up and told her, buckle up. I'm a really bad driver, because you can't hide anything from Kamala Harris, so you might as well own it, and as I got to know her better, and just fell in love fast,” he said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSen. Duckworth shares personal infertility story in speech\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois highlighted reproductive rights when addressing the convention crowd, speaking to her own experience having children with the help of invitro fertilization.\n\n“If they win, Republicans will not stop at banning abortion,” Duckworth said.\n\nSpeaking to her own journey having children, the senator and veteran blasted Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nDuckworth warned of what she called “Trump’s anti-woman crusade.”\n\n“My struggle with infertility was more painful than any wound I earned on the battlefield,” Duckworth said. “So how dare a convicted felon like Donald Trump treat women seeking health care like they’re the ones breaking the law. How dare JD Vance criticize childless women on cable news, then vote against legislation that would have actually helped Americans to start families.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nMcCain’s GOP is ‘gone,’ Arizona Republican says\n\nThe late Sen. John McCain’s Republican Party is “gone” and voters don’t owe a “damn thing” to today’s GOP, said a Republican mayor from the battleground state of Arizona.\n\nMesa Mayor John Giles is leading a coalition of Republicans who support Harris in Arizona. He brought his pitch to Chicago on Tuesday night.\n\n“John McCain’s Republican Party is gone and we don’t owe a damn thing to what’s been left behind,” Giles said.\n\nGiles called McCain his hero during his remarks, and had harsh words for former President Donald Trump. He said that Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will put “country over party” in the same spirit as McCain, who represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate for three decades.\n\nThe Mesa mayor also noted that despite appearing at the Democratic National Convention, he’s a lifelong Republican.\n\n“I feel more at home here than in today’s Republican Party,” Giles said. “The Grand Old Party has been kidnapped by extremists and devolved into a cult.”\n\n-- Stephanie Murray\n\nAlsobrooks, friend of Harris, knocks Trump\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a friend of Harris’s and Democratic nominee for Maryland Senate seat, told convention attendees Tuesday that she’s “always been inspired by women like my grandmother, women who imagined a better future and then have the grit to make it a reality.”\n\n“One of those women is a friend, a mentor and a role model. That woman is Kamala Harris,” she said.\n\nAlsobrooks blasted Trump, saying that ever since he rode down the escalator in 2015 announcing his presidential run, “we as a nation have felt trapped.”\n\n“Every national decision has been made in reaction to this one man and his extremist Maga movement,” she said. “We are still frozen by the fear that Donald Trump might once again come to power. And it's not just our politics that have been trapped. It's our imagination, and then Kamala came along. Kamala has reminded us that we don't need to fear anything, not the future, and certainly not that man.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump only rich in ‘stupidity,’ billionaire Pritzker says\n\nGov. JB Pritzker bashed Trump’s personal fortune – and his intellect – during a DNC speech in the governor’s home state of Illinois.\n\n“Donald Trump thinks that we should trust him on the economy because he claims to be very rich. But take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: Stupidity,” said Pritzker, a billionaire whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain.\n\nPritzker was seen as a contender for vice president before Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket. He praised both candidates and credited Harris for cleaning up Trump’s “mess” during her time in the Biden administration.\n\n“We have a choice, America, between the man who left our country a total mess and the woman who has spent four years cleaning it up. And I think it’s time we stop expecting women to clean up messes without the authority and the title to match the job,” Pritzker said.\n\n-- Stephanie Murray\n\nSanders touts Biden record, says more to be done\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., praised the Biden administration and called for additional reforms in what would be a consecutive Democratic White House if Harris wins 2024.\n\n“Brothers and sisters, bottom-line: We need an economy that works for all of us, not just the billionaire class,” Sanders, 82, said in his convention speech.\n\nThe senator, who ran against both Biden and Harris in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, gave the vice president his backing Tuesday.\n\n“I look forward to working with Kamala and Tim to pass this agenda,” Sanders said.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris and Walz tune in to the DNC live from Wisconsin\n\nAfter the convention delegates finished up their roll call, reaffirming Harris as the party’s nominee, the crowd at the convention turned their attention to a live broadcast of Harris and Walz speaking from a campaign event in Wisconsin.\n\n“We are so honored to be your nominees,” Harris said. “This is a people powered campaign and together, will charge a new way forward.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSchumer calls for a Democratic majority in the Senate, condemns antisemitism\n\nDancing to the tune of Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk” as he entered the convention stage, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer began his remarks offering a stark contrast between a Harris term and a Trump term.\n\n“This November, we can choose a brighter, a fairer, a freer future, or we can relive the dark night of Trump's American carnage. Only one candidate will move America forward, Kamala Harris,” he said.\n\nWorking with Harris in the Senate, Schumer said he saw a leader who was fearless and stood up for middle class families.\n\n“She will lead America forward into a brighter future, but she can't do it alone. She needs a Democratic majority in the Senate of the United States,” Schumer said.\n\nHe also closed his remarks on a personal note, discussing his background as a high ranking Jewish elected official.\n\n“I want my grandkids and all grandkids to never, never face discrimination because of who they are. But Donald Trump, this is a guy who peddles antisemitic stereotypes… I am wearing this blue square to stand up to antisemitism, to stand up to all hate. Our children, our grandchildren, no matter their race, no matter their creed, their gender or family, deserve better than Donald Trump's American carnage,” he said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhy did Minnesota and California go last at the Democratic convention?\n\nThe ceremonial roll call at the Democratic convention mostly went in alphabetical order by state on Tuesday as delegates cheered for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\n\nBut why did Minnesota and California wrap up the roll call? Those are Harris and Walz's home states, receiving the traditional honor of finalizing the proceedings.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nAna Navarro hits Donald Trump, Kristi Noem\n\n\"The View\" co-host criticized former President Donald Trump on Tuesday and gave Kamala Harris a sweeping endorsement. But she also focused on man's best friend's role in the 2024 election.\n\n\"We cannot elect a president who does not like dogs − or hangs around with people who shoot them,\" Navarro said.\n\nTrump during his term in office said he didn't have time for a furry friend. But South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem earlier this year faced major backlash after sharing in her book that she had shot a family dog that exhibited aggressive behavior.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris certified as presidential nominee in party atmosphere\n\nIn an enthusiastic ceremonial vote Tuesday, Democrats approved Vice President Harris as their 2024 presidential nominee.\n\nGoing alphabetically, representatives from each state cast votes in a process that included appearances from politicians as well as stars like Lil Jon, Spike Lee, Eva Longoria, Sean Astin and DJ Cassidy.\"\n\nHarris had already secured the official nomination ahead of the convention via a virtual roll call earlier this month. Democrats held a similarly (but less star-studded) ceremonial vote for Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Monday.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat’s that song that keeps playing in Chicago?\n\nAs Democrats gather in United Center, party organizers have nodded to the home of the Chicago Bulls and star Michael Jordan with use of the basketball team’s iconic theme song, “Sirius.”\n\nThe song played as introduction for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker during Tuesday’s ceremonial roll call as well as for former Bulls player, now NBA head coach Steve Kerr, who addressed the convention Monday.\n\nOther state-related hits made the roll call playlist, including “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Lose Yourself” by Michigan’s Eminem.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump says he would consider appointing RFK, Jr., to administration\n\nTrump has changed his tune considerably on Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., now that the independent candidate is thinking about endorsing him.\n\nAsked by a CNN reporter Tuesday if he would consider a role for RFK, Jr., in a second Trump administration, the former president said: “I didn’t know he was thinking about getting out, but if he is thinking about getting out, certainly I’d be open to it.”\n\nTrump called Kennedy “a brilliant guy\" and \"a very smart guy\" - a far cry from April, when he called him “far more liberal than anyone running as a Democrat.\" At the time, Trump expressed concern that Kennedy's independent candidacy might cost him votes in the general election.\n\nTrump's softer tone came after Kennedy running mate Nicole Shanahan said that their campaign was considering dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing Trump.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump fixer Michael Cohen turns heads at the DNC\n\nMichael Cohen, who worked as a fixer and attorney for former President Donald Trump, was spotted at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.Cohen, who spent more than two years behind bars for lying to U.S. congressional committees about Trump projects, testified against the former president during his May trial in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts related to the hush money payments to a porn star in 2016.DNC attendees stopped to take pictures with the frequent TV personality, who is reportedly shopping his own TV show called “The Fixer.”--Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nAnti-Trump Republicans bash former president on convention stage\n\nAt the convention Tuesday, anti-Trump Republicans discussed why they were supporting Kamala Harris in November.\n\nKyle Sweetser, a former Trump voter, said that he used to donate the Trump campaign. But changed, he said, when he “started to see Trump's tariff policy in action.”\n\n“Costs for construction workers like me were starting to soar. I realized Trump wasn't for me. He was for lining his own pockets,” said Sweetser. “Now I'm not left wing, period. But I believe our leaders should bring out the best in us, not the worst. That's why I'm voting for Kamala Harris.”\n\nStephanie Grisham, a former Trump press secretary, said that she wasn’t just a supporter of the former president. She said she was a “true believer” and one of his “closest advisors” who would spend her holidays at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“On January 6, I asked Melania if we could at least tweet that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, there's no place for lawlessness or violence,” said Grisham. “She replied with one word, no. I became the first senior staffer to resign that day. I couldn't be part of the insanity any longer.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nCommon: ‘Harris will change the world’\n\nCommon, the award-winning rapper, actor and activist from Chicago, performed on stage with gospel musician Jonathan McReynolds on Tuesday night.\n\n“I thank God for this moment in time where Kamala Harris will change the world for the better,” Common said when he took the stage. The pair sang about being “fortunate to be alive” during their performance.\n\n− Stephanie Murray\n\nJimmy Carter's grandson honors the former president\n\nJason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, opened his remarks by honoring his 99-year-old grandfather.\n\n“I can tell you that he wishes he could be here tonight. He and my grandmother led their lives with an unwavering faith in God, a respect for human dignity, honesty and a commitment to loving their neighbors as themselves,” Jason Carter said. “Those principles guided them throughout their lives, including during their four years in the White House and the four decades since.”\n\nJimmy Carter has been in hospice care for over a year and former first lady Rosalynn Carter, his wife, died last year.\n\n“Kamala Harris carries my grandfather's legacy. She knows what is right, and she fights for it. She understands that leadership is about service, not selfishness, that you can show strength and demonstrate decency,” said Jason Carter.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nJFK grandson Jack Schlossberg speaking on night two\n\nJack Schlossberg, grandson of former President John F. Kennedy, is set to appear at the Democratic convention Tuesday.\n\nThe 31-year-old Vogue political correspondent was photographed earlier Tuesday meeting former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., conjuring flashbacks to decades ago when Pelosi, then 17, met Kennedy, a senator at the time.\n\nSchlossberg is scheduled to take the stage immediately after another presidential descendant: Jason Carter, grandson of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nJames Taylor addresses scrapped performance at DNC 2024: 'Sorry to disappoint'\n\nThe acclaimed singer-songwriter James Taylor was scheduled to perform at the opening night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday. Taylor was slated to take the stage at the United Center alongside appearances from country music star Mickey Guyton and Americana singer Jason Isbell.\n\nBut while Guyton and Isbell delivered their DNC performances as promised, Taylor was notably absent from the Day 1 lineup.\n\nIn an Instagram post Tuesday, Taylor addressed his absence from the DNC lineup Monday night.\n\n\"We had a great rehearsal with @RickeyMinor and terrific singers, @KenyaHathaway and Mathew Johnson before the event,\" Taylor wrote. \"But it became clear, as the evening unfolded, that there wouldn't be time for our 'You've Got a Friend' with cello and voices. Maybe the organizers couldn't anticipate the wild response from the floor of the United Center…\"\n\n– Edward Segarra\n\nDNC speakers schedule tonight: See who is speaking Tuesday, including Barack and Michelle Obama\n\nThe 2024 Democratic National Convention resumes Tuesday in Chicago after the first day saw appearances and speeches from the likes of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, basketball coach Steve Kerr and President Joe Biden.\n\nTuesday will also see its fair share of party heavyweights take the stage, with former First Lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama, among others, expected to speak.\n\nHere's a full list of everyone expected to speak at the convention Tuesday evening.\n\n– Gabe Hauari\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock calls Donald Trump a 'plague on the American conscience'\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia on Monday said the 2024 election is \"about the character of the country.\"\n\n\"People with no vision traffic in division,\" Warnock said. \"(Former President Donald Trump) doesn't know how to lead us, so he wants to divide us. Make no mistake, Donald Trump is a plague on the American conscience. He is a clear and present threat to the precious covenant we share with one another.\"\n\nWarnock also praised Biden as a \"true patriot who has always put the people first.\"\n\n−Melissa Brown\n\n'A fiasco': Officers arrest retired doctor, 70, biking near Gaza war convention protest\n\nA 70-year-old retired emergency room physician said he was bicycling along an empty street Monday near a Gaza war protest when a Homeland Security officer arrested him for trespassing.\n\nCharles Steinbruegge, of Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood, wanted to check out the demonstrations near the United Center, where Democrats are gathering this week for their national convention.\n\nSteinbruegge, a 20-year Army veteran who considers himself politically moderate and feels \"agnostic\" on the Israel-Hamas war, was not a protester, but a curious onlooker. He said he biked down a deserted street, away from an area police had cordoned off. Then an officer approached him, said he was in a restricted area − and promptly slapped him in handcuffs.\n\n– Sophie Carson\n\nWhat time will Michelle Obama speak?\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama will address the convention shortly before 10 p.m. CT, according to a DNC schedule. She will speak immediately before her husband, former President Barack Obama, who is slated to take the stage at 10 p.m.\n\nMichelle Obama gave a memorable speech at the 2016 convention, where her “when they go low, we go high” catchphrase went viral.\n\n– Stephanie Murray\n\nWhat time will Barack Obama speak?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama is scheduled to speak at 10 p.m. ET, right after his wife Michelle Obama takes the convention stage.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nConvention honors civil rights icon, Rev. Jesse Jackson\n\nDemocrats paid tribute Monday to Rev. Jesse Jackson, 82, the longtime civil rights activist and politician.\n\nJackson announced last year his diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. He appeared on stage in a wheelchair and received a standing ovation from delegates.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is DNC guest Jesse Jackson? Former presidential candidate makes appearance\n\nKinzinger, Grisham: Anti-Trump Republicans to hit the stage at the convention\n\nRepublicans who have been vocal critics of former President Donald Trump will appear on stage at the convention to discuss why they are supporting Kamala Harris.\n\nThese Republicans include former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham, former Illinois U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger and Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nJasmine Crockett, Steve Kerr: Monday night’s memorable convention moments\n\nDemocrats began their convention with a packed lineup of night one speakers, albeit with a few last minute cuts after events ran more than an hour past schedule.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers took the stage, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who rose to prominence in part over her spars with Georgia's firebrand on the other side of the aisle, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nOn Monday, Crockett turned her attention and ire to Trump: \"Kamala Harris has a resume, Donald Trump has a rap sheet,\" Crockett said, also calling the former president a \"vindictive, vile villain.\"\n\nThe convention kick-off also included some non-Washington stars, like head coach of the NBA’s Golden State Warriors Steve Kerr.\n\nKerr, who just helped lead the USA basketball to gold in the 2024 Paris Olympics this summer, said he now wants to see Americans (presumably even Jayson Tatum) “playing on the same team” and voting for Harris in November.\n\n“And after the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry, we can tell Donald Trump night night!” Kerr said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump attacks Harris over crime and police policy\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump made crime and police policy his major themes Tuesday, part of his ongoing counter-convention campaign against Democratic opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nSpeaking at a county sheriff's office in Howell, Mich., Trump decried what he called a \"Kamala crime wave\" – despite surveys showing reductions of crime in recent years – and assailed Harris' law enforcement views.\n\n\"It's a real anti-police crusade,\" Trump said of the vice president who has also been a district attorney in San Francisco and attorney general of California.\n\nOpponents also hit Trump for holding his anti-crime event in Howell, a city with a troubled racial history, including links to the Ku Klux Klan back in the 1960s and 1970s; just last month, groups of white supremacists marched through the city, carrying Nazi flags and chanting \"We love Hitler. We love Trump.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Mich. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said: \"This is, I think, a troubling, troubling strategy that we see from the other side to divide us and to scare us and to stoke fear and anger.\" Trump rejected that complaint after his speech, and reminded reporters that President Joe Biden visited Howell in 2021.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow to live stream Democratic convention\n\nYou can watch USA TODAY's live stream of the Democratic convention below.\n\nObama's legacy looms large in Chicago\n\nOutside the Democratic National Convention, screen, printer and T-shirt vendor and Chicago native Rod Robinson, 60, said Obama represents the hope people like his grandparents long sought. As a Black family, Robinson said they admire Obama’s hard work and success from the very beginning: He never broke their faith.\n\nTuesday, Robinson was selling a special commemorative T-shirt featuring Obama and Harold Washington, Chicago's first Black mayor. Obama was a community organizer in Chicago before becoming a law professor at the University of Chicago and entering politics.“He’s as advertised: He’s not someone you can go dig up social media dirt in. He’s a good father, a good husband, a good man. And he came through for a lot of people,” Robinson said. “To see somebody … who followed all the rules, followed all of the instructions, went to school, went to college and came out in top? He’s like a superhero. He just doesn’t have a cape or invisible jet.”\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll of Black voters in several swing states shows Obama remains wildly popular among Black Democrats, especially: In Michigan, 84% of Black voters had a favorable impression of Obama, compared to 72% for Harris, 64% for Biden and 15% for Trump. In Pennsylvania 82% of Black voters have a favorable opinion of him, compared to 68% for Harris, 58% for Biden and 15% for Trump.\n\nThe survey of 500 Black voters in each of those states was conducted earlier this month. Harris is trying to persuade those Obama supporters to turn out for her in November, battling dissatisfaction felt for Biden by Black Americans, a key voting bloc to a Democratic win.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nWill Taylor Swift endorse Kamala Harris? Swifties in London weigh in\n\nWhile the DNC is in full swing in Chicago, Swifties in London spent most of Tuesday afternoon debating whether the singer would announce the rerelease of her album “Reputation.” So while many fans were dressed in outfits featuring the album’s black color scheme and snake motif, other garb had political implications.\n\nHalli Baker of Ohio walked down Olympic Lane to Wembley Stadium wearing a “Taylor for President 2024” white T-shirt.\n\n“The shirt is not leaning red. It’s not leaning blue,” Baker said. “I do think she’ll come out and be supportive of the Democratic Party.”\n\nMeghan Connors of Joplin, Missouri, agreed, saying Swift has already passively endorsed Harris.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if she doesn’t publicly endorse her by the end of September or maybe mid-October,” Connors, 30, said. “I think she’ll promote it on social media, but don’t think she’s going to the DNC. American politics can get so volatile or so aggressive, you look at the Capitol attack. She wouldn’t put herself in that much of the public eye because it would be dangerous.”\n\nRochelle Ulloa from Los Angeles thinks Swift has planned out when she will make a political move.\n\n“It's like all eyes are on Taylor to make a move, but she's always made a good, honest effort,” Ulloa said. “Like she supported President Biden in the last campaign, and I think she just waits for when the time is right.”\n\n— Bryan West\n\n'He’s just, like, an old guy': Gen Z Democrats laugh at Donald Trump-Taylor Swift AI drama\n\nWhen does the Democratic National Convention start tonight?\n\nConvention organizers are “making adjustments” to Tuesday night’s programming to ensure the festivities don’t stretch into the early hours of the morning, as they did on Monday.\n\nDay 2 of the Democratic convention will start at 5:30 p.m. CT/6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nSpeakers will include former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, Illinois Gov.

Bernie Sanders weighed in on the economic plans coming out of the Harris campaign, the Israel-Hams war and progressive candidates in this year's primaries.\n\nSanders on Kamala Harris’ economic plan: Harris unveiled a plan last week which includes plans to ease rent increases, cap prescription drug prices for everyone, boost first-time homebuyers, end grocery price gouging and bolster the child tax credit.

Sanders on Israel-Hamas war and U.S. aid: While he has been a staunch supporter of what Biden and Harris have done on domestic issues, on this issue, “I think the president is wrong,” he said. “Israel had a right to defend itself against this horrible Hamas terrorist attack, but it did not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people,” Sanders said. “And now creating a situation where tens and tens of thousands of children face starvation because Israel is not letting humanitarian aid come through.”\n\nWhile he has been a staunch supporter of what Biden and Harris have done on domestic issues, on this issue, “I think the president is wrong,” he said. “Israel had a right to defend itself against this horrible Hamas terrorist attack, but it did not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people,” Sanders said. “And now creating a situation where tens and tens of thousands of children face starvation because Israel is not letting humanitarian aid come through.” Sanders on progressive members of the Democratic primaries losing: Reps. Jamaal Bowman, D-New York, and Cori Bush, D-Missouri, all members of the informal group of House lawmakers known as the \"Squad,\" were booted by more moderate Democrats. Asked if the progressive wing of the party was weakening, Sanders pointed to Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, who defeated a primary challenger. “We have a campaign finance system today which is corrupt,” he said, blaming the defeats of Bush and Bowman on super PACs. ”And that is not, to me, what democracy is about.”\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nHarris commences transition planning\n\nKamala Harris has begun preliminary planning for a potential presidential transition, a move expected of any presidential candidate, according to a source familiar with the planning efforts.\n\nThe transition team will be led by Yohannes Abraham, U.S. Ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Abraham served as executive director of the Biden-Harris transition in 2020 and worked in various roles in the Obama administration.

Harris is surging past Trump in battleground states, according to polling.\n\nMuch of the convention this week will focus on that enthusiasm and turning the page as Democrats focus on reproductive rights, bringing down costs for average Americans and attacking Trump's character.\n\nProtests outside the arena threaten to distract from the progressive unity fest, however, as left-leaning activists demand Harris and the Democrats do more to end Israel's bombardment of Gaza as a result of its war with Hamas stemming from the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from Day 1.\n\n'Thank you, Joe': Biden's farewell kicks off DNC 2024: Democrats paid tribute to Biden's five-decade career Monday evening, which began in the Richard Nixon era as the country's youngest senator and ends as its oldest president.\n\nDemocrats paid tribute to Biden's five-decade career Monday evening, which began in the Richard Nixon era as the country's youngest senator and ends as its oldest president.

According to a news release, 99% of participating delegates supported Harris in the virtual roll call, and Harris and Walz accepted the nomination a day later.\n\nIn the meantime, there is still plenty left to do for the Democratic delegates. The DNC offers them a chance to adopt and unify a comprehensive party platform, taking a stance on issues like reproductive rights, immigration and economic policy. They'll also have a kind-of ceremonial vote for Harris, but her position as Democratic nominee is already final\n\nThe Democratic Party will post updates on its convention website, which can be found at demconvention.com.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nWhere is the DNC?\n\nThe convention will be in Chicago, just 90 miles south of Milwaukee, where the Republican National Convention was recently held.\n\nThe Democratic Party has held a national convention every four years since 1832 to nominate its chosen candidates, and Chicago has a storied history of hosting conventions on both sides of the political aisle dating back to 1860, with the nomination of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Sun-Times, this will be the Windy City’s 26th political convention.\n\n— Maya Homan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/21/democratic-convention-dnc-live-updates-tim-walz-speech/74800609007/", "title": "Democratic convention replay: Tim Walz accepts VP nomination", "text": "Minnesota Gov.

The Democrat who was vetted as a possible running mate to join Vice President Kamala Harris on the presidential ticket told fellow members of his political party that they – not Republicans – represent “real freedom.”\n\nAs voters eye the upcoming election, they see a fork in the road with each candidate offering a wildly different path. “Will we be a nation defined by chaos and extremism or will we choose a path of decency, honor and continued progress?” Shapiro asked. Former President Donald Trump and Republicans, Shapiro said, want to chip away at hard-won freedoms away from Americans.\n\nHe mentioned efforts to restrict what books children can read and strip away abortion rights.

He creates chaos, and then he sort of curates it as if it were precious art,” Clinton said, before adding “When Kamala Harris is president, every day will begin with you, you, you, you.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nJeffries on Trump: ‘We broke up with you for a reason’\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., began his remarks by saying President Joe Biden’s time in office would be remembered as some of the most consequential in U.S. history, and he thanked Biden for his decision not to seek another term and instead endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket.\n\n“Now the road ahead will not be easy,” he said.\n\nJeffries described former President Donald Trump as a man on a mission to revive a failed relationship. “Donald Trump is like an old boyfriend who you broke up with, but he just won’t go away,” Jeffries said. “We broke up with you for a reason.”\n\n“Been there, done that. We’re not going back,” Jeffries said, a potential reference to Taylor Swift's hit \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\"\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nMindy Kaling shares memory of cooking with Kamala Harris\n\nActress Mindy Kaling opened her remarks with a playful joke, “I am so proud to be here supporting my friend. But the real reason I am here is that deep down, I truly believe that as a woman of color and as a single mother of three, it is incredibly important that I be appointed the ambassador to Italy.”\n\nBut on a more serious note, Kaling recalled a fond memory of spending time with Harris when they were filming a video making a popular Indian food, dosa, together.\n\n“She was so much better than me, but she also knew that my family was watching, so as she gently corrected my sloppy dosa making, she was complimenting me every step of the way, making sure that my daughter…heard how good of a cook I am,” she said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKenan Thompson blasts Project 2025\n\nComedian Kenan Thompson came on stage to do a dramatic reading and continue Democratic criticism of Project 2025 – a conservative blueprint for a Republican presidency.\n\nTrump has continually denied association with the plan.\n\nIn conversations with a handful of Americans appearing virtually, Thompson highlighted a variety of agenda items, from cutting LGBTQ rights to eliminating the Department of Education.\n\n“You ever seen a document that can kill a small animal and democracy at the same time?” the comedian said while holding a large hardback copy of the project.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nStevie Wonder delivers electric performance of ‘Higher Ground’\n\nBefore Stevie Wonder began performing “Higher Ground,” he told the crowd he loved them and urged them to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris with a positive message.\n\n“As we stand between history’s pain and tomorrow’s promises, we must choose courage over complacency,” he said. “We need to choose joy over anger. Kindness over recrimination and peace over war every time. We must choose to be above the ugly words, the hateful anger and the division those words and anger create. We must keep on keeping on until we are truly a united people of these United States and then – and then – we will reach our higher ground.”\n\nThe crowd clapped and boogeyed along to the hit song.\n\n−Clara Hendrickson\n\nJan. 6 attack on US Capitol revisited\n\nThe segment of the DNC programming Wednesday night that focused on Jan. 6, 2021, started by airing a video of former President Donald Trump’s speech that dat when he encouraged his supporters to fight his 2020 election loss before they stormed the U.S. Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying the results.\n\nThe video revisited harrowing scenes from the deadly assault and the effort to stop the peaceful transition of presidential power.\n\n“Thank God they failed,” said Mississippi’s U.S. House Rep. Bennie Thompson, of Trump’s supporters. “Because in this county, we settle our differences at the ballot box, not through violence.” Thompson chaired the committee that investigated what lead up to and unfolded on Jan. 6. He warned that Trump is in the middle of another effort to sow doubt on the upcoming Nov. 5 election.\n\nFormer U.S. Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilino Gonell followed Thompson. He said he saw violence while serving in the military in Iraq. “Nothing, nothing prepared me for Jan. 6,” he said. “I was assaulted with a pole attached to the American flag.” He said he almost died.\n\n−Clara Hendrickson\n\nAnti-Trump Republicans hit the stage to bash the former president\n\nTwo Republicans rallied on stage Wednesday and talked about why they're voting for Harris in November. Olivia Troye, former Trump administration national security official, accused the former president of \"laying the groundwork to undermine this election.”\n\n“Being inside Trump's White House was terrifying, but what keeps me up at night is what will happen If he gets back there,” she added.\n\nGeoff Duncan, former lieutenant governor of Georgia, called on Republicans to vote for Harris.\n\n“If Republicans are being intellectually honest with ourselves, our party is not civil or conservative, it's chaotic and crazy, and the only thing left to do is dump Trump,” he said.\n\n“Look, you don't have to agree with every policy position of Kamala Harris. I don't, but you do have to recognize her prosecutor mindset that understands right from wrong, good from evil.

No one is outside the circle of our compassion,” he said.\n\nHarris “never shied away from a good fight” as a prosecutor, said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. “But what really stands out is when she stood up and protected her constituent’s freedoms,” Nessel said, pointing to Harris’ refusal to defend California’s ban on same-sex marriage. “It meant a lot. She was fighting for families like mine.” Nessel is the first openly LGBTQ+ person to hold statewide office in Michigan.\n\nNessel concluded her speech by referencing Trump’s felony convictions and the pending criminal cases against him. Harris is taking the path from the courtroom to the White House, she said. “Not the other way around.”\n\n−Clara Hendrickson\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz knocks Ron DeSantis\n\nRep.

But changed, he said, when he “started to see Trump's tariff policy in action.”\n\n“Costs for construction workers like me were starting to soar. I realized Trump wasn't for me. He was for lining his own pockets,” said Sweetser. “Now I'm not left wing, period. But I believe our leaders should bring out the best in us, not the worst. That's why I'm voting for Kamala Harris.”\n\nStephanie Grisham, a former Trump press secretary, said that she wasn’t just a supporter of the former president. She said she was a “true believer” and one of his “closest advisors” who would spend her holidays at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“On January 6, I asked Melania if we could at least tweet that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, there's no place for lawlessness or violence,” said Grisham. “She replied with one word, no.

She went on to name the other states where she expects other voters will follow suit this November to enshrine abortion rights.\n\nPlanned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson shared the story of a Georgia patient who couldn’t have an abortion because of the state’s six-week abortion ban. The patient had to crisscross the country – encountering ban after ban – before flying to California to terminate her pregnancy, McGill Johnson said. “We cannot call ourselves a free nation when women are not free,” she said. “Our bodies are on the ballot.”\n\nShe was followed by former President of Planned Parenthood Cecile Richards who said that when the nation’s high court overturned Roe, a generation of young people lost their reproductive freedom. “That’s the Republican promise of state’s rights,” she said.\n\n−Clara Hendrickson\n\nCory Booker honors Bill Pascrell, Democratic lawmaker who died this week\n\nSen.

Several people have been released, but many others are still in custody, he said.\n\nSome of the demonstrators last night “felt like they couldn’t leave” and were mostly surrounded by police at times, Meyer said.\n\nOfficers’ “tactics last night were very concerning,” he said. Meyer also questioned whether police issued a mass arrest order too early in the demonstration. He argued that people have the right to protest even if the protest is not permitted by police. He raised doubt that the protesters posed an immediate threat to public safety when the arrest order was issued.\n\nHe said two protesters since Sunday were hospitalized “because of police abuse” but would not specify their injuries. Two others were hospitalized because of prescription medication needs, he said. Among those arrested were at least two photojournalists.

In this case, Trump labeled Hochul \"the nastiest speaker\" at the convention's opening night.\n\nTrump has not commented publicly — so far — on the speeches by Clinton or the Obamas.\n\nIn Hochul's speech on Monday night, the New York governor said Trump does not reflect American values.\n\n“Donald Trump was born a New Yorker but ended up a fraud, a philanderer and a felon,\" Hochul said.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nWho is Jason Rae?

Tom Rice, one of the 10 House Republicans who had voted to impeach the former President, in a primary Tuesday.\n\nBut in a district south of Rice’s, another one-time Trump critic, Rep. Nancy Mace, narrowly survived another challenge from a Trump-endorsed rival. The races at once showed the difficulty of surviving in a GOP still dominated by Trump without embracing his grievances.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nevada, Republicans chose a vocal supporter of Trump’s lies about election fraud as their nominee to become the state’s top elections official.\n\nAnd in the Rio Grande Valley, Republicans’ gains among Latino voters were on display in a special election for a House seat that could offer a glimpse at what’s to come in several key states in November’s midterm elections.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday’s races:\n\nTrump topples another intra-party critic in South Carolina House primary\n\nThe former President settled another political score in South Carolina, as Trump-endorsed state Rep. Russell Fry handily defeated Rep. Tom Rice in a Republican primary in Pee Dee.\n\nRice is the latest Republican purged from the party after breaking with former President Donald Trump in the aftermath of the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Rice was one of 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Trump. He later became one of 35 Republicans to vote to create an independent commission to investigate the storming of the Capitol, which was ultimately blocked by Senate Republicans.\n\nFry’s ouster of Rice underscores the political peril that faces many Republicans who have crossed Trump. Rice, a conservative Republican who was first elected in 2012, has faced death threats, a censure from his state party and attacks from Trump himself.\n\nIn endorsing Fry in February, Trump said in a statement that Rice was “the coward who abandoned his constituents by caving to Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left” and “must be thrown out of office.” Rice shot back that Trump was a “would-be tyrant” who is “consumed by spite.”\n\n…But another one-time Trump critic survives his revenge effort\n\nWhile Rice was getting walloped, another House Republican, Rep. Nancy Mace, narrowly survived a Trump-fueled primary challenge by former state Rep. Katie Arrington in her Lowcountry district.\n\nOne key difference between the South Carolina Republican who lost a House primary Tuesday and the one who survived: Rice voted to impeach Trump; Mace did not.\n\nStill, she had been fiercely critical of Trump in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. “His entire legacy was wiped out yesterday,” she said of Trump in an appearance on CNN the next day.\n\nSince then, Mace has tacked to the right. The month after the insurrection, she picked a Twitter fight with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, mischaracterizing the New York Democrat’s comments about the threat posed by rioters.\n\nTrump endorsed Arrington. But Mace had high-profile cover in South Carolina, too, with former Gov.

Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger both defeated Trump-backed incumbents in last month’s primary.\n\nElection denier wins GOP primary for Nevada’s top elections office\n\nJim Marchant, a former state lawmaker and leading proponent of Trump’s lies about widespread election fraud, won the Republican primary for the Nevada secretary of state’s office Tuesday – adding the Silver State to the growing list of those where election deniers are positioning themselves to take over the election machinery ahead of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nMarchant is seeking to replace Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican who has repeatedly said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, but who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection.\n\nNevada is a presidential battleground state. President Joe Biden defeated Trump there by just 2.4 percentage points in 2020, and the state is poised to play a crucial role again in 2024, when Republicans will attempt to turn their gains in recent years among Latino voters into victories.\n\nNevada is also a potentially pivotal state in November’s midterm elections. Republicans nominated two Trump-endorsed candidates for two key races: Former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, whose grandfather Paul Laxalt was a former governor, senator and a towering figure in Nevada politics, won the GOP primary take on Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.\n\nAnd Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo emerged from the Republican contest to challenge Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who is seeking his second term.\n\nDemocrat concedes in race for House seat in heavily Latino Texas district\n\nDemocrat Dan Sanchez’s concession to Republican Mayra Flores in a special election for what had long been a Democratic-held House seat in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley on Tuesday offered another glimpse at the GOP’s gains among Latino voters and the enthusiasm gap confronting Democrats as the midterm elections approach.\n\nCNN projected Flores the winner on Wednesday. She held off three other candidates in the low-turnout contest and topped 50% of the vote, allowing her to avoid a runoff.\n\nThe seat was vacated when former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela resigned in March to join a law and lobbying firm. Vela’s decision to bail early has proven costly for his party in the short term, as it will further narrow Democrats’ majority in the House.\n\nBut it could also do longer-term damage to Democrats’ standing in South Texas: Flores already is set to face off against Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who currently represents a neighboring district, in the redrawn 34th District in November. The newly drawn district is more favorable to Democrats than the one Flores ran in for Tuesday’s special election, but she would have the advantage of incumbency.\n\nFor Republicans, Flores’ victory is another sign that the party is making inroads with Latino voters in the Rio Grande Valley. If the GOP can replicate that trend, even in part, in other states – particularly Arizona and Nevada, two presidential battleground states with Democratic senators up for reelection this fall, and regions like Orange County, California, home to a host of competitive House races – it would fundamentally shift the nation’s political map.\n\nMaine tees up two key races\n\nMaine’s bombastic former Republican governor, Paul LePage, is now set to take on Democratic Gov. Janet Mills after the two advanced past Tuesday primaries that were mere formalities, since neither faced an opponent.\n\nRepublican former Rep. Bruce Poliquin, meanwhile, survived a contest with a conservative activist and is now set to try to reclaim his former congressional district in a rematch of a hard-fought 2018 race against Democratic Rep. Jared Golden.\n\nMaine uses a ranked-choice voting system. In 2018, Poliquin actually received more first-place votes than Golden. But after the ranked-choice system eliminated third-party candidates, Golden prevailed. But Trump won the district in 2020, giving Republicans hope that they can win the New England seat again in November.\n\nIn North Dakota, meanwhile, Republicans nominated Sen. John Hoeven for a third term, which he is widely expected to win in November.\n\nThis story has been updated Wednesday with CNN’s projection in the special election in Texas’ 34th District.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/29/politics/george-santos-house-gop-silence", "title": "Analysis: House GOP leadership silent as incoming congressman's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s a cloud hanging over Republicans’ takeover of the House next week – and for once, it’s not former President Donald Trump.\n\nCongressman-elect George Santos, whose victory in a New York district last month was key to the GOP flipping the chamber, insists he’s coming to Congress despite admitting this week to fabricating key parts of his biography. There’s a growing range of probes into his lies, with CNN reporting Wednesday night that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating his finances and local prosecutors are “looking into” his fabrications.\n\nThose falsehoods – several more of which CNN’s KFile uncovered on Wednesday – combined with Santos’ defiance and Republican leadership’s silence are setting up the GOP for a fraught first week in power.\n\nGOP leadership hasn’t even acknowledged the controversy, which is leading to fears among some of Santos’ fellow incoming congressmen from the Empire State that his issues could overshadow Republicans’ ascent to power.\n\n“Attempts to blame others or minimize his actions are only making things worse and a complete distraction from the task at hand,” Rep.-elect Mike Lawler said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n“New Yorkers deserve the truth and House Republicans deserve an opportunity to govern without this distraction,” said Rep.-elect Nick LaLota, who was elected to a Long Island district, in a statement Tuesday in which he called for an ethics investigation “and, if necessary, law enforcement” involvement.\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who has not returned CNN’s requests for comment about Santos, has been focused on trying to secure the votes for the speakership next month. That task became harder after Republicans won a narrower majority than he had hoped, a slim margin that will empower the conference’s most extreme members. Asking Santos to step down could cost him a vote in his already tenuous quest to reach 218.\n\nBut by not addressing the New York Republican’s lies, McCarthy may risk looking like he’s not in control of his party before ever taking the speaker’s gavel.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Analysis: Why a decades-old federal law could be Santos' undoing 01:40 • Source: CNN Analysis: Why a decades-old federal law could be Santos' undoing 01:40\n\nProsecutors ‘looking into’ Santos’ lies as more false claims emerge\n\nHouse Republicans’ path to the majority this year ran through New York, which was a bright spot for the party in an otherwise disappointing midterm performance. While falling short of their anticipated “red wave,” the GOP flipped four Democratic seats in the Empire State – one of which was the 3rd District that Santos carried by about 8 points.\n\nIt emerged on Wednesday that he made even more false claims about his family history, work history and education, according to a KFile review of statements made in his 2022 and 2020 congressional campaigns. Santos has not responded to CNN’s repeated requests for comment.\n\nSantos admitted to the New York Post on Monday that he didn’t “graduate from any institution of higher learning,” despite his biography at times listing an education at Baruch College and New York University. He also admitted that he never worked directly for the financial firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as he has previously suggested, but claimed that he did do work for them through his company, telling the Post it was a “poor choice of words” to say he worked for them.\n\nThe Nassau County district attorney’s office said Wednesday it is “looking into” the fabrications.\n\n“No one is above the law and if a crime was committed in this county, we will prosecute it,” District Attorney Anne Donnelly, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nProsecutors in the US attorney’s office in the Eastern District of New York are investigating Santos’ finances, a source familiar with the matter told CNN later Wednesday.

The claims from Santos that have earned the sharpest rebuke have been those about his proclaimed Jewish identity.\n\nSantos said in an appearance on a Fox News digital show in February that his maternal grandparents changed their Jewish last name from Zabrovsky – a claim for which there is no evidence and that records contradict, KFile reported on Wednesday.\n\nThat followed last week’s KFile revelations that Santos’ claims that his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname are contradicted by sources including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists.\n\nHis explanation has quickly become the source of mockery.\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos told the New York Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\nAnd yet, Santos described himself as a “proud American Jew” in a document shared with Jewish groups during the campaign, which was first reported by the Forward and confirmed by CNN this week.\n\nThe backlash came swiftly from local corners of the GOP and quickly went to larger influential groups.\n\n“I am deeply disappointed in Mr. Santos, and I expected more than just a blanket apology,” Nassau County GOP Chair Joseph G. Cairo, Jr., said in a statement Tuesday. “The damage that his lies have caused to many people, especially those who have been impacted by the Holocaust, are profound.”\n\n“His fabrications regarding the Holocaust and his family’s history are particularly hurtful,” Rep.-elect Anthony D’Esposito of New York added in his own statement.\n\nAnd Matt Brooks, the CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition – a powerful player in GOP national politics – said on Tuesday that Santos had “deceived us” and “will not be welcome at any future RJC event.”\n\nBut a week and a half after the initial revelations, most Republicans currently serving in the House are quiet, at least publicly.\n\nWith Congress out of session for the holidays, reporters can’t catch lawmakers in hallways of the Capitol. But they’ll be back next week, and it’s only a matter of time before members face pointed questions.\n\nOne member speaking up for Santos is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene – not necessarily the defender that a New York Republican, whose district voted for President Joe Biden by 8 points in 2020, probably wants in his corner.\n\n“I think we Republicans should give George Santos a chance and see how he legislates and votes, not treat him the same as the left is,” the Georgia Republican wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhen Greene was stripped of her committee assignments early last year, in the wake of incendiary and violent past statements that had recently been unearthed, it was the Democratic-controlled House (along with 11 Republicans) who made that happen – not GOP leadership. And once again, leadership seems to be looking past the problem.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Did I embellish my resume?

Yes I did': GOP Rep.-elect speaks out about lying 01:04\n\nTrumpian tactics\n\nSantos brought this upon himself – and yet, like the former president who still wields major influence over the House GOP, he seems eager to deflect responsibility. At one point, he has even tried to explain away his actions by casting himself as a victim of America’s elites.\n\nIn a bizarre interview with City and State on Monday, he spoke about having “the weight of the world” on his shoulders over the past week as news organizations have pored over his background. He then said “elitists” had looked down on him for working in customer service, seeming to suggest that’s why he omitted that experience and fabricated others on his resume.\n\nAlthough there’s no evidence he’s ever been convicted of a crime, Santos has tried to obfuscate on the issue. He was charged with embezzlement in a Brazilian court, as the New York Times first reported last week and CNN confirmed on Wednesday, according to case records from the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. Court records from 2013, however, state that the charge was archived after court summons went unanswered and they were unable to locate Santos.\n\n“I am not a criminal here – not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world,” Santos told the Post on Monday.\n\nIn another classic Trump move, he pivoted to attacking Biden and Democrats in a Tuesday interview on Fox’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight” when the guest host, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, pressed him on the meaning of “integrity” and asked, “Do you have no shame?”\n\nBut in trying to defend the discrepancies in his record, Santos then made a statement that Gabbard seized on for the way it could offend the everyday Americans he claims to have so much affinity for.\n\n“We can have this discussion that’s going to go way above the American people’s head, but that’s not what I campaigned on,” Santos said.\n\nAs Gabbard rightly pointed out in that interview, he’s not the only politician – from either party – whose background, as they’ve presented it, has received scrutiny. Santos is clearly leaning into the unpopularity of the institution he’s planning to join as he tries to defend his record.\n\n“I challenge all 434 members of Congress, aside myself, in the House, to go through the same litany test I just went through last week,” he told City and State. “Open yourselves up to the media. Let them dig deep and pull in your deepest secrets. If we did that, we wouldn’t have a single congressman in the House. And I bet you, we wouldn’t have a single senator in the Senate.”\n\nJust 22% of Americans approved of Congress in Gallup’s latest survey this fall. Santos claims his policy work is what will matter, but so far, he – and his party’s leadership – aren’t doing much to bring up those numbers.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/opinions/republican-george-santos-congress-test-filipovic", "title": "Opinion: Rep.-elect George Santos poses a serious risk to the GOP ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter @JillFilipovic.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhat happens when Rep.-elect George Santos of New York goes to Washington, DC, in January will be a real test of today’s Republican Party. Does honesty and integrity matter at all? Or is GOP leadership so power-hungry that it will allow a serial fabulist to remain in office despite deceiving the public – and the voters who elected him – about key aspects of his biography?\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic\n\nWhile running for office, Santos, who was elected in a district in New York that encompasses Long Island suburbs and parts of Queens, had either lied or been strangely cagey about everything from where he lived to which college he graduated from to where he worked to what his religious background was.\n\nThe New York Times published an investigation of Santos’s web of lies earlier this month, and got a very Trumpian attack-the-messenger denial from Santos’ lawyer who, instead of providing any clarity or specific factual denials, simply said that it is “no surprise that Congressman-elect Santos has enemies at The New York Times who are attempting to smear his good name with these defamatory allegations.”\n\nA CNN KFile report, building on the Forward’s reporting, further revealed how he had apparently misrepresented his Jewish roots, claiming his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees who changed their last name to survive. But genealogist Megan Smolenyak told the KFile that “”There’s no sign of Jewish and/or Ukrainian heritage and no indication of name changes along the way.” Santos’ lawyer declined to comment at the time of publication.\n\nNow, more than a week later, Santos has admitted that the media outlets were mostly right, and he did indeed fudge his resume and much of his biography. Except he’s still being less than forthcoming, claiming in a WABC interview that “a lot of people overstate in their resumes, or twist a little bit.”\n\nFor example, he claimed he worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, listing specific roles he held in these organizations. Now he says he simply liaised with both companies through his actual employment at the company Link Bridge, and that a simple “poor choice of words” gave a mistaken impression.\n\nThat poor choice of words? Santos’s campaign website said that he “began working at Citigroup as an associate and quickly advanced to become an associate asset manager in the real asset division of the firm” and “was then offered an exciting opportunity with Goldman Sachs but what he thought would be the pinnacle of his career was not as fulfilling as he had anticipated.”\n\nAs for claiming he attended Baruch College and New York University and received degrees in finance and economics, Santos told the New York Post that “I didn’t graduate from any institution of higher learning. I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume.” But he also seemed to shrug this lie off. “We do stupid things in life,” he said.\n\nSantos was similarly dismissive of reporting on his false claims of Jewish heritage. “I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos said to the Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish, I claimed to be Jew-ish” is indeed quite the dodge.\n\nSantos had also claimed that he lost four employees in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. That wasn’t true, either, although he now says it was four prospective employees; still, he didn’t provide any names or other details.\n\nSantos even seems to have lied about his charity work. He claims to have founded the group Friends of Pets United, an animal rescue organization that was not registered as a charity in New York or New Jersey. According to New York Times reporting, the IRS has no record of it. The purported beneficiary of one $50-a-head fundraiser for Friends of Pets United says that she never received the money raised, according to the Times as well. Now, Santos is less clear about his work, saying he helped out the charity and found homes for the animals.\n\nOne claim that Santos flat-out denied was a finding from the Times that he was charged with fraud in Brazil after writing stolen checks. According to the New York Times, “In the court file, Mr. Santos is identified by his full name and date of birth, as well as by the names of his mother and father. The documents show that Mr. Santos confessed to the crime and was charged, but that the case remains unresolved because authorities were later unable to locate him.”\n\n“I am not a criminal here — not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world,” Santos told the Post. “Absolutely not. That didn’t happen.”\n\nThe Santos saga is utterly fascinating, in the way stories of scammers and con men are often so captivating. What makes a person lie so often and so brazenly? What makes someone whose resume is largely false put themselves in the public eye and under a media microscope by running for office? How is it possible that when this person finally gets caught, they don’t slink away in shame, but rather lash out defiantly and simply refuse to face any consequences?\n\nThere is no doubt that Santos deceived voters in his district. The case he made for his candidacy was based, at least in part, on his experience and his resume. And he has proven himself wholly untrustworthy, which is particularly salient given many of the outstanding questions about his finances and net worth.\n\nSo why should the public trust anything further he says, given his egregious pattern of lying, dissembling and then downplaying his own lies? And how should the GOP respond?\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nRepublican Party leaders could certainly pressure Santos not to take office. They could publicly denounce him, and say that their party stands for honesty and will not stand for brazenly lying to constituents. That may end with their party losing the seat in a special election, but that’s hardly a foregone conclusion; and at some point, principles have to trump power. If he insists on taking office anyway, they could launch an ethics investigation and/or withhold committee assignments from him.\n\nIt’s a sad reflection of today’s GOP, though, that I assume that they won’t do any of this. And so far, party leaders have largely stayed silent. Nassau GOP Chair Joe Cairo, one of the few Republican leaders to speak out, said Santos would have to do a lot to regain trust, but added that Santos should be able to serve his term in Congress.\n\nBut let’s be clear – Santos is exactly who you don’t want in office. He is a man who seemingly has no problem lying for self-aggrandizement and personal gain; a man who, even when caught, demonstrates little remorse or accountability; a man who still insists that he should be vested with significant political power.\n\nNew Yorkers deserve better.

The House has the power under the Constitution to expel any member with a two-thirds vote, but doing so is extremely rare and only five lawmakers have been expelled in US history.\n\nBesides making a referral to the House Ethics Committee, other potential options for dealing with Santos include not giving him any committee assignments, which would be up to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Analysis: Why a decades-old federal law could be Santos' undoing 01:40 • Source: CNN Analysis: Why a decades-old federal law could be Santos' undoing 01:40\n\nIn the past, the California Republican has shown little appetite for punishing his own members for bad behavior – particularly when it comes to actions from before they were a member of Congress.

For the latest news on the winter storm, read USA TODAY's story for Wednesday, March 5.\n\nA massive winter storm marched across the central U.S. on Tuesday, unloading heavy winds, rain, and snow across much of the country, killing two people in Mississippi, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of customers, and forcing officials to reschedule Mardi Gras events in New Orleans.\n\nTwo people in Mississippi died due to the severe weather, Gov. Tate Reeves confirmed on the social media platform X. WAPT-TV reported that one person was killed when a power line fell in Madison County and that another person in the same county died after a tree fell on his car.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tornado watch Tuesday extended until 9 p.m. CT for parts of Mississippi and Louisiana, including New Orleans, where tens of thousands gathered outdoors for the yearly Mardi Gras celebration. Police had already announced shortened parade routes ahead of the harsh weather.\n\nThe weather service reported a possible tornado moving northeastward at 45 mph toward Pointe à la Hache, a community about 50 miles southeast of New Orleans. By 8 p.m. CT, the service said severe weather in the region was \"almost done\" as the line of storms steadily moved east off the Louisiana coast.\n\nThe service also confirmed a brief tornado in Irving, Texas, about 10 miles northwest of Dallas, and said the twister had peak wind speeds of 110 mph. No injuries or deaths were reported.\n\nTens of millions of people were under severe weather advisories because of the storm, from tornado, thunderstorm and fire-related warnings in the South to blizzard warnings across the northern Plains region.\n\nHurricane-force winds were reported in northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma through the morning, prompting red flag warnings across the drought-stricken region. The winds caused widespread power outages that affected over 360,000 homes and businesses in Texas alone.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters in Minnesota and Nebraska warned of heavy snowfall that could cause whiteout conditions and make travel \"treacherous and potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nThrough the midweek, the low-pressure system is expected to spread as far south as Florida and as far north as Pennsylvania and New Jersey, coming up just short of New York City, which may still be in for some thunderstorms, AccuWeather said. In all, the storm could impact up to 170 million people across more than 20 states.\n\nUprooted trees, damaged buildings, tangled power lines\n\nDamage was reported in multiple states as the expansive storm brought hurricane-force winds across the South.\n\nIn south-central Oklahoma, the city of Ada was ravaged by strong winds and a confirmed tornado. Images showed an uprooted tree smashed into a mobile home while mangled debris littered the streets. The city urged residents to stay home if possible, with \"downed power lines, gas leaks, and trees everywhere,\" according to a Facebook post.\n\nIn Lewisville, Texas, multiple local media outlets reported that a warehouse collapsed overnight. The city said wreckage-covered roads and winds knocked out traffic lights, snarling traffic. In the nearby city of Irving, the police department said on X that there was \"significant storm damage.\"\n\nIn Plano, just north of Dallas, winds ripped off a portion of a high school's roof while heavy rain flooded the school's sports facility, KHOU reported. The NWS office in Fort Worth, Texas, said dust storms the rest of Tuesday will reduce visibility to about 2 miles in some locations.\n\nThe El Paso, Texas, office of the NWS warned motorist against driving in such conditions Tuesday, when a \"plume of dust'' from New Mexico was headed its way. The previous day, a large, fast-moving dust storm known as a \"haboob'' drastically reduced visibility in parts of New Mexico and Texas.\n\nIn Ascension Parish, Louisiana, the local sheriff's office said about five houses received weather-related damage on Tuesday. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nThe parish is part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan area and about 60 miles northwest of New Orleans. Responders throughout the Baton Rouge area also reported fallen trees in several parishes.\n\nIn Rapides Parish, located in central Louisiana, residents and authorities reported damages to structures, homes. and roads. The Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office said it was aware of damages, but there were no reported injuries.\n\nStrong winds, dry conditions cause fires in Texas\n\nHigh winds and low humidity, as well as dry vegetation in Texas fueled wildfires across the state.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Texas A&M Forest Service said extreme fire weather conditions were expected to be widespread in the western and southern parts of Texas near the cities of Abilene, Austin, Del Rio, Fort Worth, Killeen, Laredo, San Angelo, San Antonio, Stephenville, and Weatherford.\n\n\"Any wildfire that ignites in dry vegetation could have forward rates of spread up to six miles per hour,\" the Texas A&M Forest Service warned.\n\nBy late Tuesday, fire crews responded to 13 active wildfires, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service's incident viewer.\n\nStorm blasts Plains, Midwest with whiteout conditions\n\nWhile the storm unleashed damaging winds in the South, it is also set to bring heavy snow and blizzard conditions to portions of the north-central U.S. into Wednesday.\n\nThe two main trouble spots for heavy snow are parts of Colorado and the upper Midwest. On Tuesday, the swath of heaviest snow will expand and shift from northeastern Colorado to South Dakota, Iowa, and central and western Minnesota, AccuWeather said.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect in six states, and some 6 million people could be impacted, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"Travel should be restricted to emergencies only,\" the NWS office in Iowa warned. \"If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.\"\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nHurricane-force winds threaten 'extreme fire behavior'\n\nThe storm's damaging winds come as parts of the eastern U.S. are seeing a breakout of wildfires and the South's drought conditions have turned the region into a tinderbox.\n\nIn the Carolinas, firefighters continued battling blazes that have prompted evacuations and clouded communities in heavy smoke. Just outside Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, first responders were working to contain a 2,000-acre fire that erupted over the weekend.\n\nIn North Carolina, fires were engulfing swaths of the state's national forests while evacuation orders remained in parts of Polk County, where a 600-acre fire burned in the Blue Ridge Mountains. With powerful winds on the horizon, fire officials across the East warned residents to refrain from burning anything outdoors.\n\nThe National Weather Service on Tuesday issued red flag warnings throughout central and southern Texas as the storm pushed across the state. The area did not receive much rain, and hurricane-force winds threatened to fuel any fires that ignited in the dry lands.\n\nPower outages abound amid cross-country storm\n\nIn Texas, the number of homes and businesses without power had dwindled from upward of 360,000 to about 210,000 as of 8 p.m. CT Tuesday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMore than 31,000 outages were reported in Louisiana while over 24,000 utility customers had no power in Mississippi and 39,000 in Alabama as the storm moved east, the outage tracker said.\n\n\"While we may not yet have a specific time for customers’ power to return, resources are working as quickly and safely as possible around the clock,\" Texas' largest power provider, Oncor, said in a statement.\n\nWind advisories stretch across the US\n\nWind warnings and advisories were in place Tuesday from New Mexico to Florida and up to Virginia as the massive storm barreled east across the central U.S.\n\n\"As these thunderstorms roar eastward, the biggest threat will be damaging wind gusts, especially in Arkansas, Louisiana and western Mississippi,\" said Tyler Roys, a senior meteorologist for AccuWeather, adding that the area could see \"widespread gusts of up to 80 mph\" and some possibly as high as 100 mph.\n\nA gust of 93 mph − just 3 mph below Category 2 hurricane strength − was registered near the small town of Hugoton in southwestern Kansas on Tuesday afternoon, KSN-TV reported.\n\nThe gusts are expected to continue grounding flights and knocking out power. Another main concern: the threat of wildfires in the South and spreading the blazes already burning in the Carolinas.\n\nTornado warnings and watches issued across Texas, Oklahoma\n\nThe National Weather Service issued tornado advisories for multiple southern Plains states Tuesday morning, including Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nThe weather service offices in the Oklahoma cities of Tulsa and Norman warned residents of severe storms \"capable of producing tornadoes\" moving across the southeastern part of the state. Dallas was among the cities in northeastern Texas under tornado watches.\n\nThe service’s office in Forth Worth, Texas, urged residents to prepare an emergency kit with essentials. The office also alerted of the “critical fire weather’’ in the Dallas area because of the high winds and low humidity Tuesday.\n\nTravel delays pile up at Texas airports\n\nMore than 280 flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were canceled Tuesday and over 500 were delayed, according to FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration said flights at the airport were being delayed by an average of two hours \"due to wind.\"\n\n“Strong storms this morning are leading to hazardous road conditions around the metro area,” the airport said in a statement on X. “Please allow extra time and be safe as storms move quickly over the area. Check your flight status for any schedule impacts this morning.”\n\nThe smaller Dallas Love Field airport reported over 60 cancellations and dozens of delays, according to FlightAware. In Houston, George Bush Intercontinental Airport saw 45-minute delays because of the storm, the FAA said.\n\nMardi Gras forced to reschedule events because of severe weather\n\nWith the storm threatening to bring powerful wind gusts, hail and possible tornadoes to New Orleans on Fat Tuesday, officials have had to reschedule events and cut some short.\n\nTwo of the city's largest parades were set for Tuesday morning, and while they still occurred, the New Orleans Police Department set a deadline of 11:30 a.m. for the festivities to end before the worst of the storm moves over the area. The parades will also have shortened routes.\n\nThe National Weather Service in New Orleans said the city is at an enhanced risk of severe weather, issuing a tornado watch and warning of \"damaging winds in excess of 60 mph.\"\n\nThe office reported damage from a possible tornado in Gramercy, about 45 miles west of New Orleans, and said around 5 p.m. local time, \"the next 2-3 hours will be the busiest.''\n\nMajor storm threatens nocturnal tornadoes\n\nThrough March 2, the U.S. had totaled 61 confirmed tornadoes this year, less than half the yearly average of 138 for that period. That figure is about to change, according to AccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva, who said the number of twisters is less relevant than where and when they strike.\n\nNocturnal tornadoes are particularly concerning because they may hit homes when people are sleeping and not ready to seek cover.\n\n“It really only takes one,’’ he said in an online forecast. “If you get one really powerful tornado to go through a very populated area, people are really going to remember that. We just want people to be vigilant.’’\n\nForecasters raise alarms about layoffs, budget cuts\n\nWeather experts across the nation say they fear the Trump administration's government cuts that resulted in hundreds of employees leaving the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including the weather service, may increase the threat during these severe weather events.\n\n“Recent terminations within the government workforce for science are likely to cause irreparable harm and have far-reaching consequences for public safety, economic well-being, and the United States’ global leadership,” the American Meteorological Society said Monday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his senior advisor Elon Musk have looked to the Department of Government Efficiency to enact Trump's signature campaign promise to reduce the size of the federal government.\n\nMost weather service field offices already are understaffed, said James Spann, chief meteorologist for WBMA-TV in Birmingham, Alabama. “If NWS products and services are reduced, we all suffer … especially during times of life-threatening weather,” Spann wrote in a social media post.\n\nNOAA has said it's committed to keeping Americans informed about dangerous weather. More than 1,000 protesters demonstrated against the layoffs Monday outside the agency's office in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn addition to the probationary employees who were dismissed, a wave of senior weather service meteorologists retired Friday, and others left as part of the agency’s “Fork in the Road” plan that will pay them administrative leave through September.\n\nContributing: Michael Tortorich, Gonzales Weekly Citizen; Melissa Gregory, Alexandria Town Talk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/958431/worlds-most-extreme-weather-events", "title": "The deadliest and most extreme weather events of 2022 | The Week", "text": "The past 12 months have seen stark warnings issued by climate scientists and health experts as communities across the world experienced deadly floods, soaring temperatures and intense snowfall.\n\nAt the UN’s annual climate conference, held this year in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in November, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned that the last eight years are set to be the eight hottest years on record.\n\n“The tell-tale signs and impacts of climate change are becoming more dramatic,” said the WMO at Cop27.

At the same time, flood recovery efforts continued in Australia and Pakistan, while catastrophic rainfall hit the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nTake a look back at the deadliest and most extreme weather events of 2022.\n\n1. Storms, southern Africa\n\nStorm Ana hit Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique in January (Image credit: Rijasolo/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn January, Storm Ana “wrought devastation across southern Africa”, said Climate Home News. More than 80 people were killed and thousands of people were “cut off” as roads and bridges were “washed away in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi”, said the BBC.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAna “highlighted the need for investment in early warning systems and anticipatory action” in African nations, said Climate Home News.\n\n2. Cyclone, Africa\n\nCyclone Batsirai displaced more than 60,000 people (Image credit: Rijasolo/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWithin weeks of Storm Ana, Cyclone Batsirai then “barrelled towards” Madagascar, said Reuters. The tropical storm also hit Mauritius, bringing life “to a standstill, with public transport cancelled, shops and banks shut, and air and sea travel halted”, said Africa News.\n\nIn Madagascar, the death toll reached 120 and 124,000 people had their homes damaged or destroyed. The island had already been “struggling with food shortages in the south”, said Al Jazeera, “a consequence of a severe and prolonged drought”.\n\n3. Floods, Pakistan\n\nA third of Pakistan was under water in September (Image credit: Shahid Saeed Mirza/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt was estimated that more than 33 million people were impacted by the deadly floods that swept across Pakistan from June to September this year. “Logistically the country was hardly prepared”, said The Diplomat. When the government announced a “national emergency” in August, “it was already too late”.\n\nA UN report published in December warned that 240,000 people remain displaced as a result of the flooding, while an estimated eight million are still potentially exposed to the floodwaters.\n\nThousands of kilometres of road were washed away. By September, a third of the country was underwater, with water-borne diseases “now making the situation even worse”, the site continued. It remains “hard to predict if Pakistan will be able to rebuild its lost infrastructure in this decade”.\n\n4. Lightning strikes, India\n\nLightning strikes Kolkata in May (Image credit: Indranil Aditya/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIndia experienced “a big jump in extreme weather events” this year, said the World Economic Forum (WEF). Almost 50 people in Uttar Pradesh were killed by lightning strikes during the monsoon season. The state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, called for an early warning system for thunder and lightning storms as a result.\n\nA significant number of people die each year in India due to lightning, said The Independent, “A large number of people work outdoors” and there is “poor awareness and education about the dangers” of strikes. According to government figures, lightning increased by 111 times this year and 907 people were killed by strikes in 2022.\n\n5. Heatwave, UK\n\nTemperatures in England hit new highs in 2022 (Image credit: Carlos Jasso/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“For three months, heat was a regular curse, not an occasional blessing” in the UK, said the Financial Times. A record-breaking temperature of 40.3 degrees was recorded on 28 July, and a series of fires broke out across the country.\n\nA drought was officially declared in parts of England in August, with a hosepipe ban imposed in some areas as reservoir levels sunk. Analysis by the UK Health Security Agency published in October, found that 2,800 more people aged 65 and over died during the periods of high temperatures than would normally be expected.\n\n6. Wildfires, Europe\n\nThe Bordeaux region suffered devastating wildfires (Image credit: Thibaud Moritz/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBy mid-August this year, wildfires had burned an area equivalent to the size of Azerbaijan, according to Euronews. Portugal, Italy and Romania were among the countries affected by blazes, and “wildfire carbon emissions broke all records in France and Spain”, said The Guardian.\n\n“Fire weather” – a mix of heat, dry conditions and wind – “is not new to the Mediterranean”, said Euractiv. But rising global temperatures are “creating more intense, less controllable fires, and driving these conditions” further across the continent.\n\n7. Heatwave, US\n\nCalifornia hit a record 116F in September (Image credit: Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nCalifornia experienced its most extreme heat ever in September, “an epic grilling that disabled one of Twitter’s main data centers, pushed the power grid to its limit and triggered a succession of weather and safety alerts”, said the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTemperatures “sizzled” across the state as mercury readings soared above 100F, said CNN. “Such extreme heat events are being pushed into unprecedented territory”, scientists warned.\n\n8. Typhoon, Japan\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol hit southern Japan in September (Image credit: Yuichi Yamazaki/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol was “one of the most powerful” storms that Japan had ever seen, said The Japan Times. Local authorities ordered the four million people living on Kyushu island to evacuate their homes in September.\n\nDespite “dumping heavy rain, paralysing traffic and leaving tens of thousands of homes without power”, said The Guardian, the Japan Meteorological Agency said that damage “appeared relatively limited”.\n\n9. Hurricane, US\n\nHurricane Ian caused havoc across Florida and the Carolinas (Image credit: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)\n\n“One of the strongest storms ever to hit the US mainland”, according to Reuters, made landfall on 28 September.\n\n“After pummeling Cuba”, said The Washington Post, Hurricane Ian “came ashore on the western coast of Florida with an unforgiving storm surge that gutted the first floors of buildings and winds that knocked out about a quarter of Florida’s power”. It then moved up the Atlantic coast, hitting North and South Carolina.\n\nMore than 100 people died in Florida as a result of the storm’s devastation, said The New York Times, more “than any hurricane in almost 90 years”.\n\n10. Typhoon, Philippines\n\nVillagers are rescued in Bulacan, Philippines (Image credit: Dante Diosina Jr/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nPhilippine residents are “accustomed to severe weather”, said CNN; the country experiences around 20 tropical storms a year. But locals living on the island of Polillo were “stunned by the intensity of Typhoon Noru” in September, with “ferocious winds that lifted waves and lashed properties on the shoreline”.\n\nNoru was initially expected to be a category one hurricane, but that was quickly escalated to a category five. It’s estimated that more than 100,000 people who rely on agriculture and fishing for their livelihoods were affected.\n\n11. Flooding, Australia\n\nSandbags are delivered in Forbes, NSW, in November (Image credit: Brendon Thorne/Getty Images)\n\nAustralia has been hit by a series of extreme floods this year “due to a multi-year La Nina weather phenomenon”, said Reuters, which increases the likelihood of higher average rainfall. Floods have “left thousands homeless and damaged agricultural industries”.\n\nCentral west New South Wales is right now braced for “its worst flooding in 70 years”, said The Guardian. Many people have been evacuated from their homes, as farmers “struggle to recover from repeated bouts of destruction to crops and livestock losses”.\n\n12. Snowstorm, US\n\nSeveral feet of snow fell on western New York in November (Image credit: John Normile/Getty Images)\n\nA “historic lake-effect snowstorm” that swept across western New York in November “buried” much of the region, “dropping over 80 inches of snow in four days”, said Fox Weather. At least four people were known to have died as a result of the intense snowfall.\n\nSchools and highways were shut as crews cleared away several feet of snow, and President Joe Biden ordered federal aid to help local authorities.\n\n13. Flooding, Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n‘Months’ of rain fell on the capital city of Kinshasa in December (Image credit: Augustin Wamenya/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nIn mid-December, “a ‘biblical’ downpour submerged swathes” of Kinshasa, central Africa’s “largest megacity”, said The Times. “Months of rain” caused landslides and floods in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital, with at least 120 people known to have died.\n\nPictures from the area showed “just the tops of buses visible on deluged roads” as people clung to passing debris. With a population of 17 million, Kinshasa’s “rapid development and poor planning regulation have made the city’s population vulnerable to extreme weather events”.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/20/flooding-oklahoma-southeast-tornadoes/83183851007/", "title": "Easter weekend severe weather: Deaths reported; tornado threat", "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY − Severe storms that brought damaging winds, heavy rain, large hail and tornadoes to parts of the southern and Midwest U.S. have been blamed for at least three deaths in Oklahoma.\n\nNumerous tornado alerts were issued by the National Weather Service across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Illinois, Missouri and Louisiana on April 20. AccuWeather said parts of parts of Missouri, Arkansas and Illinois were under high risk for severe thunderstorms.\n\n\"Flying debris will be dangerous to those caught without shelter. Mobile homes will be damaged or destroyed. Damage to roofs, windows and vehicles will occur. Tree damage is likely,\" the weather service warned.\n\nFierce, damaging winds, thunderstorms and hail were all possible through the night, according to the Storm Prediction Center. The rounds of severe thunderstorms were expected to continue across portions of Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas, and into the Ozark Mountains and mid-Mississippi Valley on April 20, the weather service said.\n\nBy late April 20, local television stations in Arkansas and Montana reported at least two tornadoes had touched down. The weather service also warned of severe thunderstorms capable of producing tornados in Illinois and said shortly after 9 p.m. local time that a tornado was located east of East Moline — a northwestern Illinois city known for being one of the Quad Cities. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms will continue into April 21 along and ahead of a front from the Great Lakes into the Tennessee Valley, Lower Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast, forecasters said. Excessive, flood-driving rains were expected. But the good news is the threat was expected to ease through the day.\n\nFive tornadoes confirmed in Oklahoma\n\nThe National Weather Service in Norman confirmed five tornadoes developed on April 19 across several cities in southern Oklahoma. The agency had issued issued tornado warnings across the state between the evening of April 19 and early April 20, including in Love, Hughes, Pontotoc and Marshall counties, where the confirmed tornadoes occurred.\n\nBruce Thoren, a meteorologist at the local weather service, said tornadoes were present in Ada and near Courtney, Oswalt, Lebanon and Spaulding. He added that additional areas are under investigation, such as an area in Carter County, three miles away from the city of Wilson.\n\n\"There are double-digit tornado tracks that we're going to look at,\" he said.\n\nA tornado that swept through Marshall County left two homes completely destroyed and damaged about 20, said Marshall County Emergency Management Director William Macon, who added that the department was conducting assessments on April 20. A church and a gas station at the intersection of U.S. 77 and State Highway 32 were also damaged.\n\nFlooding, deaths in Oklahoma\n\n\"This was a historical weather event that impacted roads & caused dozens of high-water incidents across the city,\" the police department in Moore, Oklahoma, posted on social media late on April 19. Moore is a city of more than 60,000 people 10 miles south of Oklahoma City.\n\nPolice said numerous roads and neighborhoods were flooded, and officers assisted more than a dozen motorists whose vehicles were trapped in high water. One vehicle left the roadway and was swept under the bridge. Police estimated that flooding caused waters to rise to around 6-8 inches where the fatalities occurred.\n\nClint Byley, a spokesperson for the Moore Police Department, said responders at the scene learned that a total of five people had been inside two vehicles that got caught at about 9 p.m. on April 19. Three were immediately rescued and two bodies were later recovered, he said.\n\nAnother death was reported in Hughes County, about 75 miles east of Norman. Hughes County Emergency Management reported that at about 10:35 p.m. local time, a tornado touched down in the small town of Spaulding.\n\nOne person was killed and two others were injured, according to the agency. Two homes were also destroyed and several other small structures in the area were damaged.\n\nThe Hughes County Emergency Management said crews with the weather service were on site on April 20 to assess the tornado damage.\n\nWoman, 12-year-old boy are victims\n\n\"It is with great sadness that we report that two individuals, an adult female and a 12-year-old male, were later located deceased,\" police said on X. \"We would like to extend a thank you to our neighboring agencies who assisted in rescue efforts. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family & friends of the victims.\"\n\nByley said police opened an investigation into the exact cause of the incident, which involved a truck and a jeep that had became submerged under a bridge.\n\n\"We had a significant high-water situation,\" he said. \"We are trying to investigate that to figure out what direction the vehicle was traveling, how it got stuck underneath the bridge... There's a lot of moving parts to it, so that'll be all part of the investigation.\"\n\nRoads closed, powerlines down across Oklahoma\n\nTwo people near Ada, about 85 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, were injured and sent to the hospital and several homes and businesses were damaged on the night of April 19, according to the state Department of Emergency Services in a storm update issued on April 20. A preliminary survey by the Weather Service office found \"at least EF1 damage.\"\n\nThe state transportation department also reported multiple road closures because of storm damage, including in Atoka, Bryan, Carter, Cherokee, Jefferson, Johnston, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Okfuskee, Okmulgee and Washington counties.\n\nPowerlines, properties and trees in Hughes, Love, Marshall, Murray and Pontotoc counties were damaged, the emergency agency said.\n\nDamages reported in north central Texas\n\nAt least two tornadoes crossed west Parker County, Texas, late April 19, according to the county’s emergency services. Parker County is located just west of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.\n\nEmergency crews were dispatched to several residences to provide assistance and perform damage assessments in areas near the communities of Peaster, Poolville and Authon, Parker County Emergency Services said in a statement.\n\nPhotos shared on social media showed damaged homes with torn off roofs, including one house that had a smashed roof in a driveway. The severe weather also caused several areas in west Parker County to lose power, according to the county’s emergency services.\n\nAccuWeather warned that the threat of severe weather will reach its peak from northeastern Texas through the Missouri Valley through the night of April 20. Some risks include damaging wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes.\n\nMeanwhile, isolated flash flooding was possible for areas in the middle and upper Texas coastal plain through April 20 due to lingering thunderstorms, according to the Storm Prediction Center.

For the latest updates on the snow, follow USA TODAY's coverage for Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLAFAYETTE, La. − A wide swath of the South was targeted by a major winter storm Tuesday as brutally cold temperatures gripped much of the nation, breaking snowfall records more than a century old in a southern region where flurries are unusual.\n\nStacey Denson, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, told USA TODAY that a blizzard warning was a first for Louisiana. A blizzard warning means the expectation that snow and frequent wind gusts of up to 35 mph could reduce visibility to 1/4 mile or less.\n\n\"It was pretty crazy to see,\" Denson said. \"It is actually improving a bit, but we had whiteout conditions.\"\n\nThe blizzard warning expired for all of Louisiana as of noon CDT, but a winter storm warning remained in effect until Wednesday. More than 30 million people were under a snowstorm warning until Wednesday morning, from southern Texas through Georgia and into Virginia. Authorities in Houston investigated two deaths that may be weather-related, including that of a homeless man who was found near an apartment complex, the Harris County Sheriff said on X.\n\nIn Lafayette, 70 miles east of Lake Charles, Louisiana, Mayor-President Monique Blanco Boulet said residents should plan to stay home for the next few days, and that the approaching storm represents a weather event unlike anything the city has ever experienced.\n\n\"We are prepared for hurricanes, we have all the equipment we need, we know what we need,\" Boulet said. \"This is going to be different. We don't necessarily have snow equipment to deal with what we have coming.\"\n\nThe storm was on a track to sweep through Texas and Louisiana, across the Gulf Coast, and deep into Florida, with significant snow and ice in tow. Some areas slammed by the storm haven't seen frozen storms in decades.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, parts of the 1-10 corridor in Louisiana had received 10 inches of snow, while areas of southeastern Texas reported up to 6 inches, and some locations in Mississippi and Alabama were at 4-plus inches, according to AccuWeather.\n\nDenson said snow is rare in Louisiana and even more unusual to have the unrelenting cold required to keep it from quickly melting. The cold front was not expected to release its grip until Thursday, meaning hazardous road conditions won't be gone soon. The weather service message to residents was simple: \"Do not travel. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you.\"\n\n\"We don't really have any snowplows,\" Denson said. \"Our neighboring state (Arkansas) sent plows down to help us out.\"\n\nElsewhere, temperatures in many areas from the interior West through the Midwest and up and down the East Coast were 20 degrees below normal, even for the dead of winter. And in Southern California, another round of Santa Ana winds racing through the smoldering fires of greater Los Angeles − combined with dry conditions − drew new concerns.\n\nWind chills 55 below: Snow and ice in Florida? Extreme cold invading US\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Richard Bann, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said that the service was confirming whether Tuesday's snowfall broke a New Orleans record set in 1895 when 8 inches fell.\n\n∎ Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey proclaimed a state of emergency for 39 counties and ordered the National Guard to prepare for activation. The weather service office in Mobile posted a video of heavy snow with about an inch already covering the ground and vehicles.\n\n∎ All roads and bridges in Montgomery County should be considered impassable until further notice due to snowy conditions, the Montgomery County engineering department has determined. Only emergency vehicles should travel on county roads and bridges until further notice.\n\n∎ The Port of Houston said all its facilities will be closed through Wednesday because of the harsh winter weather.\n\n∎ In Georgia, Savannah and its surrounding area are under a winter storm warning issued by the National Weather Service beginning Tuesday at 5 p.m. and lasting until noon Wednesday. The forecast calls for \"heavy mixed precipitation.\"\n\nWinter storm across Gulf Coast draws superlatives\n\nWeather experts are using terms like \"historic snowfall'' and \"the most significant winter storm'' to describe the cold front coursing through the Gulf Coast.\n\nSo this is far from your garden-variety system.

For starters, New Orleans, which had not received measurable snow since 2009, is expecting 8 inches, near its record total set in 1895.\n\n\"It almost looks like a hurricane … only with snow as the precip type!\" meteorologist A.J. Mastrangelo said on social media as the city got blanketed Tuesday morning.\n\nOther examples: The Houston area is expecting its largest winter storm in more than 60 years, and Jacksonville, Florida, which hasn't had measurable snow in 35 years, is forecast to get freezing rain overnight. So yes, very rare.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nNew Orleans resident: 'Sit and watch, 'cause it's really beautiful'\n\nNew Orleans resident Claire Spenard has had her fair share of snow days from her time growing up in Rochester, New York. At first, she thought the weather predictions of a frozen landscape in the South were a hoax. Now watching schools and major highways close, she regrets failing to buy a shovel before the storm hit.\n\n“It reminds me of being home, and I never thought I would say that,” Spenard told USA TODAY.\n\nThe 23-year-old ballet teacher and server described a ghost town of a city sprinkled with excited children seeing snow for the first time, making snowmen, and walking in the middle of roads untouched by cars.\n\nHer advice for those not used to braving the cold? Yield to the occasional vehicle and soak up the wonder.\n\n\"Sit and watch, 'cause it’s really beautiful,\" Spenard said. \"And I think that’s what a lot of people here are doing, they’re taking time to really sit and enjoy it, 'cause that’s what people in New Orleans do about most things.”\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nRecord-breaking snow in Mobile and Pensacola\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Mobile, Alabama, reported on snowfall records about its city and Pensacola, Florida, about 60 miles to the southeast.\n\nBy late afternoon Tuesday, a new mark of 6.2 inches of snow had been registered at Mobile's regional airport, according to the office, breaking a 144-year-old record. The office reposted several photos of Alabamians reporting 7-plus inches at their locations.\n\nPensacola, better known for its white-sand beaches, was covered in a different source of white Tuesday as it set a record with 5 inches of snow while more was still coming down, breaking the 3-inch clip set in 1895. As it was still snowing, a full total for the day wasn't expected until later in the evening. said meteorologist Jason Beaman.\n\nScattered reports of 6.5 to 7.5 inches had been received nearby, Beaman said.\n\n\"FLORIDA WHITEOUT'' blared the homepage of the Pensacola News Journal's website, saying the 5 1/2 inches of snow registered almost certainly beat a previous mark that had stood for 130 years.\n\n- Jim Little, Pensacola News Journal\n\nWinter sledding Florida style on tap in state capital\n\nFloridians commonly keep pool floats, boogie boards and kayaks in storage during the winter months. On Wednesday, folks in north Florida may be bringing the novelties out and converting them into makeshift sleds, Florida style.\n\nLeon County Schools canceled Wednesday's classes because of the incoming storm, meaning kids in Tallahassee will be out on a rare snow day.\n\nTallahassee is a hilly city, so residents looking to sled the day away have plenty of options. One likely location: Florida A&M University, since its website says the campus \"sits on the highest of seven hills in Florida's capital city.\"\n\n− Alaijah Brown, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nRare snow in Louisiana is a thrill for this family\n\nFor 21-year-old meteorology student Gabriel Hebert, a once-in-a-lifetime winter storm in his hometown of Lafayette, Louisiana, isn't just a snow day but a great learning opportunity.\n\n\"I'm so thrilled,\" he told USA TODAY. \"This is my favorite kind of weather.\"\n\nHebert had been monitoring the storm for a few days, staying up late to track snowfall. In preparation, his family left open their cabinets to prevent pipes from freezing, have all agreed to stay off the roads and stocked up on essential food for the days ahead.\n\nAs the snow fell and his family bunkered down, his young siblings relished the first. \"I just want to enjoy this time with my family, watching them make snow angels and snowmen,\" Hebert said.\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nFlights canceled as airlines struggle with storm\n\nThe winter storm was upending travel plans across the Southeast. Winter storm warnings were in effect from Texas through the Carolinas, according to the National Weather Service. As of 8 p.m. ET, more than 2,200 U.S. flights had been canceled, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. That includes 22% of United Airlines flights and 12% of Southwest Airlines flights, the bulk of which were canceled Monday ahead of the storm's impact.\n\nMore than 90% of flights out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P.

The total snow and sleet forecast for the area that includes San Antonio, 80 miles to the south, ranged from a dusting up to 1 1/2 inches − with hazardous ice accumulations of one-tenth of an inch. The forecast was enough for all Central Texas school districts − including the Austin district − the University of Texas and Texas State University to shut down Tuesday.\n\nOutside of his home in Austin's Travis Heights neighborhood, Gail Armstrong prepared for the cold by replacing the propane in the trailer in front of his house. Armstrong said he's concerned about road conditions.\n\n“People don’t know diddly about driving on snow and ice,” Armstrong said.\n\n− Keri Heath and Ella McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman\n\nSingle-digit temperatures coming to Mississippi\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for Central and South Mississippi through Wednesday. Gov. Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm. Schools, businesses and city governments announced closures ahead of the snowfall.\n\n\"South Mississippi is still expected to get the highest amounts with up to 4 inches of snow,\" the state Emergency Management Agency reported. \"We encourage everyone to stay off the roads once the snow starts to fall as roads will become dangerous.\"\n\nThe entire state will see temperatures plunge. Oxford is forecast to have a low of 8 degrees Wednesday morning while Jackson should see a low of 13 degrees, forecasters said. On the Mississippi coast, temperatures in Biloxi are expected to drop to 17 degrees.

Snow accumulations could create \"crippling\" travel conditions along the Interstate 10 and Interstate 12 corridors, Gov. Jeff Landry and other state officials warned. Landry declared a weather emergency and ordered state offices closed Tuesday.\n\nNorthern Louisiana cities from Shreveport to Ruston to Monroe will likely be spared snow and ice, but every corner of the state will encounter frigid temperatures that could impact water supplies and create power outages, forecasters said.\n\n\"Most people in (southern Louisiana) haven't experienced this combination of snow and bitter cold in our lifetimes,\" state climatologist Jay Grymes said.

Schools in other states were already struggling because of an earlier storm that hit much of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states over the weekend. Scores of school districts in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia delayed their openings.\n\nIn the Midwest, many districts were closed because of the intense cold. In Wisconsin, residents of Green Bay awoke to a temperature of minus 12 degrees. The wind chill was minus 31. That was a bit too much, even for Green Bay.\n\n\"The Green Bay Area Public School District will be closed on January 21, 2025, due to severe weather,\" the district posted on its website. \"There will be no after-school or evening activities.\"\n\nSouthern cities face rare wintry slam\n\nMajor Southern cities facing a wintry hit include Austin, San Antonio and Houston in Texas; New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Louisiana; Jackson and Biloxi in Mississippi; Mobile in Alabama; Savannah in Georgia; and Pensacola, Tallahassee and Jacksonville in Florida, AccuWeather warned.\n\nNew Orleans hasn't seen measurable snowfall in 16 years. It has been 35 years for Jacksonville. Scores of school districts in Texas canceled classes for Tuesday and may not reopen Wednesday.\n\nIn California, San Diego County now battling fires\n\nPowerful Santa Ana winds fueled the spread of wildfires in San Diego County early Tuesday, prompting evacuations as officials in Los Angeles remained on high alert amid high winds and relentless dry conditions.\n\nAt least three fires broke out in northern San Diego County overnight, including the Lilac and Pala fires, which grew to 80 and 17 acres, respectively, before firefighters stopped their spread. Another brush fire, dubbed the Riverview Fire, burned about one acre of land before firefighters halted its forward progress, according to Cal Fire, the state's firefighting agency.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid\n\n(Image credit: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)\n\nIn the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\n2. Storm Christoph, UK\n\n(Image credit: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)\n\nThe period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n3. Cyclone Ana, Fiji\n\n(Image credit: Leon Lord/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\n4. Winter storms, Texas\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\n5. Dust storm, China\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nFlights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\n6. Flooding, New South Wales\n\n(Image credit: Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\n7. Cyclone Seroja\n\n(Image credit: Alfred Ike Wurin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\n8. Record temperatures, Moscow\n\n(Image credit: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\n9. Heat dome, Pacific Northwest\n\n(Image credit: Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSoaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.\n\nBlistering Pacific Northwest temperatures should act as a wake-up call\n\n10. Bootleg fire, Oregon\n\n(Image credit: Payton Bruni/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA “heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season” saw “one of the largest blazes in Oregon’s history” consume more than 364,000 acres of land, the BBC reported in July. More than 2,000 firefighters tackled the wildfire, which took more than a month to contain. The fire “generated its own weather system”, noted Oregon Live, and thousands of homes were threatened by the blaze, which saw residents temporarily housed in evacuation centres in the state.\n\n11. Flooding, west Germany\n\n(Image credit: Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFloods destroyed homes and bridges along the River Ahr in July, while in the German village of Schuld, water “engulfed streets and swallowed homes” CNN reported. Victims will be supported by a government-approved €400 million recovery package, as ministers have promised to move quickly on rebuilding affected areas, Euronews reported. A study by World Weather Attribution found that this event was between 1.2 and nine times more likely to happen in 2021 compared to pre-industrial periods.\n\n12. Flooding, China\n\n(Image credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 300 people died when China’s Henan province experienced severe rainfall and flooding in July. Twelve people lost their lives in a Zhengzhou metro train, with survivors describing how water leaked through the carriage’s doors until it became difficult to breathe. While the country typically experiences flooding in the summer months, this year’s occurrence was “exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, conversion of farmland and the worsening climate crisis, as well as overwhelmed flood mitigation systems,” The Guardian reported.\n\n13. Wildfires, Greece\n\n(Image credit: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHuge wildfires “ravaged” large regions of southern Europe in August, claiming lives in Greece, Turkey and Italy, The Guardian reported. The blaze came as a heatwave swept the region, and Greece’s second largest island - Evia - was evacuated. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised for the blazes, and said that more than 580 fires have broken out in the past seven days. More than 20 countries offered to send firefighting resources, and the “camaraderie” that’s developed between Greek and British firefighters “is testament to the scale of the job before them”, Sky News reports.\n\n14. Hurricane Ida, US\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMore than one million homes and businesses were left without power in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Ida made landfall on 29 August, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Ida hit with maximum sustained winds of 150mph. It was later downgraded to a tropical depression, and moved from a category four storm to category one. “Katrina followed a similar trajectory”, Sky News said. In the following days, Storm Ida moved up the northern-eastern coast of America. Subway stations and roads were flooded in New York, where the lives of at least nine people - including that of a two-year-old boy - were claimed by the storm. For communities in New Orleans, Ida has brought “painful reminders of the death and devastation” caused by the 2006 hurricane which killed more than 1,800 people, The New York Times reported.\n\n15. Monsoon floods, India and Nepal\n\n(Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeveral Nepalese regions and two Indian states were hit by “heavy late monsoon rains” in October, Reuters reported. “Deadly flash floods” took the lives of more than 180 people as “homes were submerged or crushed by rocks”, said the BBC. The Nepalese government committed to giving each of the victims’ families $1,700 (£1,220) in response.\n\nThe unseasonal rainfall was attributed to the climate crisis, but some experts indicated that hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and “excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes”, had contributed to the damage caused to the region’s “fragile ecology”, said the broadcaster.\n\n16. Tornadoes, Kentucky\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden said that Kentucky had experienced “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. More than 30 tornadoes “tore through” Kentucky and seven other states, claiming the lives of at least 90 people, and leaving thousands of residents homeless, said Sky News.\n\nThe state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said that this was “the most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history”.\n\nTwo brothers, aged 15 months and three months old, were placed in a bathtub before being carried away by the severe winds. Their grandmother, Clara Lutz, later learned that both boys had been found alive in her garden under the upturned bath.\n\nBiden’s infrastructure bill has allocated billions of dollars to climate resilience projects, in the hope of strengthening infrastructure and defence against future extreme weather events.\n\n17. Typhoons, Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross described “complete carnage” in coastal areas of the country after Super Typhoon Rai “sent some 400,000 people running for safety” on 16 December, said the BBC. Thousands of military and service personnel were working to assist with search and rescue efforts in the worst-hit areas.\n\nWinds of around 120mph ripped through the nation’s south-eastern islands, injuring at least 500 people. A further 375 people are known to have died. “There are some areas that look like it has been bombed worse than World War Two,” Red Cross chair Richard Gordon told the BBC.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/22/winter-storm-snow-forecast-impact-wednesday-updates/77853015007/", "title": "Rare winter storm turns deadly in the South as dig-out underway", "text": "Editor's note: This file captures the news of the snowstorm across the South from Wednesday, Jan. 22.

About 20 million people across the region were under winter weather advisories and warnings, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Florida capital of Tallahassee, which usually gets temperatures in the 60s at this time of year, is expecting an overnight low of 20 degrees. Sleet and snow-topped 2 inches in at least one location in Tallahassee, according to preliminary snowfall estimates from the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.\n\n“This has been the worst winter storm to hit the Gulf Coast in decades,\" AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said.\n\nThe dig-out, so common in the nation's northern tier, was underway in earnest from Texas to Florida while challenged by a dearth of snow plows. Residents were urged not to travel on the iced-over roadways, and temperatures were expected to linger around freezing into Thursday.\n\nThe storm began its march Tuesday in Texas, blanketing highways and snarling traffic before making its way east. Neighboring Louisiana saw it first-ever blizzard warning. New Orleans International Airport recorded 8 inches of snow, triple the previous record set more than 60 years ago, the National Weather Service reported. Records fell in Alabama, and parts of Mississippi were hit with almost a foot of snow.\n\nIn Florida, the Pensacola area broke the state's 130-year-old record for total snowfall. The National Weather Service reported 8.9 inches in Pensacola and 9.8 inches in Milton, both breaking the previous Florida record of 4 inches set in 1954.\n\n\"We plead with our with our residents to continue to stay off the road,\" Pensacola Mayor D.C. Reeves said. \"They not only put themselves at risk, but they put our first responders at risk − and our ability to respond at risk.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Interstate 10 was closed Wednesday evening in both directions for about 200 miles from the Alabama-Florida state line to near Tallahassee because of the icy conditions on the road and expected freezing temperatures overnight.\n\n∎ The 10 inches of snowfall in New Orleans on Tuesday shattered the previous official record of 2.7 inches in December 1963, although unofficially the February 1895 storm also dumped 10 inches at the city's Audubon Park. The last time New Orleans received any measurable snowfall was 2009, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n∎ In Alabama, 7.5 inches fell in Mobile, where such accumulations have not been seen in more than 60 years, according to the weather service.\n\nBeyonsleigh, Taylor Drift and more: The amazing names plows adopt while pushing snow\n\nJacksonville Airport records first measurable snow since 1989\n\nIn its Record Event Report on Wednesday night, the National Weather Service confirmed that one-tenth of an inch of frozen precipitation, mostly in the form of sleet, fell at the Jacksonville International Airport just after 5 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWhile Northeast Florida experienced far less snow than the Florida Panhandle or Southeast Georgia — the Panhandle town of Milton recorded nearly 10 inches on Tuesday and Wednesday — the First Coast's snowstorm ranks among Jacksonville's top five snowfalls in National Weather Service archives dating to 1871.\n\nJacksonville's last measurable snow before Wednesday occurred on Dec. 23, 1989, when 0.8 inches fell. The city's record snowfall came on Feb. 13, 1899, when a winter storm dumped snow to the depth of 1.9 inches on Northeast Florida.\n\nThe National Weather Service also issued a Record Event Report for Alma, Georgia, which recorded its highest-ever single-day snowfall of 5 inches.\n\n— Clayton Freeman, Jacksonville Florida Times-Union\n\nAt least 12 deaths attributed to the storm\n\nAt least 12 people have died, seven of them in Texas. Near La Pryor, 100 miles west of San Antonio, five people were killed Tuesday in a crash in icy conditions. Two people also have died from cold exposure in Austin, officials said.\n\nIn Alabama, the Dale County Coroner's office confirmed two deaths likely related to the weather − one in a car crash, the other in a house fire. And in Georgia, Emergency Management Agency/Homeland Security Director Chris Stallings said a \"critical needs\" patient went outside and died of hypothermia.\n\nA 19-year-old was killed Wednesday afternoon when his vehicle overturned into the icy waters of Cross Creek in North Carolina, according to the Fayetteville Police Department. Police spokesperson Rickelle Harrell said the weather conditions contributed to the crash and speed was not a factor.\n\nSnow in Florida's capital city a 'once-in-a-lifetime experience'\n\nThe storm brought a rare snow day to Tallahassee, shutting down practically the entire city and giving people a chance to throw snowballs or sleighs down a hill — some for the first time.\n\nLocal schools, universities, and state, local government agencies and Tallahassee International Airport had already planned to close for the day. But the sleet and snowstorm rendered Tallahassee an utter ghost town. Nearly every business in town closed, at least for the first part of the day, before a beaming sun began to melt some of the ice.\n\nOutside, the usual traffic noise of honking horns and screeching tires was replaced by the sound of laughter as kids and the young-hearted alike played outside. The Flom sisters, Pandora, 18, and Kalliope, 15, rigged cardboard boxes with exercise bands to race down a frozen hill at Lafayette Park in Midtown.\n\n\"It’s hard to comprehend that this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” the older sister said as she wiped ice from her smile.\n\n— Jeff Burlew, Douglas Soule, Ana Goñi-Lessan, and Elena Barrera, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nSnow collapses old Civic Center in Mobile, Alabama\n\nThe roof of the Civic Center in Mobile, Alabama, a building that was in the process of being demolished, collapsed under the weight of the snow Wednesday morning, the city said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"The collapse occurred in a manner consistent with the plans for the building’s ongoing demolition,'' the city said. \"Fortunately, there were no injuries, and the mosaic murals were undamaged.''\n\nThe port city received 7 1/2 inches of snow Tuesday as part of the massive storm hitting the Gulf Coast states. WKRG-TV showed drone footage of the collapsed roof in a building whose demolition started in September.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nTallahassee sees a winter Waffle House indicator\n\nIn Florida, Tallahassee police have advised residents to stay off icy roads. But a handful of brave patrons made their way to one local Waffle House on Wednesday morning – bundled up, clutching fresh cups of coffee to warm their hands for the walk back home. The full menu wasn't available, but Tallahassee's Waffle Houses were serving the \"Emergency Bowl Menu.\"\n\nCustomers could enjoy a bacon, egg and cheese bowl with their hash browns. Best known for being an indicator of how severe a hurricane threat is, the Waffle House easily withstood the Florida winter storm threat in Tallahassee.\n\nWaffle House said the limited menu is designed to accommodate lower staffing levels and to serve guests quickly. The chain's website shows eight 24-hour locations in and around the city.\n\n− Kyla A. Sanford, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nFor Houston resident, snow makes her feel 'like a kid inside'\n\nNot since elementary school had retired truck driver Thelma Foster seen the snow fall the way it did Monday night in Houston.\n\n\"I just started feeling all warm like a kid inside,\" Foster, 55, told USA TODAY.\n\nFoster was prepared for any possible power outages with portable generators and camping heaters from her planning for Hurricane Beryl last year. She's staying off the roads and has spent the last few days enjoying the powdery snow from her apartment window with coffee in hand, wrapped in a blanket. This, she said, is the best way to take in the frigid weather.\n\n\"I've been taking in every moment,\" Foster said. \"I've really enjoyed it.\"\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nStorm will be costly to businesses\n\nAccuWeather issued a preliminary estimate of $14-$17 billion across the South for total damage and economic loss from the snow, ice and extreme cold. Porter noted that businesses have been forced to shut down, in some cases for days, and supply chain and shipping logistics have been severely disrupted.\n\n\"With the cold remaining in place, the impacts and interruptions from this winter storm will be felt for days to come,\" Porter said.\n\nConcern for the homeless in Pensacola\n\nIn Pensacola, transit bus drivers provided free transportation to area cold weather shelters that made room for record numbers of people. Waterfront Mission staff moved all the furniture out of its lobby to make room for emergency cots and pallets.\n\nPensacola police have been reaching out to people who stay in camps or on the streets asking whether they need help or a ride to a shelter. For those who refuse, police offer them donated blankets and sleeping bags.\n\n“We have officers out there patrolling, and if they're contacted by anyone that wants assistance, we're going to transport them to any shelter that's available that's open,” officer Gregory Gordon said. “We're going to get them off streets.”\n\nStunning snowfall totals sweep across South\n\nBabbie, Alabama, 100 miles northeast of Pensacola, claimed the region's highest snow total with 11.5 inches reported, according to the National Weather service snowfall report. Lafayette, Louisiana, checked in at 10.5 inches.\n\nMilton led the way in Florida, but several locations reported 9 inches − as did Cordele, Georgia, 160 miles south of Atlanta. In Texas, La Porte outside Houston recorded 6 inches, and in Mississippi, Evanston reported 5 1/2 inches.\n\nStill, a more likely community topped the weather service list: 48 inches fell in Rodman, N.Y.\n\nStorm brings havoc to air travel\n\nAir travelers are continuing to feel the effects of a rare winter storm that swept across the Southeast on Tuesday and Wednesday. More than 1,800 U.S. flights were canceled and another 3,100 others were delayed as of 4:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nThose cancellations include hundreds of flights to and from George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby airports in Houston, which both planned to resume operations later Wednesday after temporarily suspending them for the storm. Cities such as New Orleans, Charleston, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida, were also seeing major cancellations. Read more here.\n\n− Zach Wichter and Eve Chen\n\nWhat are your rights? What happens if your flight is delayed or canceled?\n\nGenerational storm slams Gulf Coast – and 'there are no plows'\n\nThe snowstorm currently lashing the Gulf Coast – which included the first-ever blizzard warning in Louisiana – is being described as a once-in-a-generation weather event, the National Weather Service said Monday. How rare is snow for some of these Southern cities?\n\n\"This will be the most significant winter storm the Greater Houston area has experienced since at least 1960,\" the weather service in Houston said.\n\nElsewhere, New Orleans hasn't seen measurable snowfall since 2009. And it has been 35 years for Jacksonville.\n\n\"This will be an historic snowfall for the Gulf Coast,\" noted meteorologist Paul Douglas on X, who added that in many parts of that region, \"there are no plows – they will pretty much wait for the snow to melt (which happens later this week).\" Read more here.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nHow rare is this Southern snowstorm? Texas, Louisiana, Florida blanketed by snow\n\nRare snow in Louisiana is a thrill for this family\n\nFor 21-year-old meteorology student Gabriel Hebert, a once-in-a-lifetime winter storm in his hometown of Lafayette, Louisiana, isn't just a snow day, but a great learning opportunity.\n\n\"I'm so thrilled,\" he told USA TODAY. \"This is my favorite kind of weather.\"\n\nHebert had been monitoring the storm for a few days, staying up late to track snowfall. In preparation, his family left open their cabinets to prevent pipes from freezing, have all agreed to stay off the roads and stocked up on essential food for the days ahead.\n\n\"We don't know how to prepare for anything like this,\" Hebert said. As the snow fell and his family bunkered down, his young siblings relished the first. \"I just want to enjoy this time with my family, watching them make snow angels and snowmen,\" he said.\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nIn New Orleans, 'taking time to really sit and enjoy it'\n\nNew Orleans resident Claire Spenard has had her fair share of snow days from her time growing up in Rochester, New York. At first, she thought the weather predictions of a frozen landscape in the South were a hoax. Now watching schools and major highways close, she regrets failing to buy a shovel before the storm hit.\n\n“It reminds me of being home, and I never thought I would say that,” Spenard told USA TODAY.\n\nThe 23-year-old ballet teacher and server described a ghost town of a city sprinkled with excited children seeing snow for the first time, making snowmen and walking in the middle of roads untouched by cars.\n\nHer advice for those not used to braving the cold? Yield to the occasional vehicle and soak up the wonder.\n\n“Sit and watch, 'cause it’s really beautiful,'' Spenard said. \"And I think that’s what a lot of people here are doing, they’re taking time to really sit and enjoy it, 'cause that’s what people in New Orleans do about most things.”\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nContributing: Troy Moon, Edward Bunch III, and Tom McLaughlin, Pensacola News Journal; Jeff Burlew, William L.

The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned of rock and mudslides.\n\nBy Friday, the massive storm will stretch across nearly the entire central U.S., from the Gulf Coast to the Canadian border, threatening everything from whiteout conditions to damaging winds, unusually warm temperatures, wildfires, dust storms and tornadoes.\n\nAccuWeather senior meteorologist Tom Kines told USA TODAY the storm could be among the strongest on record in terms of low pressure.\n\n\"This is going to be a very significant, very strong storm,\" he said, adding that the barrage of extreme weather will likely lead to power outages and travel delays on roads and at airports.\n\nThe forecast comes days after an expansive storm similarly trekked across the U.S. last week, unloading snow in the northern Plains and bringing tornadoes and wildfires to the South. At least five storm-related deaths in Nebraska and Mississippi were tied to that storm.\n\nWestern US braces for deluge, snowstorms\n\nThe National Weather Service says the storm will arrive on the West Coast early Wednesday and bring heavy rain to coastal California.\n\nSouthern California is at risk of flash flooding and debris flow, the weather service said, especially in areas impacted by the outbreak of wildfires in January. San Francisco could also see heavy rain on Wednesday.\n\nAs the storm heads east, it is expected to blanket the Sierra Nevada mountains in 2 to 4 feet of snow and produce widespread wind gusts of 40 to 70 mph, Kines said.\n\nFrom Thursday into Friday, snow will bury parts of the Rockies and stretch into Nevada, Utah and Arizona, which has seen less snow this winter than usual. From Friday into the weekend, much of the Plains region will be at risk of heavy snow and possible blizzard conditions as the low-pressure system strengthens, the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nWhile these conditions could lead to travel delays and treacherous road conditions, they will also bring much needed moisture to the region. \"More storms with generous rain and mountain snow are needed prior to the beginning of the dry season, less than a couple of months away,\" said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski in an online forecast.\n\nAlmost 500K square miles at risk of severe thunderstorms\n\nBy Friday, severe weather advisories will abound across the country as nearly half a million square miles from Texas to the Dakotas will be at risk of \"severe thunderstorms,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\nKines said there are concerns this storm could cause a \"tornado outbreak,\" spinning up dozens of twisters from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest.\n\nOne of main severe weather conditions will be widespread, damaging winds of 65 to 75 mph, with gusts possibly reaching 100 mph. Such high winds risk mass power outages, grounding flights, uprooting trees and spreading wildfires, especially in the drought-stricken Plains and southwest regions.\n\nOn Saturday, the large storm will continue tracking east, bringing thunderstorms to Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, the Florida Panhandle and western Georgia, according to AccuWeather. Forecasters said thunderstorms could slow down as they encounter the Appalachian Mountains, possibly triggering flash flooding in the Tennessee Valley.\n\nSouthwest faces critical fire weather, dust storms\n\nOn the dry side of the storm, states across the Southwest may contend with a return of dust storms and \"critical fire weather risk\" as powerful winds blow through the region the week.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the parched Southwest will not see much rain, but will experience low humidity and high winds, elevating the chance of brush fires spreading quickly across dry vegetation.\n\nAreas at particular risk this week, especially on Friday, include western and central Texas, southeast Arizona and southern New Mexico. The weather service began issuing red flag warnings across the region on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to the threat of fast-spreading fires, the Southwest could again experience dust storms. Last week, blanketing clouds of dust carried by strong winds halted traffic, forced businesses to close and triggered air quality alerts in Texas and New Mexico.\n\nThe East Coast will not be spared\n\nThe storm will barrel east toward the Atlantic Coast into Sunday and could impact several major cities.\n\nKines said it's possible severe weather threats stretch into the Interstate 95 corridor, including Washington D.C., Philadelphia, New York and Boston.\n\n\"The eastern part of the country will not be left out,\" he said, adding that there's still uncertainty about what the exact impacts will look like.\n\nPossible record temperatures across central US\n\nAhead of the storm, large swaths of the country will experience above average temperatures and some areas could see daily records broken, Kines said.\n\nIn Chicago, for example, temperatures on Friday could reach the upper 70s, nearing the city's record high temperature for that day. Other Plains and Midwest states that could see record highs include Kansas City, Missouri, and Minneapolis.\n\nSouthern Texas, meanwhile, could experience triple digit temperatures, well above its average temperatures in the lower 80s for this time of year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/17/storm-damage-tornadoes-wildfires-death-toll-updates/82486374007/", "title": "Severe weather: Families return to find homes destroyed by storms", "text": "The National Guard is being deployed as residents across the U.S. began to assess the fallout from dozens of tornadoes, wildfires, and dust storms that left at least 42 people dead and hundreds of decimated buildings in their wake over the weekend.\n\nField crews from weather service offices across the central and eastern U.S. began surveying the damage Sunday after deaths were reported in Kansas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, and Oklahoma, where almost 300 houses and structures were destroyed by wildfires. As clean-up begins for some, parts of the Central and Southern High Plains will be at risk for extreme or critical fire weather Monday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nNationwide, there were over 130,000 power outages Monday morning, according to USA TODAY's outage tracker, including over 25,000 outages in Missouri, where at least a dozen people were killed and an EF-3 tornado with peak winds of 140 mph was reported Saturday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a statement that his office was monitoring the deadly bout of severe weather that struck the region and deploying the National Guard to Arkansas, where three people died. Dozens more were injured after an EF-3 tornado with 165 mph winds ripped through Cave City on Friday.\n\n\"My administration is ready to assist state and local officials, as they help their communities to try and recover from the damage,\" Trump said. \"Please join Melania and me in praying for everyone impacted by these terrible storms!”\n\nDeath tolls rises from powerful storms\n\nMissouri saw the highest initial death toll as state officials confirmed a dozen people were killed. In Kansas, eight people died when high winds and a dust storm caused a massive collision on Interstate 70 involving at least 71 vehicles, said Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Tod Hileman.\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died and at least 27 people were injured statewide during a news conference Sunday. Three people who had been reported missing on Saturday have also since been found alive, according to Reeves. Hundreds more were displaced by the storms.\n\nThe chief medical examiner's office in Oklahoma confirmed four fatalities occurred as a result of the fires or high winds. KFOR-TV reported that a father was killed and his son was severely burned on Friday.\n\nAnother four deaths were reported in two Texas counties after blowing dirt and wildfire smoke caused multiple car crashes Friday, Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Cindy Barkley told USA TODAY. Nearly 40 vehicles were involved in another crash in Randall County, Barkley said, though no life-threatening injuries were reported. \"We had so many crashes that day, I can't even keep up,\" she said.\n\nThree people also died in Independence County, Arkansas, according to the state division of emergency management and 32 people were injured across eight counties. At least three people were killed in central Alabama and damage was reported in 52 of the state's 67 counties, Gov. Kay Ivey confirmed.\n\nSevere weather also caused a tree to fall on a trailer in Brevard, North Carolina, killing two boys, ages 11 and 13, fire officials said Sunday. A tornado watch issued across a large swath of North Carolina and Virginia expired early Monday morning, though the National Weather Service in Wilmington reported the chance of showers and storms would continue.\n\nHundreds of wildfires reported in Oklahoma\n\nThe storm brought 60 to 70 mph winds to Oklahoma on Friday and the sustained gusts knocked down power lines, ripped off shingles from houses, broke tree limbs, felled street signs, caused road closures and filled the sky with dust. More than 130 fires were reported in 44 counties, the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said Friday night.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said about 170,000 acres in Oklahoma burned and promised a \"post-mortem look\" on the causes of the wildfires beyond the high winds and low humidity. \"We think some of the power lines contributed to this,\" he said.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a Fire Weather Watch from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday in several areas as southwest winds with gusts up to 35 to 45 mph are expected to hit much of central and southwest Oklahoma and meteorologists forecast conditions to be worse on Tuesday, posing higher risks for fires.\n\nFamilies return to find homes destroyed by tornadoes, fire\n\nThe fires in Oklahoma destroyed hundreds of homes, including Stitt's farmhouse north of Luther. When Jeremy Cook returned to his neighborhood in Stillwater on Saturday morning, he found his home burned to the foundation.\n\nHe and his children left for safety Friday, loading up three cars full of wedding photos, pets, personal books, and family paintings. Cook said he had prepared as best he could, mowing and cutting any dead trees on his property, \"but when that wind shifted, and that fire started coming, well my brick house burned down.\"\n\nCook said he’s had college friends drop everything to help, strangers dropping off food and water, and fellow churchgoers bringing clothes.\n\n“It doesn't get better than Oklahomans; It really doesn't. They’re always there and there is nobody better than Okies,” Cook told The Oklahoman, which part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nMeanwhile in Mississippi, Tyrene Power and her family found themselves buried under rubble after a tornado struck their home.\n\nPower told the Mississippi Clarion Ledger, also part of the USA TODAY Network, that sheet rock fell on her, which probably protected her from flying glass, but she doesn't remember much of the event including the roof being torn off. Power wasn't injured, but said a friend who was staying with her had to be taken to the hospital.\n\nWhat Power endured on Saturday was so disorienting, she said she didn't know what day it was. She did know that the tornado that struck her home came sometime the previous afternoon. She said she knew the weather was bad, but didn't recognize anything that indicated a tornado.\n\n\"You know, they say you hear a train,\" Power said as she sat in a vehicle Sunday morning to stay warm outside of the remains of her destroyed home. \"We heard no train. It was just the wind and then it was there.\"\n\nRed flag warnings issued across central U.S.\n\nRed flag warnings will also go into effect Monday in parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas, New Mexico and Florida as high winds and low humidity raise the risk of wildfires, the National Weather Service said. Extremely critical fire weather conditions are also expected on Tuesday across southeast New Mexico, northwest Texas and the Texas Panhandle, an area home to more than 1.2 million people, the National Weather Service warned.\n\n\"A Red Flag Warning means that extreme fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and dry vegetation can contribute to extreme fire behavior,\" the weather service in Fort Worth, Texas said. \"Avoid all outside burning and welding today. Do not toss lit cigarette butts outside.\"\n\nMonday weather forecast Dry air, gusty winds trigger red flag warnings across the Plains\n\nRain, light snow coming to Northeast, Central Appalachians\n\nAdditionally, the weather service said a front is expected to bring rain from the Northeast to the southern mid-Atlantic Coast by Monday evening, and the Northeast by Tuesday evening.\n\nLight snow is also expected to fall over the Lower Great Lakes and Central Appalachians through late Monday afternoon, with light snow also developing over parts of northern New England from Monday evening into Tuesday morning.\n\nLight to moderate snow is also expected to develop over parts of the Northern Rockies, Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley on Monday before moving into the North and Central High Plains by Tuesday evening, the weather service said.\n\nFlights delayed during peak spring break travel\n\nThunderstorms brought rain and the threat of strong gusts, hail, and a brief tornado to Florida over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service in Melbourne.\n\nThe severe weather caused a temporary ground stop at Orland International Airport on Sunday, Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson Chris Mulloolytold USA TODAY. More than 120 flights into or out of Orlando International Airport were also canceled and hundreds more were delayed Sunday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware as thunderstorms struck the area during what officials called the busiest weekend of the spring break travel period.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauari, USA TODAY; Rebecca Heliot, Nolan Clay and Josh Kelly, The Oklahoman; Brian Broom, Mississippi Clarion Ledger", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/05/24/severe-weather-memorial-day-weekend/83837324007/", "title": "Severe weather hits south-central US to start holiday weekend", "text": "The Memorial Day weekend kicked off with a multi-day thunderstorm and heavy rainfall system hitting the south-central part of the country, forecasters said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were under a severe thunderstorm watch the afternoon of Saturday, May 24, across a large swath of Oklahoma and part of Arkansas. The risk of severe storms stretches from the southern Plains to the Southeast, with isolated severe storms possible in South Florida, the Storm Prediction Center said. A risk of showers and thunderstorms also exists in states in the middle and lower Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe storms could bring frequent lightning, severe wind gusts, hail and even a few tornadoes. Significant flash flooding is also a risk.\n\nMemorial Day weekend forecast\n\nA large portion of the center of the country will likely see a wet, rainy holiday weekend, forecasters said.\n\nScattered rain and showers in the Great Lakes region and Northeast are expected over the weekend but ending by Memorial Day, the weather service said.\n\nA stationery front from the Southeast into the Northern Plains and central Rocky Mountain region will extend through the holiday, creating showers, thunderstorms and some heavy rain, also putting the area at risk of flash flooding.\n\n\"The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, small streams, and low-lying areas the most vulnerable,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe threat of excessive rainfall increases on May 25 for states in the central and southern Plains, the middle and lower Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee Valley, forecasters said. Flash flooding remains a risk there later in the weekend. Through May 26, the risk for thunderstorms in the region persists, especially for hail greater than 2 inches over parts of the southern High Plains.\n\nWhich areas are at risk for flooding?\n\nMore than 4 million people were under a flood watch on May 24 that centered around southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri and northern Arkansas.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, multiple rounds of storms could bring more than a month's worth of rain from southeastern Kansas into southern Missouri, northeastern Oklahoma, northern Arkansas and the mid-Mississippi Valley as far east as western Tennessee, through Memorial Day.\n\nRain could fall at rates between 1 and 3 inches per hour, easily flooding low-lying areas or streets and highways, including in areas already soaked in April and earlier in May, AccuWeather said. The runoff could also cause subsequent rises in streams and rivers.\n\n\"This will create dangerous and potentially life-threatening conditions for those who live near waterways or may be camping or recreating in areas of major flooding,\" AccuWeather said in an advisory.\n\nSee the forecast map\n\n2025 seeing worst tornado season in over a decade\n\nThere have been over 900 preliminary reports of tornadoes in 2025, making this year the busiest for tornadoes since 2011, according to AccuWeather. The 922 reports logged through late May is 281 more than the historical average of 641 for this time of year, the outlet said.\n\nThe four states with the most tornado reports are Mississippi, Illinois, Missouri and Texas. Each of those states has seen between 87 and 97 tornadoes so far, AccuWeather reported.\n\nA mid-May rash of tornadoes that broke out across the central part of the country left a deadly trail in its wake, with over two dozen dead in Kentucky and Missouri. The deaths were concentrated in London, Kentucky, and Laurel County, where at least 17 people were killed on May 16.

Check your carrots ...", "text": "November has been an active month for food recalls in the leadup to one of the biggest eating holidays of the year.\n\nFrom carrots and poultry to tortilla strips and ground beef, foodborne illness and outbreaks like E. coli and listeria have been the primary cause of the recurring recalls, some of which have resulted in hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nWhile it may seem food recalls are on a dramatic uphill slope, data from the Food and Drug Administration shows no major uptick in the recalls, most of which are voluntarily issued by companies. Instead, it seems more likely the public and health officials are simply paying more attention and getting better at identifying outbreaks quickly.\n\nEven so, with a new recall seemingly issued every day, that can be difficult for the average consumer to keep track of, especially when working on that Thanksgiving shopping list. Here is a recap of the major food recalls issued in November.\n\nFood recalls galore: Does America have a worsening food safety problem?\n\nGrimmway Farms carrots\n\nOn November 16, 2024, Grimmway Farms recalled multiple sizes and brands of bagged organic baby and whole carrots for possible E. coli contamination.\n\nAs of the latest CDC update on Nov. 17, a total of 39 people across 18 states became sick in the outbreak, resulting in 15 hospitalizations and one death in California.\n\nOther states reporting illnesses included Arkansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming\n\nThe affected baby carrots had best if used by dates ranging from 9/11/2024 to 11/12/2024. The whole organic carrots did not have use-by dates but were sold at stores between 8/14/2024 and 10/23/2024.\n\nThe recalled products were sold under brand names 365, Bunny Luv, Cal-Organic, Compliments, Full Circle, Good & Gather, GreenWise, Grimmway Farms, Marketside, Nature's Promise, O-Organic, President's Choice, Raley's, Simple Truth, Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Wegmans and Wholesome Pantry.\n\nSeveral individual brands like Whole Foods have issued their own separate recalls of related products. Any recalled products should be disposed of immediately.\n\nYu Shang Food poultry\n\nOn Nov. 9, Yu Shang Food issued an initial recall of 4,589 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products for listeria concerns. On Nov. 21, the recall expanded to include a total of 72,240 pounds, including all Yu Shang Food, Inc. products made before October 28, 2024.\n\nAs of the latest update provided by the CDC on Nov. 22, a total of 11 cases of listeria poisoning across 4 states, including nine hospitalizations and one death. Illnesses occurred in California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York. In California, one pregnant person and their twins became sick, resulting in both infants dying. Because listeria testing only came back positive for one infant, just one death is recorded in the official record as related to the recall.\n\nIf consumers have Yu Shang Food products with establishment numbers \"P46684\" or \"EST. M46684\" and/or that were produced before October 28, 2024, they should immediately be disposed of.\n\nSugar Foods tortilla strips\n\nOn Nov. 22, Sugar Food recalled 3.5-ounce pouches of Fresh Gourmet Tortilla Strips Santa Fe Style due to potential wheat contamination. According to the FDA, the brand was notified by a customer that a bag of the tortilla strips contained the company's Crispy Onion Strips. The onion strips contain wheat that the tortilla strips do not.\n\nThe recalled tortilla strips bear a UPC code of 7 87359 17504 6 and a best-by date of June 20, 2025.\n\nNo illnesses have been reported but the recall announcement states that \"people who have a wheat allergy or severe sensitivity to wheat run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the product.\"\n\nThe bags were sent to distribution centers between Sept. 30 and Nov. 11 in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington.\n\nWolverine Packing Co. ground beef\n\nOn Nov. 20, Wolverine Packing Co. recalled 167,200 pounds of fresh and frozen ground beef products over E. coli concerns.\n\nAccording to the USDA, over 100 products manufactured by Detroit-based company are subject to recall after illnesses were reported by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. While the products were distributed to restaurants nationwide, 15 cases of E. coli poisoning have been identified in just Minnesota.\n\nThe recall covers over 100 raw fresh and frozen ground beef products. Products are sold under other brand names in addition to Wolverine Packing Co., including 1855 Beef, Davis Creek Meals, Farmer's Choice, Heritage Restaurant Brands, and Cheney Brothers, Inc., according to a list of labels released by the USDA.\n\nFresh products have a “use by” date of 11/14/2024 and the frozen products are labeled with a production date of 10/22/24.

Salmonella can be spread via contaminated water errantly used to irrigate crops, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.\n\nSymptoms of salmonella infection, or salmonellosis, usually occur between six hours and six days after exposure and may include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, the CDC says.\n\nSevere infections may include aches, headaches, elevated fever, lethargy, rashes, and blood in the urine or stool. Some salmonella infections may become fatal.\n\nSalmonella causes about 1.35 million illnesses, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the U.S. annually, according to the CDC.\n\nEarlier this summer, a salmonella outbreak linked to recalled cucumbers (not linked to SunFed) sickened at least 449 in 31 states, the CDC said. Other recent salmonella outbreaks have been linked to pet bearded dragons, backyard poultry and basil, the agency says.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

Here is what you need to know about the day to celebrate Irish heritage.\n\nWho was St. Patrick?\n\nSt. Patrick is credited with introducing Christianity to Ireland in the 5th century.\n\nBut the man who spurred an Irish holiday wasn't Irish himself.

The terms are often used interchangeably, but half-staff refers to a flag hanging halfway up on a flag pole on land, while half-mast pertains to a flag flying halfway up the mast on a ship at sea.\n\nWhat does Memorial Day celebrate?\n\nMemorial Day is a day on which Americans honor the nation's military members who died in service to the country, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. It is observed on the last Monday in May.\n\nThe president is requested to issue a proclamation each year calling on the people of the United States to \"observe Memorial Day by praying, according to their individual religious faith, for permanent peace,\" according to a joint resolution approved by Congress.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump's proclamation said Memorial Day is a time to honor the nation's \"fallen warriors\" and \"pause in quiet reverence to reflect on the incredible dedication of these valiant men and women and their families, invoking divine Providence as we continue pursuing our noble goal of lasting peace for the world.\"\n\nFederal 2025 holiday schedule\n\nHere are the federal holidays in 2025, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management:\n\nWednesday, Jan. 1 : New Year's Day\n\n: New Year's Day Monday, Jan. 20 : Birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n: Birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. Monday, Jan. 20 : Inauguration Day\n\n: Inauguration Day Monday, Feb. 17 : Washington's Birthday\n\n: Washington's Birthday Monday, May 26 : Memorial Day\n\n: Memorial Day Thursday, June 19 : Juneteenth National Independence Day\n\n: Juneteenth National Independence Day Friday, July 4 : Independence Day\n\n: Independence Day Monday, Sept. 1 : Labor Day\n\n: Labor Day Monday, Oct. 13 : Columbus Day\n\n: Columbus Day Tuesday, Nov. 11 : Veterans Day\n\n: Veterans Day Thursday, Nov. 27 : Thanksgiving Day\n\n: Thanksgiving Day Thursday, Dec. 25: Christmas Day\n\nWashington 2025 holiday schedule\n\nHere are the dates for the 2025 state holidays in Washington, according to the Washington State Department of Revenue:\n\nWednesday, Jan. 1 : New Year's Day\n\n: New Year's Day Monday, Jan. 20 : Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\n: Martin Luther King Jr. Day Monday, Feb. 17 : Presidents Day\n\n: Presidents Day Monday, May 26 : Memorial Day\n\n: Memorial Day Thursday, June 19 : Juneteenth Day\n\n: Juneteenth Day Friday, July 4 : Independence Day\n\n: Independence Day Monday, Sept. 1 : Labor Day\n\n: Labor Day Tuesday, Nov. 11 : Veterans Day\n\n: Veterans Day Thursday, Nov. 27 : Thanksgiving Day\n\n: Thanksgiving Day Friday, Nov. 28 : Native American Heritage Day\n\n: Native American Heritage Day Thursday, Dec. 25: Christmas Day\n\nContributing: USA TODAY Network, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/18/when-did-juneteenth-become-a-federal-holiday-end-of-slavery-joe-biden-what-is-juneteenth/84257054007/", "title": "When did Juneteenth become a federal holiday?", "text": "Juneteenth is this week.

What to know about the federal holiday to honor ...", "text": "The life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. will once again be celebrated and honored on Monday at events around the nation.\n\nThe Civil Rights icon, whose work to end segregation and racism through nonviolence earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, is the only non-president with a federal holiday named in his honor. Every year on MLK Day, the federal government closes and citizens across the U.S. take part in a day of service.\n\nHere’s everything to know about MLK Day, including how it became a federal holiday.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day 2025: Are government offices open or closed? What to know\n\nWhen is Martin Luther King Jr. Day?\n\nThe federal government shuts down on the third Monday of every January for the day to honor Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThis year, that day is Jan. 20.\n\nThe holiday in his honor is timed to honor King’s birthday on Jan. 15, 1929.\n\nHowever, the holiday, which did happen to align with his birthday in 2024, rarely falls on that actual day. That’s because of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which former President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law in 1968 to make many federal holidays occur on Mondays.\n\nMLK Day aligns with Trump inauguration\n\nThis year, MLK Day also happens to be the day that President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated and take office for a second term.\n\nIt’s rare that such a coincidence has occurred, having only happened two other times: Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2013 and Bill Clinton’s in 1997.\n\nWho was Martin Luther King Jr.?\n\nThe Baptist minister first came to national prominence during the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama. King would go on to become one of the most prominent figures in the Civil Rights movement, founding the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957 and leading the 1963 March on Washington.\n\nKing is famed for advocating for civil disobedience and nonviolent methods to push back against racism and segregation.\n\nIn 1963, King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech on the National Mall during the March on Washington.\n\nWhat is the meaning of MLK Day?\n\nMLK Day was designated as a national day of service in which all Americans are encouraged to volunteer to improve their communities, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture.\n\nAcross the nation, cities and local communities will host ceremonies and volunteer events on Monday.\n\nNationally, the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia is hosting a variety of events through Monday to commemorate King and honor those who embody the principles for which he stood.\n\nThe NAACP will also host its annual King Day at the Dome event, which Vice President Kamala Harris headlined in 2024. This year, Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, will headline.\n\nWhen was Martin Luther King Jr. assassinated?\n\nKing was assassinated on April 4, 1968, according to the Stanford Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute. He was standing on a second-floor balcony outside his room at the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nJames Earl Ray confessed to shooting King and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. King’s killing sent shockwaves through America and is still regarded as a landmark event in U.S. history.\n\nKing, who was 39 at the time of his death, would be turning 96 this month.\n\nHow did Martin Luther King Jr. Day become a federal holiday?\n\nThe campaign for a federal holiday in King’s honor began four days after he was assassinated.\n\nBut despite the national fervor inspired by the death of the leader who was instrumental in the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, legislation to honor him languished for years, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nIt wasn’t for 15 years until after King’s death that civil rights activists finally succeeded in making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a nationally observed holiday.\n\nOn Nov. 2, 1983, Reagan signed a bill making the third Monday in January a federal holiday in observance of King’s legacy. The holiday was first observed three years later on Jan. 20, 1986.\n\nAre government offices closed on MLK day?\n\nBecause MLK Day is a federal holiday, federal offices will be closed, and federal workers will have a paid day off, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\n\nContributing: Damon C.

Black members of the community organized a burial of deceased Union prisoners and built a fence around the site, Yale historian David Blight wrote in The New York Times in 2011.\n\nAt least 25 places in the North and the South claim to be the birthplace of Memorial Day. Some states that claim ownership of the origins include Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, according to Veterans Affairs.\n\nDespite conflicting claims, the U.S. Congress and President Lyndon Johnson declared Waterloo, New York, as the “birthplace” of Memorial Day on May 30, 1966, after Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's declaration that same year. The New York community formally honored local veterans on May 5, 1866, by closing businesses and lowering flags at half-staff.\n\nWhat happens at 3 p.m. on Memorial Day?\n\nAt 3 p.m. on Memorial Day, Americans observe the National Moment of Remembrance — a one-minute pause to honor and remember those who died in military service to the United States.\n\nWhat's the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day?\n\nMemorial Day honors those who have died while serving in the military. Veterans Day honors all U.S. military veterans, both living and deceased.\n\nGenerally, Memorial Day is a day of remembrance, while Veterans Day is a day of appreciation.\n\nVictoria Reyna-Rodriguez is a general assignment reporter for the Register.

Tulsa was the site of the Greenwood race massacre, when a violent white mob attacked a prosperous Black community, killing hundreds of its residents and burning more than 1,250 homes.\n\nThe uproar prompted him to move the rally, and said news coverage of the rally brought attention the holiday.\n\n“I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous,” he said.\n\n“It’s actually an important event, an important time,” Trump said in the 2020 interview. “But nobody had ever heard of it.”\n\nThe White House has released statements attributed to Trump in 2017, 2018 and 2019 commemorating Juneteenth.\n\n“Juneteenth reminds us of both the unimaginable injustice of slavery and the incomparable joy that must have attended emancipation,” he said in a June 19, 2020 message. “It is both a remembrance of a blight on our history and a celebration of our Nation’s unsurpassed ability to triumph over darkness.”\n\nWhat is the Juneteenth flag?\n\nFirst created in 1997 by National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation founder Ben Haith, the banner is in red, white and blue of the U.S. flag to convey that all enslaved people and their descendants are American.\n\nThe flag features a five-pointed star representing Texas, the Lone Star State, outlined with a burst at the center.
