Joining Williams and Wilmore for the voyage are the two spacefarers of a mission known as Crew-9, who in September arrived at the orbital laboratory aboard that particular Dragon spacecraft.\n\nLater Tuesday evening, the Dragon carrying the four astronauts – including NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – is due to splash down off the Florida coast.\n\nThe imminent water landing would bring to an end a lengthy spaceflight saga that thrust Williams and Wilmore into the spotlight and raised questions about the future of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. For more than nine months, Williams and Wilmore have lived among the stars after arriving for a doomed mission that was only meant to last a few days.\n\nIn that time, the pair of experienced astronauts have become near-household names, with their ordeal capturing public fascination and later becoming politicized when President Donald Trump decided to weigh in.\n\nBut the stage was finally set for Wilmore and Williams to embark on their long-awaited return trip with the arrival Saturday of the Crew-10 astronauts, who have now replaced the outgoing Crew-9 mission aboard the space station.\n\nWhat time will Starliner, Crew-9 astronauts splash down?\n\nThe departure of the Starliner astronauts with Crew-9 is a little earlier than expected after NASA initially announced that the four spacefarers wouldn't head back to Earth any earlier than Wednesday.\n\nBut after examining weather forecasted off the Florida coast, NASA and SpaceX opted to bump up the return date to when conditions should be better for the Dragon's landing.\n\nThe Dragon Freedom capsule undocked right on schedule at around 1:05 a.m. EDT Tuesday from the ISS Harmony module, a port and passageway onto the station. The astronauts are now on about a 17-hour voyage back to Earth, where they are expected to make a water landing at about 5:57 p.m. EDT off the Florida coast, according to NASA.\n\nAs it did for the undocking, NASA will provide a livestream of the landing on its streaming service NASA+. Coverage is expected to begin at 4:45 p.m.\n\nRead more about our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nWhat happened with the Boeing Starliner?\n\nAs the two NASA astronauts selected for the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner, Wilmore and Williams arrived in June at the space station for what was meant to be a brief orbital stay.\n\nThat was before NASA and Boeing engineers discovered a slew of technical issues with the spacecraft, including helium leaks and propulsion problems. Instead of departing on the spacecraft that bore them to the space station, Wilmore and Williams had no choice but to watch as the the troubled Starliner undocked in September to head back to Earth without them.\n\nNASA ultimately decided to keep Williams and Wilmore at the station for a few extra months rather than launch an emergency mission to return them to Earth in order to keep the space station fully staffed. In September, the space agency launched the SpaceX Crew-9 mission with two astronauts instead of four to leave two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nFor their part, the astronauts have regularly spoke about relishing the extra time in the cosmos, including in an exclusive interview in January with USA TODAY. Wilmore and Williams have also sought to dispel the notion that they are \"stuck\" at the station, insisting that the extended stay is all part of the job.\n\n\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,\" Wilmore said earlier this month in a news conference with journalists from the station.\n\nTrump, Musk weigh in on Starliner saga\n\nThe Starliner astronauts' insistence that they are not in distress at the space station hasn't stopped their unexpectedly long stay from becoming politically charged.\n\nSince Trump took office, he and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have made assertions that the vehicle's crew were \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" in space as a result of the Biden Administration. Trump also recently claimed that it was he who \"authorized\" Musk to retrieve the astronauts, despite the return plan being in place before he was elected.\n\nWilmore was diplomatic about Trump and Musk earlier this month when reporters asked multiple questions about their claims.\n\n“The words they said, well, that’s politics. I mean, that’s part of life,” Wilmore said during the news conference. “From my standpoint, politics has not played into this at all.”\n\nCrew-10 begins mission at International Space Station\n\nThe Saturday night arrival of the Crew-10 astronauts is what paved the way for Wilmore and Williams to finally head home after more than 280 days in orbit.\n\nThe crew, under the command of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, includes NASA pilot Nichole Ayers and two mission specialists from other space agencies: Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.\n\nAfter a two-day delay, the Crew-10 mission launched Friday night from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelling the astronauts into orbit aboard a Dragon capsule. Once separated from the rocket, the Dragon Endurance, which has flown on SpaceX crew mission before, used its own thrusters to autonomously power on to the space station.\n\nBefore the outgoing astronauts departed the station, they spent a few days helping the new arrivals familiarize themselves with the orbital laboratory and station operations during a handover period. Ayers, McClain, Onishi and Peskov will soon be part of Expedition 73 and will remain at the station for about six months on a rotation conducting scientific experiments.\n\nThe SpaceX crew missions are contracted under NASA's commercial crew program, which allows the U.S. space agency to pay SpaceX to launch and transport astronauts and cargo to orbit aboard the company's own vehicles. The Boeing Starliner is meant to one day become a second operational vehicle for NASA under the program, though its path toward certification remains fraught after its botched inaugural crewed flight test.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Finally.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth on Tuesday after more than 280 days in space. Their water landing, which came after about a 17-hour voyage, is something of a storybook ending to the Starliner saga that has captivated the nation and recently become the subject of political posturing.\n\nMonths ago, Wilmore and Williams watched as the Starliner spacecraft they rode to orbit undocked from the International Space Station and left them behind. While the troubled test capsule manufactured by Boeing for NASA missions returned to Earth empty-handed, its crew had no choice but to remain for a few more months at the orbital laboratory.\n\nThe experienced NASA astronauts then had to bide their time in the cosmos until the stars aligned – figuratively, of course – for their own return journey to commence. That chance came early Tuesday morning, when Wilmore and Williams could finally board another spacecraft – this one manufactured by Boeing's competitor, SpaceX – to undock and leave the space station behind.\n\nThe astronauts landed just before 6 p.m. EDT on Tuesday off the coast of Florida in a SpaceX Dragon along with the two astronauts of a mission known as Crew-9.\n\n\"And splashdown. Crew-9 back on Earth,\" NASA communications officer Sandra Jones said while commenting on NASA's livestream.\n\nAll told, Wilmore and Williams' extended mission is now officially the sixth longest in NASA's history, with five astronauts having spent more consecutive days in space than the pair. Both will now get to at long last reunite with their families and friends while recovering from the toll of a lengthy spaceflight.\n\nRead more news about our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nWhen did the Starliner astronauts land with SpaceX Crew-9?\n\nJoining the Starliner astronauts for the water landing off the Florida coast at around 5:57 p.m. EDT were NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – the two Crew-9 astronauts who originally flew aboard the spacecraft to the space station in September.\n\n\"Nick, Alek, Butch, Suni on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,\" the four were told by someone from Mission Control.\n\nThe splashdown came after Wilmore and Williams boarded the Dragon Freedom with the Crew-9 team to undock after 1 a.m. EDT Tuesday from the ISS Harmony module, a port and passageway onto the station. The departure was a little earlier than expected after NASA and SpaceX bumped up the return date from Wednesday to ensure weather conditions would be favorable for when the Dragon reached Earth.\n\nSpace X Engineering Manager Kate Tice said during NASA's official livestream that the Dragon successfully landed \"in the Gulf of America off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida.\"\n\nWhat happened with the Boeing Starliner?\n\nFor Hague and Gorbunov, the landing brings to an end an anticipated six-month routine science expedition to the space station. But for Wilmore and Williams, their nine-month stay was anything but expected.\n\nAs the two NASA astronauts selected for the first crewed flight test of Boeing's Starliner, Wilmore and Williams arrived in June at the space station for what was meant to be a brief orbital stay.\n\nInstead, that demonstration came to an ignominious end when NASA decided the troubled Boeing vehicle wasn't up to the task of transporting its crew back to Earth. The Starliner, which had encountered helium leaks and propulsion issues that engineers discovered when it reached the station, undocked in September without Wilmore and Williams for a parachute landing in the New Mexico desert.\n\nNASA ultimately decided to keep Williams and Wilmore in orbit for a few extra months rather than launch an emergency mission to return them to Earth in order to keep the space station fully staffed. In September, the SpaceX Crew-9 mission launched as planned, but with one crucial change: Just two astronauts, Hague and Gorbunov, headed to the station instead of four to leave two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nIn the months since, the original crew of the Starliner have been integrated into Expedition 72 at the station while awaiting the completion of the Crew-9 mission in order to return home.\n\nFor their part, the astronauts, who have both now completed three trips to orbit, have regularly spoke about relishing the extra time in the cosmos, including in an exclusive interview in January with USA TODAY. Wilmore and Williams also sought to dispel the notion that they were \"stuck\" at the station, insisting that the extended stay is simply part of the job.\n\n\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,\" Wilmore said earlier this month when he, Hague and Williams appeared from the station for a news conference.\n\nTrump, Musk weigh in on Starliner saga\n\nThe Starliner astronauts' insistence that they are not in distress at the space station hasn't stopped their unexpectedly long stay from becoming politicized.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office, he and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made assertions that the vehicle's crew were \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" in space and that the Biden administration was to blame. Trump also recently said that it was he who \"authorized\" Musk to retrieve the astronauts. The plan to bring the astronauts home was in place before he was elected.\n\nTrump doubled down on the claim Monday in a post on Truth Social, writing the Biden administration \"shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them – Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents.\"\n\nWilmore was diplomatic about Trump and Musk earlier this month when prompted in questions from reporters, though he dismissed their claims that the decision last year to extend the mission was politically motivated.\n\n“The words they said, well, that’s politics. I mean, that’s part of life,” Wilmore said during the March 4 news conference. “From my standpoint, politics has not played into this at all.”\n\nCrew-10 arrival at ISS allows for Crew-9 to return on Dragon\n\nKey to the Starliner astronauts' ability to return to Earth was the arrival of another SpaceX mission replacing Crew-9 at the space station.\n\nThe Crew-10 mission, under the command of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, arrived Saturday night at the space station following a Friday night launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The crew of international astronauts selected for the mission also includes NASA pilot Nichole Ayers and two mission specialists from other space agencies: Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.\n\nThe mission got off the ground following a brief two-day delay do to an issue with the launchpad’s ground system, with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelling the astronauts into orbit aboard a Dragon capsule. Once separated from the rocket, the Dragon Endurance, which has flown on SpaceX crew missions before, used its own thrusters to autonomously power on to the space station.\n\nThe launch also came after NASA twice before delayed the Crew-10 mission, originally slated to get off the ground in February.\n\nNASA initially announced in December that the launch had been pushed to late-March to give SpaceX more time to prepare a new Dragon capsule for liftoff. The launch date was then moved back up to mid-March – possibly due to pressure from Trump and Musk – when NASA decided to instead use a \"previously flown\" Dragon.\n\nBefore the outgoing Crew-9 and Starliner astronauts departed the station, they spent a few days helping the new arrivals familiarize themselves with the orbital laboratory and station operations during a handover period. Ayers, McClain, Onishi and Peskov will soon be part of Expedition 73 and will remain at the station for about six months conducting scientific experiments.\n\nWhat's next for Boeing and Starliner?\n\nThe SpaceX Crew missions, most of which last about six months, are contracted under NASA's commercial crew program. The program allows the U.S. space agency to pay SpaceX to launch and transport astronauts and cargo to orbit aboard the company's own vehicles, freeing up NASA to focus on its Artemis lunar program and other deep space missions, including future crewed expeditions to Mars.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner is meant to one day become a second operational vehicle for NASA under the program, though its path toward certification remains fraught after its botched inaugural crewed flight test.\n\nBoeing officials had high hopes that a successful mission would be the demonstration needed to win approval from NASA for Starliner to make routine trips to orbit on behalf of the U.S. space agency. For that to still happen, the aerospace company has been conducting more tests and making modifications to the vehicle to remedy its propulsion system woes and prepare it for routine spaceflight, NASA officials have said.\n\n\"Once the test campaigns are complete, NASA will develop a potential Starliner flight schedule based on the International Space Station's current mission schedule,\" a NASA spokesman said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Isaacman and his crew arrived in late August at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to finalize preparations for liftoff, which has since been delayed three times as SpaceX looks for a viable launch date.\n\nWhen Polaris Dawn does finally get underway, ahead of the crew is a daunting journey to the upper reaches of Earth's orbit where they will spend five pivotal days performing tests that could set the stage for future deep space exploration.\n\nHere's what to know about Polaris Dawn, its potentially historic mission and its intrepid crew.\n\nWhat is the Polaris Dawn mission?\n\nPolaris Dawn is far from simply a billionaire-funded joyride to space.\n\nWhile in orbit, Isaacman and the crew will endeavor to make history while testing space technology on behalf of SpaceX that could prove crucial as NASA and other space agencies set their sights on destinations like Mars.\n\nThe objectives for the crew's five-day stay aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule include:\n\nReach altitudes higher than any human has traveled since NASA’s Apollo lunar program came to an end in the 1970s: The Dragon will tread a path that will take the crew high enough for the vehicle to travel through the treacherous Van Allen radiation belt 870 miles from Earth's surface – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station.\n\nThe Dragon will tread a path that will take the crew high enough for the vehicle to travel through the treacherous Van Allen radiation belt 870 miles from Earth's surface – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station.

But because the Dragon does not have an airlock, its entire interior will be exposed to the vacuum of space, meaning all four astronauts will wear the suits to receive oxygen through tethers. Conduct nearly 40 scientific experiments and test a new laser-based satellite communication system using Starlink – all while using the publicity to raise funds for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nOn the sixth day of the mission, the SpaceX vehicle will reenter Earth's atmosphere and splash down at one of seven sites off the Florida coast.\n\n\"We hope the results from our mission will accelerate SpaceX’s vision to make life multiplanetary,\" Isaacman said in a statement. \"Throughout our mission, we will aim to inspire humankind to look up and imagine what we can achieve here on Earth and in the worlds beyond our own.”\n\nHow to watch the Polaris Dawn launch\n\nIt could be a matter of days until the four-member crew of Polaris Dawn will finally be able to embark on their Earth orbit mission when they board a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule perched atop a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nDespite a series of launch scrubs, the Falcon 9 and Dragon remained vertical on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center as of Thursday, Aug. 29, SpaceX said in its most recent update.\n\nWhen the launch does finally get underway, SpaceX will stream the takeoff via X, formerly Twitter; the NASA facility also sold tickets to watch the launch in person at the Florida base.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY, part of the USA TODAY Network, will provide live coverage starting about two hours before liftoff at floridatoday.com/space.\n\nWhy has Polaris Dawn been delayed?\n\nThe Polaris Dawn mission has been scheduled for launch three times since Isaacman and his crew arrived to quarantine in Cape Canaveral, and all three launches were scrubbed.\n\nMost recently, the Falcon 9 rocket was slated for a Aug. 28 liftoff before SpaceX scrubbed the mission at the last minute due to poor weather forecasted for their return to Earth. Because Polaris Dawn is not docking with the International Space Station, a favorable weather forecast is crucial not just for the launch, but also for the crew's water landing five days later off the Florida coast.\n\nThe launch had also previously been delayed to provide more time for preflight checks, and also when a helium leak – since fixed – was detected.\n\nFortunately, the mission was not threatened when the Federal Aviation Administration briefly grounded Falcon 9 rockets last week following a landing mishap.\n\nWhat are the Van Allen radiation belts?\n\nThe Van Allen belts pose one of the largest hazards to future spacefarers venturing deep into the cosmos.\n\nAccording to NASA, the belts are two areas of trapped cosmic radiation in the magnetosphere surrounding Earth like \"an enormous donut.\" The outer belt is made up of billions of high-energy particles that originate from the sun, whereas the inner belt results from interactions of cosmic rays with Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe International Space Station's orbit keeps the outpost safely below the radiation belts, but future astronauts will have to fly through them to reach the moon and eventually Mars.\n\nWhen the Polaris Dawn crew travels through the radiation belts, their SpaceX craft’s nose will be oriented to minimize the astronauts’ exposure to harmful radiation.\n\n\"In the future, if we are going to have (SpaceX) Starships regularly going to the moon or Mars, we are going to have to fly through the Van Allen belts regularly,\" Isaacman told Florida Today in an email.\n\nWhy is it called the Polaris Program?\n\nThe space program is named after Polaris, a constellation of three stars more commonly known as the North Star – a guiding navigational light throughout human history.\n\nWho is Jared Isaacman, billionaire behind Polaris Dawn?\n\nIsaacman, a billionaire who helped bankroll the Polaris Dawn mission, won't be watching from the ground when it takes off: The experienced aviator and adventurer from Pennsylvania will be aboard the Dragon capsule and will serve as the mission commander.\n\nIsaacman famously dropped out of high school at 16 years old to start his internet company Shift4 Payments and in recent years has become something of an avid spacefarer.\n\nIn 2021, he served as mission commander of Inspiration4, the world’s first all-civilian mission to space that introduced commercial space tourism to the world. The mission, which Isaacman self-funded, saw four civilians head to space for three days in orbit, raising more than $250 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nWith more than 7,000 flight hours of aviation experience, Isaacman is also an aviation enthusiast who is qualified to fly military fighter jets.\n\nIsaacman said in his email to Florida Today that he didn't expect to go to space again after the Inspiration4 mission.\n\n\"I was not planning to go back until after visiting Elon at Starbase in October of 2021,\" Isaacman said in an email to the outlet. \"At that point, we discussed possibilities for test and development missions that would help move the needle on SpaceX's bigger vision to make life multi-planetary.\"\n\nMeet the rest of the Polaris Dawn crew\n\nIsaacman will lead a crew that includes a pilot and two mission specialists.\n\nPilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet ,\n\nMission specialist Sarah Gillis, a Colorado native who is a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX, where she is responsible for overseeing the company’s astronaut training program.

The company books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it — and it hopes this is the first mission of many more to come. There were four crew members on this flight — Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; and three paying customers: Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor.\n\nRecovery crews approach the Crew Dragon capsule after splashdown. SpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nThe splash down return is considered the most dangerous stretch of the mission. The Crew Dragon capsule was traveling at more than 17,000 miles per hour, and as it began the final leg of its descent, the Crew Dragon capsule’s exterior heated up to about 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit as it sliced back into the thickest part of Earth’s atmosphere. Inside the spacecraft cabin, the passengers were protected by a heat shield and the temperature should’ve stayed below 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe Crew Dragon then deployed sets of parachutes as it plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean. Rescue crews waiting near the splash down site hauled the spacecraft out of the ocean and on to a special boat, called the “Dragon’s nest,” where final safety checks took place before the crew disembarked.\n\nAn infrared shot of the recovery crew. SpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nAX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but ultimately stretched to about 17 days, 15 of which were spent on the ISS.\n\nSpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nDuring their first days on the space station, the group stuck to a regimented schedule, which included about 14 hours per day of activities, including scientific research that was designed by various research hospitals, universities, tech companies and more. They also spent time doing outreach events by video conferencing with children and students.\n\nThe weather delays then afforded to them “a bit more time to absorb the remarkable views of the blue planet and review the vast amount of work that was successfully completed during the mission,” according to Axiom.\n\nIt’s not clear how much this mission cost. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the “tens of millions.”\n\nThe mission has been made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated. And the space agency has revealed some details about how much it charges for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory.\n\nFor each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million. While in space, food alone costs an estimated $2,000 per day, per person. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day.\n\nBut the extra days the AX-1 crew spent in space due to weather won’t add to their own personal overall price tag, according to a statement from NASA.\n\n“Knowing that International Space Station mission objectives like the recently conducted Russian spacewalk or weather challenges could result in a delayed undock, NASA negotiated the contract with a strategy that does not require reimbursement for additional undock delays,” the statement reads.\n\nAX-1 did not mark the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft to various wealthy thrill seekers in years past.\n\nThe 11-person crew aboard the International Space Station on April 9, 2022. Clockwise from bottom right: Expedition 67 Commander Tom Marshburn with Flight Engineers Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev, Sergey Korsakov, Raja Chari, Kayla Barron, and Matthias Maurer; and Axiom Mission 1 astronauts (center row from left) Mark Pathy, Eytan Stibbe, Larry Conner, and Michael Lopez-Alegria. NASA\n\nBut AX-1 was the first with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS. It’s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft.\n\nThe mission has set off yet another round of debate about whether people who pay their way to space should be referred to as “astronauts,” though it should be noted a trip to the ISS requires a far larger investment of both time and money than taking a brief suborbital ride on a rocket built by companies like Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic.\n\nLópez-Alegría, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, had this to say about it: “This mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent — especially suborbital — missions. We are not space tourists. I think there’s an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about.”\n\nThough the paying customers will not receive astronaut wings from the US government, they were presented with the “Universal Astronaut Insignia” — a gold pin recently designed by the Association of Space Explorers, an international group comprised of astronauts from 38 countries. López-Alegría presented Stibbe, Pathy and Connor with their pins during a welcome ceremony after the group arrived at the space station.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles Jennifer Korn", "Jackie Wattles", "Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2012/07/01/a-brief-history-of-kennedy-space-center-s-50-years/77371078/", "title": "A brief history of Kennedy Space Center's 50 years", "text": "Todd Halvorson\n\nBRE\n\nFifty years ago today, NASA activated a lunar launch center on North Merritt Island, setting the stage for some of the greatest adventures in history.\n\nCreated to meet an extraordinary Cold War challenge, what we now call Kennedy Space Center began rising from mosquito-infested marshland in east-central Florida.\n\nThe Space Coast was born.\n\nWhat follows is a tale-filled timeline of a half-century of triumph and tragedy at America’s storied gateway to space, as well as a glimpse into what the future holds.\n\n TIMELINE: Interactive timeline traces KSC's 50 years\n\nSept. 1, 1961\n\nJack King put out the news on Sept. 1, 1961: NASA and the Army Corp. of Engineers would begin negotiations with land owners on North Merritt Island to acquire 80,000 acres for “a large space vehicle launch facility.”\n\nThree months after President John F. Kennedy’s call to send American astronauts to the moon, NASA wanted to expand its presence at Cape Canaveral and build a spaceport for manned lunar launches.\n\nHundreds of people in small communities like Neptune Beach, Allenhurst, Clifton and Shiloh would be displaced, and NASA was “determined that all owners receive just compensation,” King wrote in a news release.\n\n“Most of Merritt Island was orange groves, and there were a few small communities like Courtenay and several other places,” said King, now 81 and a Cocoa Beach resident.\n\n“But the big concern of NASA was that in acquiring all this land, we have it come out that we gave a fair shake to all the landowners. And that really did come through. I don’t recall that we had any great protests, you know, as far as the arrangements of taking over the location.”\n\nWhat followed was a four-year, $800 million project that the industry trade magazine Architectural Forum called “one of the most awesome construction jobs ever attempted by Earth-bound men.”\n\nLaunch Complex 39 at KSC required a hangar big enough to assemble Saturn V moon rockets that stood 363 feet tall and 33 feet wide. At 525 feet tall, the Vehicle Assembly Building covers 8 acres and is one of the largest buildings by volume in the world.\n\nLaunch gantries standing 45 stories tall would top mobile launch platforms. Giant tracked crawler transporters would be needed to haul the mammoth rockets to the launch pad. To support the 12 million-pound load, NASA would have to build a 100-foot-wide “crawlerway” comprising a 7-foot-deep bed of stones topped by a layer of asphalt and a surface made of Alabama river rocks.\n\n“It was just amazing coming out here over those next several years — just seeing everything from the start,” Jack King said. “My goodness, when we were building the crawlerway, it looked like we were building the Panama Canal.”\n\nJuly 1, 1962\n\nNASA officially activated its Launch Operations Center, now known as KSC, granting the embryonic lunar launch site equal status with other agency field centers. Previously, it had been the Launch Operations Directorate of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.\n\nFirst center director: Kurt Debus, a German rocket scientist and launch operations leader for Wernher von Braun.\n\nJuly 1963\n\nConstruction of the Vehicle Assembly Building begins.\n\nIn total, workers use 98,590 tons of steel, 65,000 cubic yards of concrete and drive 4,225 steel pilings 160 feet into the limestone below to construct the 525-foot-tall building.\n\nConstruction ends in 1966.\n\nAugust 1965\n\nConstruction of the first stretch of the “crawlerway” between the Vehicle Assembly Building and launch pad 39A began. Two 40-foot-wide lanes separated by a 50-foot median ultimately became the Saturn V and Apollo spacecraft’s roadway to the moon.\n\n6:31 p.m., Jan. 27, 1967\n\nJohn Tribe was on console when a spark from a chafed wire beneath the seat of astronaut Gus Grissom ignited a fire that swept through the Apollo 204 spacecraft.\n\nGrissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee were strapped into their spacecraft high atop a Saturn 1B rocket at Cape Kennedy’s Launch Complex 34, going through a test of all vehicle systems and operational procedures. It was a practice countdown for the first piloted Apollo test flight.\n\n“I was just sitting there writing a test preparation sheet for something I wanted to do the next day on the vehicle, and I’m listening on my headset, and I suddenly hear, ‘Fire!’ ” said Tribe, 76, of Merritt Island.\n\n“ ‘Fire in the spacecraft!’ and then shortly thereafter, ‘We’ve got a bad fire! Get us out of here!’ and then, finally, ‘We’re burning up!’ And it was all over in like 15 or 16 seconds.”\n\nDead silence. NASA’s launch team was stunned.\n\n“You know, everybody was so traumatized by it. It was so unexpected,” said Tribe, a propulsion systems.\n\nThe subsequent investigation found deadly fire spread rapidly in the sealed cabin, which was pressurized with a flame-feeding, 100-percent oxygen environment. There were flammable materials everywhere. No emergency fire or medical rescue squads were on hand during the test. And there was no way for the crew to rapidly escape the capsule.\n\n“We were blind to the safety aspects. That obviously came out in the investigation,” Tribe said. “We knew we were going to have to make a lot of changes to keep this program going.”\n\nNov 9, 1967\n\nIt was the loudest launch of all time.\n\nOn Nov. 9, 1967, an unmanned Saturn V blasts off on the first test flight of the rocket that would launch moon-bound American astronauts.\n\nIt was the first launch from John F. Kennedy Space Center, so named by Executive Order 11129 on Nov. 29, 1963, just seven days after the assassination of America’s 35th president.\n\nStanding 363 feet tall, 33 feet in diameter, and weighing 6.2 million pounds, the Saturn V was the tallest, heaviest and most powerful rocket ever flown.\n\nLiftoff came at 7 a.m., producing an acoustical wave that assaulted blast-proof windows in the Launch Control Center, and media facilities across the street. Both are 3.5 miles from pad 39A.\n\nIn Firing Room 1, windows shook and rattled, plaster dust fell from the ceiling.\n\nThe rolling thunder slammed CBS News Anchor Walter Cronkite: “By God, our building’s shaking here. Our building’s shaking! Oh! It’s terrific! The building’s shaking! This big glass window is shaking! We’re holding it with our hands! Look at that rocket go!” he screamed. “Into the clouds at 3,000 feet. The roar is terrific! Look at it going. You can see it, you can see it.”\n\nEngineers said the noise reached about 120 decibels at the press site — louder than a front row seat at a rock concert. The threshold for pain is 125 decibels.\n\nNASA toned things down after that. Launch-pad engineers added a sound suppression system to dampen the acoustical wave. The system dumped thousands of gallons of water onto the pad to quell the thunder of a Saturn V launch. But subsequent Saturn V launches still impressed nonetheless.\n\nOct. 11, 1968\n\nTwenty-two months after the Apollo 1 fire, NASA astronauts Wally Schirra, Donn Eisele and Walt Cunningham blasted off on Apollo 7, the first manned Apollo test flight. It launched from Cape Kennedy, which would become Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\nDec. 21, 1968\n\nAmerican astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders blast off from launch pad 39A on the Apollo 8 mission. It is the first manned launch of a Saturn V rocket (Apollo 7 was flown on a Saturn 1B from Cape Kennedy), the first manned launch from Kennedy Space Center and the first human expedition beyond Earth orbit.\n\nThe three astronauts became the first to see the entire planet Earth from outer space and the first to see the dark side of the moon. The crew orbited the moon 10 times. They also conducted a Christmas Eve broadcast during which they read the first 10 verses of the Book of Genesis. At the time, the broadcast was the most-watched TV program ever.\n\n9 :32 a.m., July 16, 1969\n\n“Ten, nine, ignition sequence start,” NASA launch commentator Jack King said. Five powerful first stage engines on the Saturn V rocket roared to life.\n\nNASA astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins rocked on top of the 36-story rocket for 8.9 seconds as the engines built up 7.5 million pounds of thrust.\n\nFive giant launch tower swing arms pulled back from the Saturn V, and then, “Liftoff! We have a liftoff. Thirty-two minutes past the hour,” the Boston native said. “Liftoff on Apollo 11.”\n\nHe peered out thick glass windows toward the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“I looked out on the pad, and there is this magnificent rocket that’s sitting there in a bed of flames. I’ve already said, ‘liftoff,’ and it looked like it was just sitting there, you know. It just took an eternity for it to take off,” King said.\n\n“It took 7 seconds for the Saturn V just to clear the tower. But once it started going, it really went.”\n\nDec. 7, 1972\n\nAn estimated 500,000 people flocked to Florida’s Space Coast to witness the only night launch of a Saturn V rocket, a midnight-hour spectacular that propelled Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans and Harrison Schmitt on the 11th and final Apollo mission, which today remains the most recent human expedition beyond Earth orbit.\n\nMay 14, 1973\n\nAmerica’s first space station, Skylab, launched atop a Saturn V rocket. NASA had hoped to keep Skylab in orbit until a space shuttle could travel to it. However, higher-than-expected solar activity dragged the station toward the upper reaches of the atmosphere. Skylab made an uncontrolled reentry over the Indian Ocean on July 11, 1979, showering debris along a path that stretched to a sparsely populated region of western Australia. No injuries or property damage was reported.\n\nJuly 1975\n\nUnbeknownst to many: the United States almost lost three astronauts on the last flight of an Apollo spacecraft, during atmospheric reentry over the Pacific Ocean.\n\n“There was a phase of the reentry where they damn near killed themselves,” said John Tribe, 76, a propulsion system engineer and manager with Apollo spacecraft manufacturer North American Rockwell.\n\nFast and furious, plunging toward Earth, the forces of gravity building up, a fireball enveloped the craft as Thomas Stafford, Vance Brand and Deke Slayton journeyed home from a successful high-profile orbital hook-up with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nThey launched at 3:50 p.m. July 15 from KSC, seven hours after Alexei Leonov and Valeri Kubasov blasted off at Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. The two craft linked up two days later in a show of orbital détente. The ships parted ways July 19. The Soyuz returned to Earth July 21. Now Stafford, Brand and Slayton faced an emergency.\n\nThe crew missed two critical switch throws required to activate the Earth Landing System. A parachute door didn’t open. Drogue chutes didn’t deploy. Quick switch throws followed, but toxic rocket propellant dumped as scheduled from the steering system. A cabin relief valve opened automatically. Nitrogen textroxide started flowing into the cabin.\n\n“All three astronauts got very sick. Brand passed out. The other two, their eyes were streaming, their faces were burning,” said Tribe, of Merritt Island.\n\nThe astronauts coughed. Slayton was nauseous.\n\nThey splashed down, the spacecraft upside down. All three hung from their straps. Stafford got loose, crawled to retrieve oxygen masks and revived Brand.\n\nU.S. Navy divers from a rescue helicopter righted the spacecraft and a crane hoisted it onto the deck of the U.S.S. New Orleans.\n\nStill sick, the crew fielded a congratulatory call from President Gerald Ford. Clearly suffering, their welcome ceremony was cut short. They went to sick bay, then were whisked to Tripler Hospital in Honolulu, where they stayed for two weeks.\n\n“If it had gone on much longer,” Tribe said, his voice trailing off as the obvious became apparent.\n\n1975\n\nThe work force at Kennedy Space Center peaked at 26,500 in 1968. But a significant drawdown followed. By July 1970, a year after the historic Apollo 11 moon-landing mission, the work force had been cut to 15,000. By 1975, the center’s population dropped to 8,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Brevard County soared. Rocket scientists pumped gas for a living. Families left the area. People tell stories of some leaving their keys at their front door on the way out of town.\n\nThe shuttle program created its own boom and bust. In 1981, the KSC work force numbered 12,000. By the late 1980s, it rose to about 17,000. That number dropped to about 14,500 in 2005. And it is back to about 8,000 now.\n\nApril 12, 1981\n\nAsk Norm Carlson, and he’ll tell you it was NASA’s boldest launch.\n\nOn the morning of April 12, 1981, astronauts John Young and Bob Crippen strapped into Columbia for NASA’s first shuttle flight. The new reusable spacecraft would be the first to blast off like a rocket, and land like an airplane.\n\nAn unbelievably complex flying machine, the shuttle would be propelled by two towering strap-on boosters, each packed with 1.1 million pounds of solid-fuel propellant, and three liquid-fueled orbiter main engines fed by a huge, bullet-shaped external tank filled with more than 500,000 gallons of propellant.\n\nAnd unlike Apollo Saturn rockets, the shuttle had never been launched on an unmanned flight test. Saturn rockets had flown 16 times before the first manned mission, Apollo 7.\n\n“We had almost a fully developed (Saturn) launch vehicle before we put a man on it. So I felt like we were in good shape as far as being safe,” said Carlson, 78, of Titusville, who served as the NASA Test Conductor for the first shuttle mission. “But that first shuttle, I had to hold my breath.”\n\n1981 to 1986\n\nNASA’s first 24 shuttle missions were some of the sportiest ever. Astronauts donned Buck Rogers-style jetpacks and flew away from the shuttle, without safety tethers. They retrieved stranded satellites, repaired solar explorers, deployed top-secret military spacecraft and commercial communications satellites.\n\nJan. 28, 1986\n\nSeven astronauts were lost after Challenger broke up 73.6 seconds into flight. The crew included commander Francis “Dick” Scobee, pilot Michael Smith, mission specialists Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, and Judith Resnik, and two payload specialists: Gregory Jarvis and Teacher-In-Space Christa McAuliffe.\n\nThe accident was caused by the failure of an O-ring seal between two lower segments of Challenger’s right solid rocket boosters. Hot gases escaped the booster and burned through the bottom of Challenger’s external tank, triggering the break-up of the vehicle.\n\nThe accident grounded the shuttle fleet for 32 months.\n\nOct. 1, 1986\n\nForrest McCartney didn’t quite know what to expect when he drove through the gates of Kennedy Space Center, headed for the corner office on the fourth floor of the NASA Headquarters building – the domain of the center director.\n\nA three-star general, McCartney was entering civilian grounds after 33-and-a-half years in the U.S. Air Force. His assignment: lead a demoralized KSC work force through a painful recovery from the Jan. 28 Challenger disaster.\n\n“That had been a long time between the accident and October, and the work force had been laid off – a lot of layoffs – so the work force was very discouraged,” said McCartney, 81, of Indian Harbor Beach. “And so it was, I’ll say, not a very happy bunch of campers. The return-to-flight efforts were very slow, and the work force was in need of picking up. It was not a very good situation at all.”\n\nBut what McCartney also found was a work force that was very professional, dedicated, and loyal.\n\n“The country wanted to get back flying, and we wanted to get back flying, and so we started hiring, and getting the people back doing what they do best. And there’s no better in the world at what they do – processing spaceflight hardware,” McCartney said.\n\nDiscovery and five astronauts blasted off Sept. 29, 1988, and NASA’s shuttle fleet was back in business.\n\n1989 to 1992\n\nNASA launched a flurry of major space science and planetary exploration missions when the shuttle fleet returned to flight. Astronauts also blasted off on seven military shuttle missions, the majority of which were classified top secret.\n\nFebruary 1994 to June 1998\n\nShuttle Atlantis blasted off June 27, 1995, headed toward the first shuttle docking with the Russian space station Mir. In a warmup for the joint U.S.-Russian assembly of the International Space Station, 10 shuttle missions were launched to Mir. The first was a rendezvous mission; the following nine docked. Seven U.S. astronauts spent a cumulative total of 977 days on Mir.\n\nOct. 29, 1998\n\n“Booster ignition and liftoff of Discovery with a crew of six astronaut heroes and one American legend.”\n\nAnd with that, NASA launch commentator Lisa Malone and the Kennedy Space Center shuttle launch team sent John Herschel Glenn Jr., into space 36 years after the Project Mercury astronaut became the first American to orbit Earth. At age 77, the retiring U.S. Senator from Ohio became the oldest person to fly in space.\n\nFeb. 1, 2003\n\nColumbia and seven astronauts were 16 minutes from a landing at Kennedy Space Center but the spacecraft never made it home. A 1.67-pound chuck of foam punched a pizza-sized hole in its wing 81 seconds after a Jan. 16 launch on a 16-day science mission.\n\nThe damage went undetected. Hot gasses blowtorched through the wing during atmospheric reentry, and the ship disintegrated over east Texas.\n\nAll onboard were killed: mission commander Rick Husband, pilot Willie McCool, payload commander Michael Anderson, mission specialists Kalpana Chawla, David Brown and Laurel Clark, amd payload specialist Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli to fly in space.\n\nThe accident grounded the shuttle fleet for two-and-a-half years.\n\nFeb. 19, 2004\n\nDiscovery Vehicle Manager Stephanie Stilson fielded the call at home. At first she was shocked. Then she got excited. Atlantis had been slated to fly NASA’s first post-Columbia test flight. But the agency was making a change. Her baby, Discovery, would return the nation’s shuttle fleet to service.\n\n“Right after the accident, we didn’t know what was going to happen. We didn’t know if we would ever fly again. And so, being chosen to be the team to put our country back into space was quite an honor,” said Stilson, 42, of Canaveral Groves.\n\nIn a way, it was fitting. Discovery was the nation’s shuttle fleet leader, and Discovery had been the orbiter that returned the nation to space after the 1986 Challenger accident.\n\n“Everybody took it very seriously. We did not forget about the accident, did not forget about the losses we had, but we able to look at the positive,” said Stilson, who was the NASA manager in charge of Discovery’s ground processing for 11 missions over 11 years. “Okay, we’ve gone through this terrible tragedy. But now it’s time to pull our bootstraps up and get back into flying again.”\n\nDiscovery and a crew of seven blasted off on STS-114 on July 26, 2005. In a near repeat of the Columbia accident, a huge piece of external tank foam broke free and almost hit Discovery’s right wing.\n\nDiscovery landed safely on Aug. 9, 2005. External tank modifications kept the fleet grounded another year. And when it came time to fly again, ‘the workhorse’ of the fleet got the call again.\n\nNASA set back into completing the task of finishing the International Space Station. The station now weighs almost one million pounds and spans an area larger than a U.S. football field. Its assembly is considered one of the greatest civil engineering achievements of all time.\n\nMay 11, 2009\n\nSeven astronauts blast off from launch pad 39A on a fifth and final Hubble Space Telescope servicing flight, a high-profile mission to resuscitate the aging observatory. They succeeded.\n\nJuly 21, 2011\n\nLet the record show that Atlantis and NASA’s final four shuttle astronauts landed on Runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center at 5:57 a.m. EDT. Wheels Stop came 54 seconds later. “Mission complete, Houston,” said Atlantis commander Chris Ferguson. “After serving the world for over 30 years, the shuttle has earned its place in history, and it has come to a final stop.” NASA’s 135th and final shuttle mission was over.\n\nLate May\n\nSomething was missing. Cruising into Kennedy Space Center in her 2002 Ford Thunderbird, Stephanie Stilson got “a very odd feeling.”\n\n“I remember driving in that first day after being gone for over a month, and thinking, ‘Oh my goodness! Discovery is not sitting in an (Orbiter Processing Facility) bay anymore, where I can just walk over and see her whenever I like to,” she said.\n\nStilson, 42, had been Discovery’s Vehicle Manager and then Flow Director — the NASA manager in charge of that orbiter’s ground processing work — for more than a decade.\n\n“And so I had that empty feeling of loss, or something being missing, from my daily routine. And, so that was a little emotional for me,” Stilson said. “I don’t get emotional very often, but that was a tough, a tough couple of hours getting dto that.”\n\nOf course, Stilson was well aware of Discovery’s whereabouts. She is heading up NASA’s shuttle “transition and retirement” program. She is in charge of getting the vehicles ready for museum display, transporting them to their retirement homes, making certain they are well ensconced.\n\nDiscovery is wowing the public at the Smithsonian’s Stephen F. Udvar-Hazy Center outside Washington. The prototype Enterprise was recently delivered to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Endeavour and Atlantis are still at KSC.\n\nThis fall, though, Endeavour will depart for the California Science Center in Los Angeles. Atlantis will stay home. It will be moved late this year to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\n\nNOW\n\nShawn Quinn is eyeing the future, and he sees big things for NASA at Kennedy Space Center.

A decade earlier he had proposed that a beam of light, instead of being composed of waves, was instead composed of individual packets of energy called photons, as a means of explaining a phenomenon involving light called the photoelectric effect which up until that point had eluded explanation.\n\nEinstein’s explanation was soon verified, and he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics for his work in this area.\n\nDuring the same year as his work on the photoelectric effect Einstein also published what has become known as his Special Theory of Relativity. He started with the assumption that all observers, regardless of how fast they are moving, would measure the speed of light to be the same, and worked out the consequences from there. His calculations led to such phenomena as time dilation, i.e., the slowing down of time as one approaches the speed of light, and the equivalence of mass and energy, represented by the now-famous equation E = mc2. All of Einstein’s conclusions resulting from Special Relativity have been experimentally verified in the decades that have elapsed since then.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWith General Relativity Einstein tackled the issue of gravity, which was difficult to reconcile with the more recent developments in physics. The equations of gravity had been worked out in the late 17th century by the British physicist Isaac Newton, and although these had worked remarkably well in explaining the behavior of objects on Earth and elsewhere in the universe, these were beginning to seem incompatible with the nature of matter as was being revealed by the emerging science of quantum mechanics.\n\nNewton had proposed that gravity was a force acting between two objects in space separated by a distance, although the exact nature of this force and how it was transferred from one object to another remained a mystery. Einstein proposed instead that the universe could be considered as being composed of spacetime, wherein time is a separate dimension of space although multiplied by the speed of light, and that the behavior of objects within a gravitational field could actually be explained by their motions through this four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nMuch of General Relativity seems counter-intuitive to our normal way of viewing things. For example, the behavior of a ball that has been tossed up by one hand which then arcs down to the other hand seems quite explainable as being influenced by the Earth’s gravitational field. However, in General Relativity the ball has actually traveled in a straight line through space time; the person who tossed the ball has traveled on a slightly different path through space time, and thus perceives the ball’s motion as being curved.\n\nGeneral Relativity was successful in explaining a previously-unexplained slight drift in the orbit of the planet Mercury. Meanwhile, one of the predictions made by General Relativity is that light will seem to travel a curved path when passing through the gravitational field of a massive object. This was experimentally verified during the total solar eclipse on May 29, 1919, when photographs taken during totality showed that the apparent locations of the background stars beyond the sun had shifted exactly as had been predicted by General Relativity.\n\nThis same concept has led to the phenomenon of gravitational lenses, wherein close-by massive objects will bend the light of more distant objects and make them more visible. Numerous examples of this are now known, including distant galaxies that have been made more visible – sometimes even with multiple images – and which have provided evidence for the so-called dark matter that pervades the universe. The existence of planets orbiting relatively nearby stars have been revealed via this phenomenon when the parent stars — and the planets — have passed directly in front of more distant stars.\n\nGeneral Relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime created by extremely energetic events. These would be very weak, and at this time no conclusive evidence for these waves has ever been produced, but that may soon change. Extremely sensitive detectors at gravitational wave observatories at locations in the United States and elsewhere will soon be operational, and meanwhile next Wednesday – on the exact anniversary of Einstein’s paper — the European Space Agency will be launching its Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Pathfinder mission, which is designed to be a test bed for a three-spacecraft space-based gravitational wave detection mission scheduled for launch in the 2030s.\n\nWhile performing his calculations for General Relativity Einstein realized that they predicted an expanding universe. The general consensus at that time was that the universe was static, so Einstein arbitrarily inserted a cosmological constant into his equations to keep things that way. A little over a decade later the American astronomer Edwin Hubble demonstrate that the universe is indeed expanding, and Einstein retracted his cosmological constant, calling it “the greatest blunder of my life.” However, the discovery of dark energy in the late 1990s, wherein the expansion of the universe is actually accelerating, suggests that there might be some kind of cosmological constant embedded within the fabric of spacetime after all.\n\nThere are in fact some competing theories to General Relativity that have been proposed over the years, and the upcoming efforts should hopefully reveal which of these is most correct in explaining the goings-on in our universe. Meanwhile, although for practical purposes all of our activities, including space missions such as the New Horizons mission which flew by Pluto in July 2015, can be calculated from Newton’s law of gravity, General Relativity and its cousins continue to lead our quest to determine the very nature of reality in this universe in which we live.\n\nAlan Hale is a professional astronomer who resides in Cloudcroft.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nMeasuring the expansion rate of the universe was one of the Hubble Space Telescope’s main goals when it was launched in 1990.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the space observatory has helped scientists discover and refine that accelerating rate – as well as uncover a mysterious wrinkle that only brand-new physics may solve.\n\nHubble has observed more than 40 galaxies that include pulsating stars as well as exploding stars called supernovae to measure even greater cosmic distances. Both of these phenomena help astronomers to mark astronomical distances like mile markers, which have pointed to the expansion rate.\n\nIn the quest to understand how quickly our universe expands, astronomers already made one unexpected discovery in 1998: “dark energy.” This phenomenon acts as a mysterious repulsive force that accelerates the expansion rate.\n\nAnd there is another twist: an unexplained difference between the expansion rate of the local universe versus that of the distant universe right after the big bang.\n\nScientists don’t understand the discrepancy, but acknowledge that it’s weird and could require new physics.\n\n“You are getting the most precise measure of the expansion rate for the universe from the gold standard of telescopes and cosmic mile markers,” said Nobel Laureate Adam Riess at the Space Telescope Science Institute and a distinguished professor at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, in a statement.\n\n“This is what the Hubble Space Telescope was built to do, using the best techniques we know to do it. This is likely Hubble’s magnum opus, because it would take another 30 years of Hubble’s life to even double this sample size.”\n\nDecades of observation\n\nThe telescope was named for pioneering astronomer Edwin Hubble, who discovered in the 1920s that distant clouds in the universe were actually galaxies. (He died in 1953.)\n\nHubble relied on the work of astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt’s 1912 discovery of the periods of brightness in pulsating stars called Cepheid variables. Cepheids act like cosmic mile markers as they brighten and dim periodically within our galaxy and others.\n\nHubble’s work led to the revelation that our galaxy was one of many, forever changing our perspective and place in the universe. The astronomer continued his work and discovered that distant galaxies appeared to be moving rapidly, suggesting that we live in an expanding universe that started with a big bang.\n\nThe detection of the universe’s expansion rate helped lead to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, awarded to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt and Riess “for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe through observations of distant supernovae.”\n\nRiess continues to lead SHOES, short for Supernova, H0, for the Equation of State of Dark Energy, a scientific collaboration investigating the universe’s expansion rate. His team is publishing a paper in The Astrophysical Journal that provides the latest update on the Hubble constant, as the expansion rate is known.\n\nAn unresolved discrepancy\n\nMeasuring distant objects has created a “cosmic distance ladder” that can help scientists better estimate the age of the universe and understand its foundations.\n\nMultiple teams of astronomers using the Hubble telescope have arrived at a Hubble constant value that equals 73 plus or minus 1 kilometer per second per megaparsec. (A megaparsec is one million parsecs, or 3.26 million light years.)\n\n“The Hubble constant is a very special number. It can be used to thread a needle from the past to the present for an end-to-end test of our understanding of the universe. This took a phenomenal amount of detailed work,” said Licia Verde, a cosmologist at the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies and the Institute of Cosmos Science at the University of Barcelona, in a statement.\n\nBut the actual predicted expansion rate of the universe is slower than what the Hubble telescope has observed, according to astronomers utilizing the standard cosmological model of the universe (a theory suggesting the components of the big bang) and measurements taken by the European Space Agency’s Planck mission between 2009 and 2013.\n\nPlanck, another space observatory, was used to measure the cosmic microwave background, or the leftover radiation from the big bang 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nPlanck mission scientists arrived at a Hubble constant of 67.5 plus or minus 0.5 kilometers per second per megaparsec.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, which launched in December, will be able to observe Hubble’s mile markers in sharper resolution and at greater distances, which could contribute to understanding the discrepancy between the two numbers.\n\nIt makes for an exciting challenge to cosmologists who were once determined to measure the Hubble constant – and now find themselves questioning what additional physics may help them unlock a new mystery about the universe.\n\n“Actually, I don’t care what the expansion value is specifically, but I like to use it to learn about the universe,” Riess said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/09/gods-hand-nebula-milky-way-telescope/73629845007/", "title": "'God's Hand' nebula seen reaching across Milky Way in telescope ...", "text": "An interstellar structure known as “God’s Hand” can be seen reaching across the cosmos toward a nearby spiral galaxy in stunning new images captured by the powerful Dark Energy Camera.\n\nThe \"cloudy, ominous\" cometary globule located 1,300 light-years from Earth in the Puppis constellation resembles something of \"a ghostly hand,\" said the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab.) While officially known as CG 4, its distinctive shape is what lends the structure its divine nickname.\n\nNOIRLab, a federally-funded research and development center, released images of \"God's Hand\" earlier this week along with an explanation of why observing phenomenon is so awe-inspiring and rare for astronomers.\n\nBlack hole simulation: NASA shows what it would be like to fall into black hole\n\nWhat are cometary globules?\n\nCometary globules are a type of dark nebula – interstellar clouds containing a high concentration of dust – known as Bok globules. These isolated clouds of dense cosmic gas and dust are surrounded by hot, ionized material.\n\nTheir name notwithstanding, cometary globules have nothing to do with actual comets other than that their extended tails are quite comet-esque.\n\nHow these objects get their distinctive form is still a matter of debate among astronomers, NOIRLab said.\n\n'God's Hand' appears to be reaching for ESO galaxy\n\nThe new image of the glowing red structure resembling a ghostly hand is CG 4 – one of many cometary globules present within the Milky Way.\n\nThe end of the structure, which could better be described as a claw rather than a hand, is 1.5 light-years across, NOIRLab said. Its tail, or arm, stretches another 8 light years – making CG 4 a comparatively small Bok globule.\n\nThe tiny, disc-shaped spec that the claw appears to be reaching for in the image is a spiral galaxy known as ESO 257-19 (PGC 21338). Fortunately for ESO, the galaxy is in fact located a safe distance of more than 100 million light-years away from the menacing grasp of \"God's Hand.\"\n\nAstronomers have observed these structures throughout the Milky Way, but the overwhelming majority of them, including CG 4, are found within the Gum Nebula. Believed to be the expanding remains of a supernova that took place about a million years ago, the Gum Nebula is a huge patch of glowing gas containing at least 31 cometary globules in addition to CG 4, NOIRLab said..\n\nThe camera that capture the image is mounted on the Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.\n\nCometary globules first discovered in 1976\n\nThe first cometary globules were first discovered in 1976 from images captured by the UK Schmidt Telescope in Australia. The reason the structures were able to go undetected for so long is because these cosmic phenomena are so faint and typically shrouded from the view of cameras and telescopes by stellar dust.\n\nBut with its Hydrogen-Alpha filter, the Dark Energy Camera was able to pick up a faint red glow of ionized hydrogen. The light is produced when hydrogen becomes energized by radiation from nearby hot, massive stars.\n\nIronically, that same intense radiation is gradually destroying the head of the globule and sweeping away the tiny particles that scatter the starlight, astronomers say.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

They just had to be Swiss or a legal resident of Switzerland for five years.\n\nCriticism of the proposal focused on common sense, some said. The basic income was a handout that would encourage laziness, harm the economy — inflation, anyone? — and invite freeloaders to Switzerland, they argued.\n\nBut the measure’s proponents righteously brushed aside those misgivings.\n\nThe advocates unveiled an enormous poster in the run-up to the vote that read “What would you do if your income was secure?” The implication was that folks might learn Chinese, grow exotic flowers or take up ballroom dancing rather than go to their soul-stifling office jobs.\n\nThey also marched through Zurich dressed up like robots and handing out free money, suggesting that technology would make up for the loss in productivity that might result if the state took away people's incentives to work.\n\nLastly, they argued that work that’s essential often generates no money – a travesty of social justice.\n\n\"In Switzerland over 50 percent of total work that is done is unpaid,” Che Wagner from the campaign group Basic Income Switzerland, told the BBC. “It's care work, it's at home, it's in different communities, so that work would be more valued with a basic income.\"\n\nOne could argue that only a fool would look askance at the proposal. Free money? Why not?\n\nBut the referendum failed by a wide margin. Around 77% of voters rejected the proposal. Around 23 percent voted in favor.\n\nThe Swiss opted against utopia, in other words.\n\n\n\nToday American presidential candidates are similarly making big promises that arguably contravene reality in hopes of setting the world aright: free tuition at public universities that are already starved of public funding; trade deals that will turn around manufacturing that’s been declining for years; establishment experience that will avoid the missteps of establishments past.\n\nTo many in Switzerland and beyond, a basic income sounded too good to be true. After the Swiss cast their ballots, it was.\n\nAmerican politicians should watch out. Skeptics vote.\n\nWANT TO KNOW\n\nThe Father's Shadow\n\nIt's still too close to call but Peru's ex-finance minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is edging out opponent Keiko Fujimori in Peru's presidential elections, according to the latest results.\n\nWith nearly 80% of ballots counted, Kuczynski has taken in 50.8% of votes, giving the Wall Street veteran a slight lead over Fujimori, who has 49.2%.\n\nKuczynski based his campaign on promises that he would apply his financial sector experience to improve Peru's economy and spur investment – but he also enjoys support from many who worry that Fujimori would follow in the footsteps of her father, former president Alberto Fujimori.\n\nThe elder Fujimori is currently imprisoned for corruption and for authorizing \"death squads\" during his time in office in the 1990s.\n\nNo Tipples Allowed\n\nThe U.S. Navy has imposed a drinking ban and restricted off-base liberty for its 18,600 sailors stationed in Japan in an attempt to improve relations between locals and US forces.\n\nThe measures will be kept in place until \"all personnel understands the impact of responsible behavior on the U.S.-Japan alliance,\" said the Navy.\n\nThe restrictions follow a series of incidents involving U.S. sailors in Okinawa: Police recently arrested one sailor on suspicions of drunk driving in a car accident that injured two people.\n\nAnd last month, a US civilian working for the military was arrested on suspicions of dumping the body of a 20-year-old Japanese woman.\n\nThat incident sparked outrage among the residents of Okinawa, who want US forces off their island. The tensions also threaten plans to relocate a US air base to less populated parts of Okinawa.\n\nRare Gems, More Violence\n\nLapis lazuli: It's a rare, brilliant blue stone that was once prized by Egyptian pharaohs.\n\nAnd now anti-corruption groups are warning that it is fueling the rise of the Taliban in a once peaceful corner of Afghanistan as tribal strongmen battle over control of Badakshan's many lapis mines.\n\nThe remote province on the border of Tajikistan has seen security deteriorate in recent years – conflicts over the mines have weakened the area's normally anti-Taliban leaders and have created a void for the Taliban to operate and recruit.\n\nBadakshan has seen the number of insurgent attacks rise in recent years: The district where the mines are located was seized by a militia in 2014, plunging the area into crisis.\n\nThat's not the only region seeing a surge of attacks. This weekend, Taliban gunman stormed a court in eastern Afghanistan, killing seven people, including a newly appointed court prosecutor.\n\nDISCOVERIES\n\nMade for Speed\n\nThe universe could be expanding faster than scientists previously thought, reported New Scientist.\n\nAccording to findings due to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, researchers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland believe the Milky Way and other galaxies are flying away from each other at a rate of around 9 percent faster than previous measurements calculated.\n\nThe concepts at play are pretty mind blowing. In fact, they are so mind blowing that scientists at least for now appear to be focusing more on how they have measured these speeds rather than the implications of the universe moving more quickly than people realized.\n\nScientists used to measure the speed of the expanding universe by looking at microwaves dating from the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. The more recent research uses the light from stars and supernovae to measure how fast things are moving.\n\nIt’s still not clear which measuring system is better.\n\nBut if the new research is right, it could mean that dark energy – a force that counters gravity – could rip the universe apart in around 2.8 billion years. It could also call into question Einstein’s theory of relatively. Or it could mean the scientists are missing something entirely and need to look harder at where the universe is going.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/world/colliding-galaxies-gemini-north-image-scn/index.html", "title": "New image of colliding galaxies previews Milky Way's fate | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA new telescope image showcases two entangled galaxies that will eventually merge into one millions of years from now – and previews the eventual, similar fate of our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\nThe Gemini North telescope, located on the summit of Maunakea in Hawaii, spotted the interacting spiral galaxies about 60 million light-years away in the Virgo constellation.\n\nThe galactic pair NGC 4567 and NGC 4568, also known as the Butterfly galaxies, have just begun to collide as gravity pulls them together.\n\nIn 500 million years, the two cosmic systems will complete their merger to form a single elliptical galaxy.\n\nAt this early stage, the two galactic centers are currently 20,000 light-years apart and each galaxy has maintained its pinwheel shape. As the galaxies become more entangled, gravitational forces will lead to multiple events of intense star formation. The original structures of the galaxies will change and distort.\n\nOver time, they will dance around each other in circles that become smaller and smaller. This tightly looped dance will pull and stretch out long streams of gas and stars, mixing the two galaxies together into something that resembles a sphere.\n\nAs millions of years pass, this galactic entanglement will consume or disperse the gas and dust needed to trigger star birth, causing stellar formation to slow and eventually cease.\n\nObservations of other galactic collisions and computer modeling have provided astronomers with more evidence that mergers of spiral galaxies create elliptical galaxies.\n\nOnce the pair come together, the resulting formation may look more like elliptical galaxy Messier 89, also located in the Virgo constellation. Once Messier 89 lost most of the gas necessary to form stars, very little star birth occurred. Now, the galaxy is home to older stars and ancient clusters.\n\nThe afterglow of a supernova, first detected in 2020, is also visible in the new image as a bright spot in one of galaxy NGC 4568’s spiral arms.\n\nMilky Way merger\n\nA similar galactic merger will unfold when the Milky Way galaxy eventually collides with the Andromeda galaxy, our largest and nearest galactic neighbor. Astronomers at NASA used Hubble data in 2012 to predict when a head-on collision between the two spiral galaxies might occur. Estimates project that the event will happen in about 4 billion to 5 billion years.\n\nRight now, a massive halo that surrounds the Andromeda galaxy is actually bumping up against the Milky Way galaxy’s halo, according to research based on Hubble Space Telescope data that published in 2020.\n\nAndromeda’s halo, a large envelope of gas, extends out 1.3 million light-years from the galaxy, almost halfway to the Milky Way, and as much as 2 million light-years in other directions.\n\nThis neighbor, which likely contains as many as 1 trillion stars, is similar in size to our large galaxy, and it’s only 2.5 million light-years away. That may sound incredibly distant, but on an astronomical scale, that makes Andromeda so close that it’s visible in our autumn sky. You can see it as a fuzzy cigar-shaped bit of light, high in the sky during the fall.\n\nAnd if we could see Andromeda’s massive halo, which is invisible to the naked eye, it would be three times the width of the Big Dipper constellation, which dwarfs anything else in our sky.\n\nScientists at NASA said it’s unlikely that our solar system will be destroyed when the Milky Way and Andromeda merge, but the sun might get kicked into a new region of the galaxy – and Earth’s night sky may have some new spectacular views.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/world/milky-way-center-black-hole-image-scn/index.html", "title": "Supermassive black hole: 1st image of Sagittarius A* at the center of ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Astronomers said the black hole is 4 million times more massive than our sun.\n\n“For decades, astronomers have wondered what lies at the heart of our galaxy, pulling stars into tight orbits through its immense gravity,” Michael Johnson, astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, said in a statement.\n\n“With the (Event Horizon Telescope or EHT) image, we have zoomed in a thousand times closer than these orbits, where the gravity grows a million times stronger. At this close range, the black hole accelerates matter to close to the speed of light and bends the paths of photons in the warped (space-time).”\n\nThe black hole is about 27,000 light-years away from Earth.

The Astrophysical Journal/Northwestern University Wonders of the universe Prev Next\n\n“We were stunned by how well the size of the ring agreed with predictions from Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity,” said EHT project scientist Geoffrey Bower from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, in a statement.\n\n“These unprecedented observations have greatly improved our understanding of what happens at the very (center) of our galaxy, and offer new insights on how these giant black holes interact with their surroundings.”\n\nThe results of this groundbreaking discovery were published Thursday in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nSearching for the black hole\n\nIt has taken five years for astronomers to capture and confirm this image and discovery. Previously, scientists observed stars orbiting some invisible, massive object at the galactic center.\n\nThe 2020 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to scientists Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for their discoveries about black holes, including evidence shared by Ghez and Genzel about the mass of the object at the center of the Milky Way.\n\n“We now see that the black hole is swallowing the nearby gas and light, pulling them into a bottomless pit,” Ramesh Narayan, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, said in a statement. “This image confirms decades of theoretical work to understand how black holes eat.”\n\nThe discovery was made possible by more than 300 researchers from 80 institutions working with a network of eight different radio telescopes around the globe that make up the Event Horizon Telescope.\n\nThe telescope is named after the “event horizon,” the point at which no light can escape from a black hole. This global telescope network essentially forms a single “Earth-size” virtual telescope when all eight are linked and observing in tandem.\n\nIt’s the second image ever captured of a black hole, with the first being the EHT’s achievement of imaging M87* at the heart of the distant Messier 87 galaxy, located 55 million light-years away, in 2019.\n\nThese panels show the first two black hole images. On the left is M87*, and the right is Sagittarius A*. European Southern Observatory/EHT Collaboration\n\nWhile the two images look similar, Sagittarius A* is more than 1,000 times smaller than M87*.\n\n“We have two completely different types of galaxies and two very different black hole masses, but close to the edge of these black holes they look amazingly similar,” said Sera Markoff, cochair of the EHT Science Council and a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam, in a statement.\n\n“This tells us that (Einstein’s theory of) General Relativity governs these objects up close, and any differences we see further away must be due to differences in the material that surrounds the black holes.”\n\nCapturing an impossible image\n\nAlthough the Milky Way’s black hole is closer to Earth, it was much harder to image.\n\n“The gas in the vicinity of the black holes moves at the same speed – nearly as fast as light – around both Sgr A* and M87*,” EHT scientist Chi-kwan Chan at the Steward Observatory and Department of Astronomy and the Data Science Institute of the University of Arizona, said in a statement.\n\n“But where gas takes days to weeks to orbit the larger M87*, in the much smaller Sgr A* it completes an orbit in mere minutes. This means the brightness and pattern of the gas around Sgr A* was changing rapidly as the EHT Collaboration was observing it – a bit like trying to take a clear picture of a puppy quickly chasing its tail.”\n\nIf the supermassive black holes M87* and Sagittarius A* were next to each other, Sagittarius A* would be dwarfed by M87*, which is over 1,000 times more massive. National Science Foundation/Keyi \"Onyx\" Li\n\nThe global network of astronomers had to develop new tools to allow for the quick movement of gas around Sagittarius A*. The resulting image is an average of different ones taken by the team. Taking the Sagittarius A* image was like capturing a photo of a grain of salt in New York City using a camera in Los Angeles, according to California Institute of Technology researchers.\n\n“This image from the Event Horizon Telescope required more than just snapping a picture from telescopes on high mountaintops. It is the product of both technically challenging telescope observations and innovative computational algorithms,” Katherine Bouman, Rosenberg scholar and assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences, electrical engineering and astronomy at the Caltech, said during a press conference.\n\nBouman also worked on capturing the M87* image shared in 2019. Despite the fact that the Sagittarius A* image may seem blurry, “it’s one of the sharpest images ever made,” Bouman said.\n\nEach telescope was pushed to its limit, which is called a diffraction limit, or the maximum fine features that it can see.\n\n“And that’s basically the level that we’re seeing here,” Johnson said at the press conference. “It’s fuzzy because to make a sharper image, we need to move our telescopes further apart or go into higher frequencies.”\n\nOn the horizon\n\nHaving images of two very different black holes will allow astronomers to determine their similarities and differences and better understand how gas behaves around supermassive black holes, which could contribute to the formation and evolution of galaxies. It is believed that black holes exist at the center of most galaxies, acting like an engine that powers them.\n\nSagittarius A* is at the center of our own galaxy, while M87* resides more than 55 million light-years from Earth. National Science Foundation/Keyi \"Onyx\" Li\n\nMeanwhile, the EHT team is working to expand the telescope network and conduct upgrades that could lead to even more stunning images, and even movies, of black holes in the future.\n\nCapturing a black hole in motion can show how it changes over time and what the gas does as it swirls around a black hole. Bouman and EHT member Antonio Fuentes, who will join Caltech as a postdoctoral researcher in October, are developing methods that will allow them to stitch images of the black hole together to reflect this motion.\n\nThis “first direct image of the gentle giant in the center of our galaxy” is just the beginning, said Feryal Özel, member of the EHT Science Council and a professor of astronomy and physics and associate dean for research at the University of Arizona, during the press conference.\n\n“This image is a testament to what we can accomplish, when as a global research community, we bring our brightest minds together to make the seemingly impossible, possible,” National Science Foundation Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement. “Language, continents and even the galaxy can’t stand in the way of what humanity can accomplish when we come together for the greater good of all.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}]}

Throughout the match, Chelsea fans chanted the name Roman Abramovich – even during a minute of applause to show solidarity for the Ukrainian people. The manager, Thomas Tuchel, was visibly displeased. This was not “the moment to do this”, he said.\n\nAbramovich reportedly tried to sell the club for an asking price of £3bn, said Duncan Castles in The Sunday Times. It seems an astronomically high sum, given that Chelsea is a club with “inferior revenue streams” to Manchester United, which is thought to be worth about £1.5bn.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

On Thursday, the situation changed drastically when sanctions were imposed on Abramovich by the UK government.\n\nRussian-born billionaire Abramovich is one of seven more oligarchs who have had sanctions placed on them in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Sky News reported. A government document said Abramovich has had a “close relationship for decades” with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHow will sanctions impact Chelsea and a potential sale?\n\nAs a result of the sanctions, the club’s income has been frozen. It is under an effective transfer embargo and it cannot even sell tickets to matches.\n\nThe future of the reigning European champions is “uncertain”, the BBC said. But a special licence allows the Stamford Bridge club to keep operating. The men’s and women’s teams can fulfil their fixtures for the rest of this season as normal and the licence allows wages to be paid to all employees, including players and coaching staff.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAbramovich can “no longer press ahead with selling the club”, said the Daily Mail. However, Chelsea can request “special dispensation”, which would be considered if the government views a change of ownership in the “best interests of the club”, provided it does not benefit Abramovich. “It effectively leaves Abramovich with two options: agree to the government’s conditions and lose the club for nothing, or let Chelsea slowly rot.”\n\nChelsea fan and British property tycoon Nick Candy has confirmed that he remains interested in buying the club, the Mail reported. “We are examining the details of the announcement and we are still interested in making a bid,” a spokesperson said. “Clearly this is a time of great uncertainty for all Chelsea fans. In our view no one is the owner of a football club – you are the custodian of it for the fans and the community.”\n\nIt’s not just Candy who is interested in buying Chelsea, The Daily Telegraph reported. New York-based merchant bank Raine, which is handling the sale, has received around 150 inquiries from individuals or groups claiming to be interested. The sanctioning of Abramovich is set to “spark a shootout” between three American-led groups who are bidding to “save Chelsea from the threat of financial armageddon”.\n\n(Image credit: Jamie McDonald/Getty Images)\n\nFollowing Thursday’s developments, Chelsea could “lose millions” in sponsorship revenue, the Mail said. Telecoms firm Three has put its £40m shirt sponsorship on hold while fellow partners Hyundai, Parimatch and Zapp are also considering ending their agreements. A Three spokesperson said it had asked Chelsea to “temporarily suspend our sponsorship of the club, including the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice”.\n\nThe “off-field chaos” continued on Friday with “further news of unrest”, The Independent reported. Kit supplier Nike may also follow main sponsor Three in suspending its deal with the club. Nike agreed a 15-year, £900m deal with Chelsea in 2016 and should they walk away it would see the club miss out on £540m. Could the Nike deal be the “nail in Chelsea’s coffin?”, the Mail asked.\n\nA club in turmoil – but Tuchel is holding it together\n\nChelsea are facing the “harsh reality of life after Abramovich”, said Miguel Delaney in The Independent. “The sanctions against the owner not only impact the here and now of the football club but its future too.”\n\nAway from the financial woes there were positive results on the pitch for Chelsea’s senior teams on Thursday night. The men’s side beat Norwich 3-1 in the Premier League while the women’s team were 4-1 winners at West Ham in the WSL.\n\nThis may be “the crumbling of the Roman Empire”, but someone forgot to tell Chelsea manager Tuchel, James Robson said in the Evening Standard. Amid the “chaos, trauma and uncertainty”, the German is the man “holding it together in the eye of the storm”. Tuchel has emerged as the figurehead of a club that is in “desperate need of leadership”.\n\nRoman Abramovich has been Chelsea owner since 2003 (Image credit: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe glory years at Stamford Bridge\n\nSince Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, they have won “every trophy available”, Planet Football said. Before his ownership, the Blues had won “just one top-flight title and five domestic cups in the 98 years before his arrival”.\n\nThe Blues have lifted 18 major trophies in the 19 years since the Russian arrived at Stamford Bridge. And last month the reigning Champions League holders completed the set by beating Palmeiras 2-1 in the Fifa Club World Cup final. They did, however, miss out on a domestic trophy after losing on penalties to Liverpool in the League Cup final at Wembley.\n\nChelsea’s trophies under Abramovich leave their English rivals behind, The Independent said. Under “Roman’s empire”, the trophy cabinet at the Bridge includes: five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, two Champions League titles, two Europa Leagues, two Community Shields, one Uefa Super Cup and now the Club World Cup.\n\nHow Abramovich made his money\n\nWorth an estimated $12.3bn, according to Forbes’s real-time data, Abramovich’s interests include stakes in the steel giant Evraz and the Russian mining and smelting company Norilsk Nickel.\n\nAbramovich’s story involves a “remarkable rise”, the Daily Mail said. Born a “penniless orphan” in Saratov, south-west Russia, he was brought up by his grandparents from the age of four. He first started out in business “flogging plastic dolls on a market stall” after dropping out of college.\n\nThe majority of his fortune is “derived from proceeds collected selling previously Russian state-owned assets he acquired following the fall of the Soviet Union”, Bloomberg said. In 2005, he sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned Gazprom for $13bn, Forbes reported. Once Russia’s richest man, Abramovich’s net worth peaked at $23.5bn in 2008.\n\nAfter his British investor visa expired in April 2018, Abramovich, who is Jewish, was granted Israeli citizenship. Last year he also gained EU citizenship via a Portuguese passport. He qualified under Portugal’s naturalisation scheme for descendants of Sephardic Jews, The Guardian reported.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Mike Starling", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/957530/2022-2023-premier-league-predictions-odds-title-winners-relegation", "title": "2022-2023 Premier League season: predictions, odds, title winners ...", "text": "The 2022-2023 Premier League season gets underway a week earlier than the last campaign due to the Fifa World Cup taking place in November and December.\n\nMatchweek 16, the weekend of 12-13 November, will be the final one before the six-week World Cup break.

They could make third place.”\n\nFootball analyst Statman Dave has published his predictions. He probably has “a better shout at getting things right” compared to, say, “the bloke in the corner of your local crying into his pint, AKA, yours truly”, said Kobe Tong on GiveMeSport. In a YouTube video the statman predicts the entire Premier League table, with “frightening” Man City lifting the trophy ahead of Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal, who complete the top four.\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\n2. Relegation predictions: which teams will go down?\n\nDom Farrell on SportingNews.com picks Bournemouth and Fulham, “two of the three newboys”, to go down. So, “who of the established names” will join them? “If Southampton get into a spiral this season, that might be allowed to go too far downward before corrective measures are applied, meaning the Championship beckons.”\n\nFiveThirtyEight’s data revealed that Nottingham Forest have a 45% chance of being relegated this season. Bournemouth (44%) and Fulham (41%) are also expected to struggle.\n\nStatman Dave predicts that Everton will join Fulham and Bournemouth in the drop zone at the end of the season. “Consistently bad decisions” have left Everton in “serious trouble”, he said. “Their squad doesn’t have an identity and is filled with players whose best days are behind them.”\n\n3.

U.S. Soccer initially chose not to renew his contract after 2022, though it re-hired Berhalter the following June.\n\nAfter giving Berhalter five years in total at the helm, U.S. Soccer has ultimately decided to move in a different direction. All we can do for right now is speculate, but here are three candidates we think the federation could consider for the newly open USMNT head coach job.\n\nUSMNT coaching candidates\n\n1. Steve Cherundolo\n\nNote: A previous version of this story included B.J. Callaghan as a promising potential hire instead of Cherundolo. This story has been updated to reflect Callaghan's departure from the USMNT staff to take over as the head coach of MLS's Nashville SC.\n\nCherundolo is a top candidate U.S. Soccer could look to if they hope to stay with a coach who is already within the U.S. Soccer Federation umbrella.\n\nThe California native and former player for the USMNT took over as the Los Angeles FC head coach in 2022 after stops at a German U15 and U17 team, an assistant job at VfB Stuttgart and the USL. He found immediate success with Los Angeles.\n\nIn his first season, he broke an MLS record for most wins by a first-year head coach when he led LAFC to its Supporters' Shield-clinching 21st win. The record was originally set by one-time USMNT head coach (and his LAFC predecessor) Bob Bradley with the 1998 Chicago Fire.\n\nLos Angeles went on to win the MLS Cup in Cherundolo's first year and finished as runners-up in 2023. The team is currently tied for the lead in the league's Western Conference with 43 points and has a game (or two) in hand over the other top teams.\n\nCherundolo is a former member of the United States men's national team, an inductee to the National Soccer Hall of Fame and a successful MLS coach. He should be among the top candidates that U.S. Soccer considers to replace his former teammate as the USMNT head coach.\n\n2. Jim Curtin\n\nIf U.S. Soccer wants an \"in-house\" option that isn't Cherundolo, Curtin is one of its other best options. He has been the head coach of the Philadelphia Union (of the USSF-sanctioned MLS) since 2014 and has established himself as one of the league's best coaches.\n\nCurtin led the Union to three U.S. Open Cup finals (2014, 2015, 2018) and the MLS Cup final in 2022. He earned MLS Coach of the Year honors in 2020 and 2022, and has a 164-106-126 record with a +114 goal differential as the Union's head coach over his decade-long tenure.\n\nU.S. Soccer has a history of hiring successful MLS coaches as the head coach of the national team. The federation did it with Berhalter – formerly of the Columbus Crew – in 2018 and with Arena – once the head coach of D.C. United – in 1998. Curtin has one of the best track records of MLS head coaches right now and would fit the mold established by previous hiring practices.\n\n3. Hervé Renard\n\nRenard, a 55-year-old Frenchman and the head coach of France's national women's team, has something of a reputation for pushing national teams to a higher level.\n\nIn 2012, Renard led Zambia to its first victory in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON), a full 38 years after the team's first tournament appearance. Three years later, he led Ivory Coast to its second-ever AFCON win and first since 1992, becoming the first head coach to win an AFCON tournament with two different countries. In 2018, Renard got Morocco into the 2018 World Cup for their first time qualifying since 1998.\n\nTwo years ago, it was Renard who coached Saudi Arabia to a 2-1 World Cup-opening win over eventual champions Argentina.\n\nAttempts to draw Renard to the United States will be more difficult than either of the other candidates. In January of this year, Ivory Coast attempted to bring him back \"on loan\" from the French women's national team for this year's AFCON tournament, but the French Football Federation rejected their request.\n\nHonorable mention: Jürgen Klopp\n\nJürgen Klopp is never going to be the head coach of the United States men's national team, but it is a fun dream to have. An all-time great manager coming to coach up the American team after stepping down from his decade-long job at Liverpool? Of course that's an exciting concept.\n\nKlopp himself once likened his teams' style of play to heavy metal in that they are highly aggressive, with an inclination to immediately press opposing teams after losing possession. Using his tactics, Klopp's Liverpool teams over the last 10 years have been among the Premier League's most successful, winning the league in 2019-20, the FA Cup in 2021-22 and the EFL (formerly Carabao Cup) in 2021-22 and this year.\n\nThe German coaching mastermind is one of the best coaches in the world. Given his price point and recently stated desire to take a break from managing soccer teams, he's nothing but a pipe dream for USMNT fans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/football/jurgen-klopp-marco-reus-dortmund-liverpool-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Jürgen Klopp: Inside the mind of the Liverpool manager – Marco ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe German phrase ‘Luftschlösser bauen’ literally translates as ‘building castles in the air,’ a whimsical image indicative of the idiom’s meaning – daydreaming about pipedreams.\n\nThis season, ‘Luftschlösser bauen’ is an idea that might resonate with many Liverpool fans.\n\nBack in January, Liverpool was a seemingly insurmountable 14 points behind Manchester City in the Premier League; had dispatched Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the FA Cup; was preparing for its round of 16 clash against Inter Milan in the Champions League; and had just drawn 0-0 with Arsenal in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semifinal.\n\nWinning all four trophies appeared to be a pipedream barely worth daydreaming about.\n\nSubsequently the Reds have closed the gap to City in the title race and navigated every cup knockout round to keep their hopes of an unprecedented quadruple mathematically still alive, although a recent draw against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League dealt their title hopes a severe blow.\n\nFor Liverpool to win the Premier League, it now needs City to slip up in its last two games. That would seem unlikely given City has won its previous two games 5-0 and 5-1.\n\nThe manager constructing the foundations of this remarkable season is, of course, Jürgen Klopp, who recently extended his contract with Liverpool.\n\nBefore his arrival at Liverpool, the German managed Borussia Dortmund for seven seasons, guiding the club to a Bundesliga title in 2011 as well as a league and cup double in 2012. Under Klopp, Dortmund also reached a Champions League final.\n\nKlopp's Liverpool has won the Carabao Cup, is mathematically in contention for the Premier League, and will play in the FA Cup and Champions League finals. Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\n“Jürgen is a special person,” Dortmund’s captain Marco Reus tells CNN Senior Sport Analyst Darren Lewis. “I remember when I moved to Dortmund and had the first conversation with him. When he walks into the room, there’s just something in the air.”\n\n“He’s charismatic, he’s got a lot of energy, and he’s just a good guy to just talk to privately about other things, not just football.”\n\nReus’ association with Klopp stretches back to 2012, when Klopp – then Dortmund coach – persuaded him to return to the club where he had been a youth player.\n\nIn his first season under Klopp following his move from Borussia Mönchengladbach, Reus contributed 19 goals and 16 assists in 49 appearances as Dortmund reached the Champions League final where it lost 2-1 to rivals Bayern Munich.\n\nReus has become a talismanic figure for Dortmund. Alex Gottschalk/vi/DeFodi Images/Getty Images\n\n“He’s definitely one of the best coaches in the world because otherwise you don’t stay at the top for so long,” Reus says. “I hope for him that he manages to do it (quadruple) this year and I wouldn’t put it past him.”\n\n‘Energy he brings every day’\n\nWhen Klopp arrived at Dortmund in 2008, the club had just endured its worst season in 20 years, finishing 13th in the Bundesliga.\n\nBy recruiting smartly – players such as Robert Lewandowski and Jakub Błaszczykowski were signed relatively cheaply – and implementing his now familiar tactic of ‘gegenpress’ – whereby the team immediately try to win back possession after losing it – Klopp built a title-winning side in three years.\n\n“Before he came, things weren’t looking so rosy here and he took the club to another level,” Reus recalls.\n\n“Of course, that had a lot to do with him and the team at the time as well.”\n\n“You can’t put that into words because it’s not just one word. It’s still, I would say, this energy, willingness to suffer every day and to get the maximum out of it.”\n\n“And, of course, he has had a lot of experiences in the last few years when he was here and then also in the first years at Liverpool, which has helped him a lot.”\n\nKlopp managed Dortmund for seven seasons. Lars Baron/Bongarts/Getty Images\n\nSimilarly, at Liverpool, the success now enjoyed by the team did not immediately materialize.\n\nIt took Klopp’s charges four years to win the Champions League, and another year to win the Premier League title.\n\n“He’s been doing a great job for years both here and in Liverpool,” says Reus. “How he’s built the team, how he’s built the club, both here and in Liverpool, is immense. That energy that he brings every day, I think, you can only take your hat off to him.”\n\nOn Saturday, Liverpool play Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley and then Real Madrid in the Champions League final on May 28 in Paris.\n\nFor the time being the pipedream – the idea of ‘building castles in the air’ – is still attainable.", "authors": ["Darren Lewis Issy Ronald", "Darren Lewis", "Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/962058/fairytale-wiegman-lionesses-womens-world-cup-final", "title": "'Fairytale' for Wiegman as Lionesses roar into first Women's World ...", "text": "England’s Lionesses, the reigning European champions, will play in their first ever Fifa Women’s World Cup final against Spain on Sunday after defeating co-hosts Australia 3-1 in today’s semi-final clash at Stadium Australia.\n\nIt was a “historic evening” in Sydney, said Emma Sanders on BBC Sport, as goals from Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp and Alessia Russo “spoiled” the Australian “party”.

But despite Kerr’s “stunning” strike “the ride ends here” for the Matildas, said Vince Rugari in the Sydney Morning Herald, as their “history-making, record-breaking, nation-changing” World Cup run was “stopped in its tracks by the old enemy”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Every single game at this World Cup “has been of the highest level”, so “we have to be ready”, she added, “but we’ve been dreaming since we were little girls, so we’re excited”.\n\nOne “headache” – a good one – is that England will have Lauren James available for Sunday’s final after her suspension. Will she come straight back into the starting XI, asked former England and Arsenal defender Alex Scott on BBC One. Ella Toone is “right there” and it’s a “great headache” for Wiegman to have, she added. “I would start with the same 11” against Spain and “have someone like Lauren James come on”.\n\nWiegman has ‘a golden touch’\n\nThe semi-final victory means that Wiegman has now become the “first coach to guide two different countries to a Women’s World Cup final”, said AFP. She took her native Netherlands to the 2019 “showpiece match”, where they were defeated 2-0 by the United States. Having the chance as a coach or a player to make it to two finals is “really special”, Wiegman said. “I never take anything for granted, but it’s like I’m living in a fairytale or something.”\n\nIn “trying to capture” just “how good a manager” Wiegman is, said Luke Edwards in The Telegraph, it’s hard not to make comparisons between men’s and women’s football. But make no mistake, after guiding England to their first Women’s World Cup final, just a year after leading them to glory at the Euros, Wiegman’s “genius” is “not up for debate”. She has shown that she has “a golden touch”, first with her native Netherlands and now with England. Pep Guardiola is the “outstanding manager of his generation” in men’s football, but Wiegman is “probably the best of hers, too”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe win over Australia caps a “sensational” two years under Wiegman, said Sanders on BBC Sport.

Kay Ivey on Friday reallocated $12.3 million of the state’s coronavirus relief funds to hire travel nurses to help hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The Republican governor announced the move as the state continues to see a surge in virus cases, straining hospital resources and staff. “I’m pleased to see more folks getting vaccinated, but we are still in the thick of COVID-19 and our hospitals are overwhelmed,” Ivey said in a statement. “The money is coming from the state’s share of CARES Act funds. Until our vaccination rates rise and our COVID-19 hospitalization rates fall, we will need the extra support these nurses provide.” The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a nurse staffing crisis, sending U.S. hospitals into a competition for travel nurses and staff to handle the crush of patients this summer. Hospitals need more staff to handle the patient loads, while some nurses have left because they are exhausted, taken lucrative travel jobs or are out sick because they themselves are sick with COVID-19. Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery, like hospitals across the country, has turned to travel staff to fill positions. “It’s a national arms race for clinical talent,” CEO Peter Selman, said. He said the hospital is paying up to $155 an hour to national staffing firms.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents in Wrangell and Petersburg now have the ability to text 911 for help when calling isn’t an option. “It’s been working out excellent,” Petersburg Police Department Chief James Kerr said. “It’s designed for the hearing impaired or domestic violence situations. If you can’t talk to the dispatch but you need help, you can text.” A third-party provider helped implement the technology with the two police departments. “One of the really big benefits I see with this is for search and rescue,” Kerr said, noting Alaska’s rugged terrain can make it difficult to get a call signal. “But you can send a text through. It gives us GPS coordinates and everything else.” The Juneau Police Department is also investigating a similar system, Lt. Krag Campbell said in an email to the Juneau Empire. He noted texting 911 could be useful in active shooter situations or other times when speaking into the phone would put a caller at risk, betraying their position. Currently, the option is only available to AT&T and GCI customers, Kerr said. Texters using other providers get a message that the service is not available. No one has texted police yet with it, other than kids trying to play a prank. But the text sent to emergency services also comes with the texter’s location, allowing police to arrive at the kids’ location and caution them not to misuse the service.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The father of an elementary school student was arrested after he and two other men showed up to the campus with zip ties, threatening to make a “citizen’s arrest” on the principal over a coronavirus quarantine, school officials said Friday. Diane Vargo, principal of Mesquite Elementary School in Tucson, said the parent came to her office Thursday with his son in tow. The father was upset the child would have to isolate and miss a school field trip because of possible exposure to someone with COVID-19. She said two other men also “barged in.” One was carrying “military, large, black zip ties and standing in my doorway.” Vargo said she tried to deescalate the situation while explaining the school had to follow county health protocols. “I felt violated that they were in my office claiming I was breaking the law and they were going to arrest me,” a visibly shaken Vargo said in a video statement released by the Vail Unified School District. “Two of the men weren’t parents at our school, so I felt threatened.” In a video posted on social media, Vargo can be heard calmly asking them to leave. One of them replies they aren’t leaving because they’re not going to let her control the situation. The principal called Tucson police. School officials said the man arrested was the father. Vargo said they are pursuing charges against the other two men.\n\nArkansas\n\nParis: The Frontier’s Day festival returns to town Oct.2. Tonya Fletcher, executive director of the Paris Area Chamber of Commerce and organizer of the festival, described Frontier’s Day as “where yesterday meets today for today.” This year marks the 43rd year Paris has celebrated Frontier’s Day. Typically, the festival draws 3,000 to 4,000 people each year, but Fletcher said it is hard to say how many people the pandemic will keep at home. “I still think we’ll have a good crowd,” she said, allowing that it will likely be a smaller gathering than in the past. Frontier’s Day will officially begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m., but Paris will celebrate its monthly “First Fridays” music night the evening prior, wrapping at 11 p.m. For the festival, the city will block off three sides of the square, only leaving Highway 22 open to traffic. Frontier’s Day has fun activities lined up for all ages, Fletcher said. Children can roam the free pumpkin patch, where they can pick out pumpkins to decorate. There will be live music, and the day will begin with a parade and end with a pageant. During opening ceremonies, area historian Curtis Varnell will discuss the legacy of the Paris Courthouse, which turned 150 this year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The mysterious deaths of a Northern California family of hikers and their dog have led federal officials to close 28 miles along the Merced River, where high levels of toxic algae were detected. The Bureau of Land Management closed campgrounds and recreation areas along the river, between the towns of Briceburg and Bagby, on Friday after receiving test results of water samples downstream from where the family died. Algal blooms can form in waterways that are shallow and warm. “These algal blooms can produce toxins that can make people and pets extremely sick,” Elizabeth Meyer-Shields, a BLM field manager, said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor for the algae’s presence and look forward to when the public can safely recreate in the Merced River.” The bodies of John Gerrish, his wife, Ellen Chung, their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and their dog were found Aug. 17 on a hiking trail close to the river in the Sierra National Forest. A family friend had reported them missing. A cause of death has not been determined, and investigators are considering whether toxic algal blooms or other hazards may have contributed to the deaths. Toxicology reports are still pending, and investigators have ruled out any weapons being used or dangerous gases from a mine along the trail.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission has proposed a congressional map that would create a new swing seat in the northern Denver suburbs and lump conservative firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert into a Boulder-based, solidly Democratic seat currently held by liberal Rep. Joe Neguse. The proposal from the commission staff Friday would rearrange the political geography as part of the once-a-decade redistricting process. It’s the first test of the commission model approved by voters in 2018. The map will be followed by a series of hearings, along with a map of state legislative districts. Both may change significantly in the weeks to come as the commission races to meet an end-of-the-month deadline to approve maps. The congressional map keeps the four Democratic seats relatively safe, as well as preserving three as solidly Republican. It would add a new swing seat running from Adams County to Greeley that voted Democratic by 1.9 percentage points in last year’s Senate election. That could make the final breakdown of the state’s congressional districts 4-4, an underwhelming split for Democrats in a state they won by 13 points in last year’s presidential election. Still, Democrats see the map as an improvement over the initial map, which had a similar partisan division.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing homes will once again be allowed to hire temporary nursing aides as they deal with staffing shortages during the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday signed an executive order that revives the state’s nurses aides program that was used last year. Under the program, the temporary workers will be allowed to provide nursing-related services – but nothing that requires a license. The governor’s office said the idea is to use those aides to help serve residents who do not have COVID-19, allowing permanent staff to focus on patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The measure also will assure adequate staffing at long-term care facilities, which have struggled with hiring and retaining workers, the governor’s office said. Connecticut recorded 111 cases of COVID-19 among nursing home patients and 94 cases among staff between Aug. 18 and Aug. 31, according to the state Department of Health. There were 16 patient deaths related to the coronavirus during that time and none among staff. The governor on Friday also extended to Sept. 27 the deadline for nursing home workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Numerous Walgreens pharmacies across the state have been unable to process prescriptions because of flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The internet services vendor for the stores was affected by the historic flooding Thursday, bringing delays for people receiving vital medications. Walgreens has apologized for the inconvenience. The company said it is working to address the issues that have caused the delays. “Our internet services vendor is currently working to fully restore their operations as a result of the storms in the Northeast, which has resulted in some technical difficulties causing longer than normal wait times in several of our stores,” a Walgreens spokesperson said in an email over the weekend. “I ended up at the urgent care on Friday because my throat was starting to close due to an allergic reaction I had and couldn’t get my meds in time,” one person commented on a Facebook post about the issue from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. “This is an issue and delay of care that represent lives at risk.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new art exhibit in the nation’s capital is remembering the twin towers, just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The show opened Saturday at the National Building Museum and features more than 50 years of photos of the World Trade Center, WUSA-TV reports. The images, all captured by photographer Camilo Jose Vergara, chart the history of the iconic towers from their construction to the attack that brought them down and what came next. “I closely followed the construction of the towers, watching heavy trucks bring in steel or haul away dirt amid the noise of jackhammers and clanging metal,” Vergara wrote in an essay accompanying the photographs. “As they rose to become the tallest buildings in the world, I regarded them as a wild expression of mistaken priorities in a troubled time. “Eventually, my early resentment faded, and I grew to see them as great human creations. As I traveled farther away to photograph the towers from distant boroughs, they seemed to lose their solidity and become mysterious, fantastic, and alluring.” Chrysanthe Broikos, a consulting curator at the National Building Museum, said she hopes the exhibit inspires visitors to think about what the towers and those who worked there meant to the world, as well as how the world responded when they fell.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: The store that inspired Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “The Ballad of Curtis Loew” has been demolished. Jacksonville’s Woodcrest Grocery Building, where Ronnie Van Zant allegedly met “the finest picker to ever play the blues,” was torn down late last month. The abandoned store was a hangout for generations of kids. The song, written by Van Zant and Allen Collins, tells the story of a young boy who collected bottles to raise money so the old man who hung out at the corner store could play his dobro. Curtis Loew was fictional, but the store was real. It was known as Claude’s in the late ’50s and early ’60s and was right down the street from the house where Van Zant was raised. Scott Hill, who grew up in the neighborhood, said fans started dropping by the site last week to grab cinder blocks as souvenirs after hearing about the demolition. Gene Odom, who wrote a book about the band and leads tours of Lynyrd Skynyrd landmarks for fans, said the building has been vacant for decades. The building started collapsing during the demolition of nearby trailers and had to be taken down. A real estate group said a residential home will be built there. The band is still touring but pulled out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame concert last month after guitarist Rickey Medlocke tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morehouse College announced Friday that it has canceled this year’s homecoming festivities due to a surge of COVID-19. Events were scheduled to occur Oct. 10-17 and will not be rescheduled. The Oct. 16 football game against Fort Valley State University will still be played but without the “homecoming” designation and with fewer tickets available to the game to implement social distancing. University officials said they made the decision last week as Georgia broke its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations. “The state has the sixth-highest per capita infection rate in the nation, and an unprecedented number of young people have become ill with the virus,” Morehouse President David Thomas said. “Given the circumstances, a massive in-person gathering on our campus presents a public health risk to our students which is impossible to ignore.” Thomas said nearly 100% of the students and employees on campus have met the school’s vaccination requirement. With “aggressive” masking requirements and other safety protocols, Morehouse has limited the spread of the coronavirus on campus, he said. But he had to consider the broader community. “Keeping our students safe is our top priority,” he said. In place of homecoming, the school will host a students-only fall festival.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: President Joe Biden’s appointment of two Native Hawaiians to the U.S. Department of the Interior could influence federal policy for the state’s Indigenous people and other Pacific Islanders. Summer Sylva, who is currently head of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, was appointed last week as senior adviser for Native Hawaiian affairs. Keone Nakoa, the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, has been appointed deputy assistant secretary for insular and international affairs. The positions carry a great deal of influence over federal policy involving Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Sylva will report directly to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to lead the agency. “She’s in a critical role to be in the secretary’s inner circle,” said Esther Kia’aina, a Honolulu City councilwoman who led the department’s Office of Insular Affairs under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Sylva’s appointment signals the agency’s desire to tackle Native Hawaiian issues, including homelands and self-governance, Kia’aina said. Nakoa will be serving in an office that oversees the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are boosting pay and offering bonuses to try to attract and maintain correctional officers. About 24% of correctional officer positions at the Idaho Department of Correction were vacant last month, including 190 vacancies at the agency’s prisons in Kuna, south of Boise. “Attracting and hiring the right people to our security ranks is only one part of the equation,” Jeff Ray, the department’s public information officer, told the Idaho Press. “We’re putting an equal amount of emphasis on retaining the staff who have and continue to admirably serve the people of Idaho.” New correctional officers will receive $19 an hour, up from the previous $16.75. New hires will also get $1,500 bonuses and be eligible for $1,500 yearly retention bonuses during their first five years. Current employees will see hourly raises ranging from $0.75 for wardens to $2.25 for correctional officers starting Sept. 5. Also, on Oct. 15, all current correctional officers will receive a one-time retention bonus of $1,500. Correctional officers often must work mandatory 16-hour shifts because there aren’t enough workers. Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said the pay Idaho offers correctional workers isn’t competitive with surrounding states, such as an Oregon prison paying new correctional officers $22.64 an hour.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Years in the making, the visitor center and state historic site grounds at the Pullman National Monument have officially opened to the public. Chicago’s first national monument marks the site where Pullman passenger railroad cars were built. Employees lived nearby in the neighborhood on the city’s South Side. The sprawling Pullman company factory closed in 1982. The National Park Services’ visitor center features exhibits on worker demonstrations that helped plant the seeds of the modern labor movement. For instance, Black railroad workers won a significant labor agreement in the 1930s that helped lead to worker protections. Robert Bushwaller, a Historic Pullman Foundation board member, said he was encouraged by the crowd Saturday. Some drove vintage cars to mark the opening day during the Labor Day weekend. “The public support has been better than expected,” Bushwaller told the Chicago Sun-Times. “The turnout is tremendous. They remember so much from how it used to be and want to see if it still tasted that way, and they’ve been satisfied.” Former President Barack Obama designated the factory and surrounding area a national monument in 2015. Restoration and revitalization at the site has been ongoing for years.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb issued seven pardons to convicted criminals during his first year in office but hasn’t granted any more pardons in the past 31/ 2 years, with officials saying the number of applications for the governor to clear criminal records has declined to a trickle, The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette reports. Indiana’s expansive expungement law – first passed by the Legislature in 2013 – has meant fewer people seeking pardons, as that process of asking a judge to clear past convictions is both simpler and more private, said Charles Miller, vice chairman of the Indiana Parole Board. “Quite frankly, I knew the numbers were way down, but even I was shocked by just how low they were,” Miller said. “Speaking personally, pardons are the best part of my job, as you get to the good things people accomplish after what is usually just an unfortunate mistake.” The pardons Holcomb issued in 2017 were largely holdovers from when Mike Pence was governor. The most prominent case was that of Keith Cooper, whose pardon request over his conviction for a 1996 robbery in Elkhart languished under Pence even as the state parole board, the local prosecutor and witnesses supported his exoneration.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa’s graduate student workers union is calling for stronger on-campus mitigation protocols against the coronavirus. The union members sent a list of demands to the UIowa administration and state’s Board of Regents in a letter dated Sept. 1 and followed that up Thursday morning with a “die-in” protest on the Pentacrest to draw attention to their plea. Demands include more remote work options, a mask mandate inside campus buildings, and required COVID-19 vaccinations or mandatory weekly virus testing of unvaccinated people, none of which are currently in place. The union represents about 250 members and 1,800 in the collective bargaining unit. Members hold a unique position at the university, as they are there not only to learn but to teach classes. Members of the organization approved the list of demands before it was sent out. “We are very concerned for our health and safety this fall,” the letter said. “We are deeply disturbed by the obligation we face to share spaces with others who may be putting us at risk, or whom we may be placing in danger, because of inconsistent vaccination and the optional status of mask wearing and social distancing on campus.” About two dozen people gathered on campus at 10 a.m. Thursday for the “die-in.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has placed 87 of the state’s 105 counties under a drought watch or warning. Kelly said Thursday that most of the state has been in drought or abnormally dry conditions for several weeks, and she encouraged residents to do what the can to minimize the risk of fire. Fourteen counties were placed under a drought warning and 73 under a watch. The 18 counties not included in the declaration are all in southeast Kansas. The action was recommended by Connie Owen, director of the Kansas Water Office and chairwoman of the Governor’s Drought Response Team. Kelly said in a statement that while some areas have had normal or higher amounts of rain so far this year, counties in the northwest, central and south-central have received less than 60% of their normal precipitation. Owen said future outlooks call for the drought-like conditions to continue into the fall, particularly in the northwest counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tucked into the pandemic-heavy agenda for a special legislative session is a request to strengthen Kentucky’s negotiating hand in trying to reel in mega-sized economic development projects. Gov. Andy Beshear said Saturday that he will ask the GOP-led Legislature to give the state’s recruiting team more flexibility in offering incentives for investment projects topping $2 billion. “As we sit here today, we have at least five potential projects that would be that size,” Beshear told reporters. “In other words, the largest in our commonwealth’s history.” The Democratic governor announced Saturday that he’s calling lawmakers back to the statehouse for a special session that begins Tuesday and will be dominated by coronavirus-related issues. After winning a legal battle against Beshear, lawmakers will take the lead in crafting policies to respond to a recent surge of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, fueled by the delta variant of the virus. But Beshear is hoping the work on economic development policy helps put the state at the front of the pack in trying to land $2 billion-plus projects. Such a massive development would be certain to create loads of new jobs, with plenty of spin-off opportunities for even more job growth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families looking for their loved ones who evacuated from Hurricane Ida to a state shelter are getting help from the state. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services on Saturday launched “Connect,” a tool that will help families connect with each other. The number to call is 225-342-2727. Families can also fill out a form online to reach out to loved ones who may be in state-run shelter. The department said people will be required to provide the name, address and date of birth, if known, of the person they’re trying to find, as well as their name and contact information. DCFS will then determine whether the person is in one of the state’s congregate shelters and, if so, pass along the caller’s message. Individuals looking for loved ones evacuated from one of seven nursing homes linked to an evacuation warehouse site in Tangipahoa Parish should call 211, the department said.\n\nMaine\n\nOxford: The state is continuing to try to slow the spread of the invasive emerald ash borer with new restrictions. The Maine Forest Service has issued an emergency order preventing the movement of ash trees and products from areas including Norway, Oxford and Lovell in Oxford County. The order limits the movement of ash trees for planting and ash tree products such as logs, pulpwood, lumber and firewood from areas that are considered likely to harbor the pest. The new areas are in addition to areas already covered by a quarantine. The state’s ban on untreated firewood from outside Maine remains in effect as another way of preventing the pest’s spread.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Nursing homes in the state are seeing another rise in coronavirus cases, leading facilities to suspend visits from loved ones. The Washington Post reports the halt to visitations has led to a new wave of despair in facilities that were struck hard by COVID-19. The impact of loneliness on the health of the elderly has been extreme. Maryland has 227 nursing homes. Gov. Larry Hogan had ordered that all nursing home employees receive at least one vaccine dose by last week. Facilities that fail to comply will be subject to fines. The percentage of employees who have received a vaccine dose is 82%. At the same time, nearly 90% of all nursing home residents have had at least one vaccine dose, and 86.1% are fully inoculated. Meanwhile, outbreaks are rising in Maryland’s nursing homes. Outbreaks are defined by the federal government as at least one COVID-19 case. In July, fewer than 10 facilities had an outbreak. But by early August, there were 33. On Friday, there were 92.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: What started as a project to restore the gravestones of three Black men and women who played a role in the abolitionist movement on the North Shore is evolving into a larger effort to find and restore the final resting places for other African American families, officials said. In Salem’s Howard Street Cemetery, two of the stones marking the burial sites of Venus Chew, Prince Farmer and Samuel Payne, all of whom died in the 1850s, are broken into pieces, The Salem News reports. The graves to be restored are in what Rachel Meyer, a stone conservator with Epoch Preservation, described as a corner of the cemetery, effectively segregated from the main cemetery. They occupy a square piece of land the city donated to expand the cemetery to bury African Americans. The three stones in question have fallen over in time and were sinking into the ground when an area resident contacted Meyer about fixing them. Doreen Wade, president of Salem United, said she’s enthusiastically behind the project because of what it represents – more than just repairing fragmented gravestones, it’s repairing a fragmented story of Salem’s past.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlat Rock: A Ford plant is the source of benzene vapor in sewers that forced the evacuation of 10 homes and a school in the Detroit suburb of Flat Rock, according to state and company officials. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy confirmed Friday that the source of the flammable vapor is a fuel leak at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant. “HAZMAT technicians will begin mitigating flammable vapors in the municipal sanitary system by injecting fire suppressant foam. These activities will take place at various locations where levels of benzene have been detected in a 4-square-mile perimeter of Flat Rock,” the department said. Ford on Wednesday discovered “what originally looked to be a relatively small leak in a pipe that carries gasoline used to fuel vehicles built at the plant,” said Bob Holycross, Ford’s vice president of sustainability, environment and safety engineering. But on Friday, the company “determined that the scale of the fuel leak was much larger and that Ford is the likely source of the problem in Flat Rock, for which we apologize,” he said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in an email late Friday that an estimated 1,000 to 3,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline spilled into the sewers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: Four congressional Democrats who are part of the progressive “Squad” and want President Joe Biden to stop construction of the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline traveled to the shores of the Mississippi River to make their plea. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan spent the holiday weekend visiting Bemidji and other parts of northern Minnesota to speak with members of Indigenous communities and others who have been protesting the project. Line 3 starts in Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing Minnesota en route to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The 337-mile line in Minnesota is the last step in replacing the deteriorating pipeline that was built in the 1960s. “We have been encouraged by Joe Biden’s boldness so far,” Omar said, referencing his January decision to cancel a border-crossing permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have carried oil from Canada to Nebraska. “Now we have another chance to reject a moving pipeline. We hope you will act.” Minnesota Republican legislators condemned the visit, which they said “will only serve to incite the obstructionists,” the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nMoney: A historical marker describing the events leading up to the killing of Emmett Till was knocked down just days after the 66th anniversary of his death. The black Mississippi Freedom Trail marker with gold writing typically stands in front of the remains of Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, where, in 1955, the Black 14-year-old was accused of whistling at a white woman. Till was later kidnapped, beaten and killed. The sign is part of the Mississippi Freedom Trail, a route dedicated to honoring people and places in the state that had a significant role in the civil rights movement. Allan Hammons, president of Hammons and Associates, which manages the Freedom Trail, said a large vehicle like a tractor-trailer likely accidently knocked the marker from its post. The area is under construction, and Hammons suspects the driver of the vehicle may have not even realized they hit the sign. The marker was picked up by workers with the LeFlore County road department and stored in a storage facility until Hammons can inspect it. The Emmett Till Interpretive Center tweeted Thursday that it believes someone ran the sign down with a vehicle and removed it. The sign details how Till stopped by the store for candy before his abduction and death.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft is urging the General Assembly to prohibit local election workers from helping absentee voters correct mistakes, a move that would mean some votes aren’t counted. “We would like to see legislation that does not allow for curing of absentee ballots,” Deputy Secretary of State Trish Vincent told the House Elections Committee last week. “Curing” is a common term for fixing errors. The Kansas City Star reports the request adds to a growing list of measures advanced by Republicans to alter the state’s elections, including restoring a photo ID requirement and making it harder to amend the state constitution through voter-initiated ballot measures. Some similar proposals failed this year but could be considered again in the 2022 session. During the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Missouri lawmakers temporarily made all voters eligible to cast a ballot by mail but required most to have their ballot notarized. Missouri previously required an excuse for voting absentee. More than 28% of Missouri voters cast ballots by mail in November, up from 8% in 2018. “I don’t think we’re going to go back to the mail-in like we did during COVID,” said Republican Rep. Dan Shaul of Imperial, chairman of the House Elections Committee.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Wildlife workers at Glacier National Park trapped and killed a black bear that officials said became a public safety risk after it lingered around a campground. The bear took apples from an open vehicle trunk while visitors were nearby at the Many Glacier Campground, officials said. It kept returning despite park staff attempts to scare it away. It was later trapped near a housing area in a large trap made out of a culvert and was euthanized Thursday. The female bear was about 4 years old and 120 pounds, park officials said. It’s believed to be the same bear that had been approaching people near Glacier’s Grinnell Lake the week prior, prompting the closure of a trail. A necropsy showed the animal had been in healthy condition. But officials said it had become used to getting human food and was unlikely to break the habit. They said it could not be relocated due to safety concerns.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State education officials halted their plans Friday for new health education standards after criticism from some parents and conservative family-values groups that the content was sexually inappropriate. The State Board of Education voted 5-1 to indefinitely postpone the standards, with one member abstaining, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The standards were nonbinding recommendations, so local schools could simply have ignored them, but opponents still railed against the proposal. The new resolution the board passed says members will determine an appropriate time to address health education standards after considering the status of the pandemic and the needs of local children, schools and communities. Under board rules, any member can attempt to revive the process with support from the majority. The first draft released in March faced strong opposition, as did a second draft released in July, despite removal of many topics opponents disliked. The initial draft called for teaching children as young as first grade about gender identity and gender stereotypes and older children about homophobia, transphobia, and vaginal, oral and anal sex. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts blasted the draft, saying it was developed with input from activists and promoted “gender ideology.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has denied tribal leaders’ bid to temporarily block digging for an archaeological study required before construction can begin for a lithium mine on what they say is sacred land where their ancestors were massacred more than century ago. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du refused three tribes’ request for a preliminary injunction blocking the trenching planned to collect samples near the Oregon state line at the site of the largest known lithium deposit in the United States. The tribes say their ancestors were massacred in the late 1800s at the proposed Thacker Pass site. Du emphasized in the ruling late Friday in Reno that she has pledged to hear and rule on the merits of the case before Lithium Nevada Corp. hopes to begin construction early next year on the mine the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved in January. She rejected a similar request in July for a preliminary injunction sought by environmentalists who claim the digging would destroy critical habitat for greater sage grouse. Du said Friday that she was “not unpersuaded by the tribes’ broader equitable and historical arguments.” But she said that there was no evidence the bureau acted unreasonably, nor that the mine was planned on an actual massacre site, and the agency has contingency plans if “human remains are unexpectedly discovered.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu was released from the hospital Saturday after tests confirmed Friday that a bleeding ulcer was the cause of his flu-like symptoms. The Republican will continue to recuperate at home, according to a statement from his office. “New Hampshire is blessed with amazing health care staff and generous blood donors,” Sununu said in the statement. “Valerie and I can’t thank them enough and are grateful for everyone’s prayers and positive outreach.” Sununu was admitted to Portsmouth Hospital on Friday after experiencing the flu-like symptoms since Wednesday. He had tested negative three times for the coronavirus. Sununu said Wednesday that he tested negative, hours after his office said he wasn’t feeling well, postponed a meeting and began isolating. Sununu, 46, is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. He received the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine April 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMullica Hill: One of the most intense tornadoes recorded in New Jersey history all but demolished the state’s largest dairy farm. When Marianne and Wally Eachus, the owners of Wellacrest Farms, came out of their basement along with other family on their homestead, they saw that two of their massive grain silos had toppled over. Some barns were completely reduced to concrete, with roofs ripped off others, equipment demolished and uprooted trees crashed into the old farmhouse. “There was just metal, wood, debris, everywhere,” Marianne Eachus said. Hundreds of cows were trapped under collapsed barns. Thirteen have died; a couple dozen more suffered injuries. A crew was milking when the twister ripped through and had only seconds to hide and hold on. They saw several cows swallowed by the funnel. Up to 100 cows were still missing Monday. Somehow, there were no more deaths on the dairy farm from the EF3 tornado spawned by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. But the storm produced historic rain and massive flooding. Wellacrest Farms produces more than 17 million pounds of milk annually and works with other farmers to share and sell crops. There are 1,400 cows on the property. In the days after the destruction, the Eachus family has seen an outpouring of support and help, both physical and financial.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A group of Democrats in the state House has outlined a package of criminal justice bills intended to combat crime that includes penalties for failing to safely store guns, enhanced pay for police, and changes in the pretrial supervision and bail system. A record-setting number of homicides in Albuquerque this year is spurring concerns about violent crime and shortcomings of the police and justice system. In a statement Thursday, 17 House Democrats announced a lengthy list of goals for the next regular legislative session in January. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said she’ll put criminal justice initiatives on the agenda for the 30-day session that is confined to budget negotiations and a few additional governor-picked topics. Republican lawmakers are asking the Legislature to reconsider a long list of their recent crime bills that were rejected. House Democrats listed legislative goals in 16 bullet points. To address gun violence, the legislators want to place new restrictions on high-capacity magazines and establish an office of gun violence prevention. Enhanced penalties are part of the plan. Democrats want a longer statute of limitations on second-degree murder charges and tougher sanctions. A crackdown is proposed on property damage in the theft of copper and catalytic converters in automobiles.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A staff shortage at Rikers Island left two units without corrections officers for more than 24 hours last Tuesday and Wednesday, a prisoner reported, and a city oversight board said ongoing personnel problems factored in a wave of suicides in the jails since December. Two Rikers units were without corrections officers through at least through noon Wednesday, leaving inmates in the strange position of helping other inmates get to court transport and video conferences, said Terrence Ferguson, the hip-hop artist known as 2 Milly. “We are really running the dorm by ourselves. I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Ferguson, who is serving a sentence for gun possession. He said Wednesday that there had been no officer on his floor since 6 a.m. Tuesday. “I’ve been answering the phones,” he said. The two unmanned units together house about 80 prisoners. Department of Correction officials declined comment on whether parts of Rikers have gone unguarded for longer than 24 hours. But the department has acknowledged a personnel shortage. Officials have said that in July, about 3,500 of Rikers’ 8,500 officers either called in sick or were medically exempt from working with detainees. Another 2,300 just didn’t come in to work at some point. Rikers’ population has roughly doubled since July 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A gay substitute teacher was wrongfully fired by a Roman Catholic school after he announced in 2014 on social media that he was going to marry his longtime partner, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn ruled Friday that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Charlotte violated Lonnie Billard’s federal protections against against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Cogburn granted summary judgment to Billard and said a trial must still be held to determine appropriate relief for him. “After all this time, I have a sense of relief and a sense of vindication. I wish I could have remained teaching all this time,” Billard said in a statement released Friday by the ACLU, which represented him in court. “Today’s decision validates that I did nothing wrong by being a gay man.” Billard taught English and drama full time at the school for more than a decade, earning its Teacher of the Year award in 2012. He then transitioned to a role as a regular substitute, according to his 2017 lawsuit. The defendants said they fired Billard not because he was gay but because “he engaged in ‘advocacy’ that went against the Catholic Church’s beliefs” when he publicly announced his engagement to another man, the ruling said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The idea to split the state’s legislative districts in half for House seats hasn’t gained traction with lawmakers, but some voters groups say the concept would benefit tribal nations that don’t have enough residents to stand alone as legislative districts. The Legislature’s Redistricting Committee meets Wednesday in Fargo as the state continues to examine redrawing legislative districts. Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand Forks, who has served on redistricting committees since 1981, told the Bismarck Tribune splitting legislative districts would have to take into account tribal nations, and “that would make a difference according to how the Department of Justice views taking care of minority populations ... so we need to explore that, and it may happen,” Holmberg said. North Dakota Native Vote Executive Director Nicole Donaghy said subdistricts would allow “people on reservations to elect candidates of their choice.” She said in the past decade there have been elections encompassing the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in which “we’ve had several Native Americans run for county commission, run for a legislative seat for that district, and they were not able to be elected because of the dilution of the populations with the non-Native population that surrounds the reservation.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Butler County judge has ruled that West Chester Hospital cannot be compelled to administer ivermectin to a COVID-19 patient. Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Oster Jr. issued the ruling Monday morning as a 14-day temporary injunction granted by another judge expired. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic treatment commonly used for livestock and recommended by the FDA to treat “infections caused by some parasitic worms” in humans, as well as head lice and rosacea. Interest in the drug as a COVID-19 treatment has spiked, fueled by endorsements from allies of former President Donald Trump and some Fox News personalities. While some studies are underway, none of the major medical organizations recommend the drug as a treatment for COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned that reports of poisoning related to ivermectin have increased threefold this year. The judge said it is “impossible not to feel sympathetic” for Julie Smith, the guardian for her husband, Jeffrey Smith, 51. He’s been in the hospital since July 15, according to court documents. But the judge wrote that he must leave emotions out of the decision and must also consider the rights of the hospital and the impact that forcing a hospital to give a drug could have.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city is paying $2million to settle a former death row inmate’s federal lawsuit over his 1988 conviction for two murders. Robert Lee Miller Jr. was set free in 1998 after DNA tests implicated a convicted rapist in the deaths. Miller sued in 2019 after an Oklahoma County judge ruled he had presented sufficient evidence to establish “a prima facie case of actual innocence of the crimes.” He had sought $95 million in compensatory and punitive damages. A jury trial had been set for January. He dismissed the case Friday after the Oklahoma City Council agreed 6-0 to the $2 million settlement. The city did not admit wrongdoing. “It was a tragedy from Day One,” said his attorney, Mark H. Barrett, of Norman. “If they had got DNA done before he got tried instead of afterward, all this would have been a very different story.” Miller, 62, has talked about using the settlement to start his own house-building business, Barrett said. In the lawsuit, the attorney complained that Oklahoma City police detectives used “bizarre, unreliable and coercive techniques” in their interrogations to fabricate a case against Miller. His attorney also blamed disgraced police chemist Joyce Gilchrist for Miller’s conviction and accused the city of condoning her shoddy, unreliable and fraudulent work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take immediate action to improve fish passage at dams in the Willamette Basin. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that in a final opinion and order issued last week, U.S. District Judge Marco Hernandez said the Corps had for years failed to provide adequate passage for threatened chinook salmon and winter steelhead trout at dams it operates in the basin. “As evinced by the listed species’ continuing decline, the Corps’ failure to provide adequate fish passage and mitigate water quality issues is causing substantial, irreparable harm to the salmonids,” Hernandez wrote in the opinion. The order comes after the court decided in favor of three environmental organizations that sued the Corps and the National Marine Fisheries Service, arguing the agencies weren’t doing their part to protect the species. Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Upper Willamette River system are both listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Dams on the Willamette and its tributaries have blocked access to spawning grounds for the fish, contributing to population declines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The Republican leader of the state Senate and a group of parents filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to overturn the Wolf administration’s new mask mandate for schools. The governor’s spokesperson dismissed what she called the GOP’s “effort at undermining public heath.” The suit, filed in Commonwealth Court, asserts that Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam failed to comply with state law when she ordered masks to be worn in all Pennsylvania public and private schools, as well as child care facilities. The masking order isn’t valid because it didn’t go through the state’s regulatory review process, the lawsuit said. It also accused the Wolf administration of trying to circumvent newly approved constitutional amendments limiting a governor’s emergency powers. “The Secretary of Health’s order subjects healthy, non-infected teachers, children, students, staff, and visitors ... to the wearing of face coverings,” the suit said. The plaintiffs, it said, are “not patients, they are heathy, non-infected children.” The parents said in affidavits that they intend to send their children to school without masks, claiming Beam’s order is illegal. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the masking order. The court scheduled a hearing for Sept. 16.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nineteen fire departments are getting a total of $5.5 million in federal grants that can be used to buy new equipment and upgrade training to enhance public safety, the state’s congressional delegation said. “These grants will help lift the budgetary burden on local governments and better protect the health and safety of the public and firefighters,” Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement Friday. The Warwick Fire Department is getting the largest chunk of the grant money, including almost $900,000 for an aerial ladder truck and more than $100,000 for portable radio equipment. The East Providence Fire Department is getting more than $800,000 for paramedic training. The Newport Fire Department is receiving more than $400,000 for portable radio units, mobile repeaters and associated communications equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency grants are also going to departments and fire districts in Bristol; Central Falls; East Greenwich; Johnston; Lincoln; Narragansett; North Kingstown; Pascoag; Portsmouth; Providence; Prudence Island; the Rhode Island Firefighting Academy in Exeter; West Warwick; and Woonsocket.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Wildlife scientists and Riverbanks Zoo are teaming up to save endangered gopher frogs. The survival rate of the eggs and tadpoles for the frogs is extremely low, so the Department of Natural Resources finds the eggs in Lowcountry wetlands, and the zoo raises them in captivity. “It’s a matter of how we can best use our strengths for species conservation,” Natural Resources herpetologist Andrew Grosse said in a statement. Wildlife scientists are also working to restore habitat for gopher frogs so that the eggs and tadpoles have a better chance at survival when they are returned to the wild, Grosse said. The frogs live in longleaf pines and are a good indicator at the health of that environmental system. “They have a very complex life history and highly specialized habitat requirements,” Grosse said. “All of the pieces must be in place and functioning at a high level to support these fragile populations.” Several hundred frogs have been saved through the South Carolina program and similar efforts in North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia, officials said. The project is attempting to keep the frogs off the federal endangered species list. Scientists are calling it “Head Start” since it gives the frogs a head start at surviving.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem wants to pass tougher abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Texas law banning most abortions in that state to go forward. The Texas law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant. “Following the Supreme Court’s decision to leave the pro-life (Texas) law in place, I have directed the Unborn Child Advocate in my office to immediately review the new (Texas) law and current South Dakota laws to make sure we have the strongest pro life laws on the books in (South Dakota),” Noem said in a statement on social media Thursday. Women in South Dakota are currently barred from terminating a pregnancy after 22 weeks. Noem has previously said she wants to ban abortions completely, with no exceptions in cases of rape or incest. The Texas law authorizes private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in aiding an abortion, including someone who drives a woman to a clinic. The law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood and other groups. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has vowed to push back against more abortion restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order late Friday blocking Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the temporary restraining order for the county’s schools after it was sought by the parents of two children with health problems. The parents argued in a federal lawsuit filed the week prior that the Republican governor endangered students with health conditions and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing parents to opt out of a mask mandate via an executive order. The temporary restraining order remains in effect until Sept. 17. The students attend school in the Memphis suburbs of Collierville and Germantown, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Lee resisted implementing a statewide mask mandate for schools, and he had initially left the decision to local officials. But on Aug. 16, he signed a statewide order allowing parents to opt out of the requirement for nonmedical reasons. Hundreds of students have been attending classes without masks ever since. The parents’ lawsuit claims Lee’s order violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A judge has temporarily shielded some abortion clinics from being sued by the state’s largest anti-abortion group under a new law banning most abortions. The temporary restraining order was issued Friday by District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble in Austin in response to a Planned Parenthood request. Although the law remains in effect, the judge’s order shields Planned Parenthood’s clinics, specifically, from whistleblower lawsuits by the nonprofit group Texas Right to Life, its legislative director and people working in concert with the group. A hearing on a preliminary injunction request is scheduled for Sept. 13. The law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy and before some women realize they’re pregnant. The law also leaves enforcement to private citizens through lawsuits instead of to prosecutors through criminal charges. Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday that the law was “already decimating abortion access in the state, as providers are forced to turn people away” once cardiac activity can be detected. It said historically, 85% to 90% of women who have gotten abortions in Texas were at least six weeks into their pregnancies.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A paraplegic man who was injured on a roller coaster is now suing an amusement park, saying his paralyzed leg wasn’t properly secured while he was on the ride, and his foot was shredded. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Matthew Christensen filed the lawsuit against Lagoon Amusement Park on Thursday in Davis County’s 3rd District Court. The lawsuit said Christensen’s ligament in his big toe was “irreparably shredded,” and he suffered fractures to his lower leg, toe, and two other foot bones. A spokesman for the theme park in Farmington, north of Salt Lake City, said he couldn’t speculate on the facts of the incident, which are under investigation. “The ride in question has a lap restraint similar to others used throughout the amusement industry,” Adam Leishman said. Christensen is paralyzed from the waist down and was using a wheelchair at the park during an October 2020 visit with his family and a friend. Christensen’s son and friend helped transfer him from the wheelchair to the roller coaster car. According to the lawsuit, Christensen had the lap restraint secured correctly, but his right leg was not secured properly by the leg restraint, which caused the man’s paralyzed leg to dangle below, and he was injured when it got caught in the platform.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The first two years of a state program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs saved money on Medicare patients and kept more people out of the hospital, an evaluation of the program has found. The report commissioned by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and released last week looked at the first two years of Medicare participation in Vermont in what is known as the all-payer model of health care. The report found that in 2018 and 2019, the costs for Medicare patients in the system being studied saved about 4.7% from the previous year. For all of Vermont’s Medicare patients, the system saved about 6.5% over the previous year. In 2019 the system reduced by almost 18% acute care hospital stays by people in the system. It reduced the acute care days patients stayed in the hospital by 14.7% and reduced the number of people being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days by 12.4%. “Those declines are very encouraging,” Ena Backus, Vermont’s director of Health Care Reform, said Friday. The same report found the project run by the organization OneCare Vermont has not signed up as many people to participate in the system as had been hoped. In 2019 it had been hoped the program would be covering 75% of eligible Medicare patients, but it reached only 47%.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Curbside recycling pickup for some in the area has been delayed by labor shortages exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and the hot weather. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority has warned customers that shortages of drivers and other waste workers could cause delays. The authority oversees waste and recycling collection in 13 local jurisdictions. The authority said Friday that residential recycling pickups that normally occur on Thursdays in a number of areas have been delayed for at least a week. TFC Recycling, a Chesapeake-based company that performs collections for about 265,000 residences in the authority’s jurisdiction, said pandemic-related labor shortages also affecting other businesses have made it harder to hire and retain drivers and other workers. The summer heat has made it even harder to find people to do the hands-on work. “In the last several months, we have had some real issues trying to recruit and maintain drivers – not only drivers but helpers, too,” said Tad Phillips, general manager of TFC’s Richmond-area operations, told the newspaper. Hiring has also become harder as package delivery companies compete for some of the same workers for their trucks as people turn to online ordering during the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Days after suing to block what is believed to be among the nation’s strictest COVID-19 employee vaccine mandates, Washington’s largest state labor union has announced a tentative agreement for Gov. Jay Inslee’s order for state workers. The Northwest News Network reports the Washington Federation of State Employees has negotiated terms for Inslee’s mandate that all 46,000 of its union members be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or lose their jobs. The Democratic governor issued the order in August, citing the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The union countered with a labor complaint, claiming Inslee’s administration was bargaining in bad faith. The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified, was announced Saturday and defines the exceptions and religious and medical exemptions process for employees who can’t or won’t get their shots. “This agreement is a victory for both public health and due process,” WFSE said in a statement. “It puts in place a fair, equitable and consistent process for members seeking a legitimate exemption to the mandate.” Anyone who is eligible to retire by the end of the year can forgo the vaccine if they use accrued or unpaid leave until they reach their retirement date.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state had one of its worst weeks of the coronavirus pandemic as the number of newly confirmed cases neared a seven-day record. The 6,705 confirmed statewide cases for the six days ending Saturday already surpassed the previous week’s total and were the fourth-highest for any week since the first case was reported in the state in March 2020, according to state health data. The record is nearly 8,200 confirmed cases for the week ending Jan. 10, followed by about 7,600 cases the week ending Jan. 3. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units was 216, just shy of the record 219 set on Jan. 6. On July 4, there were only 17 virus patients in hospital ICUs across the state. And the number of patients on hospital ventilators has surpassed the previous high of 104 set Jan. 10.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJunction City: The state’s cranberry crop is expected to end up being about average – or maybe even above average – by the time harvest begins in about a month. The U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee forecast in August that Wisconsin growers will produce 4.92 million barrels this year. But Wisconsin Cranberry Growers Association Executive Director Tom Lochner said this year’s estimated crop is closer to the state’s average of 5.5 million barrels. “We still have a few weeks to go before we start harvesting, and the continued warm weather might help the fruit size up a little bit,” Lochner told Wisconsin Public Radio. Dave Hansen, manager of DuBay Cranberry Company in Junction City, said this summer’s weather was warmer and drier than he prefers, but the crop ended up looking good. Lochner said the COVID-19 pandemic has helped boost domestic sales of the fruit, with more people consuming cranberry juice and dried fruit at home, while international sales tapered off during the pandemic, perhaps due to tariffs. The European Union has maintained a 25% tariff on U.S. cranberry products. The pandemic has also created labor issues for the cranberry industry. Lochner said some growers have been working to bring in migrant workers from Southern states to help this fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne-based Big Boy No. 4014 returns home Tuesday from a monthlong tour of the nation. Led by Ed Dickens, the Union Pacific Heritage Steam program’s showpiece is the massive locomotive that concluded its restoration in 2019 with a tour that marked the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, which became known as the “overland route” that linked the nation. The steam locomotive, along with 15 support and vintage railcars, is expected to arrive at the Steam Shop in Cheyenne about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. It should be visible on track on the east end of town starting about 1 p.m, arriving from Greeley, Colorado, its last official stop before arriving home in Cheyenne. Dickens runs the Steam Shop and the UP’s Heritage program, and he is usually found in the engineer’s seat on Big Boy while it is en route. “It’s been excellent,” he said of the 2021 tour. “Our collaboration with our colleagues across the Union Pacific has ensured that we’re consistently running on time, much to the delight of the huge crowds that have greeted us everywhere we’ve been.” The completely rebuilt vintage steam engine has performed outstandingly throughout the trip,” Dickens said. “All of the long hours we put into its restoration and continuing maintenance are paying off.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/04/fur-seal-pups-big-balloon-fest-runaway-bull-news-around-states/40242775/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Gov. Kay Ivey said South Korean auto parts manufacturer Shinhwa Group is investing $42 million in a facility and will create 95 jobs in Auburn, the company’s first manufacturing facility in the United States. Construction is already underway. Phase 1 of the project is expected to be finished by the summer. Shinhwa will initially make driveshafts for vehicles built by Hyundai Motor Manufacturing’s plant in Montgomery, as well as for Kia Motor Manufacturing’s plant, just across the state line in West Point, Georgia. Alabama Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said the company is a “welcome addition” to the state’s network of “high-caliber auto suppliers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Northern fur seals have declined at the world’s largest rookery in Alaska’s Pribilof Islands, but they’re thriving at an unlikely location. Numbers of fur seals continue to grow on Bogoslof Island, a tiny landmass at the tip of an active undersea volcano in the Aleutian Islands. The volcano two years ago spewed ash into the path of jetliners. Hot mud, steam and sulfurous gases continue to spit up from vents on the island. Fur seals give birth and raise pups along the beach of the island that’s only about one-third the size of New York City’s Central Park. Tom Gelatt of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said biologists in 2015 estimated there were 28,000 pups on the island. He said the 2019 estimate likely will be more than 36,000 pups.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Game and Fish Department is investigating the poaching of a bull elk north of Heber in late August and is asking for the public’s help finding whoever killed the animal. The agency said Tuesday the poacher left the bull elk’s meat to waste west of Forest Road 153 near Point and Javelina water catchments. Agency officials said in a press release they believe someone has information about the case because the poaching incident occurred during a time when many hunters were scouting the area for upcoming hunts. Other recreationists are also believed to have been in the area at the time of the crime, the agency said. Hunting elk and other types of game in Arizona is regulated by the department. Hunters are required to draw permits, which are limited in number and allow them to hunt a limited number of game. Hunting can take place only in designated areas during designated periods. Most elk hunting takes place during the fall season in Arizona, although there are a few locations designated during other times of the year, according to the Game and Fish website. Anyone with information about the poaching incident should call the department’s Operation Game Thief hotline at 800-352-0700 or visit www.azgfd.gov and refer to case #19-003199. Callers can remain anonymous upon request and might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 upon an arrest. The Arizona Elk Society and Arizona Deer Association are each offering an additional $2,500 reward upon the arrest and conviction of the poachers, according to a press release from the department.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: The Saracen Casino Annex, the largest tourism investment project in Arkansas, opened Tuesday morning. The annex is part of the $350 million Saracen Casino Resort project owned and operated by the Oklahoma-based Quapaw Nation. The casino resort is expected to open next June. About 10,000 guests have visited the 300-slot-machine annex since Friday’s surprise “soft opening.” Quapaw Nation officials said they plan to employ 1,100 people permanently at the Saracen Casino Resort. More than 200 are employed at the annex and a new nearby convenience store and gas station. Most hires came from Pine Bluff. The project is expected to feature 2,000 slot machines and 50 gambling tables, along with a 300-room hotel with a fire safety and an emergency services facility.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Residents had a chance to see a mini-air show as the Royal Air Force Red Arrows aerobatic team tours California. The team flew past the famed Hollywood sign Wednesday afternoon and headed south to the Port of Long Beach to fly over the retired British ocean liner Queen Mary, which is now a tourist attraction and hotel. On Tuesday, the Red Arrows’ jets flew over San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate bridge. This weekend, they will join the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds and other performers at the Great Pacific Airshow over the surf at Huntington Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A falcon that has served as the mascot for the U.S. Air Force Academy for the past 23 years has died. KCNC-TV reported the passing of the falcon named Aurora was announced by the academy on Wednesday. The academy said in a statement that the falcon was the longest-serving live mascot in the school’s 65-year history. Aurora was reported to have recovered after suffering injuries to its wings in November 2018 during a prank abduction before the annual football game against the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. The Air Force Academy uses several falcons during home games and Aurora attended most road games to greet fans. The academy described her as a “feisty, spirited bird who commanded respect.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nGroton: The Pentagon said the USS Oregon, the Navy’s newest attack submarine, will be christened Saturday at General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton. U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, said he will attend as the keynote speaker. He said the submarine will be christened with water from Crater Lake and wine from Oregon. Oregon, a Virginia-class submarine, is the third U.S. Navy ship to honor the state. Virginia-class submarines are built to conduct anti-submarine warfare; anti-surface ship warfare; strike warfare; special operation forces support; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare missions. The Pentagon said they have stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower.\n\nDelaware\n\nFenwick Island:State environmental officials might soon lease public parkland to an offshore wind energy company in exchange for millions of dollars in new amenities at Delaware’s southernmost beach. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has signed an initial memorandum of understanding with Ørsted, an offshore wind company based in Denmark, to discuss leasing up to 1.5 acres at Fenwick Island State Park. Ørsted would use park property to build an interconnection facility that will connect power generated by the yet-to-be-built Skipjack Wind Farm to the electrical grid. In exchange for leasing the public land, the company would fund improvements at the park, with the state now suggesting more than a dozen projects worth upward of $18 million. Those projects could include a two-level parking garage, a pedestrian overpass that allows foot traffic to cross Coastal Highway from the ocean side to the bayside, connections for a trail or sidewalk system, two additional bathrooms, an amphitheater and a new local Chamber of Commerce building that would house the park’s visitors center, a small nature center and more.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A museum dedicated to journalism and the First Amendment is set to close its doors near the National Mall by the end of the year. WTOP-FM reported the Newseum announced its impending closure Tuesday, citing yearslong financial issues. A company statement said that despite more than 11 years of service and nearly 10 million visitors, continued operations have proved to be unsustainable. The statement said the museum’s founder and primary funder, the Freedom Forum, remains committed to its mission to champion the five freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment. It said efforts to increase public awareness about the importance of a free press are needed now more than ever. Visitors are welcome through Dec. 31. Tickets purchased online include a 15% discount, with prices now starting at about $12.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan said Wednesday that he will be the majority investor in the nation’s only 24-hour news network aimed at African American viewers, giving the network a deep pocket as it launches next month. The network has been in the works for years and an announcement about its launch was made earlier this year. But Khan’s backing gives it a substantial boost. He declined to say how much he would invest initially but said it would be enough to keep the network running for a long time. Khan is worth an estimated $8 billion and made his fortune in the auto equipment industry. As well as the Jaguars, he owns Fulham Football Club of the English Football League, Four Seasons Hotel Toronto and All Elite Wrestling. Former Republican U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, who was a star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980s, will be chairman of the new network. It will be available via cable and satellite viewers in 33 million households. The network has agreements with Charter Communications, Comcast and DISH and will be carried in major African American markets such as New York, Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago and Los Angeles. The network is to begin broadcasting in November and will be based in Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, with bureaus across the country, Watts said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAdel: A hospital and nursing home in south Georgia has moved into a new $40 million facility. The Adel hospital began operating from its new home Tuesday. What had previously been Cook Medical Center is now called Southwell Medical. The 20-bed hospital, 95-bed nursing home and physicians’ offices are operated by Tift Regional Health System. Tift Regional Health System President Christopher Dorman told WALB-TV that the new complex just off Interstate 75 was renamed to help attract patients from beyond Cook County. The new hospital doesn’t have an emergency room but does have a walk-in clinic. The health system borrowed about 70% of construction costs through a U.S. Department of Agriculture rural development loan. Cook County and Adel government agencies provided the remainder. The old hospital’s new use remains undetermined.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A post-mortem examination of two pygmy killer whales that were found stranded on a Maui beach suggested they were fighting an infection. The Maui News reported Wednesday that the adult males had inflamed lymph nodes when they stranded themselves at Sugar Beach last month. The infection was also found in pygmy killer whales that stranded themselves at the same beach in August. An official from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the whales were afflicted elsewhere and there is no indication of an environmental toxin at Sugar Beach. The animals were euthanized after tests indicated little chance for survival at sea. Researchers said unusual food items, including excess plant material found in the animals, indicate they were not feeding normally.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge said she agrees that fulfilling public records requests can put a big burden on governmental resources, but she expressed skepticism about the number of completely redacted pages provided to four Boise-area journalists by Ada County officials this year. Fourth District Judge Deborah Bail made the comments during a hearing on a lawsuit between the Idaho Press Club and Ada County Commissioners on Wednesday afternoon. In the lawsuit the Idaho Press Club and the four journalists contend county officials repeatedly violated the state’s Public Records Act by wrongly denying access to some documents, over-redacting others and otherwise mishandling public information requests. In court Wednesday, Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney James Dickinson said the judge has all the evidence she needs in the form of the unredacted documents. Dickinson said some of the redacted documents require context to understand why they should be kept from release but said he can’t discuss it in open court lest he reveal private protected information.\n\nIllinois\n\nFairview Heights: Planned Parenthood has quietly been building a new abortion clinic in Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, as women concerned about the uncertain future of Missouri’s sole abortion clinic flock across the state line. The 18,000-square-foot in Fairview Heights, 12 miles east of St. Louis, will provide abortion services, as well as family planning, when it opens in mid-October, Planned Parenthood officials said at a news conference Wednesday. Planned Parenthood has been fighting Missouri’s health department for months to try and keep open its St. Louis clinic. The state has refused to renew its license to perform abortions, citing concerns that include “failed abortions” that required additional surgeries. Missouri’s Administrative Hearing Commission is deciding the fate of the St. Louis clinic. During an annual inspection of the St. Louis clinic in March, Missouri health investigators cited numerous concerns, including reports of failed abortions. Planned Parenthood said it has already addressed those concerns and defended its clinic. It claims the state is using the licensing process as an excuse to stop abortions.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: More than 2,200 sets of preserved fetal remains found in the Illinois garage of a late Indiana abortion doctor have been returned to Indiana. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill said Thursday that the fetal remains found last month at Dr. Ulrich Klopfer’s Will County, Illinois, home were transferred Wednesday to the St. Joseph County coroner’s office for “safekeeping.” Hill said at a news conference in South Bend that investigators determined the remains came from abortions performed in Indiana in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Authorities are still investigating where the abortions occurred. Klopfer performed abortions at clinics in Fort Wayne, South Bend and Gary. Relatives cleaning out Klopfer’s garage after his Sept. 3 death found the remains. Hill said they will be “given the decency of a burial that they deserve.”\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The Iowa Department of Natural Resources said it plans to collect as many deer samples in northeastern Iowa as it can this hunting season to test for chronic wasting disease after the first case in Dubuque County was confirmed in January, the Telegraph Herald reported Thursday. Chris Ensminger, the wildlife research section supervisor for the department, said officials want to collect at least 250 samples from an area in which the diseased deer was killed and at least 250 samples from elsewhere in Dubuque County. Samples also will be collected from surrounding eastern Iowa counties. The disease attacks the brains of deer and elk and is always fatal. No human cases have been recorded, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to not eat meat from infected animals. The disease has become increasingly prevalent in parts of the Midwest, including Wisconsin and Minnesota. Nearly 400 of the 1,060 deer that tested positive for the disease in Wisconsin from April 2018 to the end of March were in Iowa County in southwest Wisconsin. Other cases came from surrounding Crawford, Grant and Lafayette counties.\n\nKansas\n\nLinwood: A plan to build a village of foster care homes in northeast Kansas has gotten the OK, although the project has been scaled down. The Kansas City Star reported that the nonprofit Joy Meadows initially sought to create a development with up to 10 homes that could house large sibling sets on a 23-acre property in the Linwood area. Instead, the Leavenworth County Commission voted Wednesday to limit the first phase of development to four total homes, including one that is located there. The nonprofit would be allowed to add three more in a future phase, upon review from the county. Foster care advocates and the Kansas Department for Children and Families voiced support for the residential development. But the project faced opposition from neighbors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLudlow:Fire and police units are at the scene of a barge accident that set several boats adrift or sinking in the Ohio River. The barge hit the Ludlow Bromley Yacht Club on Wednesday morning hard enough to partially submerge the marina’s bar and grill. Steve Hensley, Kenton County’s Director of Homeland Security and Management, told news outlets six boats were knocked loose. Hensley said there was one person on the barge and one person on one of the boats, but neither was injured. Officials said the restaurant and patio of the yacht club were heavily damaged with some of it attached to the barge that struck it. Ludlow Police Chief Scott Smith said the Coast Guard is investigating and the barge operator was being questioned.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGonzales: The federal government has bought out an entire flood-prone neighborhood in Louisiana, prompting all its residents to move to higher ground. News outlets reported the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Emergency Watershed Protection Program financed the buyouts on along Silverleaf Street in Gonzales, which was carved out of a wetland in the 1980s and has frequently flooded since. Chief city engineer Jackie Baumann said the federal agency is buying the homes at preflood market value, and Restore Louisiana is offering to make up shortfalls in the purchasing price for some residents, as long as their next home isn’t in a flood zone. The 2017 offer required all 41 residents to agree to the deal, and the last resident agreed last month, enabling the government to restore the wetland.\n\nMaine\n\nLubec: American fishermen are expected to get a little more fishing quota under terms of an agreement with Canada. The countries are home to fisheries for economically important species that cross international boundaries, such as cod and haddock. They reach an agreement every year about how to divide catch on eastern Georges Bank, a crucial fishing area off New England and Canada. The New England Fishery Management Council said the U.S is scheduled to get 29% of the 1.4 million-pound total allowable catch of cod on eastern Georges Bank in 2020. It’s also set for 54% of the 66 million-pound total allowable catch of haddock in the area. The figures are subject to federal approval. They represent a 2.6 million-pound bump for haddock and about the same figure for cod compared to 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A 1,600-pound bull escaped from a truck into the streets of Baltimore for several hours. The Baltimore Sun reported that it took three tranquilizer shots and a crew of zoo officials to recapture the animal on Wednesday. The purebred Angus breeding bull broke out of a truck while it was stopped at a red light. A crowd gathered and watched as the animal was corralled. Baltimore Police spokeswoman Det. Nicole Monroe told the newspaper that the “owner of the bull said he doesn’t have the best disposition.” The bull was from Hedgeapple Farm in Buckeystown. Executive director Scott Barao said the animal was very expensive and thanked the police for not shooting it. He said the bull is “extremely valuable to us and we’re just glad to have him alive.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: State wildlife officials said a moose that was struck by two cars and had a broken leg has been euthanized. Marion Larson, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, told The Boston Globe that Worcester police were called about a bull moose that was hit by a car Monday morning and Monday night. The moose was spotted in a pond Tuesday morning, and the state Environmental Police responded to the scene. Several boats were deployed so the moose did not approach Interstate 290, and to maneuver the animal into a suitable darting area. Larson said the 3 ½-year-old moose would not have survived its injuries. Another moose spotted in a Worcester cemetery Monday was tranquilized and freed at a state park.\n\nMichigan\n\nBattle Creek:A fourth Michigan resident has died from a rare mosquito-borne virus that has been recorded across the southern half of the state. WWMT-TV reported that 79-year-old Stan Zalner of Battle Creek died Wednesday after contracting eastern equine encephalitis. Ronna Bagent told the television station that her father was hospitalized in September with severe flu-like symptoms before doctors were able to confirm the illness through blood tests. Nine cases have been confirmed in six southern or southwestern Michigan counties. More than 30 animals – including 18 horses – in more than a dozen counties also have died from the disease. State health officials say low-flying aircraft were expected to spray pesticides Wednesday in Calhoun and 10 other counties. The pesticides kill adult mosquitoes on contact.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A federal judge has rejected challenges by several environmental groups to a land swap needed for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen dismissed the four lawsuits late Monday, ruling that the groups lacked the necessary legal standing to block the land exchange between PolyMet and the federal government. She said the groups couldn’t establish that they had been harmed. PolyMet traded 6,650 acres of federal land in the Superior National Forest at the mine site near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes for a similar amount of private land last year. Several environmental groups sued to challenge various aspects of the deal, saying it undervalued the federal land and violated other laws, including the Endangered Species Act. PolyMet disputed those claims and persuaded the judge to dismiss the lawsuits. Ericksen dismissed the lawsuits without prejudice, meaning the groups could refile them at some later point. They could also appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg:At least 22 soldiers training at Champ Shelby were injured during a night parachuting exercise. U.S. Army spokesman John Pennell told WDAM-TV that at least 15 people were treated by medics and another seven were hospitalized. Staff Sgt. John Healy said none of the injuries is considered to be life-threatening. Camp Shelby Cmdr. Col. Bobby Ginn said the troopers belong to the 4th Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. Pennell said about 89 paratroopers were on the plane for the Wednesday night exercise. Ginn said the soldiers jumped from a C-130 aircraft and were blown off-course from their intended landing zone and into a group of pine trees. Several were entangled in the trees and had to be rescued. Healy says about 650 soldiers were involved in the exercise. About 3,000 troops from the Alaska base are at monthlong training at Camp Shelby called “Operation Arctic Anvil.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A compromise has been reached after Kansas City-area defense attorneys complained that their underwire bras were setting off jail metal detectors, forcing them to remove their lingerie for screening if they wanted to meet with their clients face-to-face. KCUR reported that the solution reached last month allows attorneys who set off metal detectors at the Jackson County Jail to be wanded or patted down. Attorneys protested after the jail rolled out a new security protocol in May. Jail officials initially responded by offering to allow attorneys to have noncontact visits, in which they talked to their clients by phones separated by glass, without clearing metal detectors first. But attorneys continued to push for change. Attorney Tracy Spradlin said she is thankful the issue was resolved without a lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana has announced plans to build a larger veterans affairs clinic in Missoula. The Missoulian reported that Tester, Democrat, announced Tuesday a location was chosen for a new community-based outpatient clinic. Officials said the clinic will be three times larger than the current clinic, which serves more than 6,000 veterans. It will have expanded primary care, mental health and specialty services. Tester said the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act that passed in 2017 set aside about $7 million in federal funding for the project. The clinic is expected to open in 2022. The current clinic will continue to serve patients until the new clinic opens.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bobcat that wandered into a Lincoln building has been captured and released back into the wild. Staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs campus in south Lincoln called the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission on Tuesday to report the animal had been spotted inside one of its buildings. Commission staffers set a cage trap and baited it with raw fish. The estimated 20-pound bobcat bit on the bait and was caught. It was freed outside of town Wednesday. Bobcats are common in Nebraska and can be found at the edge of Lincoln, sometimes coming inside to hunt. Sam Wilson with the commission said bobcats are common but rarely seen.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A firefighter suffered burns and a woman was hospitalized after she jumped from a second-floor window at a motel that was on fire just east of downtown Reno. Police closed part of East Fourth Street for about three hours Tuesday afternoon before firefighters knocked down the blaze at the Lucky Motel. Fire officials told KRNV-TV the blaze destroyed two units at the weekly motel. One firefighter was being treated for burns to his leg. The woman was transported to a local hospital after she jumped from the window onto a car. She also suffered smoke inhalation. There was no immediate information available on their conditions Wednesday. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The Reno Fire Department chaplain and motel owner were working to relocate displaced residents to a nearby motel.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBedford: A young moose that got stuck in a swimming pool has been successfully coaxed out. New Hampshire Fish and Game Department biologists and conservation officers were called to a Bedford home Tuesday to help remove the young bull. He was in the water for several hours. Officers said he was unable to get himself out of the pool, so they put in a set of wooden steps. The department posted a video of the moose looking back and forth as the team held a rope and coaxed him out. He scampered away. Col. Kevin Jordan suggested it had to do with it being moose breeding season. He told television station WMUR that “the younger moose will wander long distances struggling to find a female.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nForked River: The state has created an oversight panel to evaluate the process of dismantling the former Oyster Creek nuclear plant. Gov. Phil Murphy said it will ensure the “proper protocols” are in place throughout the process. Oyster Creek is being decommissioned after it was permanently shuttered in September 2018. Its spent fuel is also being put into safe storage. The panel’s formation was announced Wednesday. It plans to meet at least twice a year and will allow the public to share their concerns. Its members include the state’s Environmental Protection Commissioner, state police superintendent, homeland security director and the president of the Board of Public Utilities. Oyster Creek is located about 60 miles east of Philadelphia. It produced enough electricity each year to supply about 600,000 typical homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons will lift off from the New Mexico desert over nine days as part of one of the world’s largest festivals dedicated to the sport of ballooning. In its 48th year, the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is scheduled to kick off Saturday with a mass ascension. More than 580 balloons are registered, 17 countries are represented and tens of thousands of spectators from around the world are expected to turn out for the opening weekend. Albuquerque has played host to the fiesta since its inception in 1972. Troy Bradley, one of the ballooning world’s most prolific record-setters, said, “There’s just nothing like it in the world, to see that much color going into the sky.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Homeowners hurt by record flooding along Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River have until the end of this month to seek state funding. People living in Cayuga, Jefferson, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Oswego, St. Lawrence and Wayne counties can apply for up to $50,000 to offset damages sustained this year to their primary residences. The window for applications opened Tuesday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office said $20 million is available through the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Flood Relief and Recovery Program.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville:State health officials said 116 people have been diagnosed with Legionnaire’s disease since an outbreak was reported in September. The Asheville Citizen Times reported the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services released the figures Wednesday, adding that there was one death. The department also said 65% of those diagnosed had to be hospitalized. DHHS expected the number of confirmed cases to continue to climb as diagnostic tests are processed. Health officials aren’t sure if the illness originated from last month’s Mountain State Fair. Legionnaires’ disease is bacterial pneumonia that develops when someone breathes in mist or water that contains the bacteria into their lungs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill has released produced water into a small creek and a stock pond in western North Dakota. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality was notified of the spill, which happened Tuesday in Dunn County. The pipeline is part of a gathering system operated by Marathon Oil. The spill happened about 1.5 miles northeast of Manning. Authorities don’t know what caused the leak. An estimated 21,000 gallons of produced water were released, impacting the creek and stock pond within pastureland. The creek discharges into the Knife River, but no impacts have been detected in the river. Produced water is a by-product of oil and gas development. State inspectors are checking the site and will continue to monitor the investigation and remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nOxford: An investigation into alleged hazing by a fraternity at Miami University has led to misdemeanor charges of hazing and assault against more than a dozen fraternity members. A student reported in March that members of the Delta Tau Delta chapter at the university in Oxford hazed him during initiation. The student said he was beaten with a spiked paddle, kicked and forced to drink lots of alcohol. The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reported Oxford police confirmed that a Butler County grand jury’s recent indictments of the 18 men stemmed from an investigation into hazing. Miami suspended the fraternity in August for 10 to 15 years after its investigation determined violations of the school’s Code of Student Conduct. Delta Tau Delta’s national headquarters revoked the chapter’s charter in June.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Some of the 44 death row inmates housed at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester will soon be moved from the prison’s maximum-security H-Unit to another unit to give them more benefits and access to the outdoors, the state’s new prisons boss said. In a letter released by the agency on Thursday, the Department of Corrections’ Interim Executive Director Scott Crow told officials with the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma that the agency plans to move “qualifying inmates” to its less restrictive A-Unit by the end of October. The ACLU had threatened legal action over what it said are potential constitutional violations of the rights of death row inmates, mostly by confining them to their cells for 23 hours per day. Crow said the agency also plans to begin “contact” visitation for some of the moved death row inmates, who are allowed only noncontact visits behind Plexiglas and over a telephone.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: The City Council has agreed to discuss whether to impose a ban on feeding deer and elk that wander city streets. KTVZ-TV reported councilmember Chris Piper, who with Bruce Abernethy proposed considering such a ban Wednesday, said the plans were brought to him and other councilmembers by neighborhood associations. Piper said dozens of collisions involving vehicles and deer were reported in the city last year. Piper said cities including Sunriver and Sisters have seen positive results from similar wildlife feeding regulations. There is a similar ban on feeding geese in Bend that can result in a $372 fine. Although that ban is isolated to Mirror Pond, the potential deer and elk feeding ban would be citywide.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Another alligator has turned up in Pittsburgh, the seventh this year. George DeSavage told WTAE-TV he and his girlfriend spotted it along the Allegheny River as the sun was setting on Tuesday. He said he grabbed it and it “went kind of limp and calm.” He said it seemed like it was handled by somebody. Police took it to Humane Animal Rescue, which named the gator Gus. The shelter shared photos on its Facebook page. The shelter believes the reptile was a pet. It’s not illegal to own an alligator in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s high school students scored significantly lower on the SAT than the national averages. The Providence Journal reported Thursday that the state’s Class of 2019 scored an average of 483 points on the English portion of the standardized college entrance exam; the national average was 531. On the math section of the test, Rhode Islanders scored an average of 474; the national average was 528. The numbers also showed a gap between white students and students of color, with white students scoring about 70 points higher in English and math. The Rhode Island Department of Education said SAT scores were flat statewide. State Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green called on district leaders to develop action plans to increase test participation and overall scores.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: A man who set a fire at a Walmart to divert attention as he stole a case of beer has been sentenced to the maximum of 15 years in prison. Solicitor David Stumbo said 34-year-old Russell Geddings pleaded guilty Tuesday to third-degree arson – the same day his trial was set to start. Stumbo said Geddings set a clothes rack on fire at a Greenwood Walmart on Dec. 5 then stole the beer in the chaos. Stumbo said in a statement no one was injured, but $1.2 million worth of damage was done to the store and merchandise. Stumbo said Geddings deserved the maximum sentence for putting so many people at risk to steal beer. Geddings’ attorneys did not answer an email from a reporter seeking comment.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A Delta commercial airplane made an emergency landing in Sioux Falls on Thursday morning for a passenger who had a medical emergency, officials said. The Delta flight, scheduled around 7:30 a.m. from Chicago to Seattle, was diverted when a 63-year-old male passenger started to experience emergency medical symptoms, said Dan Letellier, executive director for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport. The flight was over Pierre when its pilots diverted to Sioux Falls, he said. The airplane landed around 8:30 a.m. and the passenger was transported to a local hospital, Letellier said. The passenger was alert and conscious, but Letellier didn’t comment any further on the man’s condition. “Based on our location in the country, there are thousands of flights that go overhead each year,” Letellier said. “We get at least one or two medical diversions a month. It’s a matter of where we fit in the country.”\n\nTennessee\n\nCollierville:Dozens gathered Tuesday to welcome home fallen soldier Maj. Trevor Joseph. The 33-year-old died Sept. 26 in an aviation accident at Fort Polk, Louisiana. He is survived by his wife, Erin. “Trevor was the greatest individual who was truly just so humble,” family members said in a text. “He would be so embarrassed by all this heroic attention, but this is exactly what he deserves.” Funeral arrangements are pending. Joseph, a soldier from the Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk’s 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment, was killed during a JRTC rotation in a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter within the training area, according to a Facebook post from JRTC and Fort Polk. Three other 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment soldiers were injured. The cause of the accident is under investigation.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A truck driver from California was killed Wednesday when his semi crashed into an overpass support column on Interstate 10 in downtown El Paso. The fatal crash closed westbound lanes for several hours Wednesday morning. Harjot Singh Goraya, 32, of Riverside, California, was driving when he veered off the road and crashed into a support column shortly before 1 a.m. by the Mesa Street exit ramp. Traffic Police said that the road was wet from an earlier rainstorm but that the Special Traffic Investigations Unit has yet to determine how the driver lost control. The crash closed all westbound lanes early Wednesday. Drivers were urged to find alternative routes into downtown or West El Paso, including Paisano Drive, Montana Avenue and Trans Mountain Road. Traffic was directed off the highway at the downtown exit, police said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Health has confirmed the state’s first human death from West Nile virus this yer. Authorities said Saturday that a central Utah resident at least 65 years old died from the disease carried by mosquitoes sometime between Sept. 21 and Sept. 28. Information about the victim including name and gender have not been released. Utah health officials have confirmed 19 human cases West Nile virus this year. The total is higher than last year, when 11 residents contracted the virus and one person died. State health officials have said a wet spring this year created more standing water habitats for mosquitoes, attracting species that can transmit West Nile virus to Utah. Symptoms include headaches, joint pains and a high fever.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: Residents of a town along the route of the Appalachian Trail have taken the first steps toward filing an application to become a designated Appalachian Trail Community. Local and county officials in Bennington met with state counterparts and community organizers recently to discuss plans to apply for the designation. Officials said the label as an Appalachian Trail Community will bring greater publicity and boost local business. The Appalachian Trail stretches about 2,200 miles, through 14 states and 40 communities. More than 100 miles of the trail runs through Vermont and a portion of it is just east of Bennington. The Bennington Banner reported that in addition to publicity, the move could bring stakeholders together to improve the trail system locally for hikers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A popular nature center will soon be closing temporarily for a $2.3 million renovation. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Maymont’s Robins Nature & Visitor Center will close Nov. 1 and open in March. The center houses fish, turtles, otters and other animals found within the James River and Chesapeake Bay. It attracts roughly 45,000 people each year. The animals will have upgraded habitats with lighting and heating systems and will be more visible to guests when the center reopens.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A late cold snap last winter has cut the production of Washington apricots in half. The Washington State Fruit Commission said the state usually produces 5,000 tons of apricots a year. But The Spokesman-Review reported that the yield this year is only about 2,500 tons. Washington produces about 20% of the nation’s apricots. The commission said frost in February, when apricot trees had bloomed, hurt production. Apricots produced in Washington are shipped across the country.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal officials said drought conditions in West Virginia are worsening as unusually high heat continues to beat down on the region. The U.S. Drought Monitor map released Thursday showed large swaths of southern West Virginia in a severe drought, a designation that includes the likely loss of crops and water shortages. The map also classified the entire northern part of the state as abnormally dry. Officials said nearly 50% of the state’s population is now in a drought. The National Weather Service marked last month as one of warmest and driest Septembers on record in multiple West Virginia cities. Less than 1 inch of rain was recorded in the month. Temperatures measured on Oct. 1 also surpassed record highs for the month in five cities.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said during a stop in Wisconsin that he doesn’t know if the family dairy farm can survive as the industry moves toward a factory farm model. Perdue told reporters Tuesday following an appearance at the World Dairy Expo that it’s getting harder for farmers to get by on milking smaller herds. Perdue’s visit comes as Wisconsin dairy farmers are wrestling with a host of problems, including declining milk prices, rising suicide rates, the transition to larger farms with hundreds or thousands of animals and international trade wars. Wisconsin, which touts itself as America’s Dairyland on its license plates, has lost 551 dairy farms in 2019 after losing 638 in 2018 and 465 in 2017, according to data from the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. The Legislature’s finance committee voted unanimously last month to spend an additional $200,000 to help struggling farmers deal with depression and mental health problems.\n\nWyoming", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/31/navajo-baby-shark-stanley-hotel-final-plunge-pete-news-around-states/40914241/", "title": "Navajo 'Baby Shark,' Stanley Hotel: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Auburn University is launching a partnership with Auburn City Schools to offer dual-enrollment classes to high school students. The partnership will allow Auburn High School students to begin taking Auburn University classes to help prepare them for college, The Opelika-Auburn News reports. The program allows students to earn high school and college credits at the same time, officials said. Auburn University calls the dual-enrollment program Auburn First. Auburn High School has been participating in dual enrollment with Southern Union since 2015 and the University of Alabama since 2018.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A recently released mapping project seeks to show the importance of the Tongass National Forest in terms of carbon, the Juneau Empire reports. The Oregon-based Geos Institute published an analysis of the Tongass this month that highlights the importance of the national forest as a “carbon sink,” which the report says has global climate implications. “The Tongass is part of a global network of temperate rainforests that make up ~2.5% of the world’s total forest coverage,” the report says. “But these rainforests have exceptional carbon stores for their relatively small spatial extent and are critically important in climate regulation collectively and individually.” Trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere and convert it to oxygen as part of their natural life cycle, says Dominic DellaSala, chief scientist at the Geos Institute. Excess carbon is stored in the roots and soils of old-growth forests. “Just like Amazonia is the lungs of the planet,” DellaSala says, “the Tongass is the lungs of North America.”\n\nArizona\n\nFort Huachuca: Conservation activists are pressing for the federal government to reexamine the effects of groundwater pumping at Fort Huachuca in southern Arizona. The pressure comes amid a leaked report that details how the area’s wells are taking a growing toll on the flow of the San Pedro River. The confidential 2010 study commissioned by the Army base was released by Robin Silver, a co-founder of the Center for Biological Diversity, who says the findings show the base’s groundwater pumping has been harming the river for years and will do more damage unless water use is scaled back. Silver says the study’s projections of worsening effects on the river’s flow in the coming decades weren’t adequately considered when U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials issued an opinion in 2014 approving the base’s groundwater pumping for another decade.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Visitors to Clysta Willett Park will soon be able to enjoy some improved amenities courtesy of the city and the state Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. The city received a $96,500 grant from the state this month to make improvements to the Ritter Communications Field and the NEXT Powered by NAEC Field at the park. Plans call for Mountain Home to replace the two fields’ old wooden seats with modern aluminum bleachers that include sun screens. Concrete aprons will also be installed behind home plate, leveling that area for the bleachers. The fields’ chain-link backstop will also be replaced with modern netting, providing visitors with an easier view of the field. The grant also includes adding additional playground equipment to the park’s play area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Authorities have confirmed a fire chased eight people out of an evacuated and condemned building, injuring one person before fire crews could extinguish the blaze. Assistant Fire Marshal Emmanuel Watson compared the event to the 2016 fire that trapped and killed 36 people in the Ghost Ship warehouse illegally repurposed as living quarters for artists, San Francisco Chronicle reports. It took four engines, two trucks and a total of 27 responders to extinguish the Friday fire, authorities said. One woman suffered minor burns and was hospitalized. No firefighters were injured. At least six of the eight people who escaped Friday’s fire were living in the warehouse illegally, sneaking in after the building was reg-flagged twice this year, most recently in November, fire authorities said. The building needed sprinklers, extinguishers and alarm systems, they said.\n\nColorado\n\nEstes Park: Something new will be on tap at the Stanley Hotel in 2020. The Post Brewing Co. – a Colorado brewery and comfort food restaurant chain – will open a new location in the historic hotel’s carriage house, according to an announcement from Big Red F Restaurant Group, which runs The Post’s locations. The carriage house, one of the hotel’s original buildings, is currently undergoing a renovation as part of the project. It was built in 1905 to house entrepreneur F.O. Stanley’s famous Stanley Steamer vehicles. It is the last of the property’s original buildings to be fully renovated, according to a news release. The brewery and restaurant is set to open in the 4,400-square-foot space this summer.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Public and private institutions across the state can begin applying to become sponsors of a federally funded program that provides nutritious meals and snacks to needy children and adults. Participating entities will be reimbursed for each meal they serve. More than 375 local child care centers and adult care centers across Connecticut currently participate in the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program, providing meals to more than 24,000 people daily. Approximately 800 day care home provider locations also participate, providing meals to more than 3,900 children daily. The initiative is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. More information about CACFP and the application process can be found on the Connecticut State Department of Education website.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The downtown public library will crack down on the kinds of bags allowed inside, a policy the city’s homeless say could keep them out of one of the few warm, free places to go in the winter. Beginning Jan. 1, bedrolls, blankets, garbage bags, wheeled carts and luggage will be prohibited from the library, according to signs posted on the doors. Patrons also will be limited to bringing two bags and cannot store anything at the library, according to the policy posted on the library doors. Administrators at the library, which is run by New Castle County, did not respond to multiple requests for comment in the business days before Christmas. The policy has frustrated those who have no place to store their belongings and heightened anxieties among the homeless population who feel they’re being pushed away from view in Wilmington’s business district.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A small, brown, endangered bat would become the “official state mammal” of America’s capital city under a proposed ordinance that will get a public hearing in January. The idea was proposed earlier this year by several Girl Scout troops after they studied the little brown bats, according to a D.C. Council statement. The creatures, known to scientists as myotis lucifugus, typically grow to about 3.5 inches tall with a wingspan of up to 11 inches. They are found in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, according to the Chesapeake Bay Program. Though small, the bats can fly up to 22 mph and eat up to 1,200 bugs per night, according to the legislation. The little brown bat population has been hurt by a fungal disease called white-nose syndrome, which kills bats by increasing the amount of energy used during hibernation, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: A big red navigation buoy that bounced along Atlantic waves for two years has beached in Florida, where it’s drawing attention. Crowds of spectators streamed to New Smyrna Beach over the weekend for a close-up view and some pictures with the navigational marker that some described as “the size of a truck,” news outlets report. The beacon came from South Carolina and has been displaced since 2017, said Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan Dickinson, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard Sector Jacksonville. “This one was from Sector Charleston,” Dickinson says. “We’re going to try to get it back up there.” Charleston is more than 300 miles north of New Smyrna Beach. The Coast Guard plans to bring in a crane sometime this week to remove the buoy. Officials say the move will depend on several factors, including the weather.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Coastal Georgia’s largest city is delaying a plan to swap its current police headquarters for a new building farther from downtown. The plan calls for the city to trade the current building for a new one that Savannah College of Art and Design would build at no cost to the city. The Savannah Morning News reports City Manager Pat Monahan is seeking the delay because part of the proposed new site may be needed for widening of a canal. Part of the 5-acre site could be needed to build a foundation to replace the current Talmadge Memorial Bridge. The Georgia Ports Authority has said the bridge isn’t tall enough to accommodate larger new container ships. There are also concerns about maintaining the historic nature of the current red-brick headquarters and maintaining a police presence downtown.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Protesters at the Mauna Kea Access Road removed barricades for the first time since July as the demonstrators against a giant telescope project shift their focus away from the construction site. The access road was fully reopened Saturday to all traffic except construction equipment for the Thirty Meter Telescope project, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Telescope opponents are planning a demonstration at the Capitol in Honolulu when the legislative session begins Jan. 15, they said. “The movement and clearing this road is only the beginning of where we’ve got to go on this issue here, and hopefully this is the start of that,” Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said. An international consortium wants to build the telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii’s tallest peak. But some Native Hawaiians believe the project will desecrate sacred land, and demonstrators blocked construction.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: Police say they’ve made no progress despite receiving hundreds of tips about two missing children whose parents aren’t cooperating with authorities. The Rexburg Police Department has eight officers who are following leads that have come in from across the country in their search to find Joshua Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, according to the East Idaho News. The children haven’t been seen since September. Rexburg police say the parents, Chad and Lori Daybell, are named as persons of interest because they never reported the kids missing, have repeatedly lied about where their children are – initially saying the boy with special needs was in Arizona – and aren’t cooperating with the investigation. The couple issued a statement through an attorney last week, saying they love their son and daughter and look forward to addressing “allegations once they have moved beyond speculation and rumor.” The couple married in recent months after both of their spouses died under unusual circumstances earlier this year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials say $11.5 million in city vehicle sticker debt has been forgiven in three months from a program started by Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Nearly 11,500 motorists applied for the program that began in October and followed an amnesty program for late penalties on sticker purchases. Lightfoot has touted the debt relief as one of several initiatives in her first year as mayor aimed at easing the burden on Chicago families. City residents have to buy a sticker for each car they own. Prices vary depending on vehicle type. It’s nearly $140 for a large passenger vehicle. Violators get ticketed with steep fines. Critics have said that the program has fallen short, as only a small fraction of the roughly 500,000 motorists with city sticker debt applied. Unpaid city sticker debt – which at one time could reach nearly $500 each with late fees – is the biggest source of ticket debt in the city, according to a WBEZ and ProPublica investigation.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Indiana University has started a yearlong test of using license plate reading cameras for parking regulation enforcement on its campus in the city. The project that began in November involves a camera mounted on a vehicle and comes as campus officials plan a switch from hang-tag parking passes to a system involving license plates registered by the parking permit holder. “It’s not really a pilot to evaluate if we want it,” campus parking operations manager Amanda Turnipseed says. “It’s to figure out how to do it the most efficient way and with the least amount of hardship on our end users.” Parking officials will consider issues such as how to track whether more than one vehicle registered to a permit are on campus at the same time and how to account for multiple people sharing a permit.\n\nIowa\n\nRockwell City: The city is the next victim in a growing list of small rural towns that have lost or are about to lose their only grocery store. The town of about 2,000 learned last week that Heartland Market, formerly known as South Side Grocery, will soon close, following the small chain’s closures in Manson, Rolfe, Rockwell and, soon, Manning. The closing will leave most of Calhoun County without a grocery store. A Facebook post last week notified shoppers that the store would close in the next “few weeks,” offering them 30% off groceries as it started the liquidation process. Owner Nick Graham would not specify a last day for the store. Mayor Phil Heinlen said the city received notice from an employee Tuesday, as soon as at least one employee apparently said they were told, setting the city in motion to contact chain stores to explore an alternative for the town.\n\nKansas\n\nNeodesha: This small southeast Kansas town hopes a new program offering free college tuition to graduates of the local high school will help attract new residents. A wealthy former resident of the town about 150 miles southwest of Kansas City, Kansas, announced the scholarship offer last month. Ben Cutler says he doesn’t think he would have been nearly as successful in life without his Neodesha upbringing in the 1950s and ’60s. He decided to create the college tuition program as a way to give back to his hometown. Cutler declined to say how much he donated, but he estimates it should be enough to cover at least 25 years of college costs for the town’s graduates. Cutler is a retired former CEO of USHealth Group, which provides health insurance to small businesses and the self-employed.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A partnership between Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Habitat for Humanity aims to lower families’ utility bills by giving them shares in a solar project. The utility’s solar share program allows ratepayers to purchase a share of a large solar field and get a credit on their utility bills for the solar energy the share generates, WKYU-FM reports. Solar share participants can also give their energy credits to another person or to a nonprofit. “And I hope they’ll consider this as an option as they look to make some kind of impactful contribution to Habitat and other nonprofits across our service territory during the holiday season and really all year round,” says LG&E Vice President of Customer Services Beth McFarland.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will be stocking 1- to 2-pound rainbow trout in 13 ponds statewide during January for kids and grown-ups to catch. It’s part of the Get Out and Fish! program put on by the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Foundation. The department put thousands of channel catfish into the ponds in the fall. Rainbow trout can be stocked only in cold and cool weather, according to a news release. There are four stocked sites in cities along I-20, from Turner’s Pond in Minden, through Grambling and Ruston to Kiroli Park in West Monroe. There’s one at William T. Polk Park in Vidalia and four in southwest to south-central Louisiana, from Purple Heart Memorial Park in Ragley through Jennings and Lafayette to Southside Regional Park in Youngsville. And four are in the southeast, from BREC’s Burbank Park in Baton Rouge through Walker and Hammond to Joe Brown Park in New Orleans.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: The state wants to find a way to keep more of the plastic used by agriculture greenhouses out of landfills with a new recycling program. The state is targeting low-density polyethylene, a clear film used to cover agricultural structures such as greenhouses and high tunnels. The state disposes of more than 30 tons of the plastic, and most of it goes to landfills, according to the University of Maine. University of Maine Cooperative Extensive is set to receive more than $38,000 from a Maine Department of Environmental Protection Waste Diversion Grant to develop a statewide pilot program to recycle the plastic, the university said. The goal is to collect at least a third of the state’s annual waste greenhouse plastic and work with an end-user with the ability to convert it for use in new materials. The university expects the volume of the plastic waste will increase, in part because of the growth of the hemp and cannabis markets.\n\nMaryland\n\nMiddletown: The average number of bushels of corn per acre is between 180 and 250. This year, Drew Haines of Middletown yielded over 422 bushels per acre, beating Maryland’s state corn yield record and winning first place in the National Corn Yield Contest in the no-till, non-irrigated corn category, the Frederick News-Post reports. “It’s turned into an addiction,” he says. No-till means no tilling was done other than the corn-planter itself going into the ground. Non-irrigated means there was no mechanical watering. “We rely on whatever Mother Nature gives us as far as water,” Haines says. The National Corn Yield Contest is a program of the National Corn Growers Association. Any NCGA member is eligible to apply for the contest, which has both national and state-level winners.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGloucester: Hundreds of people plunged into the chilly ocean Saturday to honor Peter Frates, the former college baseball player whose battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease helped spread the ALS ice bucket challenge. About 1,000 people showed up for the final “Plunge for Pete” at Good Harbor Beach, and more than half of those braved the frigid waters on what would have been Frates’ 35th birthday. The event, in its eighth year, raised money for the Pete Frates #3 Fund, which helped pay for Frates’ medical bills. “He is laughing so hard right now at me getting into the ocean,” said Frates’ wife, Julie, who participated in the plunge for the first time wearing the bikini she had on when she first met her husband. “This is the best birthday party he could ask for, and wherever he is, he is very grateful.”\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: A company that makes self-driving food delivery vehicles will begin testing them out in Ann Arbor this week with patrons from four restaurants. Ann Arbor-based Refraction AI makes the REV, an autonomous robot that’s 5 feet tall, with wheels and a fuselage that can hold delivery bags. The company will begin using its REVs on Friday to make meal deliveries from four restaurants to a test group of 300 customers in downtown Ann Arbor. Refraction AI hopes that its electric, 100-pound REV can make food deliveries for half the cost of existing delivery services like Grubhub, EatStreet and DoorDash, the Detroit News reports. If successful, the robots could open the door to metropolitan areas being serviced by self-driving vehicles that hustle meals, groceries and documents to customers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBloomington: Police were called to remove a group of 50 rowdy juveniles from the Mall of America over the weekend. Mall security had asked the young people to leave because they were disturbing other people, but the group refused, Bloomington Deputy Police Chief Mike Hartley said. Police arrived Friday night and escorted the group out. A couple of juveniles were cited for disorderly conduct, the Star Tribune reports. “It was a large group that was asked to leave. Once they weren’t going to leave … (Bloomington police) just assisted mall security in moving them out,” Hartley said.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A bar will be opening inside a hotel on campus at the University of Mississippi. The university received state approval for resort status for the Inn at Ole Miss, and that allows the sale of alcohol. The Oxford Eagle reports the current McCormick Cafe inside the hotel is being renovated. The 2,000-square-foot indoor and outdoor space will feature a bar handcrafted by Ben Napier, an Ole Miss alumnus. He and his wife, Erin, co-star of the HGTV show “Home Town,” live in Laurel, Mississippi, and frequently visit Oxford. The school’s football arena, Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, began selling alcohol for the first time Oct. 19 during the Ole Miss-Texas A&M game, and beer sales have continued at the Pavilion during basketball games.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A family that saw its application to grow medical marijuana rejected by the state is now suing, demanding a license to participate in Missouri’s fledgling medical cannabis industry. The lawsuit filed Friday by Paul Callicoat and his family, of Sarcoxie, came a day after the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services granted 60 licenses from the more than 500 companies that applied. The Callicoats, who had planned to open a cultivation facility called Sarcoxie Nursery, were not among those who won a license. The family’s lawsuit argues the state’s 60-license limit violates the state constitution’s “right to farm” amendment passed by voters in 2014. The lawsuit also challenges the state’s selection process that gave more points to businesses in high-unemployment ZIP codes, saying that “geographic bonus” was announced after the family had already paid a non-refundable $10,000 application fee.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A Montana outfitter has announced plans to purchase multiple electric bikes for rental use on a scenic mountain road in Glacier National Park. Glacier Guide and Montana Raft Company is already taking reservations for bike rentals and guided tours on Going-to-the-Sun Road in spring 2020, The Flathead Beacon reports. The decision comes months after the U.S. Secretary of the Interior ruled to allow powered bikes to be used in national parks, officials said. It is unclear what brand of e-bikes will be purchased, but the company is expected to buy at least 10 to start, company officials said. They have plans to make test trips with the bikes in April to see how they can withstand the elevating road, officials said. All bicyclists must obey speed limits and any other state traffic laws, authorities said.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: Students may receive two bachelor’s degrees from two colleges after four years in a new biology and agriculture program. Wayne State College and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln announced the program earlier this month. Students can earn a life sciences degree with a concentration in biology from Wayne and an applied science degree with concentrations in agriculture and natural resources from the Lincoln university. Tammy Evetovich, dean of the Wayne State School of Natural and Social Sciences, praised the flexible program, saying that “people can take it and do what they want with it.” The Norfolk Daily News reports students will spend three years at Wayne State’s School of Natural and Social Sciences and then finish with a year at UNL’s College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. Graduates will be prepared for jobs related to farming, ranching, parks and recreation and land management.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A nonprofit organization promoting vaccinations has canceled two events this month in Reno and Las Vegas after it said anti-vaccination activists harassed restaurant vendors hired to host the events. Immunize Nevada executive director Heidi Parker says several people posted bad reviews for each vendor for supporting the organization’s events on Facebook and Yelp. The comments were bringing down the overall review rating. Immunize Nevada reported the hecklers to Facebook and Yelp, which took down the comments. With sponsorships from groups such as the Community Health Alliance, Immunize Nevada booked the venues and made food arrangements several months in advance. The organization said it lost a few thousand dollars after canceling both events.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A bill up for consideration before the Legislature in 2020 would require school districts to offer lessons on climate change. The House bill would require at least 10 hours of climate education or a full semester of environmental education in high school and anywhere from two hours to eight hours for younger students. It would take effect July 1, 2021. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Chris Balch, a Democrat from Hillsborough, said some teachers incorporate climate change into their science curriculum, but it’s the state’s responsibility to prioritize it. “We need to have a common base of knowledge of what climate change is, how it works, how it happens, what we can do about it,” he told New Hampshire Public Radio. Nationally, many teachers report they shy away from the topic, not only because of issues with materials but also because of political sensitivities and uncertainty about where to introduce an issue that crosses so many disciplines.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEast Rutherford: Organizers are billing it as the largest gathering MetLife Stadium has ever hosted. But the throng of more than 92,000 men and women expected to pack the venue Wednesday aren’t gathering for a playoff game or New Year’s gala. They will celebrate having read the entire Babylonian Talmud from cover to cover in an event called Siyum HaShas. Learning the ancient, voluminous work of Jewish law and folklore is no simple feat: It takes participants seven and a half years to complete all 2,711 pages. Such a venture warrants a momentous celebration – in Hebrew, a siyum. The MetLife gathering will be the largest venue – organizers have erected seating and a large dais on the field – and an overflow crowd of 20,000 is expected at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Through satellite hookups, the event will be beamed to over 100 sites across the globe.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Creators of the popular video “Baby Shark,” whose “doo doo doo” song was played at the World Series in October and has been a viral hit with toddlers around the world, have released a Navajo version of the tune. Pinkfong, a brand of the South Korea company SmartStudy, announced it unveiled the new version Sunday after holding singing auditions on the Navajo Nation. “Łóó’ Hashkéii Awéé,” which loosely means “Navajo Baby Shark,” is the 20th language version of “Baby Shark,” SmartStudy marketing manager Kevin Yoon said in an email. The project was launched after Navajo Nation Museum director Manuelito Wheeler reached out to SmartStudy in September about translating “Baby Shark” into Navajo. The museum previously had lobbied for Navajo versions of the movies “Star Wars” and “Finding Nemo” that were eventually made.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: This year’s New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square will spotlight efforts to combat climate change when high school science teachers and students press the button that begins the famous 60-second ball drop and countdown to next year. “On New Year’s Eve, we look back and reflect on the dominant themes of the past year, and seek hope and inspiration as we look forward,” Times Square Alliance President Tim Tompkins said in a statement. The honorees, he said, “are working to solve this global problem through science.” Jared Fox, who teaches at the Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School, and seniors Ricardo Herrera and Diane Arevalo are working on a clean-air and greening project in the school’s Upper Manhattan neighborhood. Aida Rosenbaum, a Bronx Latin School teacher, and seniors Daniel Soto and Van Troy Ulloa led a fundraising walk to raise money for places without clean water.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The deadline to comment on how the state Wildlife Commission should manage more than 1,700 acres of new public game land is coming up this week. The commission has sought the public’s view of how to manage the 1,760-acre Dan River Game Land since September. The deadline to respond is Wednesday, says Jodie Owen, a commission spokeswoman. The opinions will help guide the management and activities on the game land, located 4 miles southwest of Eden on the Dan River, for the next 10 years. The state became the full owner of the property in the spring of 2018 after purchasing acreage from the Piedmont Land Conservancy, according to the News & Record of Greensboro. The commission’s plans include a canoe and kayak launch to provide a take-out for paddlers coming from other access points upstream and downstream.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: A local man is accused of threatening to “shoot up” a state government agency. Christopher Chase, 46, faces a felony terrorizing charge. According to a police affidavit, Chase allegedly threatened Workforce Safety and Insurance in social media posts, saying, “I want them all to suffer the way I have,” and “Gonna take out as many as I can before they kill me so they know what it feels like.” Police responded to a request for a welfare check after a caller saw the posts. Chase made his initial court appearance Thursday. His bail was set at $1,000 cash with a stipulation that he not have contact with the state agency, The Bismarck Tribune reports. He was not listed on the Burleigh Morton Detention Center roster Friday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The U.S. Census Bureau is seeking thousands of temporary workers to help conduct its 2020 count in the state. Workers are needed to interview residents and update address lists, The Columbus Dispatch reports. The Census Bureau also is seeking field supervisors, recruiting assistants, clerks and office supervisors for its eight field offices. The positions will pay between $14 and $23.50 an hour. Census Day is April 1. It is unclear how many people will be hired in the state. The Census Bureau hired 24,000 temporary workers for the 2010 count. The bureau is seeking about 88,000 applicants in Ohio and has received about 36,000 thus far. Job offers will be made between January and April, with some positions lasting through September. Information about Census Bureau jobs and qualifications is available online.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Department of Commerce is seeking additional money for an economic development fund dedicated to attracting businesses and jobs to the state. The department is requesting legislators appropriate $14 million next year to the Quick Action Closing Fund – a pot of money the governor can use to cover infrastructure and development costs for businesses relocating to the state. The request comes after the Legislature appropriated more money for the fund this year than ever before. At Gov. Kevin Stitt’s behest, legislators appropriated $14 million to the fund this year on top of a $5 million supplemental appropriation approved in March. “Cumulatively, that was more than we had put in there since the foundation of the program,” says Brent Kisling, the department’s executive director. “We’re just asking that we maintain that baseline of $14 million for another year so we can see that growth.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A plan that would require purchasing a permit before entering three of the state’s most popular wilderness areas has received a largely negative response. More than 13,700 comments were submitted on a proposal to charge $4 to $11 per day to enter the Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington wilderness areas beginning in 2020. The comments, which came from across the country, echo the idea that while action is needed to combat overcrowding and garbage on wilderness trails, the proposal is too costly and restrictive. “There is something amiss when an American citizen has to pay a fee to hike on their lands, which are really our birthright, not a commodity to be ‘sold,’ ” said George Nickus, executive director of Wilderness Watch.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city has appointed a new police chief to lead a troubled department that has been plagued by sexual harassment lawsuits and racial discrimination – issues she will be suited to tackle with “conviction,” Mayor Jim Kenney said Monday. Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney announced his choice of Portland, Oregon, Chief Danielle Outlaw to fill the job, which has been open since August, when the last commissioner abruptly resigned amid a scandal. Outlaw spent nearly two decades with the police department in Oakland, California, before being named Portland’s chief more than two years ago, becoming the first black woman to hold that job, as she is in the new Philadelphia position. Kenney said Outlaw will focus on addressing racism and gender discrimination and “horrid instances of sexual assault on fellow officers.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Firefighters are doing their part to keep city streets drunken-driver free by offering free rides home on New Year’s Eve. This is the sixth year that the city’s firefighters’ union has offered the Safe Night program, in which off-duty firefighters provides rides from bars and restaurants to private residences within city limits. The program will run from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 7 a.m. Wednesday. The union is urging patience to people requesting a ride because only a limited number of off-duty firefighters will be available. “It’s an opportunity to give back to our community by offering a free and safe ride,” IAFF Local 799 President Derek Silva says.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSt. Phillips Island: Guests will soon be able to rent a beach house that once belonged to billionaire Ted Turner’s family on a private island, state officials say. South Carolina State Parks is finishing rehabilitation work on the property and expects to open the site for rental starting in spring 2020, Duane Parrish, director of the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, told The Post and Courier. The four-bedroom, four-bathroom house sits on what was once the family compound on the 4,680-acre St. Phillips Island across the sound from Hilton Head Island. But there’s more work to do. The newspaper says there’s no bridge, electricity or water line to it, and restrooms are portable. Travel on the island is limited to sand trails through the forest, and the house is set almost 4 miles from the boat landing. Parks staff plan to run a tram though the island, among other upgrades.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The rain and snow that hit the city over the year’s final weekend was enough to make 2019 the wettest year in Sioux Falls history. So far this year, 39.27 inches of precipitation had fallen on Sioux Falls as of Sunday morning. That amount broke the previous record of 39.17 inches, set last year. The past two years have been the wettest in the history of the city. Annual precipitation totals date back to 1891. Over the course of that history, Sioux Falls has averaged 25.7 inches of precipitation a year. Steady rainfall throughout Saturday and a mix of rain, sleet and snow overnight clinched the record early Sunday morning in Sioux Falls, according to the National Weather Service. The precipitation broke daily rainfall records for Sioux Falls on Saturday and Sunday as well.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State parks are offering free, guided hikes on New Year’s Day. Free hikes will be available at all 56 state parks Jan. 1 with the exception of Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, which hosts a New Year’s Eve event in Nashville, state park officials said in a news release. Hikes are led by a park ranger and vary in degrees of difficulty. The free hikes are part of America’s State Parks First Day Hikes in all 50 states, officials said. State parks also offer free hikes on National Trails Day, National Public Lands Day, after Thanksgiving Day and to mark the coming of spring. More information can be found at the Tennessee State Parks website.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas business leaders say they’re all for college students pursuing their passions, even if it means majoring in contemporary dance, sculpture or something similarly esoteric. They’d just like to convey a few financial details first – like the probability of earning a bigger paycheck as a computer programmer or even a plumber. “A lot of people have no clue” how many jobs are available in various occupations and what they pay, said Tony Bennett, president of the Texas Association of Manufacturers. Beginning in the new year, wage and workforce statistics will have a higher profile during the application process for Texas colleges and universities under a measure backed by Bennett’s organization and other business groups around the state and approved by lawmakers during this year’s session of the Legislature. The law requires a “prominent link” to the data on the standardized electronic college application called ApplyTexas.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state is known for its high birth rate, but an ongoing lag has researchers wondering if it’s in a new era of lower fertility. The state’s demographers expected people to start having more children as they recovered from the Great Recession, but even with more people working and making more money, the state’s fertility rate has continued to drop, the Deseret News reports. Utah’s fertility rate fell to 2.03 births per woman last year – the lowest rate in more than 50 years, new census data shows. The state, which had the highest rate in the United States as recently as 2015, now sits behind North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska. The national fertility rate has fallen to a historic low of 1.73 births per woman.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Thirty-four people took advantage of the state’s aid-in-dying law in the most recent two-year period studied, according to a report released by the Vermont Department of Health. The report, which was submitted to the Legislature last week, covered the two years ending June 30. It found that of the 34 cases, 24 were from people with cancer; four had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease; three had other degenerative neurological diseases; and three were due to other events. Of the 34 people, 28 hastened their deaths using a drug prescription; five died of the underlying disease without taking a prescribed aid-in-dying drug; and the mechanism of death in one case was unknown, the report said. Since Vermont’s law, known formally as the Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act, passed in 2013, the law has been used 87 times.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As much of central Appalachia looks to reinvent itself amid the decline of coal, community leaders in mountainous southwest Virginia say they are seeing some early success by focusing on another natural resource: the Clinch River. The Clinch is the centerpiece of what will be one of Virginia’s newest state parks, thanks to a years­long grassroots effort. Advocates say the park will help protect the river, a biodiversity hot spot, and support a growing regional outdoor recreation and tourism industry. The generally gentle river – ideal for mellow floats during the summer, or canoeing, kayaking and fishing – has the highest concentration of rare aquatic species of any river in the United States, says Brad Kreps, an employee of The Nature Conservancy who has been involved for years in the push to create the park. State lawmakers have allocated about $5 million so far to the Clinch River State Park.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state’s age for legally purchasing tobacco was set to increase from 18 to 21 beginning Jan. 1, but a change in federal law has already effectively raised the age. The state Liquor and Cannabis Board said that prior to Jan. 1, state officers encountering retailers selling to people under 21 were to provide education instead of pursuing enforcement, The Seattle Times reports. Congress inserted the provision raising the purchase age into an emergency spending bill signed by the president Dec. 20. New federal legislation does not normally take effect immediately, but the change was made to existing law, a Food and Drug Administration spokesman said. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee requested that more regulations on vaping products be adopted in the next legislative session, which begins Jan. 13.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharles Town: A historic home that played an important role in the area’s African American history is changing hands as a way of continuing to preserve it. The Webb-Blessing House was the only residence owned by a free African American family living in Charles Town before the Civil War, The Journal reports. Since 2003, it had been owned by the Jefferson County Black History Preservation Society. When group members decided they were no longer able to take care of it, Friends of Webb-Blessing House stepped forward to help. The property officially changed hands Friday. Doug Perks, chair of the Friends group’s steering committee, told the paper the group will maintain the building and tell its story. That includes the story of the Webb family that built the house before the Civil War and continued to live in it until 1866, when it was purchased by John Frederick Blessing, Perks said. Blessing was a confectioner who supplied meals to John Brown after Brown was incarcerated in the Jefferson County Jail, Perks said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Elections Commission deadlocked Monday over whether to remove the voter registrations of more than 200,000 people in response to a judge’s order. The commission’s inability to reach a consensus means the voters will stay on the rolls for at least the time being. An appeal in the case is ongoing, and the commission faces a separate lawsuit that is trying to make sure people are not pulled from the rolls. The three Republicans on the commission sought to take many of them off the rolls, but they were blocked by the three Democrats on the panel. It was the second time in as many weeks that the commission broke down along party lines over the lawsuit, which has drawn national attention because of Wisconsin’s top-tier status in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A new state rule seeks to reduce a record number of applications for permits to drill oil and gas wells. The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission rule makes it easier for other developers and mineral owners to challenge permit applications and contest permits when drilling doesn’t begin right away. Wyoming Oil and Gas Supervisor Mark Watson says the rule encourages competition. Recently, companies with no immediate plans to drill have been applying for multiple permits to secure control over potential drilling areas in Wyoming. The commission received almost 70,000 drilling permit applications in just three years. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the commission faced a backlog of thousands of permit applications and protests from competing operators. The new rule took effect Dec. 20.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/19/nativity-run-bag-oslag-kapu-aloha-news-around-states/40643943/", "title": "Nativity on the run, 'Bag O'Slag': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: Whooping cranes are back at the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge. The International Crane Foundation says that, for the second year in a row, wild-hatched chick W7-17 was the first to arrive at the refuge in Decatur. The 2-year-old arrived Nov. 9. She’s among about 100 whoopers in a flock taught to migrate from Wisconsin to Florida by following ultralight aircraft. Crane foundation outreach assistant A.J. Binney says about one-third of them winter in Alabama. So do about 20,000 sandhill cranes. A tracking map shows about 14 whooping cranes at the refuge. The refuge website says whoopers have been seen around the visitor center and wildlife observation building in recent years. The refuge’s annual Festival of the Cranes will be held Jan. 11-12.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaskans have experienced both a record-high temperature and a record amount of snowfall in the same day. The Anchorage Daily News reports the Municipality of Anchorage saw snowfall of more than a foot Saturday after tying a temperature record set in 1967. The National Weather Service says the city tied the high-temperature record by reaching 45 degrees Fahrenheit about 3 a.m. The weather service says southeast winds blew warm air into the city before the winds subsided, temperatures dropped, and snow fell. Snow levels at the weather service’s office broke the 1958 record of 8.3 inches by a tenth of an inch. Officials say the snow varied from 5 inches in the city to more than 12 inches in nearby Eagle River.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: With climate change cranking up the heat and intensifying droughts, more than 400 people from across the state gathered Friday and Saturday to brainstorm solutions for reducing planet-warming pollution and preparing for a hotter, drier future. Among them were young activists who see climate change as the defining issue for their generation. The time to act is now, they said. “This is rapid change, and we should do something about it before it’s too late,” said Alicia Rose Clouser, a 13-year-old eighth grader from Sinagua Middle School in Flagstaff and a member of the Navajo Nation. “My people will be suffering for generations on if we don’t do something.” The two-day conference at Northern Arizona University brought the students and teen activists together with academics, health officials, tribal representatives, environmentalists, representatives of farming businesses, urban planners and city officials, and people from the community who said they wanted to be part of the discussion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: State highway officials have designated a stretch of Arkansas 22 as “True Grit Trail” in honor of the classic novel by Arkansas native Charles Portis. The state Department of Transportation unveiled the commemorative signs Thursday along the highway in Fort Smith and Dardanelle. The signs came about after state lawmakers unanimously approved legislation earlier this year. The bills, sponsored by Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville and Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch, said that part of the highway should be designated as True Grit Trail to honor Portis’ 1968 novel, which has served as the basis of two feature films.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A month after two men were arrested at an illicit marijuana farm on public land in the state’s wilderness, authorities are assessing the environmental impact and cleanup costs at the site. A group including Forest Service rangers, scientists and conservationists hiked into the so-called trespass grow where 9,000 cannabis plants were illegally cultivated in the Shasta Trinity National Forest. Officials say trees were clear-cut, waterways diverted, and the ground littered with containers of fertilizer and rodenticide. The cleanup efforts are spearheaded by the group Cannabis Removal on Public Lands Project. CROP is a coalition of conservation organizations, tribes, elected officials, police and federal land managers. Also lending its support is the legal cannabis industry, which says it’s being undercut by the criminal market.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: The leader of this western Colorado community that relies on tourism is vowing to do everything he can to stop the proposed expansion of a nearby limestone quarry. The Glenwood Springs Post Independent reports Mayor Jonathan Godes called the proposal by RMR Industrial a “regional threat” in announcing the city’s campaign against it Friday. He said the city is committing $1.25 million to fight the expansion but promised to provide any other needed resources. The Bureau of Land Management is starting an environmental review of the proposal to expand the quarry from 23 to 321 acres and remove millions of tons of rock a year. RMR didn’t respond to requests for comment on the campaign but previously said the quarry is a “healthy commercial alternative” that will employ 100 people.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: A new report says the state has had the most metal theft insurance claims in the country. The National Insurance Crime Bureau issued a report recently that found that Connecticut had the most metal theft insurance claims per capita in 2017 and 2018. The state had almost 32 theft claims for every 100,000 residents. According to the report, thieves mostly steal copper and metal piping. The bureau says any place where copper is present is at risk of being stolen. Bureau spokesman Frank Scafidi says this kind of theft is typically driven by “an urgent need for quick cash” and drugs. According to a Council of State Governments report, the national number of metal thefts is probably higher because no states comprehensively track that crime.\n\nDelaware\n\nSmyrna: Police are trying to identify the remains of a young girl who was found dead and released facial reconstruction images Monday of what the girl may have looked like when she was alive. The girl, who was between the ages of 2 and 5, was found in September near the Little Lass softball fields in Smyrna. Police said she was dead for several weeks, if not longer, when she was found. The girl had slightly wavy brown hair and was Caucasian or Hispanic. She also may have suffered from a chronic disease. Smyrna police are working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Delaware Division of Forensic Science. Anyone with information should contact detective Bill Davis at 302-653-3490.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A bill that would decriminalize sex work in the nation’s capital won’t move forward this year. The Washington Post reports the bill’s death comes after an emotional hearing that lasted 14 hours. Thousands of emails about the bill revealed a deep divide between district residents. Councilman Charles Allen, who chairs the committee that heard the testimony, says the bill lacked the support to pass a committee vote. Councilman David Grosso wrote the bill in collaboration with a coalition of district sex workers and says it should be brought to the ballot box. He says the bill was undermined by Chairman Phil Mendelson, who has opposed the bill since its initial iteration was proposed in 2017. Mendelson disagreed, saying his office primarily heard negative feedback about the bill.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A dozen municipal utilities in the Sunshine State are breaking ground on one of the largest municipal solar projects in the nation. The utilities broke ground Monday in the Orlando area for the project that will have 900,000 solar panels installed at two sites. Jacob Williams, the CEO of Florida Municipal Power Agency, a wholesaler, says the utilities can make solar power more affordable by working together. When it is finished, the project is expected to be able to power the equivalent of 45,000 Florida homes. The municipalities involved are in Alachua County, Bartow, Fort Pierce, Homestead, Jacksonville Beach, Key West, Kissimmee, Lake Worth Beach, Ocala, Orlando, Wauchula and Winter Park.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Two historic black churches founded in the 1880s have been listed among the state’s most threatened historic buildings. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation released its annual list of “places in peril,” including Antioch Baptist Church in tiny Taliaferro County, which was founded by freed slaves in 1886 and features striking Gothic-revival towers. The Georgia Trust says water damage is taking a toll inside and outside the church, which could face more neglect because regular services are no longer held there. Asbury United Methodist Church is the only African American United Methodist church in Savannah’s Victorian District. The 1887 building still has an active congregation, but water damage has left portions of the building unusable. The Georgia Trust says the congregation is struggling to raise money for repairs.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahuku: The ability of protesters to block construction of a giant telescope on Hawaii’s tallest mountain is inspiring efforts to stop other contentious projects across the state. Since July, protesters have stalled construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea. Leaders of fights against a wind farm and the redevelopment of a beach park say they are employing similar methods to those used at Mauna Kea. Organizers of the movements say they are rooted in a philosophy of peace and nonviolence known in Hawaiian as kapu aloha. The movements share several traits. Like on the Big Island mountain, there are protest camps on Oahu featuring a large tent with food and supplies. They even have so-called universities offering lessons and workshops on subjects ranging from civil disobedience to pounding taro, a popular root vegetable in Hawaii.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal authorities say a lawsuit seeking to ban black bear hunting using bait in national forests in Idaho and Wyoming to protect grizzly bears should be dismissed. The U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in documents filed Friday say the decision to allow using bait to attract bears should continue to be made by the states in which the national forests are located. Western Watersheds Project, WildEarth Guardians and Wilderness Watch filed the lawsuit in June, contending the federal agencies are violating environmental laws because black bear hunters using bait have killed at least eight threatened grizzly bears since 1995 in national forests. Idaho, Wyoming and the hunting group Safari Club International have intervened in the case on the side of the federal government.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has named recipients of the 2020 Order of Lincoln, the state’s highest honor for professional achievement and public service. Pritzker announced honorees Scott Altman, originally from Pekin, a former NASA astronaut; Paul “Doug” Collins of Benton, an NBA All-Star and coach; and Robert “Robb” Fraley of Hoopeston, a former Monsanto Co. executive. Other honorees are Donald F. McHenry of East St. Louis, former United Nations ambassador and permanent representative; Dr. Joanne C. Smith, president and CEO of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab for physical medicine and rehabilitation; and Chicago native Mavis Staples, a rhythm and blues and gospel singer and civil rights activist. The recipients will be honored in April 2020 at Illinois State University in Normal.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie: Mayor Dennis Tyler is accused of accepting a $5,000 bribe in exchange for what federal authorities said was “steering lucrative excavation work to a local contractor.” The 76-year-old Tyler was indicted last Wednesday by a U.S. District Court jury on a count of theft of public funds. The indictment was then sealed, setting the stage for the mayor’s arrest by FBI agents Monday morning at his northside Muncie home. According to the indictment, Tyler received the cash from Tracy Barton, the Muncie Sanitary District’s superintendent of sewer maintenance and engineering, for “awarding of contracts under Tyler’s influence.” The charge carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence and $250,000 fine. Tyler appeared at an initial hearing Monday and was then released from custody. His trial is set for Jan. 21.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A jury has awarded $1.4million to a Burmese immigrant who wanted a circumcision but instead got a vasectomy. The jury leveled a $2 million judgment against Dr. Kevin Birusingh, who performed the vasectomy. But jurors decided the man who filed the lawsuit, Zaw Zaw, was 30% responsible. Zaw is a 41-year-old refugee from Myanmar. He sued in November 2017, nearly two years after the errant procedure. Birusingh’s attorney says Zaw, who is not fluent in English, signed two informed consents that were translated into Burmese and completed four consultations before undergoing the procedure. The lawsuit says there’s no word for “vasectomy” in Burmese. Zaw’s attorney, Marc Harding, says a doctor’s referral documents showed Zaw was seeking a circumcision.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Authorities discovered a camel, a cow and a donkey roaming together along a road in a grouping reminiscent of a Midwestern Christmas Nativity scene. The Goddard Police Department asked for help Sunday in locating the owners of the “three friends traveling together (towards a Northern star).” Police said in a Facebook post that if they couldn’t find the owners, they would be “halfway toward a live Nativity this Christmas season.” Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Lt. Tim Meyers says the animals belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. One person who replied to the Facebook post inquired, “Are there 3 wise looking men near?” Another speculated that they “may lead you to the Second Coming.” Goddard is about 15 miles west of Wichita.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The University of Kentucky’s Appalachian Center is hosting a student-led series of events designed to bring awareness to water issues in eastern Kentucky and beyond. The events running through Thursday focus on ecology, infrastructure and bottled water, and they highlight organizations working on water-related issues. The Appalachian Center is based in the university’s College of Arts and Sciences. Among the events include a Tuesday screening of the film “Water Stories: Martin County,” followed by a panel discussion in the William T. Young Library UK Athletics Auditorium. The speakers will include water activists and Martin County residents Nina and Mickey McCoy. Other speakers include Ricki Draper, a community engagement coordinator and Madison Mooney, a master’s student in the UK College of Social Work.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Extensive Army training will close two wildlife management areas near Fort Polk to hunters over the Thanksgiving weekend. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said in a news release that the Fort Polk-Vernon and Peason Ridge Wildlife Management Areas will be closed to hunting from Nov. 29 through Dec. 1. The Fort Polk-Vernon WMA is in central Vernon Parish near Leesville. Peason Ridge is in northern Vernon Parish, southeastern Sabine Parish and southwestern Natchitoches Parish near Simpson. The department notes that deer hunts will remain open in the Kisatchie National Forest and three other wildlife management areas in the region: Clear Creek near Leesville, West Bay in Allen Parish near Oakdale, and Sabine, in Sabine Parish, near Many.\n\nMaine\n\nFarmington: There’s support for changing the University of Southern Maine’s name to the University of Maine at Portland. The vote Monday by the University of Maine System trustees in Farmington authorizes the system’s leadership to seek approval from the Legislature for the name change. Chairman James Erwin said the change would clarify the university’s identity and improve its marketability. The name change initiative was launched a year ago as a means to attract out-of-state students. Market research showed that out-of-staters don’t know where USM is located and that placing “Portland” in the name would increase interest.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Baltimore Museum of Art will only add artwork created by women to its permanent collection in 2020. Museum director Christopher Bedford announced the policy Thursday, saying something radical must be done to rectify centuries of imbalance. The museum acquired its first work by a female artist in 1916, just two years after it was founded and several years before women gained the right to vote. Today, only 4% of the 95,000 pieces in its permanent collection were created by women. News outlets report each of the museum’s exhibits will be strongly tied to women. Nineteen will showcase art solely by women, including at least one of whom is transgender. Bedford says the museum is working to “correct our own canon” and address historical blind spots.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state Senate is preparing to debate a bill to create a ban on all carry-out plastic bags at checkout from retail stores. The bill would require retailers to charge at least 10 cents for a recycled paper bag. Five cents would go to the city or town for enforcement of the ban. The remainder would go to the retailer to cover the cost of the paper bags. More than 100 Massachusetts communities have already passed plastic bag bans. Democratic Sen. President Karen Spilka said she took a personal interest in the ban after a family trip this summer to Vancouver and Alaska, where she learned sea animals can starve to death because of the amount of plastic in their stomachs. The Senate will debate the bill Wednesday.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city’s Civil Rights, Inclusion and Opportunity office is partnering with the owners of a downtown tavern and a Detroit resident on a discussion about racial issues. The city says “Let’s Talk About Race” will be held Thursday at the Checker Bar. It follows the firing of a white Checker Bar employee because of mistreatment of a black patron over his race. Organizers say the discussion will fuel a needed dialogue aimed at the history and roots of racial discrimination in the city, with a goal of building bridges between communities and “champions against racial discrimination.” Checker Bar owner Tim Tharpe says the incident has provided “an outstanding opportunity to have a deeper, more meaningful conversation to make Detroit’s business community even more inclusive.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: County officials say they will pay for additional help to examine about 1,700 rape kits that have never been tested, some of which date back 30 years. The city announced Friday that it discovered the untested kits in July when the department was doing an inventory. Deputy Police Chief Erick Fors estimates it will likely take two years to get them tested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says the county will fund an additional DNA analyst position at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to help speed up the process. Freeman says victims who have questions should contact Vernona Boswell, the county’s sexual assault victim advocate. The number revealed Friday is nearly nine times more than the 194 untested kits the city disclosed it had in 2015.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Enrollment is down at the University of Mississippi for the third straight year. The Oxford Eagle reports 2019 enrollment numbers for all six Ole Miss campuses show a 3.5% decrease from 2018. That’s the highest percentage drop over the past three years. Numbers released by the Institute of Higher Learning show the system now has 22,273 students, which is a decline of 817 people from last year. Chancellor Glenn Boyce says recruiting students is tough nationally, and the university is working to improve through investments in technology, marketing and recruiting. Statistics show enrollment at rival Mississippi State University rose slightly, increasing by 1.1% to 22,226 students. Enrollment is down overall at Mississippi universities, declining 1.6% from last year to a total of 29,193 students.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State officials are stepping up enforcement of laws that ban selling vaping products to minors. The move is part of a state campaign launched Monday to deter young people from vaping. Missouri’s health department so far has reported two vaping-related deaths. Alcohol and Tobacco Control agents are prioritizing inspections at stores that sell vaping products. The division’s state supervisor, Dottie Taylor, says about 83% of stores are currently checking identification cards and refusing sales to minors. State officials are also using YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat to warn teenagers about the risks of vaping. Gov. Mike Parson says it’s up to lawmakers to consider whether to restrict flavored electronic cigarettes when they return to the Capitol in January. Parson didn’t say whether he’d support such a ban when asked Monday.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Environmental regulators have put a halt to a business association’s sale of sandwich bags of mining waste advertised as a “Bag O’Slag.” Environmental Protection Agency officials overseeing the Superfund cleanup of pollution from decades of smelter operations in Anaconda came across the potentially toxic tchotchkes for sale by the city’s chamber of commerce. The slag contains small amounts of arsenic and lead. Mary Johnston, the chamber’s executive director, said Monday that the EPA asked the group to stop selling the black slag in a resealable bag and gave it some alternatives. Anaconda’s golf course, which has slag in its sand traps, offers slag and a golf ball in a sealed container as a souvenir. Johnston says the chamber sold up to 40 bags a summer for $2 apiece.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Trees around the perimeter of Zorinsky Lake Park will be cut down over the next few years as a result of a directive from Washington. The 30-foot corridor is expected to total about 40 acres of trees, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The plan by the Army Corps of Engineers has angered some property owners, while others welcome it. The federal government owns the land where the lake, built for flood control, is situated. The City of Omaha operates and maintains the park. The trees are being removed to better delineate the park’s boundaries. A number of homeowners around the lake say they are stunned by the decision. The loss of trees around the park will irreparably harm their views, they say, as well as lower their property values, damage habitat and alter the natural qualities of a park that the public has come to love.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The federal government wants a judge to reject the state’s request for a court order to remove weapons-grade plutonium from a site north of Las Vegas, arguing that officials have promised no more material will be shipped to the state. In documents filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Reno, the federal government brands as “conjectural” or “hypothetical” state claims that residents are harmed by radiation from the one-half metric ton of plutonium secretly trucked a year ago from South Carolina to Nevada. The decision cannot be undone, the material is already in the state, and the federal government has sovereign immunity, meaning the state can’t force the federal government to act, the motion contends. The Department of Energy “routinely and safely transports nuclear materials into and out of Nevada and stores classified amounts of plutonium in Nevada,” it says.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The quadrennial chaos has quieted down over at the New Hampshire secretary of state’s office with the closing of the filing period for the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Between Oct. 30 and Friday, a total of 50 candidates signed paperwork and paid $1,000 each to get their names on the 2020 ballot – 33 Democrats and 17 Republicans. That’s compared to the 42 names voters saw 100 years ago, the first time New Hampshire held the nation’s earliest primary. Back then, voters selected delegates to the nominating conventions, rather than voting for the candidates themselves. For the 2016 election, 58 candidates got on New Hampshire’s ballot. The all-time high for candidates came in 1992, when 61 signed up.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: After nearly two years of back-and-forth over legalizing marijuana, legislative leaders announced Monday that legal weed is heading to the polls, setting up a pivotal ballot question in the 2020 election. If voters approve the bill, New Jersey would become the 12th state to legalize marijuana for adult use. All but two other states – Vermont and Illinois – have legalized weed via ballot measures. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, introduced a constitutional amendment that he expects to appear on the ballot in the 2020 election. Sweeney and Sen. Nicholas Scutari, who sponsored the original New Jersey legal weed bill, said they simply couldn’t find enough support in the Senate to get a marijuana legalization law passed.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A ceremonial Native American shield has been welcomed back by tribal leaders, in the culmination of a years­long international campaign to reclaim the sacred object that held a place in a cycle of ceremonies until it vanished from a mesa-top indigenous village in the 1970s. Nearly four years ago, the shield surfaced as an auction item in Paris, prompting tribal leaders to begin making public appeals for it to be pulled from bidding and returned to them. U.S. and Acoma Pueblo officials announced Monday that an FBI agent delivered the shield from Paris last week following a multiagency effort that involved U.S. senators, diplomats and prosecutors. It will be formally returned to Acoma Pueblo after a judge dismisses a civil forfeiture case that prosecutors filed to secure the shield’s return, U.S. Attorney John Anderson said. “It will be a day of high emotion and thanksgiving,” Acoma Pueblo Gov. Brian Vallo said ahead of the expected return.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: Reports of racism at Syracuse University have resulted in a student sit-in that was in its sixth day Monday, a suspension of fraternity events and an offer of as much as $50,000 in reward money. Administrators on Sunday suspended one fraternity, along with social events for the others, after the latest report the night before. An African American student filed a complaint saying she was verbally harassed by people identified as members and guests of the suspended fraternity. The slurs followed several unsolved discoveries of graffiti and vandalism in recent weeks that administrators say have targeted Jews, Asians and black students. State agencies have joined the investigation. Students have staged a protest at the campus wellness center since Nov. 13 to demand stronger diversity programming.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper has signed into law bills designed to help his cash-strapped Department of Transportation and the continued recovery from hurricanes Florence, Matthew and Dorian. Cooper on Monday signed the measures, the last pieces of legislation on his desk from the General Assembly session that ended Friday. The Legislature reconvenes in mid-January. DOT’s cash balance had fallen due to unprecedented hurricane repairs, legal settlements over rights of way and project overruns. The bill directs $100 million to the agency for past and natural disasters, forgives a $90 million loan and allows an extra $100 million in road-building bonds. A separate disaster-relief law locates $180 million in state funds, most of which would meet federal matching requirements and create a Dorian state recovery program for displaced residents.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The U.S. Bureau of Prisons says an inmate walked away from a Fargo facility, and his whereabouts are unknown. Authorities say 30-year-old Juan Francisco Martinez walked away from Centre Inc. early Sunday morning. Authorities say he was serving a federal sentence for a 2015 conviction of felon in possession of a firearm. Martinez was transferred from Lee United States Prison in Virginia to Fargo in August to serve the remainder of his sentence. He was due for release in February. Center Inc.’s website says it is a “private nonprofit agency that provides rehabilitative services to individuals to achieve social re-integration.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two ride-share companies are urging the state to resume requiring front license plates. Uber and Lyft submitted letters last week to Republican Senate President Larry Obhof in support of legislation that would again make it mandatory for Ohio drivers to affix license plates to both the front and back of their vehicles. The companies cite safety concerns. Both urge their riders to confirm the license plate number on a phone app before entering a ride-share vehicle. A 21-year-old University of South Carolina student was murdered earlier this year by the driver of a car she mistakenly thought was an Uber vehicle. A provision removing Ohio’s front plate requirement was included in the state transportation budget passed earlier this year. It is set to take effect in July.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State veterinary officials say a horse at Remington Park has been euthanized after testing positive for equine herpesvirus-1. Assistant state veterinarian Dr. Michael Herrin said Friday that the horse was euthanized last Tuesday, and the barn where it was housed is under quarantine for 14 days. All horses remaining in the quarantined barn will remain there and will be monitored daily for symptoms of EHV-1, which include fever, a lack of coordination, and weakness or paralysis of the legs. The disease is not transmitted to humans but is highly contagious to horses and is generally spread through coughing and sneezing.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Oregon State University will use a $3.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation to study pollution from tiny plastics and its impact on aquatic life. The university said Monday that scientists will develop tools and methods for evaluating micro- and nanoplastics in everything from the ocean to estuaries. Research will focus on the impact of tiny plastics on an estuary fish called the inland silversides and on oyster larvae off the Oregon coast. Another goal of the project is establishing a Pacific Northwest Consortium on Plastics – to include government agencies, non-governmental organizations and grassroots groups – to encourage the reduction of marine pollution. Results of OSU’s plastics research will be displayed at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland the future.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania State University’s president says he is working to counter difficult national and state enrollment trends that could put pressure on even a financially healthy school like Penn State. President Eric Barron says almost every county in Pennsylvania has seen a decline in the number of high school graduates, and those graduates are less likely to go to college. To fight those trends, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports Barron told trustees Friday that the university has created a task force to focus on recruiting international students, including from areas such as South America and Africa. Penn State also is sending admission staff to recruit in growing areas domestically, including California, Florida and Texas. However, Barron says the university will keep its commitment to a majority enrollment of Pennsylvania residents.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., says a land trust in the state has been awarded $600,000 in federal funding to help beginning farmers. Reed says the Southside Community Land Trust won a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant to help beginning farmers access resources and training. Reed toured the land trust’s 50-acre Urban Edge Farm bordering Cranston and Johnston last Tuesday. It serves as a hub for small-scale, environmentally sustainable commercial agriculture. Thirteen farmers operate at Urban Edge. New farmers are invited there to learn how to raise and market crops. Reed says the grant helps “plant the seeds for future success.” The land trust says it has used federal funding to help 27 people begin farming and to train another 79 beginning farmers in the past three years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state says more than half a million loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings have made it to the sea during a record-breaking year, despite losses during Hurricane Dorian. The Post and Courier reports that preliminary data from the state Natural Resources Department counts about 525,500 turtles that emerged from their nests. The previous record was set in 2016, when eggshell counts showed about 396,400 turtles emerged. This year’s numbers are still being verified. Though the department says all sea turtle species found in South Carolina are threatened, the newspaper says state, federal and citizen efforts dating back to the 1970s could be reversing the once gradual decline. Hundreds of volunteers help mark and monitor the nests through a recovery program, along with biologists who relocate and cage in endangered nests.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A university researcher says it might someday be necessary to pipe Missouri River water to the city. The Rapid City Journal reports Kurt Katzenstein presented his findings to the West Dakota Water Development District last week. Katzenstein is an associate professor of geology and geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology. He says the 171-mile pipeline could cost up to $1.87 billion, making it a long-term idea that could require funding from Congress. Katzenstein says projections indicate the Rapid City area could have enough water from local sources to sustainably meet demand for the next 100 years if average precipitation levels prevail. But he says the day will come when local water supplies are insufficient.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s education commissioner says the new school vouchers for private education will be considered federally taxable income for parents. After confirming the requirement to lawmakers Monday, Commissioner Penny Schwinn told reporters the Board of Education, attorney general’s office and program rulemaking officials helped make the determination. Schwinn said officials will have to examine the taxable income of families as a result, given income limits to receive vouchers worth up to $7,300 annually. Participating families cannot exceed twice the federal income eligibility for free school lunch. The law says the vouchers “do not constitute income of a parent of a participating student” under Tennessee law. That doesn’t affect federal taxes. Gov. Bill Lee’s administration is hoping to begin the program next year. It’s limited to Shelby and Davidson counties.\n\nTexas\n\nCollege Station: More than 1,000 people have attended a memorial to honor the 12 people who died when a tower of logs collapsed at Texas A&M University 20 years ago. The Eagle reports that the ceremony Monday at the university’s Bonfire Memorial featured performances of “Spirit of Aggieland,” “Amazing Grace” and “The Aggie War Hymn.” Eleven university students and one former student died Nov. 18, 1999, when a 40-foot bonfire structure holding about 5,000 logs collapsed. Twenty-seven other students were injured. Janice Kerlee, the mother of a student who died, said those who died were “extraordinary young people” known for their smiles and love for people. Texas A&M President Michael K. Young says he hopes Monday’s ceremony brings solace to the loved ones of those who died.\n\nUtah\n\nEagle Mountain: A high school student who lost both her parents to heart attacks has been nominated for a prestigious scholarship on the strength of her idea for a CPR assistance device. The Daily Herald reports Kennedy Hall’s idea is to create a device that fits over the nose and mouth and creates artificial breaths for a person. Hall says many people have a basic idea of how to give CPR but don’t know exactly how to do it. She says a machine like she’s envisioning might have helped her parents. Hall, a senior at Cedar Valley High School in Eagle Mountain, was chosen as the school’s nominee for the Career and Technical Education Presidential Scholarship Award. She says she hopes to attend Utah State University and become a trauma surgeon.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: Cross country skiers in the area will have a new warming hut available for use this winter. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the warming hut that was built at the Windham Regional Career Center was brought to the Brattleboro Country Club just in time for the 2019-20 ski season. For years skiers used a structure at the country club, but it’s no longer available. So the country club offered the Brattleboro Outing Club another location for a warming hut. The outing club bought the 14-by-36-foot unfinished tiny house built by the Construction Trades Program. Over the past several months, the foundation was built, and the club won regulatory approval for the hut.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Health officials say the number of fatal overdoses from methamphetamine use in the state has risen over the past three years. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Virginia Department of Health’s Office of Chief Medical Examiner says deadly meth overdoses rose from 88 people in 2017 to 127 people in 2018. The office projects 150 people will die of a meth overdose this year. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Washington Division spokeswoman Katherine Hayek says meth from Mexico brought into the U.S. is cheap and of high quality, which is a part of the problem. She also says fentanyl is sometimes mixed into meth and cocaine. Numbers from the Virginia Department of Health say almost half of meth overdose deaths in the state last year had fentanyl causing or contributing to death.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Children’s Hospital says 10 of its operating rooms will now remain closed through January to deal with an Aspergillus mold outbreak. KOMO reports the hospital says it will immediately install what it called custom in-room HEPA filtration in those 10 operating rooms and two equipment storage rooms. The installation was scheduled to be complete by July, but the hospital says it will now be fully installed by the end of January. The latest discovery marks the second time the fungus has been detected in operating rooms at Seattle Children’s Hospital. The previous outbreak led to at least five infections and one death, hospital officials said at the time. It is still not clear what caused the mold to resurface this time, but an investigation is underway by the hospital and its regulator, the State Department of Health.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nElkins: Members of the Polish Territorial Defense Forces have been training with the West Virginia National Guard and Special Forces near Elkins. The Inter-Mountain reports the Polish troops were participating in the Guard’s Ridge Runner program, which focuses on irregular warfare. Olga Krawcyzk-Majeran, the public affairs officer for the exercise, tells the paper a group of more than 100 Polish troops arrived for training Nov. 1. She says it is the third trip to West Virginia for Territorial Defense Forces troops. The TDF was established in 2017 and includes more than 22,000 soldiers. Its role is similar to that of the National Guard, supporting local communities and serving as the reserve base for other Polish forces.\n\nWisconsin\n\nHartland: A girl with an inoperable brain tumor who received tens of thousands of pictures of her favorite animal from strangers has died at age 8. Emma Mertens loved dogs. So after she was diagnosed in January, family and friends sent photos of their dogs to the Hartland girl. And after some social media posts, the photos, letters and gifts from around the world started pouring in to Emma. In March, 40 police dogs and their handlers from around Wisconsin paid a special visit to Emma at her home. Emma’s parents asked well-wishers to support her foundation at emmalovesdogs.org, and in September it made its first gift – a protective vest for the Racine County Sheriff’s Department K-9 officer, Stax. Her family says Emma died Sunday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State and tribal officials are working to ensure Native Americans are accurately counted in the 2020 census. The Casper Star-Tribune reports advocates and officials are consulting with tribal leaders and planning an advertising campaign to attract attention to the U.S. Census Bureau’s canvassing efforts. Officials say they hope the outreach leads to a more accurate count of Native American residents in Wyoming, who are believed to have been under-counted in the past. Census data says 2.7% of Wyoming’s population identifies as Native American. The figures indicate about 27,000 people live on the Wind River Reservation west of Casper and off-reservation trust land, with about 7,800 identifying as Native American. The Census Bureau says American Indians and Alaska Natives living on reservations were undercounted by nearly 5% in 2010.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/12/26/rare-black-rhino-born-dengue-fever-santa-lady-disputed-lincoln-hat-news-around-states/40887925/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTown Creek: Warning sirens failed to sound before a tornado struck a north Alabama community last week, killing two people, but officials said it probably wouldn’t have mattered even if they had. The area where an EF-2 tornado hit near Town Creek is too far away from warning sirens to have made a difference for the victims even if they went off, said Johnny Cantrell, director of the Lawrence County Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said a tornado touched down Dec. 16 south of Town Creek, went over a mountain and dipped down again before destroying everything in a path that was 370 yards wide at its maximum. A husband and wife died, and their 7-year-old son was among the injured. Town Creek Mayor Mike Parker said neither of the community’s two storm sirens emitted a warning before the killer tornado. Cantrell said the siren system is based on a concept that is decades-old, and he favors having a severe weather application for cellphones so residents in a storm’s path can be notified. He said he will continue to look at more modern notification systems and look for money to fund the application.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Matanuska-Susitna Borough has declared a local emergency from flooding brought on by an ice jam in Willow Creek. Borough Mayor Vern Halter in his declaration Monday night asked Gov. Mike Dunleavy to declare a state disaster for the affected areas. Halter cited severe threats to life and property, lack of access to homes and property damage loss. “The severity and magnitude of the flooding emergency is beyond the timely and effective response capability of the local resources,” he said. The ice jam Saturday night sent floodwater into nearby homes. At least 13 households were forced to evacuate, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Six were damaged by floodwater. Residents who chose to stay behind to tend to animals were cut off from leaving their neighborhood, KTUU-TV reported. Emergency workers on Monday used amphibious all-terrain vehicles and boats to shuttle people in and out so they could buy food, fuel and medications. There had been little change in the ice jam from Sunday to Monday, said borough emergency services director Ken Barkley. Ice jams have occurred during spring breakup but presented an unusual challenge in early winter, Barkley said. The temperature at 7 a.m. Tuesday in Willow was 6 degrees.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials said City Hall had been bugged for several months – with bedbugs, that is. The Arizona Daily Star reported officials said it took nearly three months to remove the small insects from the municipal building. The first report of bed bugs came in late September, with an employee reporting finding a dead bedbug in a file folder on the third floor. A week later, the second report surfaced with the sighting of a bedbug on the fourth floor. As a precaution, exterminators sprayed every floor of City Hall to get rid of the little bloodsuckers. Officials believe the bedbugs were brought in accidentally from an outside source. Tucson spokesman Andy Squire said after the three-month removal, the city also had to hire a Phoenix company earlier this month to bring in a specially trained dog to sniff the remaining bugs out. City officials estimated it cost about $7,853 to get rid of the infestation, with nearly half paying for the bedbug-sniffing dog.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An Arkansas fire chief has donated a kidney to a teenager he didn’t know. Maumelle Fire Chief Gerald Ezell told KATV that the surgery took place Dec. 13, two days after he met 18-year-old Sidney Burnett of Granby, Missouri. Ezell said he discovered Burnett was in need when he saw a Facebook post from her mother, an old school friend. He realized they had the same blood type. “I just felt like God was saying, ‘Hey, this is you,’” Ezell said. “Step across that line.” The transplant was performed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Burnett is still in Minnesota recovering from the surgery. “I was just so shocked that my donor was someone that had never even met me, but I’m so grateful for him,” she said. “He literally gave me my life back.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A study released this week has found that a law aimed at boosting vaccination rates across California had the greatest effect in high-risk areas where the vaccination rates were the lowest. The peer-reviewed study published in the journal PLOS Medicine on Monday showed that the 2016 legislation contributed to a 3.3% increase statewide for measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and a 2.4% decrease in the number of requests for nonmedical or personal belief exemptions to childhood vaccination requirements. California adopted the strictest childhood vaccination laws in the nation after public health officials connected more than 100 measles cases to an outbreak at Disneyland that began in December 2014. The law requires children to be vaccinated to attend public or private schools. It allows for medical exemptions if there is a clear medical reason that children should not be vaccinated.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverton: A fire that destroyed a historic building in a small mountain town in southwestern Colorado over the weekend led to power, internet and cellphone outages and took more than half of the town’s stored water to fight, officials said. The fire, which was reported about 10 p.m. Saturday, took nearly 17 hours to extinguish in subfreezing temperatures and used so much water that city officials asked residents of the small mountain town to voluntarily conserve water for a couple of days until storage tanks could refill, the Durango Herald reported Monday. Initially, “there was no way to get the word out,” to the town’s 400 residents, said John Sites, Silverton’s director of Public Works. Patrons at a brewery who spotted the fire were unable to use their cellphones to call 911 because of the outage. Fortunately, the brewery had a landline. The fire damaged a power line and CenturyLink line that run through the alley behind the gift and souvenir store that was destroyed, said San Juan County spokeswoman DeAnne Gallegos. Power was out for about six hours as outside temperatures dipped as low minus-10 degrees. Other wireless providers rely on CenturyLink’s line, so they were out of service as well. The fire was under control at 6 a.m., but Silverton’s fire crews continued to put out hot spots until 4 p.m. Sunday, said Gilbert Archuleta, chief of the Silverton-San Juan County Fire and Rescue Authority. The cause of the fire is unknown. Foul play is not suspected, Archuleta said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has been awarded a nearly $27 million federal grant to help further enhance early childhood development programs, the administration of Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday. The Preschool Development Birth through Five grant will help the state Office of Early Childhood design and launch better, more cost-effective systems to support family resilience and early childhood development. In addition to giving parents a greater voice, it focuses on developing and retaining the early childhood workforce. Connecticut was positioned to win the grant because the office is a national model integrating programs for young children and families, Commissioner Beth Bye said in a statement. Through a family-centered approach, the office serves thousands of children each year through child care, preschool, home visiting, health and safety assurance, early intervention, and parenting support. The three-year grant award starts Jan. 1.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Partially treated wastewater is being released from a treatment plant because of an equipment malfunction that state officials said cannot be immediately fixed. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control learned of the equipment malfunction at the Lewes wastewater treatment plant on Dec. 18, according to a press release Monday. Residents in the Lewes area are being asked to take water conservation measures until a resolution is announced, news outlets reported. Those measures include reducing shower time, avoiding multiple partial loads of laundry or dishwashing and minimizing “unnecessary flushing of toilets,” according to the release. DNREC said the plant has been bypassing stages of wastewater treatment since Dec. 19. Crews are screening the partially-treated wastewater effluent to remove visible solids, and a hydrogen peroxide feed is being used to reduce bacteria, state officials said. An emergency shellfish closure order has been issued by DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin for harvest areas downstream from the plant. The closure will continue for 21 days after the malfunction is fixed per U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two people were injured in a fire at a home for people recovering from drug and alcohol abuse. D.C. Fire and first responders arrived at the scene early Monday and found three people were trapped inside, news outlets reported. Once rescued, two of those people were taken to a hospital to be treated for injuries not considered to be life-threatening. The third person declined medical treatment. Fire department spokesman Vito Maggiolo said most residents were alerted to the blaze by working fire alarms and were able to escape on their own. The fire’s cause still is under investigation. The D.C. mayor’s Office of Community Relations and Services and Red Cross are helping displaced residents, of which there are about 16. The home is part of the Oxford House network, which seeks to help residents with sobriety.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Two more cases of dengue fever have been discovered in Miami-Dade County, bringing the total for the year to 14. The Miami Herald reported that it represents an uptick in reported cases of the mosquito-borne tropical disease. It continues to spread rapidly through Latin America, raising concerns that the number of cases in Miami will continue to rise. The Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County said the latest two cases are geographically linked to a travel-related case, but the department didn’t release additional details. Common symptoms of dengue virus include fever and one or more of the following: headache; eye pain; muscle, joint or bone pain; rash; nausea and vomiting; or unusual bleeding such as nose and gum bleeds. The disease is spread through the bite of an Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same insect that also spreads the chikungunya and Zika viruses. According to the Florida Department of Health, Miami-Dade has had the most cases of locally transmitted dengue in the state this year, with only Broward and Hillsborough reporting other cases – one in each county.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp submitted twin plans requesting that President Donald Trump’s administration allow changes to federal government subsidies for health insurance. Kemp said proposed changes to former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act would give individuals and families less expensive coverage options, a particular benefit for those who don’t qualify for federal subsidies to cover premiums. Critics said it would drive up insurance costs for older and sicker people. Kemp also wants to offer subsidized coverage to a fraction of Georgia’s uninsured poor if they worked or went to school for 80 or more hours a month. Kemp’s administration projects the expansion would cover 50,000 people, far less than the 400,000 uninsured Georgians who might be covered by the Medicaid expansion originally envisioned by the overhaul. This second proposal, aimed at people earning incomes of up to 100% of the federal poverty level, echoes those made by other states. Federal officials have rejected some similar partial expansions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Department of Education won a federal grant of nearly $50 million for a long-term effort to enhance literacy among children, officials said. Education officials said the grant will be used to foster skills from infancy through high school, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy Grant spans five years and will focus on disadvantaged students, officials said. The state education department will begin seeking applicants in January for the effort that will use techniques grounded in data. The funds will supplement current instruction combined with other approaches known to be effective, from family education and engagement to ensuring educators at all levels have necessary tools and training, officials said. The $49.8 million grant will be divided among grade levels, with 40% to elementary schools, 40% to secondary schools and 15% to early education from birth to age 5. The remaining 5% at the state level will cover grant administration and program monitoring, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Environmental groups have written a letter to the U.S. Forest Service requesting more time for public comment on plans for Idaho’s Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. The coalition of a dozen environmental advocacy organizations sent a letter to the agency Monday asking for a 90-day extension because of interruptions caused by the holiday season, The Lewiston Tribune reported. The letter to Nez Perce-Clearwater Supervisor Cheryl Probert said the Dec. 20 release of the draft forest plan revision and environmental impact statement effectively removes about two weeks from the 90-day comment period. Even those with time to examine the document are not likely to be able to reach forest service employees during holiday break periods, the groups said. The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest did not immediately return a call from the Associated Press on Tuesday. The two draft documents released by the forest service broadly describe the management of Nez Perce-Clearwater for the next 15 to 20 years. The documents are revisions of the individual Nez Perce and Clearwater forest plans that were last updated in 1987.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new study has found no evidence to corroborate that a beaver-skin stovepipe hat – for years a centerpiece of Illinois’ Abraham Lincoln museum – ever belonged to the 16th U.S. president, according to a published report. Among the findings spelled out in a 54-page report was that the hat, once appraised at $6.5 million, didn’t appear to be Lincoln’s size and that descendants of the original collectors weren’t aware of the claim Lincoln had owned it, WBEZ reported Tuesday, citing a copy of the study. The 16-month study also criticized a lack of due diligence to verify any link between the hat and Lincoln before it was purchased in 2007 and went on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield. The hat was later purchased in 2007 by the private Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation from collector Louise Taper for display at the Springfield museum. It was the headliner in a wider Taper collection, for which the foundation paid around $25 million. The collection also included the bloodied gloves Lincoln wore to the theater the night he was shot. With secret doubts of their own, the private foundation sought to authenticate the hat over recent years, including a failed attempt to match DNA on the hat to Lincoln.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: A group working to create a monument to the lead character in “Star Trek: Voyager,” Capt. Kathryn Janeway, has met its crowdfunding campaign goal of $12,500. The Captain Janeway Bloomington Collective will receive matching funds from the Indiana Housing & Community Development. That gives them enough to build it. Peter Kaczmarcyk and his wife, Mary Beth, have headed up efforts to create the monument this year. On May 23 – three days after Bloomington-native Janeway’s fictional birthday in the 24th century – a bust bearing the likeness of actress Kate Mulgrew will be unveiled in downtown Bloomington. Included in the design is a limestone base in the shape of the Starfleet insignia; and an informational table with information about the USS Voyager captain, series writer and producer Jeri Taylor and their local connections. Taylor is also a Bloomington native and earned her bachelor’s degree from Indiana University in 1959. Initially, the unveiling was planned for May 20, the character’s birthday, but Kaczmarczyk said so many people expressed interest in attending that they decided to move it to the weekend.\n\nIowa\n\nWashington: A former bricklayer made a deal with a retirement home that when he became a resident, it would to allow him to put up a display of model trains. Jim Bennett of Washington said the holiday season is his favorite time for the past 10 years because he gets to practice and display his enthusiasm for being a train engineer, KCRG-TV reported. His train display is in the lobby of the United Presbyterian Home in the town of 7,400 people about 50 miles south of Cedar Rapids. He has posted hours of operation so that visitors can see it for more than three hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and Bennett said he will likely leave the display up through February. Bennett said he has always loved building toy trains, repairing them and watching them cruise around the tracks. But as he got older and moved into the retirement home, he worried he would not have a chance to ever bring out the sets again.\n\nKansas\n\nOsawatomie: Fire officials said a driver for the U.S. Postal Service “saved Christmas” after his delivery truck caught fire. The Wichita Eagle reported that firefighters in Osawatomie on Sunday posted photos on the volunteer department’s Facebook page of the smoldering and badly damaged engine compartment of the mail truck. The area of the driver’s seat also appeared to be damaged. But several packages, including Amazon Prime shipping boxes, were removed by the driver and placed in a ditch a safe distance from the burning vehicle. The driver’s name was not released. “Your Prime delivery may have just lost its Prime,” The Osawatomie Volunteer Fire Department said in the Facebook post. “The good news is, the driver saved Christmas!” Osawatomie is a town of 4,500 residents about 60 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Marian Group said Monday it has withdrawn from a development agreement to transform a site in Paristown that was home to the old Urban Government Center. Louisville chose The Marian Group in 2017 to develop the roughly 2-acre lot in Paristown Pointe at 814 Vine St. as the first part of a larger mixed-use development. The developer planned to build 22 modern shotgun homes on the vacant lot, angering some neighbors because it marked an increase from the 12 shotgun homes originally proposed. In a letter Monday to Louisville Forward, the city’s development branch, legal counsel for the developers wrote that the reason for withdrawing was the city’s failure to obtain rezoning, demolition permits and other waivers for the project, which it had to complete by Dec. 31. The development agreement called for the city, not the developer, to be responsible for those tasks. Caitlin Bowling, a spokeswoman for Louisville Forward, said the termination had been received and “we respect their decision.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nAbbeville:A Roman Catholic church decided to disperse some blessings to a local town via crop dusters. According to a Facebook post from the Diocese of Lafayette on Sunday, members of St. Anne Church on Cow Island called upon crop duster pilots to help spread their blessing to the community. The Rev. Matthew Barzare and parishioners of the church loaded 100 gallons of holy water into the planes, and the pilots sprayed the water onto the town and the nearby farms, KATC-TV reported. Parishioners also bought water from their homes to the airstrip to be blessed by Barzare. The idea came from L’Eryn Detraz, a Cow Island native who is a missionary stationed in Ohio. Cow Island is an unincorporated community in Vermilion Parish approximately 38 miles south of Lafayette.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A University of Maine Cooperative Extension program that provides fresh produce for people in need has reached 3 million pounds of donations. Maine Harvest for the Hunger has existed since 2000 and donated more than 193,000 pounds of produce from more than 120 farms in the state this year. The donations went to more than 200 hunger-relief distribution sites, the university said. In nearly two decades in existence, Harvest for the Hunger has “mobilized Master Gardener Volunteers, home gardeners, farmers, businesses, schools, and civic groups to grow, glean, and donate quality produce to distribution sites (pantries, shelters, community meals) and directly to neighbors in need,” the university said in a statement. The value of the produce harvested this year was estimated at more than $300,000, the university said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Advanced Industrial Solutions, the United Kingdom’s largest provider of offshore wind industry training, will open a Salisbury facility in early 2020. The new training hub, created in partnership with Salisbury-based welding company ARCON, will begin hiring instructors in February or March, said ARCON President and CEO Katarina Ennerfelt. In total, the number of permanent new jobs at the training center in Northwood Industrial Park will likely be in the dozens, said Salisbury Mayor Jake Day. The safety training – which includes fire, first aid, material handling and working at heights – is required for technicians working on offshore wind projects and is regulated by an international standard under the Global Wind Organisation. As a whole, the renewable energy sector is expected to add 40,000 new jobs nationwide by 2030. Although the first trainees sent to the new facility will likely be training to work on offshore wind projects elsewhere across the U.S., the center will be available to train workers for wind projects set for the waters off Ocean City, Day said. ARCON has operated a welding services training center at its Northwood location since 2015.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Public health officials are seeking organizations to set up centers where people can be monitored after using illicit drugs. These planned “medical observation and monitoring services” would be staffed by nurses and other clinicians, who would monitor the clients’ vital signs, administer oxygen, intravenous fluids and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone if necessary, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The clients will be able to remain anonymous and receive counseling, treatment for infections and wounds, and help with obtaining primary health care and addiction treatment. People will not be allowed to use drugs inside these centers, a marked difference from the concept of “safe consumption sites.” The state’s Department of Public Health is seeking bids to create three to five monitoring sites. Each would serve five to 10 people who have taken too much of a sedative, such as heroin or fentanyl, or a stimulant, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. The site locations have not yet been determined. The observation centers were part of a $5 million item in the state budget, which charges the public health department with promoting “harm reduction” to reduce the bad consequences of drug use.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:A black rhino that is part of a critically endangered species delivered her first calf at a Lansing zoo, officials announced on Christmas Eve. The unnamed calf was born at Potter Park Zoo on Tuesday before 6 a.m. The 12-year-old mother, Doppsee, nuzzled her baby within minutes and the calf was standing up about 90 minutes later, according to the zoo. The calf, which is bonding with its mother, won’t be seen by the public until the spring of next year. Both animals will be monitored closely for the next few weeks. “This is a monumental moment for Potter Park Zoo that has taken our staff years of planning and hard work,” director Cynthia Wagner said. “We are dedicated to conserving rhinos and couldn’t be more excited about this successful black rhino birth.” Zoo officials said that the species is at risk of extinction because of illegal poaching and habitat loss. Dozens of sites are making conservation efforts, zoo officials said. The newborn’s father, Phineus, came to the zoo from Texas in 2017.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: A light breeze and blue skies greeted a 30-by-60-foot American flag as it was unfurled for the first time Friday during a ceremony at Minnesota Truck Headquarters. The flag will fly atop a 150-foot flagpole, the largest dedicated flagpole in the state, according to general manager Rick Wildtraut. A tower at Millerbernd Manufacturing in Winsted is taller, but that light tower is used for other purposes for most of the year. A flag is flown on holidays and during the town’s festival and is not on daily display. In June, Ryan Electric built a 100-foot-tall flagpole at their offices in St. Cloud. The tallest flagpole in the U.S. is 400 at the Acuity Insurance company between Green Bay and Milwaukee.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: A scraggly metal Christmas tree planted in a pothole has inspired a minister to pen a holiday song. The Rev. Leon Hitchens of Webb Chapel Church in Liberty wrote “Pothole Christmas Tree” after local radio host Fern Crossley showed him the makeshift holiday scene, the Enterprise-Journal of McComb reported. The song celebrates John Drummond, who stuck the base of a wire Christmas tree into the traffic cone sticking out of the pothole. Neighbors decorated it with tinsel, ornaments and a large star on the top. An Associated Press account went worldwide, leading to additional coverage by Fox News. Drivers are now going out of their way to check out the pothole and its decoration. The city board said at last week’s meeting that crews are repairing poles as tight finances allow, and a $3.2 million bond issue dedicated to street paving might let the city fill others. Although many people take down their Christmas trees by New Year’s Day, it’s uncertain whether the city will have the pothole fixed by then.\n\nMissouri\n\nCalifornia: A mid-Missouri couple is donating more than 3,000 pairs of socks to homeless people as part of a program to honor their late son. The Columbia Missourian reported that Janet and Edward Miller of California started Gentle Ben’s Socks for the Homeless in memory of their son, Ben, who died of a brain aneurysm in 2017 at age 34. Janet Miller said socks are the most needed and least donated items for homeless people. The couple collected 900 pairs of socks in their first year. This year, the goal was 2,000 pairs, but they ended up with 3,100 pairs. The socks were donated at collection bins in California and Jefferson City. The socks will be donated to three Columbia organizations that help the homeless.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Warm temperatures and a lack of snow in the Kalispell area has led to the cancellation of a planned skijoring competition this weekend. Skijoring is a winter sport where skiers are pulled by horses through a course and over jumps. Organizers of Skijoring at Rebecca Farm said the events scheduled for Saturday and Sunday have been canceled and would not be rescheduled. Last year’s planned event was postponed to March 2019, also because of a lack of snow. Then, the first day of the competition was canceled because of severe cold. Skijoring America lists eight other competitions this season, including five more in Montana and one each in Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.\n\nNebraska\n\nEustis: A western Nebraska woman is known in her town as “The Santa Lady” because she has collected more than 9,000 items related to jolly old Saint Nick over 50-plus years. The North Platte Telegraph reported that Santa items fill both floors and every room, including the bathrooms, of Nancy Laier’s home in Eustis, a village of about 370 people about 165 miles west of Lincoln. She gives tours of her home – but asks that visitors call in advance to make sure she’s home. Laier said she began her collection sometime in the 1960s, when the first Pizza Hut restaurant came to North Platte, about 50 miles to the northwest. She said it had a drawing for a Santa doll; she entered her infant son, and he won. She said she found a lot of items when others threw them away.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Tire chains or vehicles with FWD/AWD with snow tires were required if people were trying to drive over Donner Summit on Interstate 80 or the Mt. Rose Highway on Wednesday morning, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation. Chains were also required at Lake Tahoe on SR-28 from the Nevada/California state line in Crystal Bay to U.S. 50 near South Lake. Snowfall over Donner Summit on Tuesday night closed Interstate 80 because of several spinouts over the summit, but the road has reopened. The chain controls were later dropped for travel on Interstate 80.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State police helped to deliver a baby on Interstate 93 early Christmas morning. State police posted the news and a photo with the baby and parents at the hospital on social media Wednesday morning. State police Sgt. Vincent Grieco, Trooper Ryan St. Cyr and Boscawen Police Officer Ryan Nolan helped welcome baby Dominic into the world in Concord shortly after midnight, WMUR-TV reported. “All are happy, healthy and overjoyed to be spending Christmas together,” the state police post said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Thirteen bears were killed last week as the state concluded the second phase of its black bear hunt, according to wildlife officials. The hunt initially was scheduled for six days and ended Dec. 14, with 37 bears being culled overall. But it was extended for four more days because the harvest objectives for the year had not been met, and the hunt resumed Dec. 18. The state’s bear management policy mandates that the hunting season will be extended by four days if less than 20% of tagged bears are killed. The harvest rate for the season stood at 14.7% when the decision to extend the hunt was made, marking the third straight year that the hunt has been prolonged. That harvest rate is deemed necessary to provide better ecological balance to the bear population and reduce the potential for bear-human encounters. Officials have said 265 bears were harvested during the first phase of the hunt, which took in place in October. Overall, 315 bruins were killed during this year’s hunts.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials are urging residents and visitors to spend some time outside on the first day of the year. The State Parks Division is holding a series of hikes at nine state parks on New Year’s Day as part of the annual First Day Hikes initiative. In addition to the hikes, visitors can also participate in Polar Bear Plunges at Storrie Lake State Park in Las Vegas and Eagle Nest Lake State Park in Eagle Nest. The participating parks range from Navajo Lake State Park in the northwest corner to Cerrillos Hills near Santa Fe and Pancho Villa and Leasburg Dam parks in southern New Mexico. At Elephant Butte, the dam is only open to pedestrian traffic one day a year for First Day Hikes. The New Year’s Day tradition happens nationwide. Last year, the National Association of State Park Directors reported that nearly 55,000 people rang in the New Year, collectively hiking more than 133,000 miles throughout the country on the guided hikes.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city is expanding a program to use mobile units to reach hundreds of people who are mentally ill, the city announced Monday. The city said in a release that it will spend $9.4 million to boost its mobile mental health treatment teams, which were launched in 2016. The city said the new money will be part of a $21 million investment that will lead to the hiring of more social workers, housing specialists and legal assistance employees. The additional workers will be needed to process the 20% increase in mental health referrals the effort is expected to generate, the city said, adding that it will likely reach 900 more people annually. In addition, the city said it plans to spend $11 million to create hospital-based outreach teams to coordinate care for people who frequent emergency rooms and acute care facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A college student hailed by police as a hero for preventing more injuries and deaths after a gunman opened fire in a classroom has been immortalized as a Jedi by the production company for the Star Wars franchise. News outlets reported the family of Riley Howell, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte student who is described as a huge Star Wars fan, was tipped off by Lucasfilm in May that it planned to honor him in a forthcoming book, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - The Visual Dictionary.” Howell, 21, and a classmate died April 30 when a gunman opened fire in a classroom in the Kennedy building on UNCC’s campus. Four other students were injured, but police said Howell’s actions prevented more injuries or loss of life. The book was released by publisher DK to coincide with the release of the film “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” The entry in the book is just 66 words, but credits Jedi master and historian “Ri-Lee Howell” with collecting “many of the earliest accounts of exploration and codifications of The Force.” Howell’s mother, Natalie Henry-Howell, told The Charlotte Observer this marks the second time her son has appeared in a “Star Wars” book: When he was younger, an uncle had a personalized book made for Riley that put him in the starring role of “The Phantom Menace.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Firefighters continued a 30-year tradition of delivering gifts to children at hospitals in Fargo on Christmas Day. KFGO-AM reported the tradition began in 1990 when the 3-year-old son of a Fargo firefighter was hospitalized and worried that Santa Claus would not be able to find him. The gifts this year are given in memory of Keaton Nelson, who made his Make-a-Wish be for gifts to be delivered to other hospitalized children. Nelson died from complications from Cystic Fibrosis.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Bureau of Motor Vehicles plans to begin a vehicle safety recall notification program using the state’s vehicle registration renewal process. Vehicle safety recall information will be printed on registration renewal notices sent through the mail, the bureau said in a news release. Customers will begin receiving open recall notifications beginning in January under the new program. Drivers who are not the original owners of a vehicle might not be aware of an open recall, officials said. An open recall will not interfere with a Ohioans’ ability to renew their vehicle registration, according to the bureau. BMV customers are advised to check their Vehicle Identification Numbers for open recalls by using the VIN look-up tool on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. They also can contact their authorized dealer.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt’s top adviser on tribal issues announced her resignation on Monday and accused the governor of creating an ‘unnecessary conflict’ with the tribes over casino gambling. Lisa Billy, a former Republican lawmaker and Stitt’s secretary of Native American Affairs, said in her resignation letter that Stitt’s position on the compacts poses a threat to the state’s economy and its relationship with the tribes. Stitt said in a statement he was grateful for Billy’s service and he remains committed to working collaboratively with the tribes. `The governor caught many tribal leaders off guard last summer when he announced in a newspaper editorial that he wanted to renegotiate the compacts. The sides have been locked in a dispute ever since about whether the compacts expire on Jan. 1. Stitt claims they do, but the tribes maintain triggers have been met for the compacts to automatically renew.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The Salem and Brooks vegetable processing plants owned by bankrupt NORPAC Foods could soon reopen after Lineage Logistics filed to purchase the company’s Oregon properties for $49 million, according to court records. The Statesman-Journal reported that a bankruptcy judge is scheduled to hear the petition for the proposed sale Jan. 14 in bankruptcy court in Portland. The sale would include NORPAC’s Willamette Valley processing facilities in Salem, Brooks and Stayton, along with the field shop in Quincy, Washington. NORPAC attorney Al Kennedy said in court that Lineage Logistics will lease the plants in Salem and Brooks from NORPAC until the sale is completed. And Lineage would lease those to Oregon Potato Company to operate until the sale is done, which would allow some of the 1,400 NORPAC workers who had been notified they could be laid off to continue to work. Lineage Logistics, which was formed in 2008, is one of the largest cold storage companies in the world, including operating 169 cold storage warehouses in the United States and more in countries such as China and the United Kingdom.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington Crossing: Thousands turned out Wednesday to watch the annual reenactment of George Washington’s daring Christmas Day crossing of the Delaware River in 1776 – the first time the crossing was completed in three years. The event was scrapped because of bad weather the last two years, but historical interpreter Nancy O’Leary said at Washington Crossing Historical Park that the conditions this year “couldn’t be better.” Jennifer Martin, executive director of the Friends of Washington Crossing Park. estimated that 4,500 to 5,000 people were watching the event, the highlight of a historical reenactment that draws people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing and Titusville, New Jersey. Other activities included Washington’s address to his troops, historical speeches and processions, and staff in period clothing providing public interpretation. In the original crossing, boats ferried 2,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 18 cannons across the river. Washington’s troops marched 8 miles downriver before battling Hessian mercenaries in the streets of Trenton, New Jersey. Thirty Hessians were killed, and two Continental soldiers froze to death on the march.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers returning to the State House after the holidays will notice some subtle changes to the House and Senate chambers. When lawmakers return in January, they will see new shades of paint on the walls, feel thicker carpet under their feet, sit at revarnished desks, brush past brighter drapes and listen to each other’s speeches on new audio speakers, according to The Providence Journal. In addition, the cracked skylight above the House Speaker’s desk has been repaired as has the domed roof above the Senate chamber, which often leaked when it rained. It was the first significant chamber renovation since the General Assembly downsized in 2003 from 150 seats to the current 113. That renovation also brought computers to lawmakers’ desks for the first time.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: A Charleston-area landmark will be lit up for the holidays. The Post and Courier reportsed that Dominion Energy and a group dedicated to saving the Morris Island Lighthouse will illuminate the lighthouse from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. The lighthouse also was illuminated on Christmas Day. Dominion spokesperson Persida Montanez said engineers will use 12-volt batteries, LED lights and a solar panel to provide light. The lighthouse was constructed in 1876, but has faced severe erosion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Area schools and two radio stations raised more than $14,000 to give gift cards to students who don’t have a permanent address this year. In all, the Rapid City Journal reported Tuesday that 573 students will each receive $25 Visa gift cards. The radio stations that helped in the effort were 97.9 the Breeze and KLMP. It was part of a campaign called “Hope for the Homeless.” During the four years the schools and radio stations collaborated on the effort, they haved raised nearly $45,000 for gifts to homeless middle and high school students.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee’s county health department clinics are offering flu vaccines at no charge. Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey encouraged anyone who has not received a flu shot this season to get one as soon as possible. The state Health Department suggested contacting local health departments for information. Information about nearby departments is available online. Free flu vaccines are also available at the Shelby County Health Department in Memphis and the Metro Public Health Department in Nashville, in addition to health departments run by the state throughout Tennessee, the state said. Even after being vaccinated, the state Health Department recommends washing hands with soapy water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers and covering coughs and sneezes with a sleeve or tissue to help prevent the spread of illness. People who are sick should stay home so they can recover and avoid infecting others.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A resident who was diagnosed with measles is no longer a health threat, but officials are urging some people to get medical attention if they develop a fever before New Year’s Day. Public health officials made the plea to anyone who visited specific Austin locations that the affected resident was in between Dec. 14 and Dec. 17. The Austin American-Statesman created a map of those locations. The resident is currently not in Texas. Measles is a virus that can cause high fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms, but other complications include pneumonia and encephalitis. Health officials first alerted people in Austin about the measles case and potential exposure on Sunday, a day after state agencies were informed by Virginia officials, said Dr. Mark Escott, the interim health authority at Austin Public Health. The person traveled to Virginia on Dec. 17. The person, whom officials are not identifying, contracted the disease while traveling in Europe from late November to early December and became sick on Dec. 14, Escott said. He noted that the person developed a rash on Dec. 17, which is the day they boarded United Airlines Flight 790 from Austin to Chicago, with a connecting flight to Virginia. The person’s measles case is the first reported in Travis County since 1999, the Statesman reported. Officials didn’t disclose if the person was vaccinated.\n\nUtah\n\nBrighton: A second ski resort near Salt Lake City is changing its parking policy to favor carpooling amid concerns about traffic congestion in a canyon home to popular ski resorts. Starting Wednesday, Brighton Resort designated prime parking areas for visitors with three people or more in their cars on holidays like Christmas that are often popular days to ski, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Officials said the policy applies to weekends, holidays and powder days. It could encourage more people to share cars or take public transportation on days when cars full of skiers can lead to long lines of traffic snaking through the snow-covered mountains. Single drivers or those with one passenger must park at a further lot, where a shuttle service will ferry them to the lifts. When that lot near the resort store is full, people will be asked to turn around and park along the road, or return to the mouth of the canyon and take public transit. The move comes after neighboring Solitude Mountain Resort, also in Big Cottonwood Canyon, made the unusual move to start charging noncarpooling guests $20 to park. The price drops to $10 if the car has three occupants and $5 for four or more people. Park staffers have said their goal isn’t to make money but rather to ease traffic gridlock. Season pass holders at both Brighton and Solitude can ride free on the canyon bus routes offered by the Utah Transit Authority.\n\nVermont\n\nJericho: The Army Mountain Warfare School in Jericho will get $30 million in federal funding for a new facility, the Vermont National Guard announced this week. The funding is part of the defense budget signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Groundbreaking is likely to happen late next year, the Guard said. Members of the school provided mountain warfare and cold-weather training to U.S. and Afghan conventional operations forces on deployments in 2005 and 2010, the Guard said. Instructors served as experts on mountain warfare in Afghanistan. The $30 million appropriation will support “a critically important but previously unfunded priority of the Army,” said U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy in a written statement on Monday. The design of the 82,600-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility will start as early as January, said Michael Bleau, deputy construction and facilities management officer. Construction is expected to be completed in early 2022, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRaven: A company that owns a coal mine has furloughed 600 workers until the end of the year. The reported reason behind the move is the trade war between the U.S. and China. The Bristol Herald Courier reported Monday that Coronado Coal idled its mining facility in Buchanan County on Dec. 16. Tarah Kesterson, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, said the company cited the trade war between China and the U.S. as a reason for the furlough. But she said the company also plans to bring the mine back into full production by Jan. 1. Coronado did not specify what it was looking for between China and the U.S. But tensions appeared to ease earlier this month with the announcement of a “Phase One” trade deal. China has agreed to buy an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services. That agreement is expected to be signed in January. The idling of the mine in Buchanan County caps a tumultuous year for southwest Virginia’s coal industry. The region also saw the bankruptcy of Blackjewel LLC. The firm employed more than 480 people in the state.\n\nWashington\n\nNorth Bend: The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Police is asking for the public’s help to find the person or people who killed three cow elks and left them to waste in North Bend. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that police said in a Facebook post that three cow elks were found the weekend of Dec. 14 shot with archery equipment and left to die in the area behind Ken’s Truck Town Diner in North Bend. Two of the elks were found with matching arrows, and the third was found with a different type of arrow and broad head. Police said that those who provide information leading to an arrest might be eligible for a cash reward or bonus points for special permit hunting opportunities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Eligible employees at Mon Health System will soon be offered 14 straight days of paid parental leave. Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg announced in a news release that the new policy will take effect at the start of the new year. WBOY-TV reported that if both spouses or partners are employed by Mon Health, each will be afforded the same benefit. Mon Health also operates Mon Health Preston Memorial Hospital and Mon Health Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hospital. Congress passed a bill earlier this month giving the country’s 2.1 million government employees 12 weeks of paid parental leave as part of a defense bill that President Donald Trump signed into law. But it still leaves about 80% of U.S. workers in the private sector with no access to paid family leave. The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that lacks a federal policy, at least for new mothers, leaving employers to decide whether to offer it.\n\nWisconsin\n\nRib Mountain: The Salvation Army in Wausau said it got to 80% of its $170,000 Red Kettle fundraising goal before the holiday campaign ended on Christmas Eve. The organization told WSAW-TV donations have dropped in recent years and a lack of volunteers is one of the factors. Lt. Donna Thammavongsa with Wausau’s Salvation Army said another reason for falling short is that people don’t carry as much cash anymore. The Red Kettle campaign is more than 100 years old. It’s the Salvation Army’s largest annual fundraiser.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: No evidence links hydraulic fracturing to contaminated groundwater in central Wyoming, according to a state Department of Environmental Quality report. The contamination near Pavillion likely occurred naturally because of permeable geology in the gas-drilling area, the report released Monday found. However, absence of data from before drilling began in the mid-1900s limits scientists trying to determine the exact source of the contamination, the report stated. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigation began in 2008 and led to draft findings in 2011 that theorized a link between the contamination and nearby hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process uses pressurized water, mixed with sand and chemicals, to split open underground deposits and boost oil and gas production. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry cautioned residents not to drink the water. The EPA, however, didn’t complete its report and handed the investigation over to state officials. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality announced in 2013 it would conduct a thorough study of the 12-square-mile Pavillion gas field with help from $1. million from Encana Oil and Gas USA, Inc., the Canadian-based company operating the site, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Several environmental groups and landowners expressed skepticism about the additional research.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/04/lighthouse-peril-wizard-rock-cable-la-carte-news-around-states/40541683/", "title": "Lighthouse in peril, Wizard Rock: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDothan: An event that bills itself as the world’s largest celebration of the peanut is underway in the city. The National Peanut Festival opened Friday and continues through next Saturday with rides, exhibits, music and agricultural competitions. Now in its 76th year, the festival began in 1938 as a three-day event with an appearance by agricultural scientist George Washington Carver of Tuskegee. It has been held each year since except during the 1940s, when organizers took a break for World War II. The festival now lasts 10 days and draws an estimated 200,000 people annually. The festival site isn’t hard to find if you make it to Dothan: A 24-foot-tall peanut marks the entrance.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A local teacher has been named 2020 Alaska Teacher of the Year, an honor revealed in a surprise ceremony at West Valley High School. Amy Gallaway walked into the gym Oct. 25, as the school had been told they’d be filming an assembly for another activity, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports. Students and teachers competed for a moment in a hopscotch activity before Principal Sarah Gillam called in a “VIP team” of legislators, school district staff, and members of the Department of Education and Early Development, including Education Commissioner Michael Johnson. Johnson announced there was one more person on his team: Amy Gallaway, the 2020 Alaska Teacher of the year. The students erupted into applause as Johnson noted Gallaway was selected for many reasons, one of them because “she doesn’t just teach democracy; she has you do democracy.” Gallaway is a Kid’s Voting liaison. She teaches the We the People government class and has encouraged students to participate in the national “We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution” program.\n\nArizona\n\nPrescott: A boulder that mysteriously disappeared two weeks ago from a national forest is back, and authorities aren’t asking any questions. Prescott National Forest officials said a forest employee on patrol Friday noticed that the 1-ton boulder dubbed “Wizard Rock” had been returned to a site along State Route 89. The much-admired boulder is black with streaks of white quartz running through it. District Ranger Sarah Clawson said forest officials were thrilled that the rock was returned and “grateful that whoever took it was conscientious enough to give it back to the public.” According to forest officials, heavy equipment would’ve been needed to move the boulder. Permits are required to gather and remove most forest products, including rocks, plants and trees.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Markers to 12 men convicted of murder and sentenced to death, before eventually being released, in connection with the Elaine Race Massacre will be placed along the Arkansas Civil Rights Heritage Trail. The University of Arkansas at Little Rock said a marker to each of what is known as the “Elaine 12” will be located along the trail from the Old State House Convention Center to the William J. Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. They are to be unveiled Tuesday. The men were black sharecroppers convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury following the 1919 massacre in eastern Arkansas during what is known as “Red Summer,” when hundreds of African Americans nationwide were slain by white mobs. More than 200 people died in Elaine, mostly black men, women and children.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Authorities say a dam could fail during an extreme storm and send water flooding into Mojave Desert communities that are home to about 300,000 people. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced Friday that it’s changed its risk characterization of the Mojave River Dam from low to high urgency of action. The earthen dam was built in the 1970s near the San Bernardino Mountains. It has never breached, but an assessment last year found that during an extreme storm, water could flow over the top and erode the dam. That could threaten Apple Valley, Hesperia, Victorville, Barstow and even the tiny town of Baker, more than 140 miles downstream. Officials say the chances of such a storm are small – about 1 in 10,000 – but they’re working with communities on emergency preparations anyway.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A middle school dean has pleaded not guilty after authorities accused him of bringing a handgun to school and threatening administrators in April. The Sentinel reports 31-year-old Tushar Rae was charged Oct. 21 with three felonies and one misdemeanor in Arapahoe County. The Aurora West Preparatory Academy dean also pleaded not guilty to two additional felony and three misdemeanor charges filed against him Oct. 3 in connection with a Denver case accusing him of making threats against an administrator weeks earlier. School officials say Rae remains on paid leave.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Hampton: A police officer has retired after a civil rights organization raised concerns about his membership in a far-right group known for engaging in violent clashes at political rallies, a town official said Friday. Officer Kevin P. Wilcox retired from the East Hampton Police Department on Oct. 22, according to Town Manager David Cox. That was one week after the Associated Press reported that Wilcox had been a Proud Boys member and made online payments to a group leader. Wilcox had been an East Hampton police officer since 1999. His retirement was a “revision” of a previously planned retirement date in December, Cox wrote in an email. In September, East Hampton Police Chief Dennis Woessner had told the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law that Wilcox’s Proud Boys membership didn’t violate department policies.\n\nDelaware\n\nBlades: Federal officials are recommending that a residential area in this town where high levels of toxic chemicals were discovered in municipal wells be added to a national priority list of environmental cleanup sites. State and federal officials plan to hold an informational meeting in the Blades area next month regarding the proposed Superfund listing. Officials announced in February 2018 that concentrations of perfluorinated compounds above the human health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion were found in all three of the town’s drinking water wells. The sampling was part of an effort to identify areas where certain chemicals used in textiles, food packaging, firefighting foams and metal plating may have been released. Blades has been home to two metal plating businesses, one of which is still operating.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The song “Baby Shark” blared over loudspeakers and a wave of red washed across this politically blue capital Saturday as Nationals fans rejoiced at a parade marking Washington’s first World Series victory since 1924. “They say good things come to those who wait. Ninety-five years is a pretty long wait,” Nationals owner Ted Lerner, who is 94, told the cheering crowd. “But I’ll tell you, this is worth the wait.” As buses carrying the players and team officials wended their way along the parade route, pitcher Max Scherzer at one point hoisted the World Series trophy to the cheers of the crowd. At a rally just blocks from the Capitol, Scherzer said his teammates grinded their hearts out to “stay in the fight.” And then, after backup outfielder Gerardo Parra joined the team, he said, they started dancing and having fun. And they started hitting. “Never in this town have you seen a team compete with so much heart and so much fight,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A commission investigating the Parkland school shooting wants state lawmakers to boost funding for mental health services. The commission is sending its second report to lawmakers, 10 months after an initial report urged immediate improvements to school safety following killings of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year. Lawmakers have already responded by enacting a package of school-safety measures, including raising the legal age for gun purchases, requiring armed security officers on every campus and adopting a “red flag” law. The 389-page document released Friday advocates new laws that would allow authorities to act more quickly against threats of violence. It calls for more funding and better coordination of mental health services for children.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPlains: Former President Jimmy Carter taught a Bible lesson on life after death Sunday, less than two weeks after breaking his pelvis in a fall. Using a walker, the 95-year-old Democrat slowly entered the crowded sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church in the southwest Georgia town of Plains. “Morning, everybody,” he said cheerfully. With help, Carter sat on a motorized lift chair at the front of the room to teach a 45-minute lesson based on the Old Testament book of Job. Referring to a cancer diagnosis that resulted in the removal of part of his liver in 2015, Carter said he is “at ease” with the idea of dying and believes in life after death. More than 400 people were on hand in the main hall and smaller, overflow rooms where the lesson was shown on television.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Hundreds of fish died in Maui’s Wailuku River last week as the state was implementing measures to improve their habitat. The Maui News reports the die-off occurred as officials installed a ladder to help fish climb a 22-foot, man-made wall in the river. Officials arranged for river flows to be diverted to create safe working conditions during the installation. State officials say the reduced flows and low rainfall contributed to the deaths. On Thursday, residents who frequent the river mouth scrambled to rescue ’o’opu floundering on dry stream beds and puddles of warm water below the project site. Small piles of dead fish and shrimp were strewn about the riverbed. Department of Land and Natural Resources Director Suzanne Case said her agency regrets the situation and offered its sincere apologies.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: The University of Idaho has anticipated more budget cuts as tuition revenue is estimated to drop $8 million by 2022. The Lewiston Tribune reports the Moscow university has already imposed $14 million in budget reductions this year that are set to become permanent. University officials say current enrollment trends reflect a tuition revenue decline, and the university has also routinely spent more than what it is bringing in, citing low reserves and no expected revenue increases. Officials say budget cuts could include layoffs, not renewing contracts, salary reductions, elimination of academic programs, early retirement and outsourcing services. They say the university’s goals include balancing revenue and expenses while rebuilding and maintaining reserve funds.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A city official says hundreds of overdue books have been returned in the three weeks since the city eliminated overdue fines at public libraries. Library Commissioner Andrea Telli told City Council members Wednesday that the number of returned books has increased by 240%. On Oct. 1, Chicago became the nation’s largest major city to eradicate overdue library fees. Telli said people who owe fines can be afraid to go to the library because they can’t afford to pay them. She said fines lead to loss of books and patrons. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s 2020 budget includes an $18 million property tax increase to fund adding Sunday hours at all 81 libraries, which will gradually roll out throughout the city.\n\nIndiana\n\nOxford: An autopsy has determined that a woman found with an 8-foot-long python wrapped around her neck was killed by the reptile. State Police said Friday that the autopsy found 36-year-old Laura Hurst’s cause of death was “asphyxiation due to strangulation by a snake.” Those findings are pending a final toxicology report. The Battle Ground, Indiana, woman was found unresponsive Wednesday on the floor of a snake-filled home in the northern Indiana town of Oxford. The reticulated python was wrapped loosely around her neck. Medics were unable to revive her. The home contained about 140 snakes, about 20 of which were owned by Hurst, who police said apparently kept them there and visited the home about twice weekly. The home’s owner had renovated it to house a snake collection.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: A state board has approved post-traumatic stress disorder and intellectual disability with aggression to the list of medical conditions that can legally be treated by medical marijuana but rejected two other conditions petitioners had requested. The Iowa Medical Cannabidiol Board voted Friday not to allow patients with opioid dependency and those with Alzheimer’s disease to have legal access to medical marijuana. Board members expressed concern over lack of studies or other evidence that medical marijuana would help those conditions. The Iowa Board of Medicine must agree with the addition of PTSD and intellectual disability before they can be added to a list of diagnoses for which medical marijuana can be prescribed. The conditions would join seizures, Crohn’s disease, AIDS, Lou Gehrig’s disease and Parkinson’s disease as approved conditions.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is reporting it collected nearly $37 million more in taxes than anticipated in October. The Department of Revenue said Friday that the state collected $553 million in taxes during the month when its official revenue forecast predicted $516 million. The surplus was 7.1%. Gov. Laura Kelly called the better-than-expected tax collections “a positive sign.” For the four months since the start of the state’s 2020 fiscal year in July, the state collected nearly $2.3 billion in taxes and exceeded expectations by nearly $85 million, or nearly 3.9%. Tax collections also are running 4.1% ahead of collections for the 2019 fiscal year. They have exceeded expectations 28 of the past 29 months.\n\nKentucky\n\nMayfield: A prominent painter whose works capture the state’s rural, small-town culture is turning 100. Helen LaFrance visited a church in Mayfield on Saturday to celebrate her birthday with an unexpectedly large group of friends and family. A documentary about her also was shown at a separate church in town. According to a press release, LaFrance’s paintings are housed in museums in the U.S. and Europe and in the collections of Oprah Winfrey and Bryant Gumbel. The self-taught, African American painter’s works show people at church, family gatherings, funerals and other aspects of small town life in western Kentucky. One of her first known public works is a mural in the St. James AME Church in Mayfield, completed in 1947. LaFrance also has worked in wood carving and quilting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: A man was sentenced to probation Friday for killing one of the state’s oldest whooping cranes. Gilvin P. Aucoin Jr., of Ville Platte, shot the endangered whooping crane in July 2018 in Evangeline Parish. In a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Carol B. Whitehurst, Aucoin changed his plea to guilty for a misdemeanor violation of the International Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Whitehurst sentenced Aucoin to two years’ probation, during which time he cannot hunt or fish, and 120 hours of community service to be served with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Aucoin, 53, also must complete a hunter education course. Whooping cranes are among the world’s most endangered birds. About 850 are alive, with about 660 of them in the wild. Nearly all of Louisiana’s birds, like the one killed in 2018, were raised by people in crane costumes so that the birds will stay wary of humans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal judge is considering a request to put on hold a state law requiring cable companies to offer channels on an a la carte basis. Comcast, joined by Disney, Fox Cable and NBC/Universal, is seeking a temporary restraining order to delay the law. The Portland Press Herald reports District Judge Nancy Torreson didn’t provide a timetable for her ruling after hearing arguments Friday. The state law requiring cable companies to offer channels individually took effect in September. Comcast contends enforcement of the law would mean limited choices and higher prices than the current packages it offers to consumers. The newspaper reports that Maine would become the first state in the country to require a la carte cable selections if the law is upheld.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A community vigil, art workshops and a poetry-writing workshop were among many peace-themed events aimed at promoting nonviolence during “Baltimore Ceasefire” weekend. The first ceasefire weekend was held in 2017 by organizers who urged that it be seen as a 72-hour period when no murders are committed in the violence-plagued city. The weekends are held every three months. The hopes of Erricka Bridgeford and other founders of the ceasefire weekends are often dashed, as they were Saturday afternoon when two men were shot. A 24-year-old man was pronounced dead, becoming Baltimore’s 286th homicide victim of the year. But the ceasefire weekends do seem to have some effect. The Baltimore Sun reports a study conducted by Bridgeford’s organization found an average 52% reduction in shootings on ceasefire weekends.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Contests that involve the hunting of predator or fur-bearing animals like coyotes would be banned under a proposal being considered by state wildlife officials. Critics of the contests say that they’re cruel and that randomly killing coyotes won’t prevent conflicts with people, pets or livestock. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife is planning to hold a hearing Tuesday evening at the Richard Cronin Building in Westborough to hear from the public. Wildlife officials say the current level of coyote hunting doesn’t reduce the population, nor would hunting have an appreciable impact on coyote populations. They say despite the presence of coyotes, deer populations are thriving in Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan\n\nMount Pleasant: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is ordering state agencies to step up collaboration with Native American tribes. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday affirming commitment to the sovereignty and right of self-governance of Michigan’s federally recognized tribes. The document outlines a process for communication between tribes and state departments and agencies on matters of mutual concern. It also makes a first-time requirement of training on tribal-state relations for all state employees who work on matters with direct implications for tribes. Whitmer issued the directive during a meeting with the state’s tribal leaders in Mount Pleasant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Environmental groups and activists in Minneapolis and Duluth are advocating for a new strategy on plastic bag restrictions. Minnesota Public Radio News reports advocates are pushing for fees for paper and plastic bags in the two cities. They want customers to think about whether they’re needed. Bag It, Duluth and other environmental groups pivoted to this tactic after Minnesota prohibited cities from banning plastic bags in 2017. The ordinances would place a nickel fee on both paper and plastic disposable bags. But Duluth’s council revised the ordinance there to apply only to plastic bags. The efforts in the two cities are part of a nationwide movement to reduce the use of plastic bags.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge ruled Friday that he will not immediately block the state’s unique, multistep process for electing a governor and other statewide officials, which was enacted at a time of Jim Crow segregation to maintain white rule. U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III said he would not issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the system from being used in Tuesday’s elections. However, he left open the possibility of further considering the case later. Mississippi’s 1890 constitution requires a statewide candidate to win a majority of the popular vote and a majority of the 122 state House districts. If nobody wins both, the election is decided by the House, and representatives are not obligated to vote as their districts did. African American plaintiffs who sued the state this year have argued that the system unconstitutionally violates the principle of one person, one vote.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A bill requiring gun dealers to alert police when a firearms purchase is denied because of a criminal background check is the latest step in addressing violence in a city beset by gun crimes. St. Louis aldermen unanimously gave final approval to the bill Friday. Supporters say 30% of criminals who try to purchase guns but fail to do so because of background checks are arrested within five years. The bill awaits Democratic Mayor Lyda Krewson’s signature. Missouri’s big cities, St. Louis and Kansas City, have among the highest homicide rates in the nation. Both are seeking to address the problem through tougher local gun laws, as statewide legislation is unlikely in the conservative-led state, where Republican Gov. Mike Parson has pledged “to protect the rights of the Second Amendment for law-abiding citizens.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: An environmentalist has found plastic pollution in half of the water samples collected statewide this summer. The Billings Gazette reports Environment Montana Research & Policy Center director Skye Borden traveled across the state collecting 50 samples at fishing access sites. Borden says the results are meant to start a conversation on how to reduce plastic consumption and raise awareness. Borden says plastic reduction options include phasing out single-use plastics, reusing plastics and encouraging businesses to eliminate unnecessary plastics. Borden says communities could also initiate cleanup programs. A 2016 federal report found that millions of metric tons of plastic made their way into the food chain and contaminated drinking water. Scientists say long-term effects of plastic ingestion are unclear, but plastic chemicals could build up over time.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A former superintendent of the Nebraska State Patrol wants to carry a concealed firearm and is suing the patrol to get it. Bradley Rice was fired by Gov. Pete Ricketts in June 2017 amid a review that found evidence that high-ranking patrol staffers interfered with the agency’s internal investigations. The lawsuit filed Wednesday says Rice asked the agency this past April for an identification card to allow him to carry a weapon. Federal code lets qualified retired law enforcement officers carry concealed firearms with proper identification. The lawsuit says the current patrol superintendent, John Bolduc, denied Rice’s request on grounds that Rice did not depart the agency in good standing. Rice’s lawsuit says he has concerns for his safety in public places because of his work in law enforcement.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit seeking to outlaw the state’s legal brothel industry. Chief U.S. District Judge Miranda Du dismissed the lawsuit Tuesday, ruling that the allegations made against the state were insufficient “on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.” In her court order granting the dismissal, Du said the plaintiffs relied on federal criminal statutes that prohibit illegal prostitution and sex trafficking across states. In February, Reno attorney Jason Guinasso filed the suit against the state on behalf of Rebekah Charleston, who claimed she was a victim of sex trafficking in brothels. The lawsuit additionally named two other women who also claimed they were trafficked in Nevada. The suit sought to end ordinances that allow legalized prostitution in Lyon, Elko, Lander, Mineral, Nye, Storey and White Pine counties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s congressional delegation is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to level the playing field for producers of biomass energy. The four-Democrat delegation wants electricity in the Renewable Fuel Standard program in time for biomass power producers to participate in the 2020 market. They say New Hampshire’s biomass power industry has been directly threatened by the agency’s failure to include electricity in the program. The program was created by Congress in 2005 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector and expand the nation’s renewable fuels sector, which includes electricity produced by biomass. The letter signed by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Reps. Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas says the omission puts rural jobs and local government infrastructure at risk in farming, forestry, logging and waste-to-energy.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMaurice River: State environmental officials are moving to protect a lighthouse on Delaware Bay considered one of the most vulnerable in the nation to rising seas and storm surges. The Department of Environmental Protection said Friday that it will begin this week to protect the East Point Lighthouse with giant, sand-filled synthetic fabric tubes meant to temporarily keep the waves and tides at bay until a long-term solution can be found. The project will cost more than $460,000 at the lighthouse in Maurice River Township in Cumberland County, using a grant from the National Park Service. The two-story brick structure was built in 1849 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It sits just 90 feet from the mean high-water mark, but during storms the surf pounds against an earthen wall just 10 yards from the lighthouse’s front steps.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many state lawmakers say they want to build up the government workforce, but the vacancy rate in the state’s executive branch has clung to about 22% even after pay raises and increased recruitment efforts. The Albuquerque Journal reports state agencies are competing with strong demand in the private sector for workers, especially in southeastern New Mexico, where an oil boom is generating high-paying jobs. Officials say low pay in some state departments and the reputation of state government itself after years of belt-tightening also are factors. State Personnel Director Pamela Coleman says she’s optimistic the vacancy rate will fall as the new administration’s priorities take hold. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took office Jan. 1, when the vacancy rate in state government was also about 22%.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City voters used to picking one candidate per race may soon be marking their ballots for up to five. A measure on the city’s ballot Tuesday will let voters rank their choices in primaries and special elections for mayor, city comptroller, public advocate, borough president and City Council starting in 2021. The system is known as ranked-choice or instant-runoff voting. It is in effect in U.S. cities including San Francisco, Minneapolis and Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well as throughout Maine. Backers say ranked-choice voting forces candidates to broaden their appeal beyond a narrow base in hopes of being chosen second or third by voters whose favorite is someone else. Critics of the system call it unconstitutional or confusing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Cold weather is hitting western North Carolina, but fewer homeless shelters are allowing men inside. The Asheville Homeless Coalition called a “code purple” for Friday. That means organizations will open shelters from the cold. But in recent years, a number of shelters have said they would no longer host men. The shelters cite growing security concerns and an inability to ensure the safety of women and children. They also said they need more support from local police. A yearly census of the homeless in the area found that more than 70% were men.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum is asking for federal help for farmers and ranchers struggling with wet harvest conditions. State Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring says unusual and relentless wet weather has been overwhelming for agricultural producers. Excessive rain, an early October snowstorm, widespread flooding and high winds have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in commodity losses in North Dakota. Burgum is asking for a secretarial disaster designation, which would make federal loans available to farmer and ranchers. To qualify for a secretarial designation, a county must have experienced a minimum 30% production loss of at least one crop due to natural disaster. In North Dakota, 45 of the state’s 53 counties report meeting that threshold.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An analysis has found a growing number of small towns in the state have disbanded in recent years. The analysis of statewide election results found 12 small towns have gone defunct in the past 15 years. The number of small towns dying has increased as costs go up and revenues decline. Residents of Newtonsville and Amelia in southwestern Ohio’s Clermont County will vote Tuesday on whether to dissolve those villages. They would be absorbed by surrounding townships if voters approve dissolution. The imposition of a 1% tax on residents’ income in each town has spurred some supporters of dissolution, while opponents argue villages provide a personal touch not found in townships. Newtonsville has about 400 residents. Amelia has about 5,000.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former four-term Democratic congressman from the Sooner State is quitting his position as a member of the National Rifle Association’s 76-member board, citing the organization’s “mounting troubles.” In his resignation letter obtained by the Associated Press, Dan Boren suggests some current and past NRA members have lost trust in the group, which has been roiled by infighting that included severing ties with Ackerman McQueen, its longtime Oklahoma-based public relations firm. In the letter to the organization’s Secretary and General Counsel John Frazer, Boren also said he was ending his NRA membership. The 46-year-old Boren is part of one of Oklahoma’s most powerful political families. He’s the son of ex-Gov. and U.S. Sen. David Boren and the grandson of ex-congressman Lyle Boren.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Many users of natural gas will see an increase in their bills starting in November. The Oregon Public Utility Commission has approved rate hikes for the state’s three gas utilities, only the third time in the past ten years. The increase in the wholesale cost of natural gas is blamed on a pipeline explosion last winter that affected regional gas supplies, according to a statement from the Public Utility Commission. An overall increase of $15.142 million was approved for NW Natural, which serves nearly 670,000 customers in the Willamette Valley and on the Oregon Coast from Astoria to Coos Bay. Typical residential customers of NW Natural using 54 therms per month will see their bill increase by $2.31, or 4.4%, from $52.43 to $54.74.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPocono Manor: Authorities said Saturday that firefighters were still looking for hot spots at a wind-whipped fire that has destroyed much of a century-old Poconos resort. No injuries were reported in the blaze reported at 6 a.m. Friday at the Pocono Manor Resort, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Officials say guests in about 25 rooms were safely evacuated. They believe the fire started in a dining area and quickly spread. The Monroe County resort, known locally as “the grand lady of the mountains,” was built by Quakers in 1902 and designated a historic site in 1977. The inn had been set to close later this month for a two-year renovation. The Pocono Mountains Visitors Bureau said several properties offered alternatives for overnight guests, groups and weddings booked through this month.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has officially taken control of the city’s struggling school district. State officials authorized the takeover shortly after researchers at Johns Hopkins University released a scathing report in June that found the district beleaguered with low test scores, crumbling infrastructure and widespread dysfunction, labeling it among the worst in the nation. The takeover, which began Friday, is expected to last at least five years. State Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green, who controls the school budget, program and personnel, says it’s a new chapter for Providence schools, students and families. A website was launched to provide updates. Infante-Green is searching for a superintendent to manage the turnaround.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Officials have confirmed seven more cases of mumps at the College of Charleston, bringing the total number of cases to 18 since the state declared an outbreak in September. News outlets report the new cases of the viral disease at the school were confirmed Thursday. College spokesman Mark Berry says the college will operate normally “regardless of the number of positive mumps cases.” The state Department of Health and Environmental Control said the first case was confirmed Sept. 17. It said the cases involve both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Officials say some of the cases aren’t infectious, but students should monitor themselves. Vaccination is also recommended. Mumps can be transmitted through air droplets from coughs and sneezes.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline in the state are pointing to a significant oil spill in their neighbor to the north to help make their case. A handful of water permits were up for consideration last week before the state water management board in Pierre. The meetings were contentious enough that the process will be extended to additional meetings in December. As those meetings were underway, a spill of about 383,000 gallons was reported along the Keystone pipeline in northeastern North Dakota. Faith Spotted Eagle, a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, said it was a sharp contrast to assertions that the Keystone XL in South Dakota would be safe. A spokeswoman for TC Energy, developer of both pipelines, said it’s unfortunate opponents are using the North Dakota spill to claim the Keystone XL would be unsafe.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Three condemned inmates in the state have chosen to die in the electric chair in the past year, claiming the state’s lethal injection method is even worse. Tennessee is one of six states that allow inmates to choose electrocution. Courts in Georgia and Nebraska have found the electric chair unconstitutional, and the U.S. Supreme Court has never fully considered its constitutionality. The Tennessee inmates argued in court that the state’s midazolam-based lethal injection method causes feelings of burning and suffocating. But their court challenge was dismissed when they failed to prove a more humane method was available. Tennessee has three executions scheduled and nine more in the works. Unless something changes, it is likely the three inmates who opted for the electric chair won’t be the last.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The University of Texas chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity has been shut down following a university investigation into hazing allegations. The investigation found that during the 2018-19 school year, fraternity pledges were shot with airsoft guns and forced to eat spicy soup made with ghost peppers and cat food. Officials said pledges competed in relay races where they would run back and forth between the chapter house and a nearby apartment building while chugging milk mixed with hand soap, laundry detergent or vinaigrette. The chapter officially closed Tuesday. Fraternity CEO Mark E. Timmes said shuttering the chapter was the “only appropriate action.” Fraternity officials say the students involved have been placed on disciplinary alumni status. It’s the third hazing allegation in the chapter in the past eight years.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Gary Herbert has asked the White House to send more refugees to the state. The Republican governor sent a letter to President Donald Trump last week. Herbert says Utah has the resources and space for refugees. In the past, Herbert says Utah has been able to accept 1,000 refugees per year, but the numbers of those settling in the state have decreased. Herbert sent the letter as the Trump administration prepares to reduce the number of refugees accepted into the country, while allowing states more say over whether they will accept them. Herbert says the compassion to welcome refugees is a part of the culture of Utah, where members of The Church of Latter-day Saints found refuge generations ago. He says Utah’s refugees contribute to the communities where they resettle.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: The town is going to have to repay the federal government more than $137,000 it received to help pay for repairs caused by flooding from Tropical Storm Irene. But Killington won’t have to repay an additional $197,000 after it won an appeal to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Rutland Herald reports the issue stems from the replacement of two large culverts that washed out during Irene in 2011. The town replaced them with concrete bridge structures. FEMA says it felt the town went beyond the scope of the agreed-upon work and wants the money back. Select Board Chairman Steve Finneron says the town appealed FEMA’s ruling, which took several years. The final decision came down at the end of October.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: Nearly 5,000 acres of woodlands in northern Botetourt County are to become part of the Jefferson National Forest. The Roanoke Times reports the U.S. Forest Service used money from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund to buy the property in what it calls one of the largest purchases for conservation in Virginia. The $5 million purchase was made possible earlier this year by a vote in Congress to reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a $900 million program that uses royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling to pay for protection of unspoiled lands. The land, which includes 14 freshwater springs, borders Craig Creek and also includes the Grace Furnace, a historic pig iron facility that likely provided iron ore for munitions during the Civil War.\n\nWashington\n\nSnoqualmie: The Snoqualmie Tribe has purchased the Salish Lodge & Spa and the acreage surrounding Snoqualmie Falls, marking a major victory in the tribe’s pursuit to reclaim land it considers sacred. The Seattle Times reports the Snoqualmie Tribe purchased the Northwest landmark and land from the Muckleshoot Tribe for $125 million, according to a news release. The total area is about 45 acres. The purchase does not include Snoqualmie Falls itself, but the tribe said it plans to discuss ownership of the underlying aquatic lands with the state. Puget Sound Energy holds the license to two hydroelectric generating plants at the falls. The Snoqualmie Tribe has spent years fighting against development near Snoqualmie Falls. Tribal members believe that the mists of the falls carry prayers to their ancestors, who used the site as a gathering place.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University says it plans to open a commercial compost facility in January. The university said in a statement that it’s working to obtain funding for the last piece of equipment needed to make the site fully functional. The facility is being developed by the university’s Sustainability Department, and sustainability manager Amy Parsons-White says most of the waste produced at Marshall can either be recycled or composted. Marshall President Jerome Gilbert says it’s a way for the school to help the environment and give back to the community. The statement says compost produced by the facility will be used on the Huntington campus and sold to the public.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers says it’s “astonishing” that Republicans want to fire his agriculture secretary. Evers appointed Brad Pfaff to lead the agency in January, but the Senate has not voted to confirm him. Pfaff angered lawmakers when he criticized the Legislature’s Republican-controlled budget committee for not releasing $200,000 to help with farmer mental health programs. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald’s spokesman Alec Zimmerman says there aren’t enough votes in the Senate to confirm him. He says Fitzgerald asked Evers to withdraw the nomination. Evers said in a statement that removing Pfaff would “create even more uncertainty and instability” for farmers and rural communities. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Pfaff on Tuesday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Yellowstone National Park officials say that despite the challenges of managing visitors eager to photograph wildlife in the park, the number of conflicts involving humans and bears was low in 2018. Yellowstone biologist Kerry Gunther says in the park’s annual bear report that it was a considerable challenge to manage visitors who stopped to view and photograph bears foraging in roadside meadows, creating what she called “large bear jams.” The Cody Enterprise reports rangers were notified of 1,627 grizzly and black bear sightings in the park between March 10, 2018, the first sighting of bear activity of the spring, through Dec. 20, 2018, the last black bear sighting of the year. Yellowstone officials predict bears will become more habituated to humans as the park welcomes more visitors.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/20/fire-advances-general-sherman-flags-mark-virus-deaths-news-around-states/118840688/", "title": "Fire advances on General Sherman, 660K flags mark virus deaths ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state could see its shipments of monoclonal antibodies reduced as federal officials take over distribution to equitably dispense the limited life-saving resource amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the state health officer said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the change was needed after just seven states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas – accounted for 70% of monoclonal antibody orders in the country. “Given this reality, we must work to ensure our supply of these life-saving therapies remains available for all states and territories, not just some,” the department said in a statement. The seven states are also among those that have the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday that federal officials told states providers would no longer be able to order the drugs directly but would have to place those orders through state health departments. “We are really sorry to say there are probably going to be some patients who aren’t able to access that drug who thought they were going to have that available to them,” Harris said. Doctors continue to emphasize that vaccination, rather than a secondary treatment after the fact, is the best way to prevent severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nAlaska\n\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson: Military leaders on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson have declared a public health emergency and encouraged all personnel to avoid places that do not require masks or social distancing in response to increasing COVID-19 cases across the state, officials said. “We’ve all seen COVID-19 cases continue to spread rapidly across our nation, the state of Alaska and in our local community,” U.S. Air Force Col. Kirsten Aguilar, 673rd Air Base Wing and JBER commander, said in a statement Friday. “After close consultation with JBER mission commanders, I have decided to declare a Public Health Emergency.” Aguilar said the declaration will remain in effect for 30 days but could be shortened or extended based on cases and community transmission of COVID-19. The base has also transitioned to Health Protection Condition Bravo, which means Aguilar will be able to implement additional measures to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, “including restricting access to off-base establishments,” the statement said. Hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases throughout the state have increased as a result of the highly contagious delta variant. Alaska on Friday reported more than 1,200 newly confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Board members overseeing Arizona’s most populous county reached an agreement Friday evening with the Republican-controlled state Senate that will end a standoff over a Senate demand that they hand over computer routers for use in an unprecedented partisan election review. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors announced that a special master will take questions from the Senate’s election review contractors and provide them with information contained on the routers that they say they need to finish the election review. Supervisor Bill Gates said the deal will protect sensitive information contained on the routers while avoiding a massive penalty the county faced if they had not complied. Gates called the deal “a win for transparency, and it’s also a win for protecting sensitive data in Maricopa County.” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a decision last month that the county must comply with the subpoena issued by Republican Senate President Karen Fann or lose about $700 million in yearly state funding. The county agreed to drop a $2.8 million claim it filed with the Senate after election equipment it handed over to the auditor was decertified and needed to be replaced.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: A former sheriff’s deputy was charged Friday with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists. A special prosecutor announced the felony charge against Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis faces between three and 10 years in prison if convicted. Davis shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to the arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands. Davis, who is white, was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: Hot, dry weather Sunday added to the challenges facing firefighters battling to keep flames from driving farther into a grove of ancient sequoias, where the base of General Sherman, the world’s largest tree, has been wrapped in protective foil. Fire officials warned that stronger winds were also contributing to “critical fire conditions” in the area of the KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked blazes that merged on the western side of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread. The fires forced the evacuation of the park last week, along with parts of Three Rivers, a foothill community of about 2,500 people. Crews have been bulldozing a line between the fire and the community. More than 34 square miles of forest land have been blackened. The National Park Service said Friday that flames had reached the westernmost tip of the Giant Forest, where it scorched a grouping of sequoias known as the “Four Guardsmen” that mark the entrance to the grove of 2,000 sequoias. Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires – fueled by climate change – can overwhelm the trees.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A civil rights investigation that was launched amid outrage over the death of Elijah McClain – a Black man put into a chokehold during an encounter with suburban Denver police two years ago – found a deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing within the department, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. He said Wednesday that the investigation found the Aurora Police Department has long had a culture in which officers treat people of color, especially Black people, differently from white people. He said the agency also has a pattern of using unlawful excessive force, frequently escalates encounters with civilians, and fails to properly document police interactions with residents. It’s the latest mark against the Aurora department since Weiser’s office indicted three officers and two paramedics on manslaughter and other charges this month in connection with McClain’s death. “These actions are unacceptable. They hurt the people that law enforcement is entrusted” to serve, Weiser said. Police stopped McClain, a 23-year-old massage therapist, as he walked home from a store Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed “sketchy.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: The town’s police force is warning residents to stay away from aggressive minks. In a recorded message sent to residents, Capt. Todd Olson of the Stonington Police Department urged people to stay away from a mink if they see one, The Day of New London reports. Olson said that even though they resemble a pet ferret, minks are territorial and are not friendly. One of them chased a person Wednesday, he said. Olson said the department’s animal control officer notified the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection about the minks, and the agency is looking into the situation. A mink farm once operated in the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: African folk music played through the Herman M. Holloway Sr. Park as the community gathered Saturday to participate in the 25th African American Family Festival. The festival, designed to celebrate “everything African,” also serves as an opportunity to raise awareness about social issues – including COVID-19. “We want to do good things for the people in our community so they don’t feel like all good things happen in majority-white neighborhoods,” said Harmon Carey, the event organizer. “A lot of African American festivals have moved away from the community, near white communities, or they have completely stopped doing events.” The aroma of African cuisines filled the park as children playfully jumped in a bounce house, and adults gathered around jewelry and clothing stalls, adorned with traditional African stones and colorful fabrics. A Mobile Health Unit set up by the Life Health Center conducted coronavirus tests and encouraged people to get vaccinated. “It is kind of a hit and miss, but every time I come out, I cross my fingers and hope that we get a good response,” said Kyme McCleary, a nurse at the mobile unit. The unit focused on vaccinating children ages 12 and up during the first half of the event, followed by adults for the later part of the day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 660,000 white flags are waving in the air on the National Mall, each honoring one American life that has ended due to COVID-19. The installation, called “In America: Remember,” covers more than 22 acres in 143 sections near the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, WUSA-TV reports. Volunteers from Ruppert Landscape installed the flags over the course of three days, completed Friday. The installation will be up for a total of three weeks, lasting until Oct. 3. Visitors are invited to get involved in the memorialization, come to the mall and personalize a flag for someone they have lost. Those who can’t make it in person can dedicate a flag virtually on the installation’s website. Artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg conceived the idea, beginning last fall with 267,080 flags placed outside RFK Stadium in Northeast D.C. Firstenberg – described as a “social action artist” based in the D.C. area, according to the installation’s website – has also spent 25 years participating in hospice volunteering.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: The mayor says officials will revamp a program that allowed police officers to notify landlords when their tenants had been arrested, even in cases in which charges were later dropped. The decision to reform Tampa’s Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program was announced by Mayor Jane Castor on Saturday following an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times that showed police officers were reporting tenants after arrests for misdemeanor crimes and the arrests of juveniles, and about 90% of the 1,100 people flagged by the program were Black tenants. Under the announced changes, the city will inform landlords only about “certain serious drug and violent felonies.” A police captain must sign off on notices sent, and landlords will be notified only about arrests that happen on their properties. The program was created in 2013 with the goal of stamping out drug and gang crime in apartment complexes. At its peak, about 100 apartment complexes were enrolled. While Castor touted the program as having “improved the safety and quality of life for tens of thousands of people,” Yvette Lewis, president of the Hillsborough County NAACP, said it could still violate a renter’s civil rights by resulting in an eviction based solely on an arrest. “This program needs to be stopped,” she said. “You’re treating housing as though it’s a privilege.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A disaster relief organization founded by actor Sean Penn is boosting the state’s drive to inoculate people against COVID-19, though some of its pop-up vaccine clinics have struggled to attract people. CORE has offered COVID-19 shots at hundreds of sites in big and small communities around the state, including schools, farmers markets and meat plants. But it has had few takers at some locations – a likely reflection, at least in part, of skepticism about vaccines in Georgia. The percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in the state is well below the national average, and that’s a big factor in Georgia’s nearly three-month surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. On a recent weekday, one person came in to get inoculated over six hours at an Atlanta church where CORE was offering the Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. State health officials say regardless of how many people show up at each site, the group has been a key partner in their mobile vaccination efforts. “We feel like every opportunity is not wasted if we can get a shot in an arm,” said Chris Rustin, a senior adviser to the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: At least seven people were injured Saturday in the collapse of a large tree branch in Waikiki, Hawaii News Now reports. A large branch of a banyan tree came crashing down about 12:15 p.m. at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the heart of the popular tourist district, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services told Hawaii News Now. The seven people who suffered multiple injuries included some with serious head injuries and multiple cuts. Four of the seven were treated and transported to a nearby hospital, Honolulu EMS said. Among those seriously injured were a 50-year-old man, a 22-year-old woman, a 28-year-old woman and another woman whose age was not disclosed, according to Hawaii News Now. Three others evaluated at the scene refused to be transported. The banyan reaches a height up to 100 feet and spreads laterally indefinitely, with its branches dropping new roots to the ground, creating a structure that can appear to be composed of many separate trees. Hilton Hawaiian Village said in a statement after the incident: “Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and their families. Our hotel team along with several guests responded immediately and the proper authorities were contacted. The wellbeing, safety and security of our guests and team members are of paramount importance.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican state officials are warning President Joe Biden of legal action if his proposed COVID-19 vaccine requirement for about 100 million Americans goes into effect. Gov. Brad Little, Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, House Speaker Scott Bedke and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder said in a letter Friday that there appears to be no legal basis for the requirement. “If you choose to continue to move forward in this direction, the State of Idaho will have no choice but to take the necessary legal actions to uphold its sovereignty, check the overreach of power by federal bureaucracy, and uphold the system of checks and balances our Constitution guarantees,” they wrote in the letter to Biden. Many Idaho Republican lawmakers are angry with the vaccine mandate that requires employers with more than 100 workers to require the workers either to be vaccinated or to be tested for the coronavirus weekly. The officials’ letter comes a day after the entire state entered crisis standards of care because of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients filling hospitals. The standards allow health care providers to give scarce resources, such as ventilators, to the patients most likely to survive. The letter also comes as Republicans jockey for position ahead of the GOP primary early next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A kind of bird that not that long ago was so rare in Illinois that people traveled hours just to catch a glimpse of one has lately been winging its way through the Chicago area. Snow-white 30-pound birds called the American white pelican are on their semiannual migration through Illinois right now. The trip means hundreds of them stop to rest near the Four Rivers Environmental Education Center in Channahon, 50 miles southwest of Chicago. Thousands more stop for a bit about 150 miles beyond Channahon at the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge in Lewistown. Among reasons this might be happening is that decades of wetland restoration across the country have helped increase the number of birds from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 180,000 today. As to why Illinois has seen so many more, American Birding Association webmaster Greg Neise told the Chicago Tribune that perhaps the birds that traditionally breed in Canada and the Great Plains and migrate to the Gulf Coast every winter started breeding in northern Wisconsin. He said another possibility might be that Asian carp that have invaded Illinois waterways in recent years are, as the pelicans have discovered, good eating.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest hospital system says more than 100 workers are no longer employed with the health network after they did not comply with its mandate for all employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Indiana University Health said Thursday that 125 employees had departed from the hospital system after a two-week unpaid suspension period that ended Sept. 14. Officials did not say whether those workers quit or were fired, saying in a statement that they “chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and have left the organization.” IU Health did not provide details on what kinds of positions were affected or whether any of the employees worked in bedside care. The 125 former employees were a small percentage of IU Health’s work force of about 36,000. IU Health announced in June that it would require all its doctors, nurses and other employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 1. The health system operates 15 hospitals and dozens of outpatient clinics around the state. Two weeks ago, IU Health said suspended employees would be allowed to return to work if they attested to partial or full vaccination. At the time, it said that fewer than 300 workers had been suspended, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal.\n\nIowa\n\nBurlington: Paint-A-Thon participants are hoping the goodwill it brings to the community each year will spread much like the virus that resulted in the cancellation of last year’s event. Each year, hundreds of Burlington and West Burlington residents work with their neighbors, co-workers and friends to paint houses for those most in need. “It’s like a good virus,” said Mark Rosenburg, team leader for Bethany Lutheran Church, who was painting a house on Elm Court. “It goes to the community and spreads.” The Burlington/West Burlington Paint-A-Thon is hosted each year by Two Rivers Bank and Trust in collaboration with Diamond Vogel Paint and Community Action of Southeast Iowa. One of the program’s goals is to beautify the homes of those who cannot afford a fresh coat of paint. This year’s event marks the 28th annual Paint-A-Thon. Last year’s was canceled because of COVID-19. When Paint-A-Thon first started in Burlington, an organizer reached out to all the churches in the city asking for help. Since then, it has become an annual tradition for many houses of worship. Individuals can apply to have their home painted or can be nominated by someone else. Community Action goes through a selection process in which members seek out the neediest homeowners to receive assistance.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Sit-ins and marches have followed alleged sexual assault on two major university campuses in the state. Dozens of University of Kansas students staged a sit-in in front of the chancellor’s office Friday in an ongoing protest of the handling of allegations that a fraternity member sexually assaulted another student. A spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi has said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. Protesters are demanding that university officials take action against the fraternity as well as the alleged perpetrator, The Kansas City Star reports. They changed a placard at the entrance of the office of the chancellor, renaming it “Office of the Complicit,” and taped other signs with messages to the glass windows at Chancellor Doug Girod’s office. Meanwhile, more than 200 people marched to the Wichita State University police station to protest the handling of a reported rape in a dormitory. The Wichita Eagle reports students gathered Friday at Shocker Hall, where the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred Sept. 12. They then marched to the campus police station. Some carried signs reading: “We deserve a rape-free campus,” and “WSU, do better.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A $21 million project at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport will install geothermal wells to heat and cool the facility. Crews will drill 648 vertical geothermal wells that go 500 feet deep on the east side of the airfield. Geothermal wells use the earth’s natural temperature to heat and cool. The new system will cut carbon emissions by 80% and use 40% less energy than traditional systems, the airport said. “Not only will this innovative technology make systemwide improvements and increase efficiencies, but we are also setting an example in the industry to reduce carbon emissions and energy use,” said Dan Mann, executive director of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority. Airport officials held a formal groundbreaking Thursday for the project, which is part of a larger set of improvements to the airfield and terminal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Garbage and debris are piling up along many streets almost three weeks after Hurricane Ida pounded southeast Louisiana as residents react with increasing anger and, in some cases, dark humor. Several residents told a City Council committee Friday that they haven’t had their garbage collected since days before the storm hit Aug. 29. “I was at the point of naming every maggot in my garbage, and I was going to put them on my income tax as dependents,” a woman told council members at City Hall. “This is not good government. This is just incompetence.” Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration has said much of the problem arises from labor shortages that have plagued the city for months, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, then, the storm. The city sought bids from companies wanting to supplement its two main waste contractors, officials said Thursday. A Sept. 8 deadline was extended to Sept. 13 due to a lack of response. After the later deadline, one contractor was hired to aid trash collection efforts Thursday in part of the city. Another contractor who bid on another area had 20 trucks available – but no labor. On Thursday, Cantrell’s office announced a plan to use workers and equipment from various city agencies to supplement trash pickup.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The public gets an opportunity Monday to weigh in on Democratic and Republican proposals for reshaping the border of Maine’s 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts. Both proposals released Thursday focus on Kennebec County, and both parties agree on moving Augusta, the capital city, to the state’s northern district. There’s disagreement, however, on reshuffling a dozen other towns. Democrats want to move both August and Waterville, along with several other Democratic-leaning towns. Republicans targeted a different grouping of towns. Based on the 2020 election, the Republican proposal would have meant nearly 900 additional votes for President Joe Biden and the Democratic proposal would mean about 6,200 extra votes for Biden in the district, according to an analysis by the Bangor Daily News. Former President Donald Trump won the vote in the 2nd Congressional District, picking up one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Sen. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, who is serving on the commission for Senate Republicans, said he’s optimistic the differences can be ironed out. “I think we are pretty close, at least on the congressional side,” he told the Portland Press Herald. The state’s bipartisan redistricting commission is racing to meet a Sept. 27 deadline.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Legislative auditors found that glitches in the cashless tolling infrastructure at the state’s bridges, tunnels and express lanes overbilled motorists thousands of dollars. The Baltimore Sun reports the Office of Legislative Audit’s report on the Maryland Transportation Authority comes about a year after the state announced it permanently ceased cash toll collections – put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic – and moved to fully electronic tolling systems. “We received allegations on our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline alleging that MDTA was not taking sufficient action to detect and address the overbilling of customers for electronic tolling due to issues with its new toll equipment,” Legislative Auditor Gregory Hook wrote in a letter to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “Our audit disclosed that MDTA was inconsistent in its actions related to the impact of issues with its electronic toll collection system on its customers and potential customer overbillings.” The report identified tolling issues at the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge in Cecil County.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The city known for its witch trials more than three centuries ago will require a negative coronavirus test for people to attend some large Halloween events, officials said as they brace for the typical influx of visitors in the weeks ahead of the holiday. The Salem Board of Health voted Friday to require people to have a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend indoor events with more than 100 people at a public space. The requirement goes into effect Oct. 1 and lasts through Nov. 1. Masks are required inside all public businesses through mid-November. “The delta variant is so transmissible. We are seeing an increase in COVID case counts in Salem,” Mayor Kim Driscoll said. “Thankfully, more people are vaccinated, so we’re not seeing the crush of hospitalizations. But those numbers are up, too.” Details about rapid testing in the area will be announced soon. Vaccine mandates are in place for some events like the Horror Fest, which includes 50 indoor movies throughout October. “We’ll do whatever it takes to keep our audience safe,” said Kay Lynch, of Horror Fest. “We’ve capped our audience. We’ve required vaccination. Masks are required indoors.”\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: After hearing from critics, including the homeless, city officials have rejected an ordinance that would have cracked down on panhandling. The measure would have stopped people in Jackson from asking for money by speech or sign near banks, building entrances or outdoor dining or on public transportation. A violation would have carried a $100 fine. Kevin Hardman, who said he’s homeless, told the Jackson City Council that finding solutions to poverty would be a better step. “To penalize me or anyone because I’m poor, I don’t dress nice – if you see somebody in that condition, why won’t you help them?” Hardman said. A first reading of the ordinance was defeated 5-2 on Tuesday, MLive.com reports. Council member Karen Bunnell, who voted for the ordinance, said panhandling is a serious issue downtown. “Those are not just my constituents. Those are also my business owners,” she said. Mayor Derek Dobies, who opposed the ordinance, said it violated free speech. “The city can’t say it’s OK for the Salvation Army or firefighters to collect donations in some of these places but not allow poor people to ask for spare change,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Regulators have ordered Enbridge to pay more than $3 million for allegedly violating state environmental law by piercing a groundwater aquifer during construction of the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement. The state Department of Natural Resources said Enbridge, while working near Clearbrook in January, dug too deeply into the ground and pierced an artesian aquifer, which resulted in a 24 million-gallon groundwater leak. “Enbridge’s actions are a clear violation of state law, and also of the public trust,” said Barb Naramore, DNR deputy commissioner. “That is why we are using all of the tools in our authority to address the situation.” Enbridge said in a statement that it was reviewing the DNR’s order and would work with the agency on a resolution. It wasn’t until mid-June that the DNR discovered something was wrong after speaking to independent construction monitors who had observed water pooling in the pipeline trench near Clearbrook. The DNR has ordered Enbridge to put $2.7 million into escrow for restoration and damage to nearby wetlands. Enbridge is also required to pay $300,000 to mitigate the lost groundwater and $250,000 for long-term monitoring of the wetlands. Enbridge’s 340-mile Line 3 replacement pipeline, opposed by environmental groups and some Ojibwe tribes, is nearly complete.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An interactive exhibit prompts visitors to speak aloud the names of people who were killed in acts of racist violence in the United States during the civil rights era – incantations in a darkened room to honor some 150 men, women and children whose lives were cut short. The names appear on lighted glass panels, backed by images of trees. Next to each name is a code that visitors can scan with their cellphones. “Say his name to begin his story,” or “Say her name to begin her story,” says the recorded narrator, journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who made history in 1961 as one of the first Black students to enroll in the University of Georgia. The traveling exhibit, “Un(re)solved,” was created by PBS Frontline with artist, filmmaker and technologist Tamara Shogaolu. It is on display until Oct. 24 at the Two Mississippi Museums, which houses the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History under one roof. The exhibit opened in downtown Jackson on Aug. 28 – 66 years to the day after Emmett Till, a Black teenager from Chicago, was abducted, tortured and killed in the Mississippi Delta after witnesses said he whistled at a white woman. “Un(re)solved” focuses on the federal investigation of more than 150 cold cases under a law enacted in 2008, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Mississippi has 56 names in the exhibit – more than any other state.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A crowd gathered Saturday to celebrate the state’s bicentennial, with a World War II nurse leading the parade. KTVO reports Edith Harrington waved to the crowd from a military jeep, followed by about 100 entries that highlighted the history of the Show-Me State. The 98-year-old Harrington joined the United States Cadet Nurse Corps in 1943. The festivities also marked the election of state officeholders in 2020 whose traditional inauguration events were delayed because of the coronavirus. Missouri turned 200 years old last month. Territorial residents first sought statehood in 1818, but the request became bogged down in Congress by a dispute over whether slavery should be allowed. In March 1820, President James Monroe signed legislation known as the Missouri Compromise. Maine was allowed into the union as a free state and was allowed to draft a constitution as a slave state, so long as no other new slave states formed north of Missouri’s southern border. Missourians thought they had become a state, but the parties were premature. Missouri’s first constitution, which sought to exclude free “Negros or mulattoes” from the state, prompted further opposition in Congress. After a second compromise, Monroe signed legislation finally making Missouri the 24th state on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Interior Secretary Deb Haaland signed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes water rights compact Friday, settling a decades­long battle over thousands of individual water rights in Montana and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The deal also created a $1.9 billion trust to settle claims and refurbish the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project. The tribes have claims to more than 10,000 water rights beyond their reservation land. The compact offered a deal in which the tribes relinquished their claims to most of the water outside of the reservation. In exchange, the tribes will receive 211 water rights on their reservation, 10 water rights outside the reservation and co-ownership of 58 other water rights, along with the funding. “Our elders continually remind us to protect our water, and this day marks the beginning of the water compact implementation that will protect the water for all generations to come,” Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said in a statement. Montana lawmakers passed legislation approving the compact in 2015. Under the compact, the federal government will initially provide the tribes with $90 million over a 10-year period to rebuild the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, which was built in the 1900s.\n\nNebraska\n\nAlvo: A massive, flammable mountain of scrap tires that had grown to more than twice the size allowed under state environmental rules in a small eastern Nebraska town now appears to be in compliance. The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said a report that B-Rose Tire Recycling of Alvo had made significant progress in coming into compliance with a Sept. 1 deadline to bring its inventory below 160,000 passenger tire equivalents, according to the Omaha World-Herald. In April, the business signed a consent agreement with state regulators to drastically reduce its pile of shredded tires or face fines or other sanctions. By the middle of last year, the business’ pile of tires in the town halfway between Lincoln and Omaha had grown to as much as 323,228 passenger tire equivalents. B-Rose fell short of benchmarks in the agreement for July and August, but after a warning letter from the state agency Aug. 9, B-Rose reported hauling out 123,176 passenger tire equivalents to the landfill during August, exceeding the number of tires hauled out in the months of May, June and July combined. Officials at the State Fire Marshal’s office said Wednesday that they hadn’t yet conducted an inspection to determine if the business had created fire lanes for emergency vehicles between the tire piles.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A fire burned the main building of the Mount Charleston Lodge in a forest area that is a popular retreat from summer heat for Las Vegas residents. A fire official and a representative of the company that owns the business said the building that houses the lodge’s restaurant was a total loss, but cabins used for lodging weren’t damaged. No injuries were reported, officials said. The fire was reported about 4:45 a.m. Friday. Its cause wasn’t immediately known. Photos posted online showed flames flaring from the building, and Clark County Assistant Fire Chief Thomas Touchstone said the lodge’s dining area was fully engulfed when the first units arrived about 5 a.m. The lodge was built in the 1960s after a previous lodge on the site that had been operating since at least 1948 was destroyed by a fire in December 1961, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Since 2018, the property has been operated by Ellis Island Hotel & Casino. “The Lodge was a beloved landmark, and we plan on rebuilding and recreating the atmosphere and charm that so many were able to enjoy throughout the years,” Christina Ellis, the company’s marketing director, said in a statement. Touchstone said it appeared the fire started inside the building when no employees were there, and it was too dangerous for firefighters to enter the building to battle the blaze.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The head of the state’s health department on Friday accused a Republican lawmaker of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette was telling the Legislature’s fiscal committee that 90% of those hospitalized in New Hampshire due to the coronavirus are unvaccinated when she was interrupted by Rep. Ken Weyler of Kingston. “That is in doubt,” he said, adding that he has heard from emergency room workers who say 90% of those admitted have been vaccinated. “That is incorrect, and that is misinformation,” Shibinette told him, according to video of the exchange shared by WMUR-TV. “I have no idea why someone would say that, but that is incorrect, and that is the problem that we are having in increasing our vaccination rate: spreading misinformation about the COVID vaccine.” Republican members of the committee voted to table $27 million in federal virus relief funds that would have gone to the state’s immunization program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge who suggested to a domestic violence suspect that men are “in control” has been suspended without pay two years after he made the comments. The state Supreme Court announced Friday that it adopted the recommendation of a panel on judicial conduct to suspend Municipal Court Judge Steven Brister for one month, beginning Wednesday. The panel wrote in 2019 that Brister, who has served in both East Orange and Newark, told the man that men “can’t punch; you can’t hit. At best, you treat as if you’re holding a feather, just to let them know you’re the man, and you’re in control.” The panel wrote that the comments violated conduct rules, were disparaging to women and could create the perception of bias. It also wrote that Brister allowed his personal religious beliefs to influence his judicial role because he referred to women as being created “with the curve of the rib of Adam.” In a subsequent response to the panel’s report, Brister didn’t deny the remarks and called them “well-meaning but undeniably misguided” and said he had completed several ethics courses. An email message seeking comment was left Friday with an attorney who represented Brister.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s film industry has come roaring back to life this year and so far managed to avoid significant COVID-19 outbreaks. Many credit the stringent protocols put in place by the industry, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Film and TV productions in New Mexico got the green light to resume in September 2020. According to the New Mexico Film Office, from Sept. 1, 2020, through Sept. 1, 2021, there have been 176,598 coronavirus tests administered throughout the various productions. Of those, 183 were positive. “This is a testament to the film industry, as they want to mitigate and remain safe,” said Amber Dodson, director of the New Mexico Film Office. “There have been less than eight productions that have paused for their own safety during the last year.” As of Aug. 31, there were 18 film and 24 TV productions in various phases currently in the state. When the film industry paused in March 2020, leaders spent months developing protocols that would be put in place when it resumed. In June 2020, a white paper was created by a task force of the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee describing health and safety guidelines to resume film and TV production.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Most nonviolent parole violations will not result in jail time under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The “Less is More” law largely eliminates New York’s practice of incarcerating people for technical parole violations, including being late to an appointment with a parole officer, missing curfew, or failing to pay fees or to inform a parole officer of a change in employment. Starting in March, people on parole will land back behind bars only for drug or alcohol use if they were convicted of driving under the influence of those substances. Supporters of the law say that New York has one of the the nation’s highest rates of incarcerating people for technical parole violations and that the practice is costly and fuels the cycle of people landing behind bars again after serving their time. Criminal justice advocates applauded the law but urged Hochul and lawmakers to make it effective immediately. The move means an estimated 5,000 people who are behind bars for technical parole violations could eventually be eligible for release. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will be releasing “hundreds and hundreds of people the right way.” The governor also said she would sign off on the release of 191 eligible inmates from the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex, troubled by years of neglect.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Judges struck down the state’s latest voter photo identification law Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power. Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law was rushed and intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections. The law “was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,” Superior Court Judges Michael O’Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 102-page order. “Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence.” The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, will be appealed, Republicans at the Legislature said. A state appeals court had previously blocked the law’s enforcement last year. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Air Force Base has been selected for a military satellite mission, the state’s U.S. senators announced Friday. Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer said the base will be home to a Space Networking Center, which is part of the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency’s new low-Earth orbit mission. NASA defines low-Earth orbit as having an altitude of 1,200 miles or less. Hoeven said the mission serves as the backbone for all U.S. military communications. “Grand Forks is the ideal location to house this new Space Networking Center,” Hoeven said in a statement. The mission “provides essential support for our national security and will help our nation stay ahead of our adversaries in developing critical new technologies,” he said. Hoeven’s office said a military installation in Alabama also was selected as a center for the mission.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Republican lawmakers try to limit drop boxes and early voting, a new report shows rural Ohio voters want more flexibility in how they can cast their ballots. A poll commissioned by the nonpartisan election group Secure Democracy found that roughly three-quarters of rural voters support allowing counties to provide multiple early voting and ballot drop-off locations, as well as expanding the types of acceptable voter identification. They also back 24-hour drop box access and the use of a secure website to request an absentee ballot. The poll comes as legislators push separate bills that would alter the state’s rules for conducting elections. Supporters say the changes are necessary to prevent fraud, but opponents contend they would sow confusion and suppress votes. One proposal would eliminate in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day, limit drop boxes to 10 days before Election Day and require Ohioans to request mail-in ballots no later than 10 days before an election. A stricter measure would ban drop boxes entirely and significantly reduce the number of days for early voting, among other provisions. Officials with Secure Democracy say the bills could hurt voters in 17 rural counties who relied on voting flexibility even before the pandemic drove people toward absentee and early voting.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court will expedite an appeal of an injunction limiting a ban on mask mandates in public schools. The court, in an order dated Wednesday, placed the appeal on its fast-track docket, giving Attorney General John O’Connor 20 days to file briefs in the case and opponents 20 days to respond. The appeal argued the law passed earlier this year by the Legislature is constitutional. “The Legislature may reasonably exercise its … power over public schools without regulating private schools,” the filing said. The appeal also said the state is immune from the lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma State Medical Association and four parents. District Judge Natalie Mai cited the fact the law did not apply to private schools in approving the temporary injunction. Mai’s ruling allows for exemptions to mask requirements for medical or personal reasons, which Oklahoma State Medical Association President Dr. Mary Clarke said some schools have adopted. “It’s disappointing to see the Attorney General appeal a decision that even Gov. Stitt supported,” Clarke said in a statement. “We’ve seen several schools implement masking programs with opt-out clauses.”\n\nOregon\n\nBend: About two dozen people have contacted the state’s poison center after self-medicating against COVID-19 with a drug used to treat parasites, with five becoming hospitalized and two winding up in intensive care units, authorities said Friday. The drug they used was ivermectin, which has no proven use against the coronavirus and is instead approved to treat some parasites in people and some animals. “COVID-19 is a devastating disease and can be very frightening, but the public does not need to use – nor should it use – unproven and potentially dangerous drugs to fight it,” said Robert Hendrickson, medical director of the Oregon Poison Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 14, the Oregon Poison Center at OHSU managed a total of 25 cases. Five of those cases involved hospitalization, and two people were so severely ill that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for antiviral efficacy would require administration of doses of the drug up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans, the National Institutes of Health said. The Oregon Poison Center said its recent cases involved people experiencing mental confusion, balance issues, low blood pressure and seizures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Democrats in the state Senate sued Friday evening in a state court to block a Republican-approved subpoena seeking voter information and to put a stop to what Republicans call a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election. Democrats had said they would sue within days after the GOP-controlled Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee voted Wednesday to issue a subpoena that seeks detailed state election records, including communication with counties and the names of who voted in last year’s presidential election, their birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. The subpoena is an outgrowth of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he was cheated out of victory last November and ongoing pressure by Trump and his allies for battleground states where he lost to investigate the election. “The latest ploy by the Senate Republicans is unprecedented and completely unwarranted,” Democrats said in a statement. “All aspects of the certified 2020 election have been thoroughly reviewed and adjudicated in the courts with no findings of irregularities or fraud. The timeframe to contest the 2020 certified election results is long overdue.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A group of parents and grandparents has filed a legal challenge to Gov. Daniel McKee’s statewide school mask mandate. The lawsuit filed in Providence Superior Court on Thursday alleges the Democratic governor violated state law and the state constitution in both signing the K-12 mask mandate and declaring a new state of emergency due to the delta variant of the coronavirus, WPRI-TV reports. The 16 parents and grandparents from Glocester, Smithfield, North Smithfield and Warwick argue there is a double standard because the state no longer requires masks in restaurants, retail shops and other indoor spaces. They also question the science of mask-wearing, which state and national experts have said helps slow the spread of the virus. “Often, it appears that those at highest risk for the effects of COVID-19, the elderly, the obese, and those with multiple comorbidities, are willing to force the young and healthy, who are little affected by COVID-19, to suffer these irreparable harms on unproven science,” the complaint says. McKee spokesperson Alana O’Hare, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment. In the suit, the plaintiffs also say masks make it difficult for their children to breathe, hear and communicate, hampering the learning process.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The capital city will not allow people to carry guns in the open during protests, festivals or other events that need a city permit. The resolution passed unanimously earlier this month by the Columbia City Council also bans the open carrying of guns in city-owned buildings without written permission from the city manager, The State newspaper reports. The South Carolina General Assembly passed a law this year allowing people with a concealed weapons permit to carry those guns openly. But the law allowed local governments to ban open carry for specific events for a limited period of time. Columbia’s resolution will keep people safer, Mayor Steve Benjamin said. Concealed weapons permit holders “are incredibly responsible with the use of firearms, and I’m thankful for that,” Benjamin said. “But the ability for a good, hard-working police officer to be able to ascertain who’s who when someone has a sidearm on fully exposed is very difficult.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislative leaders on Friday distributed a petition to lawmakers asking them to support a special session to consider impeaching Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg for a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. House Speaker Spencer Gosch released the text of the petition. Two-thirds of both the Republican-controlled House and Senate must sign on to convene the special session. Lawmakers would meet in November, the day after they are scheduled to hold another special session to consider new legislative districts. The petition says the special session would be called for “investigating and evaluating whether the conduct of Jason Ravnsborg … surrounding the death of Joe Boever, involved impeachable offenses.” Gosch has said that if the special session is approved, he will appoint a committee to investigate the conduct of the attorney general, a Republican whose term runs through 2022. The South Dakota Legislature has never tried to impeach an official as powerful as an attorney general. It would require a simple majority of the House to approve articles of impeachment, while two-thirds of senators must vote to convict and remove him from office. The attorney general pleaded no contest to a pair of misdemeanors last month, and prosecutors dropped a third misdemeanor.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge has indefinitely blocked Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County, saying Friday that evidence shows Lee’s order prevents children with health problems from safely going to school during the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the preliminary injunction after parents of students with health conditions argued that the Republican governor’s executive order endangered their children and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing others to opt out of a mask mandate. “It is that unmasked presence that creates the danger to these Plaintiffs,” the judge wrote Friday. Meanwhile, two families in Williamson County, just south of Nashville, sued in federal court Friday, also challenging Lee’s order. In Shelby County, Lipman had already issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 3 stopping schools from allowing parents to opt out. It was set to expire Friday. The preliminary injunction continues blocking Lee’s order as the federal lawsuit proceeds. The injunction applies to all seven public school districts in Shelby County, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Shelby County Schools is Tennessee’s largest, with 100,000 students.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A man linked to the “boogaloo” movement who livestreamed threats to kill police was sentenced Friday to 50 years in prison after being convicted of attempted murder of a peace officer. On Thursday, a jury in Bowie County found 38-year-old Aaron Caleb Swenson guilty of attempted capital murder of a peace officer and found he’d violated the Texas Hate Crimes Act, the Texarkana Gazette reports. On Wednesday, before testimony began before the judge, Swenson had pleaded guilty to terroristic threatening and evading arrest. The newspaper reports that on Friday, the jury sentenced him to 50 years in prison for attempted murder, 20 years for terroristic threatening with a hate crime enhancement and 10 years for evading arrest. Prosecutor Kelly Crisp said the terms will run concurrently. The jury also assessed maximum fines on each of the three charges for a total of $30,000. Swenson testified he was trying to be killed by police in April 2020 when he made the threats and never intended to hurt anyone when he streamed on Facebook Live while driving in Texarkana, Texas, that he was searching for a police officer to kill. Texarkana crime scene analyst Spencer Price testified about the two pistols, 12-gauge shotgun, handmade sword and 156 rounds of ammunition found in Swenson’s truck.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Salt Lake: The Wasatch Youth Center is no more. Demolition crews began work last week tearing down the former long-term, secure lockup for child offenders. A backhoe knocked down brick walls and tore off the roof of a gymnasium. A stray office chair was picked up with some debris and thrown into the back of a dump truck. The juvenile detention facility is no longer necessary. “Because of some of the shifts in reforms in Utah in juvenile justice, this is a space where we don’t need this capacity anymore,” said Brett Peterson, the executive director of Utah’s Division of Juvenile Justice Services, told Fox13. “We’re able to reinvest our dollars in serving youth in their home, schools and communities.” It’s a result of a series of laws the Legislature passed beginning in 2017 dubbed “juvenile justice reform.” Instead of incarceration, the state has placed more of an emphasis on rehabilitation and community oversight for youth offenders. Funding has been shifted to ensure there are proper services to keep children facing what are termed “low risk” offenses out of detention facilities. The Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Services had actually planned to expand Wasatch Youth Center prior to the reform legislation. Instead, the land will be given back to the state for other needs.\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state plans to spend $25 million of its own funds to help redevelop old industrial sites. Historically, the costs of cleaning up former industrial sites that may be contaminated from previous industrial or commercial activities, known as “brownfields,” have been funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Vermont officials traveled Thursday to Springfield, where they highlighted that some of the state funds will be used to help redevelop the 270,000-square-foot former Jones & Lamson Machine Co. building that once employed 1,500 factory workers. Other sites that will be redeveloped with some of the money are in St. Albans and Burlington. “It’s an understatement to say this is just another brownfield site,” said Bob Flint, the executive director of the Springfield Regional Development Corp., which owns the 14-acre property. “This beats them all.” The projects were announced by Gov. Phil Scott. “This presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address longtime challenges and finally make good on the promise to increase economic equity from region to region and bring growth to all areas of the state, not just Chittenden County,” Scott said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Residents have a new digital option for proving they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Virginia Department of Health has added QR codes, barcodes that can be scanned with smartphones, to state COVID-19 vaccination records, officials announced Thursday. People will be able to prove they’ve been inoculated by showing a digital or printed QR code instead of a paper card, and they won’t need a special app. As more employers and businesses require employees and customers to be vaccinated, officials said this will boost the consistency and security of vaccination information while protecting individual privacy. Anyone vaccinated in Virginia can visit the department’s Vaccinate Virginia website to obtain their free vaccination record with QR code, which can then be saved to a phone gallery or printed out. The codes contain the same information as paper records, but the format offers more security, and the information is only available if a person chooses to share it, officials said. Because the digital records are digitally signed by the Department of Health, officials said they can’t be altered or forged. Businesses and employers can use a free app to scan the codes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has filed a class-action lawsuit against the city on behalf of its members and the public, saying the electric utility’s green power claims are misleading and hurting the tribe. The lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court on Friday seeks to stop Seattle City Light from claiming that it’s a fish-friendly, green and environmentally responsible utility until Seattle provides fish passage at its three Skagit River dams. “Until that happens, they are not as green as they say they are,” said Nino Maltos, chairman of the tribe. More than 80% of City Light’s energy comes from hydropower, which doesn’t directly emit climate-warming carbon dioxide. The city of Seattle is in the midst of a relicensing process for the dams. The tribe insists the utility can’t claim its dams are green while they block salmon passage on the region’s premier salmon river. Julie Moore, spokeswoman for Seattle City Light, said the utility won’t comment on litigation. But she said the relicensing process “gives us the opportunity to update the research and determine what additional measures may be necessary to protect fish moving forward. This includes looking at fish passage.” Native wild Chinook salmon, steelhead and resident bull trout within the Skagit River drainage all are threatened with extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic this month has already doubled the total from August. There have been 286 reported deaths from COVID-19 in September and at least 3,370 since the start of the pandemic, according to state health data. The September total includes at least 32 virus-related deaths added to the count after being reconciled with official death certificates. Deaths during the pandemic peaked in January, when there were 654 reported from Jan. 4 to Jan. 31. They slowed to 49 total deaths in July but picked up again in August with 148. “We’re going to have a bunch more die. That’s all there is to it,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a news conference Friday. “And the only way we can stop it from being a bunch more and then a whole lot more on top of that, in my opinion, is one thing, and that’s to get vaccinated. I’m going to continue to plead with you to do that because I don’t know anything else we can do.” Justice lifted a statewide indoor mask requirement in June as the number of cases dropped, and he’s balked at issuing a mandate vaccination or new mask requirements. He has said mandating masks is “penalizing” some people, but he’s not convinced it’s going to significantly help as the pandemic goes unchecked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The return of a popular annual music festival wasn’t what some vendors expected. After the event was canceled last year due to the coronavirus, Summerfest 2021 ended with mixed reports. Sellers who set up shop for the first time generally marked it a success, while longtime vendors saw it as a “total bust.” Vendors said during Saturday’s final day of the two-week concert that the crowds had picked up a bit more from the start but remained low compared to previous years. Surging cases of the delta variant of the virus and new pandemic protocols were cited as possible factors. “This was not what I expected,” said Kagan Tate, owner of Butterfly Connection. “A total bust.” Tania Espinoza Bonilla, owner of T for Textile, was selling for the first time at a large festival. Although she didn’t see the crowds she had hoped for, she said she was thankful for the exposure and connections she made for her business. “I’m sure the vaccine rule made a lot of people angry, but I supported it,” she said. Even before the pandemic, Summerfest had already experienced reduced attendance and in 2019 saw the lowest participation since 1986 with just more than 718,000 festivalgoers. Officials have not provided daily attendance numbers and would not comment on the numbers while the event was running.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Human remains found in a reservoir on the Wyoming-Idaho state line have been identified as a kayaker who drowned in 1995, investigators said. Kyle Martin, 24, was kayaking on the Hoback River when a companion lost his paddle. Martin went ahead but was never seen alive again. Relatives of Martin and sheriff’s officials briefly saw Martin’s body after a helicopter dislodged his kayak from a snag in the river a couple of days later, Teton County sheriff’s deputy Dave Hodges told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “He separates, and he’s on the surface, but I didn’t expect him to then submerge almost as quickly as he emerged,” Hodges recalled. Last winter, Hodges saw an entry in Forensics Magazine about human remains found in Palisades Reservoir, downstream from the Hoback River. A DNA sample from Martin’s mother confirmed they were her son’s remains. Hodges called Martin’s brother with the news Sept. 10. “It was an incredible moment to call family after 26 years and say that your son and your brother is finally coming home,” Hodges said. “We both had a moment of tears. It was a sense of closure for a family that’s been waiting so long to have their son and their brother home.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/06/02/elvis-estate-gets-cruel-students-demand-change-casino-workers-picket-news-around-states/50315949/", "title": "Elvis' estate gets cruel, students demand change: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state legislator appears to have lost to a primary challenger by a single vote after provisional ballots were counted Tuesday, setting up a possible recount in the race. Another state representative who was trailing a challenger said he will file an election contest in his GOP primary race after some voters in his district might have gotten the incorrect ballot. Republican state Sen. Tom Whatley of Auburn trailed primary rival Jay Hovey by a single vote after provisional ballots were counted Tuesday, Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl said. Hovey, a member of the Auburn City Council, had initially led by four votes, according to unofficial returns, but his lead shrank to a single vote after eligible provisional ballots were counted. Provisional ballots are votes for which there was initially a question about the voter’s eligibility. The vote is counted once that question is resolved. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said Whatley has 24 hours to request a recount if he chooses. Alabama provides automatic recounts in general elections. In a primary election, a candidate must request and pay for the recount. Meanwhile, unofficial returns showed Rep. Gill Isbell, R-Gadsden losing to Mack Butler, who previously served in the Legislature. But some voters got ballots with the wrong House district.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The owner of the largest natural gas utility in the state said it is selling the company to Canada-based TriSummit Utilities Inc. for $800 million. AltaGas Ltd. announced last Thursday that the sale includes Anchorage-based ENSTAR Natural Gas, associated pipelines and ENSTAR’s majority ownership in a gas storage facility, the Anchorage Daily News reports. AltaGas, also based in Canada, acquired Enstar in 2012. TriSummit has about 133,000 customers in Canada. ENSTAR, which has about 150,000 customers in Anchorage and parts of south-central Alaska, has had about 1% annual growth in customers in recent years, according to AltaGas. The company said the sale, in part, will allow it to reduce debt and make “higher growth investments” in other operations, the firm’s president, Randy Crawford, said in a statement. The sale is subject to regulatory approval. The companies expect it to close by early next year. TriSummit in a statement said it plans to “retain all of ENSTAR’s dedicated employees and hire new Alaska employees to perform certain functions currently performed out of state.” ENSTAR Natural Gas has about 200 employees.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Minority Democrats in the state Senate used a procedural move Tuesday to force a vote on legislation that would require background checks for any firearm purchase. The effort led to more than an hour of pleas from Democrats and pushback from Republicans, who for years have blocked all gun restrictions. All 16 Senate Republicans voted against the measure, while the 13 Democrats supported it. The bill, which never got a hearing, would have closed the so-called gun show loophole that allows someone to buy a gun without the federal background check that federally licensed firearms dealers are required to perform before a sale is completed. Republicans won’t even assign Democratic gun bills to a committee, meaning they never get hearings or a chance to get a formal floor vote. Democratic Sen. Martin Quezada bypassed that process to bring it right to the floor. “This isn’t a radical idea – this isn’t something that other states aren’t considering or even enacting,” Quezada said. He called requiring background checks for private gun purchases – anything except a transfer to a family member – a commonsense measure supported by overwhelmingly majorities of Americans that won’t prevent anyone legally allowed to have a gun from purchasing one. “We have that loophole built into our public policy,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: In the wake of a mass shooting in a neighboring state, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who chairs the National Governors Association, said the idea of raising the minimum age for purchasing semi-automatic rifles should be up for discussion. “I think you’ve got to be able to talk about the AR-15 style weapons and whether that’s an 18 or 21 age,” Hutchinson told CNN this week. “You have to at least have a conversation about that.” But Hutchinson, who leaves office in January, isn’t pushing for the limit in his own state. Any proposed gun restrictions are unlikely to find support among Republicans who control the Legislature. Arkansas Republicans are echoing their party’s calls at the national level to focus instead on beefing up school security or addressing mental health. “If we move to 21, and the shooter is 21, then they’ll want to move to 25,” said Republican state Sen. Bart Hester, who will serve as Senate president next year. “We have established that 18 in our society is an adult who can make adult decisions, and I’m good with that.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: More than half of substantiated child abuse reports in recent years were not in the state’s database, which could result in child abusers being allowed to care for children, state auditors said Tuesday. The unreliability of the database “puts children at risk,” auditors said. The database is used by state and county social services and welfare departments, adoption agencies, medical workers treating possible victims of child abuse, agencies conducting background investigations of applicants for law enforcement jobs, and agencies conducting background investigations on those who want to work or volunteer in positions that would give them access to children, like day care centers or group homes. But the flaws in the database mean those agencies “cannot depend on the database to help protect children,” acting California State Auditor Michael Tilden said in an opening letter to the governor and legislative leaders. The state’s Child Abuse Central Index, run by the state Department of Justice, contains more than 25,000 reports of sexual and physical abuse and neglect that are backed by county records. But there are more than 52,000 such reports in county records, meaning nearly 27,000 reports – 52% – are in county records but not the state’s database, auditors said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Denver-based federal appeals court has agreed with a lower court’s dismissal of a lawsuit that claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from then-President Donald Trump and had been rigged by Dominion Voting Systems, Facebook (now Meta) and others. Friday’s opinion from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, first reported by Colorado Politics, found that eight plaintiffs from across the U.S. had no standing to assert that the outcome of the election “violated the constitutional rights of every registered voter in the United States.” The lawsuit relied on baseless conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen in favor of Joe Biden. Among others, it named Facebook and Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, whose election machines remain the focus of some of the most fevered – and continuing – unfounded speculation about voting fraud. U.S. Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter dismissed the lawsuit in April 2021, finding the plaintiffs failed to show they had suffered specific injuries due to the election result and thus had no standing to bring the lawsuit. The appeals court agreed and dismissed the plaintiffs’ request to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all registered U.S. voters.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: Jury selection began Tuesday for the trial of a state senator and his 2018 campaign treasurer on federal fraud charges alleging they lied in efforts to obtain nearly $180,000 in public funds for his election bid. Bridgeport Democratic Sen. Dennis Bradley and Jessica Martinez, his 2018 campaign treasurer, began picking jurors in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, where their trial could begin as soon as Wednesday. Both deny the allegations and have pleaded not guilty. Federal prosecutors allege Bradley and Martinez improperly received about $84,000 from the Connecticut Citizens’ Election Program for the 2018 Democratic primary for the Senate seat, then improperly sought to obtain another $95,700 for the general election that year. Authorities say in court documents that Bradley and Martinez made “material misrepresentations and omissions to hide prohibited campaign activities” that would have barred them from receiving the public campaign funds. Among the allegations against Bradley, prosecutors say he used about $5,600 in personal funds to pay for a campaign launch party at a Bridgeport restaurant in March 2018 where he announced his candidacy and collected donations. Bradley knew his personal spending was limited to $2,000, prosecutors said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Mayor Mike Purzycki is proposing the city take ownership of the historic Gibraltar mansion and Marian Coffin gardens, nixing a plan to turn the mansion into a boutique hotel and wedding venue but maintaining developers’ plans to build housing on adjacent land. “As there are too many hard feelings over the way Gibraltar has deteriorated to allow the current owners to be part of any ownership plan, I propose that the city or a city subdivision acquire the entire property and take responsibility for care and maintenance of the mansion and grounds,” the mayor wrote to neighbors last week. Gibraltar Preservation Group – a limited liability company of which Drake Cattermole and David Carpenter are principals – has owned the 6-acre property since 2010. The two spent the following years amassing adjacent parcels to propose a financially viable rehabilitation project for the historic property. During that time, the mansion sat vacant and deteriorated. Local developer Robert Snowberger, of 9SDC – a Wilmington-based historic preservation contractor – introduced plans in February to turn the Gibraltar mansion into a boutique hotel, renovate the greenhouse and garage into restaurant and retail space, and build townhomes on vacant land surrounding the property. But that plan was met with community backlash.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Community groups came together Tuesday to launch the DC Peace Academy, aimed at training and supporting violence interrupters, WUSA-TV reports. The goal is to harness the expertise of organizers who have been fighting gun violence on their own for years and to give them the resources they’ve been lacking. “This gives us an opportunity to be able to center the voices of the people that are closest to this problem,” said Lashonia Thompson-El, executive director of Peace for DC, which is privately funding the program as it brings together multiple organizations into one academy. The 13-week, 125-hour training program educates activists on conflict-resolution and mediation techniques while offering them mental health support. “It’s a job. It’s a skill set. So we want to make sure you know how to do a proper mediation; you know how to engage an 11-year-old that has a gun, as opposed to a 20-year-old who may have a gun,” said Warees Majeed, who helped develop the curriculum. “We want to make sure that you know where the resources are in your community so that you can help better serve them and their family.”\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: U.S. wildlife officials have agreed to revise the critical habitat designation for Florida manatees, which have been dying in record numbers because water pollution is killing a main food source. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a court settlement made public Wednesday that it will publish a proposed revision by Sept. 12, 2024. The agreement comes in a long-running court case involving the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and the Save the Manatee Club. The rule would bring enhanced federal scrutiny to projects that might affect the manatee in waterways in which the marine mammals are known to concentrate. One such area is the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s east coast, where this winter officials successfully fed manatees tons of lettuce in an unprecedented experiment to prevent more starvation. Last year, more than 1,100 manatees died largely from lack of food, a state record. This year, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reports 562 manatee deaths as of late May. Dozens more have been rescued and are being cared for at facilities around the country. The manatee critical habitat designation has not been updated since 1976, but advocates have been pushing for a change since 2008. The state wildlife commission estimates there are about 7,500 manatees in the wild in Florida.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStone Mountain: Facing state demands to move forward, as well as public pressure after students produced a viral video showing widespread disrepair, a suburban Atlanta school board on Tuesday voted for a $50 million overhaul at an aging high school after previously voting three times against it. The DeKalb County school board voted unanimously to renovate Druid Hills High School, news outlets report. “I am proud to say today that we’re in unison, that we want what’s good for this district,” board Chair Vickie Turner said, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “It feels quite refreshing that we’ve made this progress.” The dispute over Druid Hills climaxed after students made a video about poor conditions including raw sewage, crumbling bathrooms and signs warning of possible electrical shock around utilities in one room. But last month the board rejected plans to overhaul the high school, instead voting to make minor repairs at all the district’s schools. Students from at least two other DeKalb high schools have since published similar videos. The dispute dredged up racial and class tensions that often divide the 93,000-student district between a wealthier white minority in its northern end and a poorer, Black majority in the southern end.\n\nHawaii\n\nPahoa: Police and federal authorities are investigating after a man building homemade fireworks died following an explosion at his house. Police on the Big Island said Tuesday that the man was severely injured by an explosion early Saturday at his home in the Puna district. The man was flown to a Honolulu hospital, where he died, police said. When police arrived at the home, the 35-year-old man was lying on the floor with a wound to his abdomen area. His wife and children were asleep but woke up because of the explosion shortly after 2 a.m. The man had been making homemade fireworks at the time, police said. Police found materials used to make fireworks, several guns and 214 marijuana plants. The exact cause of the explosion is under investigation.\n\nIdaho\n\nRigby: A 12-year-old girl who shot three people at an eastern Idaho junior high last year will likely remain in juvenile detention until her 19th birthday, according to newly released court documents. The girl was charged with three counts of attempted murder after she shot two students and a custodian at Rigby Middle School on May 6, 2021, EastIdahoNews.com reports. All three victims have recovered from their gunshot wounds. Though the school shooting was widely reported, the details about the subsequent charges and outcome of the case remained sealed for months. EastIdahoNews.com filed a public records lawsuit seeking access to the investigative documents, and in April a judge ordered that they be released. Last week, Magistrate Judge Stephen J. Clark ordered the release of some of the court documents as well, noting that the shooting was an “exceptional event.” “To state the obvious, the public has a right to access information concerning an exceptional event,” Clark wrote. The court documents show that the girl pleaded guilty to all three charges as part of an agreement with prosecutors. She was committed to the Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections until her 19th birthday or until the Custody Review Board deems her rehabilitated. She could be held by the juvenile corrections department until she turns 21.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A necropsy on a beloved, endangered shorebird named Monty the Piping Plover shows he died of a respiratory infection, experts said Tuesday. The Lincoln Park Zoo said it partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the University of Illinois Zoological Pathology Program to determine the bird’s cause of death. The severe fungal respiratory infection included a laryngitis that restricted Monty’s airway, the zoo announced. Additional testing is being conducted to identify the fungus, but it is suspected of being environmental in origin, the zoo said. Further testing concluded Monty did not show any signs of high pathogenic avian influenza, also known as bird flu, that has been spreading in several states, the zoo said. Monty died May 13 at Chicago’s Montrose beach. His remains will be provided to the Field Museum’s avian department to be available for future studies that contribute to the recovery of the Great Lake piping plovers, the zoo said.\n\nIndiana\n\nSalem: A young boy found dead inside a suitcase in a heavily wooded area of southern Indiana was laid to rest Wednesday following a memorial service in which a police chaplain called the unidentified child an “unknown angel.” Mourners gathered at the Weathers Funeral Home in Salem for Wednesday morning’s service. The child’s gray casket was topped by a floral arrangement and stuffed animals. Todd Murphy, the chaplain for the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, said donations from local residents and businesses paid for the funeral. The child remains unidentified more than a month and a half after his body was discovered by a mushroom hunter in Washington County. “We’re not here today to answer these questions, even if we could. We’re here to mourn,” Murphy told mourners who filled a room for the service. “This unknown angel has been adopted and beloved by the Washington County community, so Angel is what we will call him for the service today.” The boy was later buried at a cemetery with a gravestone marker bearing the image of an angel and an inscription that reads: “In loving memory of a beloved little boy known but to God.” Investigators believe the child, who was Black, was about 5 years old and had died within the previous week.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Residents could face rolling blackouts this summer if extreme heat and spiking demand coincide with insufficient power. A warning by the North American Electric Reliability Corp., a Georgia-based regulatory authority called NERC, prompted state regulators Tuesday to grill utilities on how they would handle controlled outages. Iowa and 14 other states are at high risk of “energy emergencies during peak summer conditions,” NERC said. In April, Midcontinent Independent System Operator told utilities whose power grid it serves, including most of those in Iowa, that it expects summer demand to increase 1.7% over last summer, while generation capacity has declined by 2.3%. MISO said the decline in generation is due to fossil-fueled power plant retirements as the nation shifts to renewable energy. The grid operator expects summer demand to reach 124 gigawatts, though there will be only 119 gigawatts of available energy. It warned that Iowa’s largest utilities, MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy, as well as dozens of municipal and rural electric cooperatives, may be asked to cut power to customers if demand appears on track to exceed available electricity. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting above-average temperature for Iowa through August.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Presumed Republican gubernatorial nominee Derek Schmidt on Wednesday announced he’s chosen a staffer for one of Kansas’ two U.S. senators as his running mate in his bid to unseat Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Schmidt filed the necessary paperwork to get him and Katie Sawyer on the ballot for the Aug. 2 primary, where he faces no major opposition. The 38-year-old Sawyer is state director for U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall and worked on Marshall’s congressional staff before his election to the Senate in 2020. Schmidt told reporters he expects Sawyer to be a key adviser if he’s elected, helping him stay informed of people’s views on issues. Kansas lieutenant governors have little formal role in state government other than duties assigned to them by governors, such as Lt. Gov. David Toland serving as state commerce secretary. But over the past 20 years, two of the state’s five governors have left office early, elevating their lieutenant governors to the top position. Before working for Marshall, Sawyer worked in marketing and business development at McPherson College in her hometown, as managing editor of the McPherson Sentinel and as a reporter at The Pittsburg Morning Sun. She and her husband operate a farm.\n\nKentucky\n\nOwensboro: A Confederate statue that stood outside a western Kentucky courthouse for more than a century was removed by county workers with little fanfare. The Soldiers Monument at the Daviess County Courthouse was taken down Tuesday morning and moved to the road department, the county’s top official, Judge-Executive Al Mattingly, told the Messenger-Inquirer. He said it will be kept there while officials decide what to do with it. Mattingly said the statue of a soldier with a gun could be placed elsewhere in the county or sold. The base, reading “To Our Confederate Heroes,” remains in place for now. Daviess County officials voted to remove the statue in 2020, but a lawsuit over its ownership delayed any action. Daviess Circuit Judge Lisa Payne Jones ruled last month that the statue belonged to the county, the newspaper reports. The Rev. Rhondalyn Randolph, president of the Owensboro NAACP, led the charge for removal and said she’s thankful the statue that stood on the courthouse lawn since 1900 is gone. Randolph said her aim was never to erase history but “to promote truth for how things actually happened without romanticizing the antebellum period.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has vetoed legislation that supporters said would open up loan opportunities for people who need credit but that opponents said enabled predatory lending. The Advocate reports that the bill by state Sen. Rick Ward, R-Port Allen, would have allowed so-called payday lenders to offer installment loans worth up to $1,500, with fees and interest totaling 100% of the amount loaned. In his Tuesday veto message, the Democratic governor noted the arguments that Ward’s bill would have aided people who need loans and have a difficult time getting them from banks. “However, and despite the best efforts of the bill’s author, I do not believe that this bill adequately protects the public from predatory lending practices,” Edwards wrote in his veto message. Payday lenders typically make short-term, high-interest loans to be paid back from the borrower’s next paycheck. Payday loans are currently capped at $350 in Louisiana.\n\nMaine\n\nOld Orchard Beach: Wildlife advocates predict this summer will bring another record-high number of a rare species of bird to the state’s beaches. The piping plover nests in Maine and is listed as threatened along the East Coast by federal authorities. Recent signs, however, are encouraging. Just 10 pairs of the birds were found in Maine in 1981, the first year of monitoring. Last year’s total swelled to 125. Laura Minich Zitske, coastal bird program director for Maine Audubon, told the Portland Press Herald that this year looks likely to yield another record high. There are a couple thousand piping plover pair nests from North Carolina to eastern Canada. They are small shorebirds that are vulnerable to predation from numerous animals, including larger wild birds and feral cats.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Peter Wolf Toth, a world-traveling, self-taught sculptor, has returned to the resort town to repair his 20-foot tall Whispering Giant sculpture. Toth, who was initially invited to erect the sculpture in 1976 by former Mayor Harry W. Kelley, said he was pleased to have an excuse to return to Ocean City. Born in Vienna, Austria, Toth moved to the United States at age 11 and began to develop a deep interest in Native American art, culture and history. Although he is a self-taught sculptor, he was often inspired by his father, also an artist. Toth’s first statue was made from stone and on a California cliffside. Since then, he has built a total of 74 statues, at least one in each of the 50 states. He has teased that his next project will be along the Amazon River. Through his work, Toth aims to raise a nation’s conscience to the plight of Indigenous peoples across the globe. His art, primarily abstract expressionism, encompasses the North American continent and beyond. The statue standing in Ocean City, titled Nanticoke, is composed of three materials: oak, steel and concrete. “I believe that wood brings out the living quality of a human being,” said Toth, 74. When he’s not sculpting, passersby will find him playing chess. He invited the public to sit down with him for a friendly game or stop and chat about his work.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A memorial to a famed Civil War unit made up of Black soldiers was rededicated Wednesday after a three-year-long restoration with a ceremony filled with song and somber reflection. The Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial – considered the nation’s first honoring Black soldiers – underscores how ending slavery was not just about one man but many, Dr. Ibram X. Kendi said in his remarks. “The Black soldiers of the 54th were as much the great emancipators as Abraham Lincoln,” the author of “How to Be an Antiracist” and founder of Boston University’s Center for Antiracist Research said. “The 54th are a testament to ‘We freed us.’ There wasn’t a single person that abolished slavery. It was something we did together.” Dr. David Blight, a Yale history professor, said the memorial is considered the country’s greatest work of public art not just because of its beauty but also because of the message it tells. He pointed to the memorial’s Latin inscription, which he said is translated: “He gave up everything to serve the Republic.” The towering bronze relief by American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens captures the stirring call to arms answered by Black soldiers who served in the unit, which was popularized in the 1989 Oscar-winning movie “Glory.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Michigan Supreme Court declared Juneteenth a statewide court holiday Wednesday over the objections of two Republican justices who said taxpayers will be shortchanged. Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, two months after the Confederacy had surrendered. It was about 21/ 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in Southern states. Congress and President Joe Biden created a federal holiday a year ago. “Juneteenth is an event of profound importance in the history of our nation, and mandatory observance of this holiday by courts statewide sends a message that Michigan’s judiciary values the life experiences of all who seek justice,” said Tom Boyd, state court administrator. Juneteenth will be the 13th paid holiday when Michigan courts are closed. This year it will be observed on June 20, a Monday. “This is far more than observed by the private sector,” Justice Brian Zahra said. “I believe as servants of the people we owe it to them to work diligently and regularly to provide good public service.” Justice David Viviano said courts slogging through a COVID-19 backlog of cases will face another burden.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBuffalo: A man accused in a shooting attack on a medical clinic that killed one staff member and wounded four others last year refused to look at the survivors Tuesday as they described their pain and terror. Gregory Ulrich is being tried on charges of murder, attempted murder and other counts in the Feb. 9, 2021, shooting at the Allina Health Clinic in Buffalo, a small city about 40 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Ulrich sat attentively at the table with his lawyers through the first two weeks of trial. This time he laid his head on a courtroom table and wrapped his arms around it as victims took the stand. He didn’t look up through two hours of testimony, the Star Tribune reports. Before the jury was brought in, Ulrich told Wright County District Judge Catherine McPherson that he was in great pain and would prefer to lie down outside the courtroom. “Pain is the most powerful drug. I might as well be on heroin. I’m all mixed up, and I need some pain medication so I can talk and think about it,” Ulrich said. But McPherson ordered him to remain in the courtroom. Prosecutors say Ulrich was angry about his medical treatment at the clinic. Court records allege he has mental health and substance abuse problems. After the two victims testified, prosecutors played two short videos made by Ulrich in December 2020, about six weeks before the attack. “They’re gonna find out what happens” when they mess with “a good Christian man,” he said in one of the videos. “You picked on the wrong person.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove is teaming up with a health care executive to apply for a state license to open a medical marijuana testing facility. The Mississippi State Department of Health started taking applications Wednesday for the state’s new medical marijuana program for patients, medical practitioners, growers, processors, testers, and transportation and waste disposal providers. Musgrove and Quentin Whitwell, who are both attorneys, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that they are applying for a license to open Magnolia Tech Labs in Marshall County. “To me, medical marijuana is … a natural progression of options for health care in Mississippi and in America,” Musgrove said. “I mean, to me, it’s obvious that it will eventually be offered in all 50 states.” A wide majority of Mississippi voters approved a medical marijuana ballot initiative in November 2020, but the state Supreme Court invalidated the results of that election six months later by ruling the initiative was not properly on the ballot. Earlier this year, Gov. Tate Reeves signed a law to create a medical marijuana program. Whitwell is involved at high levels with three rural hospitals in north Mississippi. Musgrove is a Democrat who was governor from 2000 to 2004 after serving one term as lieutenant governor. For nine years, he was chairman of the national Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services. Whitwell, who now lives in Oxford, served as a Republican on the Jackson City Council from 2011 to 2014.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans’ Hospital plans to celebrate its 50th anniversary Thursday with a time capsule event. The capsule commemorates the anniversary as well as the work that has been done and is continuing to be done since the opening of the medical center in 1972, the hospital announced. “The event is meant to celebrate 50 years of outstanding care that Truman VA staff have provided to our nation’s heroes,” the hospital said. The celebration is scheduled to kick off at 10 a.m. Thursday. The center is inviting staff, veterans and their families, and other stakeholders, including congressional staff, former employees and veteran service organizations. The center’s vision centers on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ core values, including integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect and excellence – “to provide veterans the world-class benefits and services they have earned, and to do so by adhering to the highest standards,” the department’s website says.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The city is suing the First United Methodist Church to enforce its zoning requirements on campgrounds, a city press release said Tuesday. Unhoused people have taken refuge at the church, stirring fiery debate for months, with some residents wanting the city to do more to provide for the homeless and others framing it as a problem that taxpayers should not be responsible for solving. Pastor Jeff Wakeley said the church had not been served the lawsuit papers and therefore did not have comment on the matter. The church is zoned in the city’s C-4 central business core. That permits emergency shelter with a conditional use permit, which the church has submitted and is being processed by city staff, according to the release. The application will be presented to the Great Falls Zoning Commission within the next few weeks. The C-4 district does not permit campgrounds, which is the basis of the city’s suit in District Court. According to the release, the church was placed on notice regarding the tent and camper encampment violation, and the city said the church did not respond to that notice by removing the tents and camping arrangements as directed. There have been several public nuisance complaints related to the unhoused living on the church’s property.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A federal judge threw out a lawsuit against prosecutors filed by the family of a white bar owner who killed himself after being charged in the fatal shooting of a Black man during 2020 protests over racial injustice. U.S. District Judge John Gerrard said in an order Tuesday that there is no legal basis to conclude Douglas County prosecutors are liable for the death of 38-year-old Jake Gardner. His parents accused the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, its top prosecutor and a special prosecutor of violating Gardner’s constitutional rights. The lawsuit also accused special prosecutor Fred Franklin of implying during a news conference that Gardner was a racist, leading Gardner to take his own life Sept. 20, 2020, in Oregon. Gardner was charged with manslaughter and other felonies in the May 30, 2020, shooting death of 22-year-old James Scurlock outside Gardner’s downtown Omaha bar during protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine initially declined to charge Gardner, saying he acted in self-defense after being attacked by Scurlock. Kleine later asked for a grand jury investigation after critics said he hadn’t thoroughly investigated the shooting. Franklin later said additional evidence from Gardner’s phone and his Facebook Messenger account, along with video from inside his bar, shed new light on his intent. Following Gardner’s death, Franklin revealed Gardner had been armed and waiting to ambush people who might break into businesses.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Chapels of love that use Elvis Presley’s likeness could find themselves becoming Heartbreak Hotels. The licensing company that controls the name and image of “The King” is ordering Sin City chapel operators to stop using Elvis in themed ceremonies, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Authentic Brands Group sent cease-and-desist letters in early May to multiple chapels, which are expected to be compliant by now. With Elvis so closely tied to Vegas’ wedding industry, some say the move could decimate their businesses. “We are a family-run business, and now we’re hanging with the big dogs,” said Kayla Collins, who operates LasVegasElvisWeddingChapel.com and the Little Chapel of Hearts with her husband. “That’s our bread and butter. I don’t get it. We were just hitting our stride again through COVID, then this happens.” Clark County Clerk Lynn Goya, who led a marketing campaign promoting Las Vegas as a wedding destination, said the order for chapels to stop using Elvis couldn’t have come at a worse time for the sector. The city’s wedding industry generates $2 billion a year, and officials say Elvis-themed weddings represent a significant number of the ceremonies performed. “It might destroy a portion of our wedding industry. A number of people might lose their livelihood,” Goya said. One chapel last weekend had its Elvis impersonator change instead into a leather jacket, jeans and a fedora for a “rock ’n’ roll” themed ceremony, the Review-Journal reports.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Supreme Court adopted a congressional redistricting plan Tuesday, one day before the filing period opened for candidates in the upcoming elections. New Hampshire is one of the last states to adopt a plan as required every 10 years to reflect population changes, although maps in several other states still are being challenged in court. In the end, the new map doesn’t differ drastically from the old. It moves just five towns – Albany, Campton, Jackson, New Hampton and Sandwich – from the 1st District to the 2nd. The court took action after Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed two maps approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature that would have given the GOP an advantage in the 1st District. “It is now undisputed that a demonstrated impasse has occurred,” the court said in its unanimous order. Under both the old and new maps, the 1st District covers the eastern part of the state and some of the south, including Manchester. The 2nd District covers the western, northern and some southern communities, including Nashua. Though Democrats hold both seats, the 1st District seat flipped five times in seven election cycles before Democrat Chris Pappas won his first term in 2018.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Hundreds of casino workers picketed outside the Tropicana on Wednesday, as the union for employees at nine casinos is pushing for a new contract giving them a share of gambling halls’ post-COVID recovery. The picketing comes at an uncertain time in Atlantic City: The casinos and their online partners are collectively making more money now than before the pandemic hit. But the casinos say those statistics are misleading because they get to keep only about 30% of online and sports betting money, with the rest going to their third-party partners. They say that in-person revenue won from gamblers is the crucial metric, and not all the casinos have surpassed their pre-pandemic levels. The old contract between the casinos and Local 54 of the Unite Here union expired early Wednesday. Union leaders and workers said they will demonstrate as often as necessary to show the casinos they’re serious about their demand that workers are able to make up ground as the casinos are trying to do so. “We are united, we are ready to fight, and we have very specific asks in a new contract, number one of which is a raise that matters,” said union President Bob McDevitt. “Our hope is the individual casinos will recognize that these are really big numbers that they are racking up and that the workers have not had a cost-of-living raise in a while.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office tapped into a taxpayer-funded expense account to pay for a political event at the governor’s mansion in October, prompting her reelection campaign to quietly reimburse the state two months later. Documents obtained under a public records request show New Mexicans for Michelle, the governor’s campaign committee, issued the state a $1,837 check in December to pay for expenses stemming from a Democratic Governors Association party hosted by Lujan Grisham in Santa Fe. At the time, Lujan Grisham was serving as chairwoman of the association, a Washington, D.C.-based political organization dedicated to electing Democratic governors and other candidates. The reimbursement appeared in the governor’s campaign finance reports as a “campaign event.” “The campaign transparently and expeditiously reimbursed the state for an event hosted by the Governor as chair of the Democratic Governors Association,” campaign spokeswoman Kendall Witmer said in a statement Wednesday. Witmer did not provide any other comment or information about the event, and the Democratic Governors Association did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A woman who was among those injured in a shooting attack on the New York City subway last month filed a lawsuit against gun manufacturer Glock and its parent company Tuesday, accusing the firearm maker of “reckless disregard for human life.” In her lawsuit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, Ilene Steur said Glock has “endangered the public health and safety” with its marketing, distribution and sales of its guns, one of which was used in the attack. An email seeking comment was sent to Glock. Steur was one of 10 people wounded April 12 when a gunman fired dozens of bullets in a train full of morning commuters. The man charged in the attack, Frank James, has pleaded not guilty to terrorism and other counts. In the lawsuit, Glock is accused of “marketing that emphasizes firearm characteristics such as their high capacity and ease of concealment, that appeal to prospective purchasers with criminal intent.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation authorizing marijuana for medical use and developing a system to grow, sell and regulate cannabis was recommended by a state Senate committee Wednesday, nine months after it last surfaced. The measure, which now heads to the Senate floor for the first of two required votes Thursday, would allow patients with at least one of the more than a dozen “debilitating medical conditions” to purchase and use marijuana with their physician’s formal approval. Those conditions would include cancer, epilepsy, Crohn’s disease and post-traumatic stress disorder. The bill envisions several dozen medical cannabis centers across the state operated by 10 state-licensed growers and vendors. They could sell up to 30-day supplies of pot or cannabis-infused products to patients or their caregivers, who would have to obtain registration cards from the state Department of Health and Human Services. Ten percent of the cannabis suppliers’ monthly revenues would be forwarded to the state. The legislation had been idled in the Senate since last August after advancing through three policy committees. Brunswick County Republican Sen. Bill Rabon, chief bill sponsor and a cancer survivor, said the measure was never on a fast track, adding that he wanted to ensure all of his colleagues’ questions were answered to build bipartisan support.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Police have arrested a woman for allegedly trespassing on the state Capitol grounds near the governor’s residence. The Bismarck Tribune reports the 32-year-old was taken into custody Sunday night. According to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, the woman was seen near the residence about 9:45 p.m. but left when police asked her to leave. Capitol security spotted her near the residence again about half an hour later. She had entered the grounds when a gate opened to let a vehicle pass. North Dakota Highway Patrol Sgt. Jenna Clawson Huibregste said the woman said she wanted to speak with the governor and give him paperwork about what what the spokeswoman termed “a personal matter.” She didn’t elaborate. She said the woman was under the influence and combative, and it took multiple officers to subdue her. Gov. Doug Burgum and first lady Kathryn Burgum were home at the time, but the woman didn’t enter the residence.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Legalized sports betting in the state will officially begin Jan. 1, the state Casino Control Commission announced Wednesday. A bill signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine in December set Jan. 1 as a deadline, but some groups pushed for starting earlier to allow for betting on football during the fall. The commission had previously predicted it would take months to formulate rules and regulations. The legislation will allow people to place sports bets online, at casinos and racinos, and at stand-alone betting kiosks in bars, restaurants and professional sports facilities. People will be able to place wagers on professional sports teams, motor sports, Olympic events, golf and tennis, and major college sports such as football and basketball. Ohio joins more than 30 states that have passed legislation since a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down a federal ban on states legalizing sports wagering. Operators will pay a 10% tax on net revenue to help fund K-12 education and problem-gambling programs. The state Legislative Service Commission estimates that sports betting will eventually become a $3.35 billion industry in Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: President Joe Biden on Wednesday recalled “the hell that was unleashed” 101 years ago when a white mob looted and burned a section of the city known as Black Wall Street, killing hundreds of people. “We remember the hell that was unleashed,” said a statement from Biden, who traveled to Tulsa one year ago to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. “This was not a riot; it was a massacre.” The violence was, for decades afterward, referred to as the Tulsa Race Riot and was largely ignored. An estimated 300 Black people were killed May 31 and June 1, 1921, in the attack on then-prosperous Greenwood District. A search for the graves of massacre victims began last year, with nearly three dozen coffins containing remains of possible victims recovered and researchers urging that the search continue. Biden said his administration has worked to end housing discrimination for Black people and to provide federal contracts to businesses owned by Black and brown people. A lawsuit that includes three known survivors of the massacre and seeks reparations for the violence and financial losses of life, homes and businesses is pending in Tulsa County District Court.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Every public school district in the state last year was given the option to ban guns from their properties, but most have declined to do so, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Since a change to Oregon law in September, only 13% of the state’s public school districts have opted to close an exemption that allows holders of a concealed handgun license to carry weapons onto public property where possessing a gun would otherwise be a felony. According to an analysis by OPB, that list includes some districts in the Portland metro area – though not yet Portland Public Schools – along with more rural school systems. Among the 25 that have banned guns are districts in Klamath Falls, Myrtle Point, Tillamook, Pendleton, Tigard-Tualatin, Lake Oswego and Woodburn. The vast majority of the state’s 197 public school districts have, to date, taken no action. Whether to prohibit guns in schools has been a contentious point in Oregon, where one estimate suggests gun ownership is more prevalent than in many other states. After the slaying of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, independent Oregon gubernatorial candidate Betsy Johnson faced heated questions about her pro-gun stance from a crowd in Portland.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A suburban Philadelphia man charged in the January 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol after he was turned in by an ex-girlfriend after reportedly insulting her intelligence for not believing the election had been stolen has pleaded guilty to a felony count. Richard Michetti, 29, of Ridley Park, pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court in Washington to a charge of aiding and abetting obstruction of an official proceeding. He was originally also charged with trespassing, violent entry and disorderly conduct. FBI authorities said a former romantic partner of Michetti alerted authorities about his presence a day after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Officials said photos showed him inside the Capitol Rotunda. The affidavit alleged that Michetti said he was there to protest the election results and told the informant in a text message several hours after the siege began: “If you can’t see the election was stolen you’re a moron.” The Philadelphia Inquirer reports Michetti said little during Tuesday’s hearing. He is to be sentenced Sept. 1, and although the charge carries a maximum 20-year sentence, federal sentencing guidelines call for call for a prison term of 15 to 21 months, the paper reports.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: High school students walked out of school Wednesday and rallied at City Hall to protest inaction in Congress and at many state capitols on gun control. Organizer Zachary Pinto, 17, said his fellow students told him they were frustrated, angry and in pain after last week’s shooting at a Uvalde, Texas, grade school. That spurred him to lead students out of the Charles E. Shea High School in Pawtucket when the bell rang for lunch Wednesday. They were joined by other local high school students. The group of more than 150 students converged at Pawtucket City Hall. Pinto, a junior, said they feel like politicians nationwide “would rather protect guns than children.” He led a chant to call out the names of the 21 victims of the Uvalde school shooting. Democrats in Congress have been trying to expand background checks and otherwise boost gun control laws since a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Pinto, who supports the proposed bans, said schools like Shea High School need more counselors to help address a wide range of mental health issues, rather than a greater police presence. The students also want local officials to address a “severe lack of resources” and the need for repairs at Shea, Pinto added. “I want them to just care,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Regular early voting began across the state for the first time Tuesday. Legislators passed and the governor signed into law a bill allowing anyone to cast a ballot without an excuse for the two weeks before Election Day in the same way they would by going to the polls. South Carolina’s primaries are June 14, and early voting is available Mondays through Fridays. The procedure to vote is just the same as on election day. For the general election in November, early voting centers will also be open on Saturdays. Counties are required to have at least one polling place open. Some smaller counties like Bamberg, Chester, Hampton and Williamsburg counties will have multiple locations, while some larger counties like Aiken, Charleston, Greenville, Lexington and York only have one site at the county election office. A list of sites is on the South Carolina Election Commission’s website. County officials said early voting does give them flexibility to get more workers or voting machines to a site if it gets busy, which is something impossible to do on election day. Absentee voting is still allowed for people over the age of 65, with mobility issues or illnesses, but those ballots must be cast by mail.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A judge has delayed the release of affidavits in the child pornography investigation of banker and philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, days after the South Dakota attorney general’s office declined to file charges. Minnehaha County Judge James Power said in an email Tuesday that the affidavits would remain sealed until parties in the case seeking to unseal them have a chance to submit written briefs. Affidavits are submitted by law enforcement officers when they ask judges to issue search warrants. Sanford attorney Stacy Hegge asked Power in an email Monday to keep the affidavits sealed or at least be given additional time in order to seek relief from the South Dakota Supreme Court. The delay comes after the attorney general’s office said in a Friday filing that the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation has determined there are “no prosecutable offenses” under state law. South Dakota investigators in 2019 began searching Sanford’s email account, as well as his cellular and internet service providers, for possible possession of child pornography after his accounts were flagged by a technology firm.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will celebrate National Trails Day by offering free guided hikes at all 56 state parks starting this weekend. According to a news release, the events come as Tennessee’s state parks agency will celebrate its 85th anniversary. “We’re looking forward to the hikes at each of our parks especially this year because of the anniversaries of our parks and National Trails Day,” Jim Bryson, deputy commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, said in a statement. “Each hike has its own identity, and we invite everyone to participate.” Radnor Lake State Park, located within Nashville, will hold a kickoff night hike Friday. Following events will include day hikes, history hikes, nature hikes and trail cleanup hikes. Some will host post-hike celebrations. A full schedule can be found online.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A week after the state’s deadliest school shooting, several dozen teacher union officials, parents and other education advocates marched Tuesday to the downtown Austin office of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, demanding he support “sensible gun regulation.” Attendees walked from the Texas AFL-CIO building to the J.J. Pickle Federal Building, where Cruz’s Central Texas office is located, screaming chants such as “Hey hey, ho ho, these dangerous guns have got to go.” People also held signs that read “Books not guns” and “Protect our students.” The Texas chapter of the American Federation of Teachers called Cruz’s response to the shooting “abominable,” saying in a statement that the junior Texas senator has been “beating a drum promoting the status quo.” Ken Zarifis, president of Education Austin, the Austin school district’s employee union, said arming teachers is not the answer. Instead, he and other attendees expressed support for universal background checks, a total ban on assault rifles and red flag laws, which would temporarily remove guns from people who pose a risk to themselves or others. “There are things that can be done ... that have been proven nationally,” said Zarifis, who attended the march. “Red (flag) laws that have been enacted by far-right Republican legislators. They should be enacted here in Texas.”\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Two local groups, St. George Races and the St. George Firefighters Association, are joining forces to offer a new way to beat the summer heat, holding the Moonlight 5K on June 10 at 9 p.m. in the Desert Color community. Throughout the course, firefighters will spray runners with water. After the race, registered participants can take part in a glow-in-the-dark pool party from 10 p.m. to midnight. Typically, the newly built lagoon is restricted to residents of Desert Color. “When we started this race seven years ago, we had no idea it would continue to grow into one of the most enjoyable races and family activities of the summer,” said Jake Green, a St. George firefighter. “The firefighters love it, our families love it, and the community loves it. With it taking place during the annual Utah State Firefighters’ Association Convention, we are looking forward to even more participants.” Participants may register online. A portion of the proceeds from the event will benefit the Utah Burn Center and the St. George Firefighters Association. “After the race, stick around and enjoy an awesome pool party,” Green said. “We can’t wait to see everyone come out and have a blast, get sprayed by the fire hoses, and be involved in our great City of St. George.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: An app created by a Vermonter will soon serve as a platform for queer friendship in communities nationwide. Anna Harissis, co-founder of the Out App, grew up in Stowe, went to college in Boston and moved around several times, including a stint in Burlington, before landing in Denver. She and other co-founder Jen Farmer, both lesbians, wanted to find queer friends to hang out with in their new home but ran into some barriers. “When we first moved here, it was kind of hard to find queer community,” Harissis said. “We really only have dating apps to find each other.” The dating apps – even versions made for finding platonic friends, like Bumble BFF – were not tailored for finding LGBTQ friends. Harissis saw a need for something more specialized, so she got to work. Out App will launch sometime this month, which is Pride Month, and have three different features to help queer people connect. A “Friend Finder” will let people make profiles and swipe to match with potentially compatible friends. Another section will publicize queer-friendly events in the area, and the third will map businesses and places in the community that are queer-friendly. Harissis described the locations section as a “queer Yelp” that can help families and individuals seeking queer-friendly doctors, restrooms, restaurants, hotels and stores.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The divided General Assembly passed a compromise state budget Wednesday that would offer nearly $4 billion in tax relief, increase pay for teachers and other public employees, boost K-12 education spending, and fund a wide range of projects from roadwork to school construction. Budget negotiators crafted the measure at a time when Virginia’s tax revenues have been soaring far beyond projections. That allowed for making long-term investments in core government services while also boosting the state’s reserves and enacting tax cuts that are expected to save a family of four an estimated $1,108 a year, Republican House Appropriations Chairman Barry Knight said. “It’s been a long haul, but I believe the result is a fiscally sound, bipartisan budget we can all be proud of,” he said. The proposed spending plan, which covers two fiscal years and would take effect July 1, passed with broad bipartisan support and relatively subdued debate. Lawmakers also passed a bill making adjustments to the current budget. The legislation now goes to GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who can sign it or seek changes. He said in a statement earlier this week that the compromise offered a “good framework” and that he would be reviewing it closely in the days to come.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The Washington State Patrol says drivers are increasingly refusing to stop for troopers, and other law enforcement agencies also say it’s becoming a common occurrence. The Northwest News Network reports that from Jan. 1 to May 17 of this year, the agency logged 934 failure-to-yield incidents. While the patrol didn’t track this in the past, veteran troopers say there’s been a dramatic uptick in drivers fleeing traffic stops. “Something’s changed. People are not stopping right now,” said Sgt. Darren Wright, a WSP spokesperson with 31 years on the job. “It’s happening three to five times a shift on some nights and then a couple times a week on day shift.” Local police departments are also seeing this behavior. The Puyallup Police Department logged 148 instances of drivers fleeing from officers from July 26, 2021, to May 18, 2022. Asked if that represents a significant increase, Chief Scott Engle wrote in an email: “I could 1,000,000% say this is completely absolutely emphatically totally unusual.” In Lakewood, another small city in Pierce County, Chief Mike Zaro said drivers are refusing to stop for his officers on average once a day. “A lot of times they’re stolen cars; sometimes we don’t know what the deal is,” Zaro said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A dashboard with some foster care data collected by the state made its debut Wednesday, more than two months after it was cut by lawmakers from a bill proposal. Advocates have said making the data available to the public could help both policymakers and nonprofit groups interested in assisting children while keeping residents informed. It includes information on Child Protective Service placements by county; types of placements, including homes and placement facilities; workforce information broken down by both district office and county; and out-of-state placements. According to the Department of Health and Human Resources dashboard, which will be updated monthly, there are 6,654 children in the care of the state. One-third of the in-state placements are children living with relatives acting as certified foster parents. Marissa Sanders, who is an adoptive parent and founder of the West Virginia Foster, Adoptive and Kinship Parents Network, has called the need for the dashboard critical. “As a nonprofit, if I want to do a project in a particular county or region, I have to have data to prove that I need to do that project in order to get funding for it,” Sanders said. “I have pastors calling, saying, ‘We’d love to support all of the foster families in our county.’ ”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A circuit court judge ruled Wednesday that it was legal for private grants from a group funded by Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg to be sent to the Democratic stronghold of Madison to help it run the 2020 election during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ruling from Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke affirmed an earlier decision by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission rejecting a complaint challenging the grant money from the Chicago-based Center for Tech and Civic Life as illegal bribery. It is the latest in a series of court rulings, both in Wisconsin and nationally, upholding the legality of the private grant money. The lawsuit challenging that ruling as it pertained to Madison was brought on behalf of five voters by Erick Kaardal, a former secretary and treasurer for the Republican Party of Minnesota, who is an attorney for the conservative Thomas More Society. Kaardal also filed four nearly identical lawsuits challenging the grant money being awarded in four other heavily Democratic cities: Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay. Those cases are all pending. The one targeting the grant money in Madison is the first to have a ruling. President Joe Biden won battleground Wisconsin over Donald Trump by almost 21,000 votes. The victory has been upheld by numerous courts.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A bison gored a 25-year-old woman in Yellowstone National Park and tossed her 10 feet into the air. The bison was walking near a boardwalk at Black Sand Basin, just north of Old Faithful, when the woman approached it Monday, according to a park statement. She got within 10 feet before the animal gored her and threw her high in the air. The woman from Grove City, Ohio, sustained a puncture wound and other injuries. Park emergency medical providers responded and transported her via ambulance to a hospital in Idaho. Park officials say it’s the first reported bison goring this year. The park statement said bison are unpredictable, have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal, and can run three times faster than humans. Park regulations require visitors to remain more than 25 yards away from bison. The park statement said two other people were also within 25 yards of the same bison. The incident was under investigation. No additional information was immediately available.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}]}

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nShocking atrocities in Ukraine, allegedly at the hands of Russian forces, have amplified calls to pursue war crimes charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nImages of at least 20 bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, Ukraine, emerged in early April following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for an end to Russian “war crimes.” And at least 50 deaths from a Russian missile strike on a railway station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk – where civilians were waiting for evacuation trains to safer regions of the country – led Zelensky to say, “We expect a firm, global response to this war crime.”\n\nAlready, there was a loud and growing chorus of calls for the International Criminal Court to pursue Putin for the unprovoked invasion, and the US government in March formally declared that members of the Russian armed forces have committed war crimes.\n\nThe top war crimes prosecutor for the ICC has traveled to Ukraine to investigate, and the US Embassy in Kyiv argued in the war’s opening days that specific Russian attacks constituted war crimes.\n\n“It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant,” the embassy said on its official Twitter feed on March 4. “Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further.”\n\nRussia’s bombing of hospitals and a theater where children were seeking refuge along with its suspected use of cluster bombs and so-called vacuum bombs in dense areas with many civilians have also been described as war crimes.\n\n“The law is clear on this, it is a crime to intentionally target civilians, it is a crime to intentionally target civilian objects,” Karim Khan, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.\n\nBut Khan added there is a burden of proof and a process that must play out.\n\nHere’s a very broad look at war crimes and the international justice movement.\n\nNote: Some of what’s below comes from CNN’s research library, which compiled information about the International Criminal Court.\n\nWhat is a war crime?\n\nThe International Criminal Court has specific definitions for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. Read about them in this guide published by the ICC.\n\nSpecifically, targeting civilian populations, violating the Geneva Conventions, targeting specific groups of people and more could be potential Russian war crimes.\n\nKhan said there can be justified attacks in civilian areas if they are being used to launch attacks. But even then, he said, attacks in civilian areas cannot be disproportionate.\n\nThere is a method of gathering evidence from testimony, satellite images and elsewhere to meet a burden of proof.\n\nWhat is the International Criminal Court?\n\nLocated in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the International Criminal Court operates independently.\n\nMost countries on Earth – 123 of them – are parties to the treaty, but there are very large and notable exceptions, including Russia and the US. And, for that matter, Ukraine.\n\nWho can be tried by the court?\n\nAnyone accused of a crime in the jurisdiction of the court, which includes countries that are members of the ICC, can be tried. The court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction.\n\nPutin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea.\n\nHowever, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. That seems unlikely.\n\nWhat crimes does the court handle?\n\nThe ICC is meant to be a court of “last resort” and is not meant to replace a country’s justice system. The court, which has 18 judges serving nine-year terms, tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes.\n\nHow does the ICC bring proceedings?\n\nCourt proceedings can be brought in one of two ways: Either a national government or the UN Security Council can refer cases for investigation.\n\nRussia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has veto power over council actions. It was requests by 39 national governments, most of them European, that sparked this current investigation.\n\nKhan previously told CNN, “I want to emphasize that I’m willing to speak to all sides, and not just the Ukrainian side, but also the Russian Federation, state parties and non-state parties alike. This institution is not political. We’re not part of the geostrategic or geopolitical divisions that we witness around the world.”\n\nWhat will the ICC investigate in relation to Ukraine?\n\nIn its new investigation into Russia’s possible war crimes, the ICC has said it will look at all actions in Ukraine from 2013 to the present.\n\nRussia first entered Crimea, which has been part of Ukraine, in 2014. The ICC was already investigating crackdowns on protesters by a previous Ukrainian government that was pro-Russian. This new referral seems to put all potential war crimes together.\n\nHow long do these investigations take?\n\nIf justice in general moves slowly, international justice barely moves at all. Investigations at the ICC take many years. Only a handful of convictions have ever been won.\n\nA preliminary investigation into the hostilities in eastern Ukraine lasted more than six years – from April 2014 until December 2020. At the time, the prosecutor said there was evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Next steps were slowed by the Covid-19 pandemic and a lack of resources at the court, which is conducting multiple investigations.\n\nThat perception of slow and ineffective justice will test the system of international law, Khan told Cooper.\n\n“This is a test for the court. It’s a test for me, it’s a test for the office,” he said.\n\nWhat are cluster bombs and vacuum bombs?\n\nIn addition to attacks on hospitals and civilian apartment buildings, the feared use of banned weapons meant to kill without discrimination is another very specific war crime.\n\nWith a cluster bomb, a missile is fired and explodes thousands of feet in the air, releasing smaller bombs that each detonate when they fall to the ground. See an illustration from The Washington Post. Amnesty International said a Russian cluster bomb fell on a Ukrainian preschool.\n\n“Vacuum bombs,” or thermobaric weapons, suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects. Russia previously used them in Chechnya.\n\n‘This is genocide’\n\nNow, Russia is facing more accusations of war crimes after its forces began retreating from areas near Kyiv, including Bucha, following a failed bid to encircle the capital.\n\nAsked during an appearance on CBS in early April if Russia was carrying out genocide in his country based on the images out of Bucha, Zelensky said: “Indeed. This is genocide.”\n\nThe alleged atrocities in Bucha have drawn outrage from leaders outside of Ukraine, with Western leaders, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia.\n\n“Since the aggression, we’ve come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we’ve been working to document that, to provide the information we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. And there needs to be accountability for it,” he told CNN.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the deaths.\n\nWhy would a Ukraine prosecution be different?\n\nThe international outcry against Russia is unique, and that could give the court the ability to operate differently, according to Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University and co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, an online forum.\n\n“It’s hard to judge the ICC’s investigation based on past practice,” Goodman said in an email after the court initially launched its investigation. “In the Ukraine situation, the prosecutor is buttressed by an extraordinary outpouring of support from dozens of countries, which I expect will be followed by an infusion of resources.”\n\nHow would an ICC case affect the conflict?\n\n“For better or for worse, the ICC investigation may affect the diplomatic space for negotiations,” said Goodman, arguing Putin and other Russians might not want to risk arrest if they travel outside the country.\n\nThe investigation could also, he argued, weaken Putin at home.\n\n“Russians may come to realize this is another reason Putin can no longer serve their country,” Goodman said.\n\nWhat happened before the ICC?\n\nPrevious trials for war crimes were brought by special UN tribunals, such as those empaneled for the former Yugoslavia, focusing on the Serbian autocrat Slobodan Milosevic, and for the Rwandan genocide.\n\nAll of this stems from the precedent of the Nuremberg trials to bring Nazis to justice after World War II and held by the Allies, including the US, the Soviet Union, France and Germany.\n\nSo it is interesting that neither the US nor Russia are members of the ICC.\n\nWhy aren’t the US and Russia ICC members?\n\nBoth the US and Russia are signatories to the treaty that created the court – meaning their leaders signed it – but neither is a member of the court.\n\nRussia pulled out of the court in 2016 days after an ICC report published what CNN called a “damning verdict” on Russia’s occupation of Crimea in 2014. The court also launched a probe in 2016 into Russia’s 2008 efforts to support breakaway regions in Georgia.\n\nAt the time, France had also accused Russia of committing war crimes in Syria.\n\nAs for the US, while President Bill Clinton signed the treaty creating the court in 2000, he never recommended the Senate ratify it.\n\nThe George W. Bush administration, to a fair amount of criticism, pulled the US from being a party to the treaty in 2002. The Pentagon and many US policymakers have long opposed joining such an international court system since it could open US servicemembers to allegations of war crimes.\n\n“The president (George W. Bush) thinks the ICC is fundamentally flawed because it puts American servicemen and women at fundamental risk of being tried by an entity that is beyond America’s reach, beyond America’s laws and can subject American civilians and military to arbitrary standards of justice,” then-White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said at the time.\n\nHow has the US supported the court?\n\nOpposing America joining the court did not mean the Bush administration opposed the court itself. It supported ICC efforts to seek justice for genocide in Sudan.\n\nThere has always been an awkwardness to how American presidents deal with the court, noted CNN’s Tim Lister in 2011. He wrote about Barack Obama applauding ICC efforts to bring justice to people like former Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, while not endorsing the court for oversight of the US.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

He will also impose punishing actions on those individuals' family members.\n\nThe ICC, which is seated in The Hague in the Netherlands, issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in November over alleged war crimes in Gaza. It issued a warrant for a senior leader of Hamas at the same time.\n\nThe ICC has \"no jurisdiction\" over the United States or Israel, the executive order says.\n\nThe organization's actions against the two countries set a \"dangerous precedent directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest,\" it says.\n\nLike Israel, the U.S. is not a party to the international treaty that established the ICC. The pact provides the ICC and its chief prosecutor with powers that the U.S. says are a threat to its sovereignty.\n\nRepublicans in the U.S. Senate sought to pass legislation sanctioning the ICC last month but could not overcome Democratic opposition to the bill, which passed the House with bipartisan support.\n\nTrump, in his first term, hit ICC officials with an asset freeze and travel restrictions over their investigation into alleged war crimes committed by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. He argued at the time that the international court had no jurisdiction or authority over the U.S.\n\nThe arrest warrants last year for Israeli leaders were also met with fierce opposition from the U.S., with former President Joe Biden calling them \"outrageous\" and saying there was \"no equivalence\" between the nation and Hamas. The Trump administration also accused the ICC of drawing a \"shameful moral equivalency\" between Israel's actions and those of Hamas.\n\nIn sanctioning the ICC on Thursday, the White House accused the court of working to prevent Israel and other nations from exercising their right to self-defense. The White House also accused the ICC of \"biased attacks\" and a \"disproportionate focus on Israel\" in its investigation of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe conflict began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and took roughly 250 hostages into Gaza. More than 46,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, according to the Hamas-run Gazan health ministry.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have since reached a ceasefire agreement that involves the release of hostages taken by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.\n\nNetanyahu is currently in the U.S. meeting with lawmakers. He held talks with Trump at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing in January, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the court's arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes was a test of power the ICC could try to wield against other nonmember nations such as the United States.\n\n“I think the United States should be very concerned because I believe this is a test run for applying it to American service members and American leaders in the future,\" Rubio said.\n\nContributing: Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/26/us-russia-putin-war-crimes-ukraine-prosecution/11364190002/", "title": "Congress sets its sights on Putin, suspected war crimes in Ukraine", "text": "WASHINGTON – Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are launching a full court press to hold Russia accountable for war crimes it is accused of committing in Ukraine.\n\nA pair of House and Senate committees will hold hearings in mid-April to bring attention to atrocities such as the civilian massacres in Bucha and Mariupol that U.S. officials are helping the Ukrainian government investigate and prosecute.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, plans to have the Ukrainian prosecutor general and victims of war crimes appear before the panel on April 19.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco will testify at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the same day about the work the Department of Justice's war crimes and asset forfeiture teams are doing.\n\nThe asset-seizing task force, which Monaco oversees, has been prosecuting Russian oligarchs who violate U.S. sanctions or commit related financial crimes and liquidating their assets.\n\n\"The purpose of the hearing is to make a commitment in public that we're going to be all-in on the legal lane. That we're going to continue to work together to hold [Vladimir] Putin and his cronies accountable,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview. \"And, I think, equally important, is to put a face on the victims of this war.\"\n\nGraham co-sponsored a bipartisan measure that passed in December alongside sweeping changes to U.S. war crimes statutes that allowed the executive branch to use forfeited assets to provide financial assistance to Ukraine, with congressional reporting and oversight.\n\nAt the hearing — which committee aides previewed to USA TODAY and the Department of Justice confirmed Monaco will give testimony at — Graham said he hopes to receive a progress report on DOJ's efforts.\n\nThe Republican senator said he also wants Monaco to deliver the message that \"we're not quitting\" and U.S. \"resolve is greater today than it was last year.\"\n\nHe and Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., are also pressing U.S. officials to support the creation of a special international tribunal where individual Russian leaders could be held criminally responsible for the “crime of aggression,” or waging an unprovoked war against a sovereign country.\n\nThe proposed special tribunal is one of several legal avenues that the international community is pursuing, and the Ukrainian government is pushing for, as nations grapple with how to prosecute senior Russian leaders for crimes they are accused of committing in connection to the war.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied allegations that Russians are committing war crimes in Ukraine, where it maintains it is conducting a \"special operation.\"\n\nWidespread evidence of systemic war crimes, which are considered to be among the most serious violations of international law, have been well documented in Ukraine. They include the bombing of civilian infrastructure, forced deportation of minors, raping of women and children, mass graves and torture chambers.\n\n“Any person in the U.S. can relate to the situation. A brutal, aggressive killer just got into your house and is killing your children, and is raping people for no reason, just because they thought they can do that,” Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told USA TODAY.\n\n“It's in the national security interest of the United States, as the country that believes in freedom, believes in sovereignty, believes in territorial integrity, believes in the world order that was put together after the World War II to ensure that if these principles are violated by some brutal aggressor, that as the global community, we can do something.\"\n\nSuspected war crimes: Ukrainian children taken to Russia brings back fear, memories of a similar Nazi effort\n\nAs of March 23, law enforcement agencies in Ukraine had launched investigations into 75,801 alleged crimes of aggression and war crimes. That includes the killing of 465 children, with another 940 wounded. Another count from the Ukrainian government puts total civilians killed at 9,883 with another 13,254 wounded, as of last Wednesday.\n\nU.S. and Ukrainian officials said the numbers do not include possible atrocities in occupied territories that their law enforcement officials do not have access to.\n\n“That's just scratching the surface,” McCaul, the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, said. “This is probably the most documented war, but we still don't have a lot out of Mariupol, just because we haven't had access to it.”\n\nICC puts Putin on notice: International Criminal Court members issue arrest warrant for Putin over war crimes\n\nSenators set their sights on war crimes tribunal\n\nThe International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin this month for his alleged involvement in war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nBut under the prevailing international treaty that created the ICC in 2002, known as the Rome Statute, experts say the court lacks the authority to prosecute Russia for the crime of aggression, because Moscow is not a signatory to the treaty.\n\nAs a result, no venue — domestic or international — currently exists that can put Kremlin leaders on trial for the crime of aggression, experts say.\n\nThe United States also is not a signatory to the ICC treaty due to concerns that it could be used to target American troops overseas.\n\nGraham said the ICC arrest warrant is still \"a game changer\" and said he would be speaking to Interpol about issuing a \"red notice\" for Putin if he travels to a place where police can take him into custody.\n\nHe and Durbin were part of a bipartisan group of senators who sent President Joe Biden a letter last Friday urging the administration to assist the ICC with its investigations, including through financial support and information sharing.\n\nNational Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement that \"the Ukrainian people deserve justice\" for war crimes and crimes against humanity that are being committed in the nation. She said the U.S. \"supports a range of investigations to identify and hold accountable those who are responsible,\" including through Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin's office, the United Nations and the ICC.\n\n\"We are also working to expose Russia’s atrocities in Ukraine so the world can see what Russian forces are doing,\" she said.\n\nThe European Parliament passed a resolution earlier this year calling on member states to work with the United Nations and Ukraine to form a special tribunal that would complement the ICC’s work. The Netherlands has offered to house the tribunal.\n\nIn the interim, the European Commission has announced the establishment of an International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression in Ukraine that will operate out of The Hague, where the ICC is also based.\n\nU.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack said in a statement that the United States supports the development of a special tribunal on the crime of aggression \"in the form of an internationalized court that is rooted in Ukraine’s judicial system, with international elements.\"\n\nShe said that over the past two years, \"the United States has worked hard to improve and reset our relationship with the ICC,\" including through the lifting of sanctions, and is \"identifying specific areas where we can support ICC investigations and prosecutions.\"\n\n\"We also offer rewards for information leading to the arrest, transfer, or conviction of foreign nationals accused of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide before the ICC,\" she said. \"We do not discuss what specific support we provide to the ICC generally, as those issues may implicate the investigations and the safety of victims and witnesses.\"\n\nGarland visits Ukraine: Merrick Garland makes unannounced trip to Ukraine, reaffirms US vow to pursue war criminals\n\nBiden administration ramps up war crimes investigations\n\nMembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Durbin chairs, have been actively exploring ways the U.S. can further assist Ukraine with its efforts to prosecute alleged war crimes and rebuild its damaged civilian infrastructure.\n\n“Sadly, I think there’s going to be ample evidence of this type of outrageous conduct,” Durbin said.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland is among the U.S. officials who have made trips to Ukraine this year to help bring attention to suspected war crimes.\n\nGarland told the Senate Judiciary Committee before his trip that U.S. “forensic agents are on the ground now” assisting Ukrainian investigators and that he had met multiple times with Ukraine’s prosecutor general to discuss needed support.\n\nMarkarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., said Kyiv appreciates the Biden administration's help and backs the efforts by the ICC and European Union to investigate and prosecute war crimes.\n\nShe said that Ukraine also wants to see an international tribunal formed under the United Nations infrastructure that can prosecute Putin and the government officials close to him who ordered the invasion.\n\n“The only really missing part right now is the crime of aggression,” Markarova said. “It's very important also to prosecute the crime of aggression, which is a mother of all the crimes, and also prosecute the top leadership.”\n\nIt will be difficult to hold Putin personally accountable, because he will not travel to countries where he could be arrested, lawmakers who have studied the issue said.\n\n“This is going to be a very long affair. The number of war crimes that have been committed in Ukraine is just staggering,” Sen. Jim Risch, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said. “And obviously, it's going to be very difficult to chase every one of those, but they're going to do their best, I’m sure, to chase the most important ones, and the higher ranking a person they can find the better off the prosecution is.”\n\nNot all GOP lawmakers in agreement\n\nMcCaul said he intends to use the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing to put Putin on trial on the world stage and make clear to the American people what the Russian leader is capable of. “I find that that's persuasive. It moves the dial,” McCaul, a former federal prosecutor, said.\n\n“They may be very unpleasant photos of a murder” and other atrocities allegedly committed by Russian troops, McCaul said. “But I think it's necessary to show the American people what is happening.”\n\nSome of his Republican’s colleagues have already said the hearing will not persuade them to provide additional financial support to Ukraine when the current tranche runs out.\n\n“I don't believe that the aid that we're giving Ukraine is making the war crimes less likely. So to showcase the war crimes as a strategy to facilitate more aid presupposes that the aid will stop the war crimes and I believe that not to be true,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fl., said in an interview.\n\nGaetz, a member of the Judiciary and Armed Services committees, recently introduced a “Ukraine Fatigue” resolution that would halt further military and humanitarian aid.\n\nHe told USA TODAY that it’s “frivolous” at this stage in the war, in his view, to be talking about “Vladimir Putin’s lifetime travel plans” and ways to hold him accountable if he sets foot on U.S. or allied soil.\n\nWhile he said he would consider supporting U.S. participation in a special tribunal at the appropriate time, Gaetz added, “I think that discussion is a little premature right now while towns are still getting shelled with rockets.”\n\nContributing: Kevin Johnson\n\nFrancesca Chambers is a White House Correspondent for USA TODAY.

For the latest news on the investigation into the suspect, follow our live updates on the probe for Monday, Sept. 16.\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. ― Investigators on Sunday were probing what appears to be an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, the second one in two months. The Republican presidential candidate was safe following gunshots near his golf course in Florida, his campaign and U.S. Secret Service announced.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said Sunday that it is investigating \"what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.\" The incident took place at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach where the former president was golfing shortly before 2 p.m., according to officials.\n\nAuthorities said a man stuck the barrel of a rifle through the fence at the edge of the golf course while the former president was golfing. Secret Service agents on the course spotted the weapon and opened fire on the man, who fled.\n\nAuthorities later said they identified the vehicle, a black Nissan, thanks to a bystander's photograph, and soon traced it to neighboring Martin County to the north. David Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, confirmed to USA TODAY that the suspect in custody is Ryan Routh, 58.\n\nThe incident occurred on the same day that the Republican nominee posted \"I hate Taylor Swift\" on his Truth Social platform and his running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, admitted that he had \"no regrets\" for propagating fake stories about Haitian migrants that led to multiple threats in the town of Springfield, Ohio.\n\nFollowing Sunday's assassination attempt, President Joe Biden vowed to make sure the Secret Service has \"every resource\" for Trump's safety, adding that \"there is no place for political violence.\"\n\n\"I am relieved that the former President is unharmed,\" Biden said. \"There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened. As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country.\"\n\nExperts say Secret Service handled situation properly\n\nThe Secret Service had an elevated presence around former President Donald Trump when he was golfing on Sunday and thwarted an alleged assassination attempt after an agent in front of him spotted a rifle through the shrubbery.\n\nExperts say agents in West Palm Beach appeared to have handled the situation properly two months after the Secret Service was heavily criticized about an earlier assassination attempt in which a gunman with an AR-style rifle shot at the GOP nominee from about 150 yards away.\n\nBut the recent incident at one of Trump's golf clubs in Florida underscores the challenges in protecting a presidential candidate who likes to keep a high public profile – including hitting the links and holding outdoor rallies, those experts told USA TODAY.\n\n“Generally, even for a sitting president, they will operate in the way that they did here,” said A.T. Smith, the deputy director of the Secret Service from 2012 to 2015. That means having agents do the best they can to accommodate other golfers, Smith said, while discreetly scouring the terrain for potential threats as Trump and his party continued playing.

Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter.\n\nWho is suspect Ryan Routh?\n\nDavid Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, confirmed to USA TODAY that the suspect in custody is Ryan Routh, 58. He said his prosecutors were preparing an arrest warrant and pretrial detention for Routh when federal prosecutors told him they were taking over the case, so he backed off.\n\nAronberg also said an AK-47 rifle believed to belong to Routh was recovered at the scene. Aronberg said Routh appeared to be at least partly motivated by his strong support for Ukraine and its war against Russia. “He’s someone who obviously has some issues,” he said. \"Normal people don’t commit crimes like this.\"\n\nPublic records indicate a man of that age named Ryan Routh lived in Hawaii, but voting records showed the same man as a longtime voter in North Carolina. State voting records show him casting ballots in general and municipal elections going back many cycles, including 2008 and 2012 − though not in 2016, when Trump first ran.\n\nThe same records show Routh voted most recently in the March primary election this year in Guilford County, North Carolina. A registered Democrat, he voted in person.

As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,\" Harris said. \"I am thankful that former President Trump is safe. I commend the U.S. Secret Service and law enforcement partners for their vigilance.\"\n\nHarris' statement came on the heels of a similar statement President Joe Biden made earlier in the day.\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nGun experts scrutinize gunman’s Soviet-style rifle\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw showed photos from the scene of what he said was an assassination attempt depicting a rifle, backpack, and GoPro camera.\n\nHe described the firearm as an AK-style rifle — a ubiquitous semi-automatic rifle designed with a curved detachable 30-round magazine. Firearms experts were quick Sunday to point out some of the features in the grainy photo suggest the rifle is a Soviet cousin to the AK, the SKS. It was designed in the 1940s by another famous Russian designer, Sergey Simonov.\n\nThe SKS was a slightly older rifle than the AKs with replicas sold worldwide in the civilian market. Traditionally, the SKS came with a 10-round \"fixed magazine\" a distinguishing feature from the detachable, curved 30-round magazines on AKs.\n\nThe wooded scene photos showed a black \"sporterized\" modern SKS, with a detachable magazine. It had a scope added for longer-range shooting and appeared to have a \"Monte Carlo\" stock to fit better to a shooter’s cheek.\n\nFirearms experts at The Military Wire called the weapon a 7.62x39mm SKS rifle with black synthetic stock. That’s the same ammunition as most AKs.\n\nNotably, an SKS was used in the 2017 Congressional baseball game shooting that wounded U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a police officer, aide, and lobbyist.\n\nSome firearms experts called the weapon an \"eclectic\" and odd choice. Other gun lobby groups pointed out Sunday the weapon would not be covered by a so-called assault weapons ban since it had no foregrip, pistol grip, or detachable stock which have been targeted by the proposal as distinguishing features.\n\n-- Nick Penzenstadler\n\nTrump campaign sends email about assassination attempt with fundraising link\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign sent an email Sunday evening touching on the assassination attempt against the former president earlier in the day. The message includes a link that takes supporters to a site where they can donate to the Trump campaign.\n\n“My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life!” Trump says in the email. “I will never slow down. I will never give up. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER!”\n\nThe email includes two large red “MAGA” buttons. Clicking on them takes supporters to the site where they can donate. The site includes another message from Trump.\n\nThe message included suggested donation amounts up to $3,300.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nDeSantis opening investigation into Trump assassination attempt\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis wrote on social media Sunday that his state will be “conducting its own investigation” into what authorities are describing as an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\n“The people deserve the truth about the would-be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards of the former president and current GOP nominee,” DeSantis wrote.\n\n-- Zac Anderson\n\nBomb squad examined vehicle driven by suspect in attempted Trump assassination\n\nMartin County, Florida deputies intercepted the suspect at State Road 714 on I-95. The vehicle was described as a black, mid-size SUV.\n\nMartin County deputies held the man until the FBI and Secret Service arrived and took him away. While he was detained, the St. Lucie bomb squad examined the suspect’s vehicle. Three counties in the region all use the St. Lucie bomb squad.\n\n\"He picked the wrong county to drive through if he was planning on getting away,\" Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told reporters.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire\n\nBiden on new Trump assassination attempt: 'No place for political violence'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Sunday evening “there is no place for political violence” in the U.S. following the second assassination attempt targeting former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, in a written statement, said he has been briefed by his team regarding what federal law enforcement officials are investigating as a possible assassination attempt against Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nBiden commended the work of the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners “for their vigilance and their efforts to keep the former President and those around him safe.”\n\n“I am relieved that the former President is unharmed. There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened,” Biden said. “As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country.”\n\nBiden said he has directed the federal government to continue to ensure the Secret Service has “every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety.”\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nSpeaker speaks with Trump at Mar-a-Lago\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) posted on X, that he and his wife met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate this afternoon.\n\n“We just spent a few hours with President Trump and are thanking God for protecting him today — once again. No leader in American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient. He is unstoppable,” Johnson said. He attached a photo of them with Trump.\n\nOther Hill leaders have said they were briefed by Secret Service about the incident. Johnson is the first to say he has spoken directly with Trump.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire\n\nSchumer: Suspect 'must be prosecuted'\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was briefed by the acting director of the Secret Service about the shooting.\n\nHe applauded the agency's quick response, and reiterated Harris' point earlier in the day that there is no place for political violence in the U.S. before saying, \"the perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nEx-White House press secretary: Secret Service should expand Trump perimeter\n\nAs the Palm Beach sheriff explained at Sunday's news conference, the golf course would have been \"surrounded\" by law enforcement if Trump were the sitting president, but because he's a candidate that area is much smaller.\n\nSome are already saying that needs to change amid a hotly contested election defined by divisive rhetoric.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the Secret Service should change its policy and treat Trump like he's an incumbent with a larger protective perimeter around him. \"Stop being bureaucratic,\" he said on X. \"Do what’s necessary.\"\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nTrump running mate: 'Hugging my kids extra tight'\n\nSen.

They provided exactly what the protection should have been, and their agent did a fantastic job.\"\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nFlorida lawmaker wants Secret Service to brief Congress this week\n\nA member of the bipartisan congressional assassination task force is calling on the U.S. Secret Service to brief lawmakers this week after a second assassination attempt at Trump in as many months.\n\n“As I’ve said before, the July 13 assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,\" Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Florida, said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe panel, which consists of six Democrats and seven Republicans, was established to look into the attempted assassination in Pennsylvania.\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nCounty sheriff: Secret Service 'provided exactly what the protection should have been' for Trump\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the Secret Service had less protection at the golf course for Donald Trump because he was a former President and not a current one – but that the agency did everything it was supposed to do to protect him.\n\n“You got to understand, the golf course is surrounded by shrubbery, so when somebody gets into the shrubbery, they're pretty much out of sight, and at this level that he is at right now, he's not the sitting present,” Bradshaw said at the news conference. “If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded.”\n\n“But because he's not, the security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible,” Bradshaw said. “So I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there'll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter.”\n\n“But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done,” Bradshaw told reporters. “They provided exactly what the protection should have been, and their agent did a fantastic job” in responding to the suspect.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nFlorida lawmaker wants Secret Service to brief Congress this week\n\nA member of the bipartisan congressional assassination task force is calling on the U.S. Secret Service to brief lawmakers this week after a second assassination attempt at Trump in as many months.\n\n“As I’ve said before, the July 13 assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,\" Rep.

That's how we got the guy.”\n\n“We started out with ‘We don't know anything’ to where we had a tag, we had a vehicle description, and we got an area where we saw the person,” Bradshaw said. “So be proud. Be proud of your law enforcement.”\n\n--Josh Meyer\n\nOfficials: Secret Service engaged gunman, AK-47 style weapon found\n\nU.S. Secret Service agents opened fire on a gunman located near the property line of the golf source after seeing a rifle, according to law enforcement officials who spoke at a press conference Sunday afternoon.\n\nAgents found an AK-47 styled rifle, a scope, backpack and a GoPro camera on the scene, officials said. Trump was on the golf course at the time, and was roughly 400 to 500 yards away from where the would-be assailant was.\n\nThe suspect is now in custody, officials said.\n\nWitness: 'I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag'\n\nA witness saw the alleged gunman running from the golf course bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s quick apprehension, the Palm Beach County sheriff said at Sunday's news conference.\n\n“We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.\n\nAs a result, they were able to alert the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, who detained the suspect. The witness also was able to then identify the alleged gunman.\n\nWho was Trump golfing with?\n\nBefore the shooting began Trump was golfing with longtime friend and real estate baron Steven Witkoff, according to multiple reports.\n\nWitkoff gave a heartfelt speech about Trump at the Republican convention in Milwaukee back in August. He said he reached out to the former president after the assassination attempt in July, and was surprised when Trump picked up.\n\n\"I know this man very well,\" Witkoff said. \"President Trump is as kind and compassionate a man as I've ever met my lifetime.\"\n\nTrump: 'I am safe and well'\n\nIn a fundraising email sent out roughly an hour after the incident, Trump said there were gunshots in his vicinity, \"but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I am safe and well!\"\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity has developed a close relationship with Trump and conveyed having a brief conversation with the GOP nominee on Sunday.

Kennedy Jr., who is up for secretary of Health and Human Services. A 2024 presidential candidate turned ally to Trump, Kennedy is expected to face tough questions Wednesday and Thursday from not one but two Senate committees curious about his stances on issues ranging from abortion to vaccinations.\n\n“I don’t have a sense of how that hearing’s going to go,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told USA TODAY. Hawley sits on the committee overseeing Kennedy’s Thursday hearing, his second of the week.\n\n“There’s such a wide range of topics there, I’ll be curious to see what tomorrow’s hearing yields, and then I imagine the Thursday hearing will pick up from there,” Hawley continued.\n\nAlso on the docket this week is FBI director nominee Kash Patel and director of national intelligence pick Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard’s confirmation is in question, given doubts by a handful of Senate Republicans regarding her experience and past statements appearing sympathetic to foreign dictators, including Vladmir Putin of Russia.\n\n“They’re going to be controversial,” Sen.

Senators on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee raised concern about ports on both ends of the canal owned by Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based company that they said was subject to Chinese influence.\n\nMaritime experts said the canal was firmly under the operational control of the Panama Canal Authority - Trump had falsely claimed it was under Chinese control.

Officials found $37 million about to be sent to the World Health Organization, which Trump ordered the U.S. to withdraw from, and $50 million for condoms in Gaza, which Leavitt called “a preposterous waste of government money.”\n\n“President Trump is looking out for you in issuing his pause,” she said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nSean Duffy confirmed as Transportation secretary\n\nThe Senate confirmed Sean Duffy on Tuesday as secretary of Transportation, clearing the way for another of President Donald Trump's Cabinet officials to start working on plans to improve traffic safety, cut regulations on construction projects and restore public confidence in Boeing.\n\nDuffy was confirmed by a vote of 77 to 22.\n\nIn nominating Duffy to his post, Trump said the former Wisconsin Republican lawmaker would use his experience and relationships from eight years in Congress to rebuild the country’s infrastructure and improve travel safety.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nPritzker slams pause on loans and grants\n\nState agencies in Illinois have been reporting issues with accessing federal funding sites, including the site that issues federal payments to Medicaid, according to a statement by Alex Gough, the press secretary for Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat.\n\n“The US Constitution does not grant the President this unilateral authority,” Pritzker said in a statement.” In Illinois, we will stand against unlawful actions that would harm millions of working families, children, and seniors.”\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nAdvocacy groups ask federal court to block Trump federal grant memo\n\nA coalition of advocacy groups for nonprofits, health care and small businesses asked a federal court Tuesday to block the Trump administration’s memo pausing federal grants and loans.\n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits, the American Public Health Association and the Main Street Alliance asked for a temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, to prevent the pause scheduled for 5 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n“This reckless action by the administration would be catastrophic for nonprofit organizations and the people and communities they serve,” said Diane Yentel, CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits. “From pausing research on cures for childhood cancer to halting housing and food assistance, shuttering domestic violence and homeless shelters, and closing suicide hotlines, the impact of even a short pause in funding could be devastating and cost lives.\"\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nFormer OMB official calls new OMB directive “cruel” and “a massive fraud”\n\nTopher Spiro, a former associate director at OMB, called the OMB memo “a massive fraud,” and said he has “no doubt that OMB lawyers would believe this is illegal.”\n\n“I know (acting OMB Director) Matt Vaeth. This memo reads like a hostage note written directly by Russ Vought, who is not confirmed,” Spiro said in a series of posts on the social media platform @X.\n\nSpiro said Vought, the incoming OMB director and Project 2025 chief architect, “is illegally carrying out his ideological agenda with greatest harm to the most vulnerable--including many in the working class and rural communities who voted for Trump.”\n\nA sampling of funding potentially affected in health care, Spiro said, includes all opioid prevention funding, all mental health funding, funding for community health centers, suicide prevention and the suicide lifeline, HIV/AIDS treatment and grants to states to address avian flu.\n\n--Josh Meyer\n\nSenate Budget Committee plans Vought vote despite Democratic complaints\n\nThe Senate Budget Committee issued a statement Tuesday saying lawmakers will vote Thursday as scheduled on Russell Vought’s nomination to become director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDemocrats complained the Trump administration was trying to usurp the power of Congress by temporarily freezing billions in federal grants and loans. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, proposed a two-week postponement of the Vought vote to learn more about the freeze that sparked chaos among federal grand recipients.\n\nBut the committee headed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said it would hold the vote anyway.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nDemocrats blast Trump over freezing federal grants nationwide\n\nSenate Democrats blasted the Trump administration’s freeze on federal grants set to go into effect Tuesday at 5 p.m. as an unconstitutional power grab that sparked widespread panic about funding drying up overnight.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump shut off billions and perhaps trillions of dollars to state and local governments, schools, hospitals and small businesses – and disaster aid.\n\n“It’s a dagger at the heart of the average American family,” Schumer said. “It is just outrageous.”\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget issued a memo Monday ordering a pause in grant and loan funding while officials review whether the spending priorities are aligned with Trump. The White House said the pause wouldn’t impact Social Security or Medicare payments.\n\nBut Democrats argued the bipartisan spending decisions were made by Congress and can’t be overturned by Trump. Democratic senators called for a two-week postponement of the Senate Budget Committee vote scheduled Thursday on Russell Vought’s nomination to become director of OMB to learn more about the freeze.\n\n“The scope of this illegal action is unprecedented and could have devastating consequences across the country for real people,” said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. “This memo is creating chaos and confusion about whether these resources will be available to them.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nHouse Republicans meet at Trump's Miami resort\n\nIt may be cold and dreary in Washington, but House Republicans wouldn't know it. They're sitting poolside, hitting the links, and spending hours in conference meetings at the Trump National Doral Miami hotel and golf club.\n\nThe conference is coming together for the second day of their annual policy retreat, where they hope to hammer out more details on their plan to implement President Donald Trump's agenda. They will meet with House GOP leadership and key committee chairs, and hear from Vice President JD Vance at 12:30 p.m.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nGary Peters won’t seek re-election\n\nMichigan's senior senator announced Tuesday he would not run for re-election in 2026, a move that will leave an open seat in the key battleground state during Donald Trump’s first midterm election cycle.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, a Democrat, made the announcement to The Detroit News. He told the news organization he is ready for a new chapter that includes spending time with a new grandchild.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nNoem to speak at DHS after attending New York City arrests\n\nNoem, the former governor of South Dakota, who was confirmed Saturday as the secretary of Homeland Security, will speak to the workforce at 3 p.m.\n\nEarlier in the day, Noem was in New York City as forces from her department began arresting immigrants in the country without legal authorization who have been convicted of crimes. She thanked the “brave officers involved.”\n\n“Dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets,” Noem said in a post on X of the arrest of a suspect for kidnapping, assault and burglary.\n\nThe department will be at the forefront of Trump’s top priority of immigration enforcement. The department includes Customs and Border Protection, which is charged with securing the border, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is rounding up migrants without legal authorization to be in the country, for mass deportations.\n\nBut Trump's policy for mass deportations clashes with state and local officials in New York, Illinois and elsewhere that have policies against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.\n\n“We are doing this right - doing exactly what President @realDonaldTrump promised the American people – making our streets safe,” Noem said in another post.\n\nSenate hearing to examine trade, security of Panama Canal\n\nThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. examining the Panama Canal's impact on U.S. trade and national security.\n\nTrump has criticized previous U.S. policy that turned over control of the canal, a key link for shipping between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, to Panama. Trump has complained about China’s rising influence over the canal.\n\n“Serving forty percent of U.S. seaborne container trade, the Panama Canal is vital to American economic and national security interests,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the committee chairman, said in a statement. “The United States paid for and built the Panama Canal, but Panama is treating America unfairly and ceding control of key infrastructure to China.”\n\nWitnesses include Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission; Daniel Maffei, a member of the commission; Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at George Mason University; and Joseph Kramek, CEO of the World Shipping Council.\n\nSenate votes at noon on Duffy to lead Transportation\n\nThe Senate scheduled a noon confirmation vote for former GOP Rep. Sean Duffy, Trump’s nominee to lead the Transportation Department.\n\nDuffy’s confirmation is expected because he breezed through his Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing and was approved with a bipartisan vote. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Wis., said Duffy was the right choice for the job.\n\nDuffy has said he would focus on improving safety for roads and aviation, and work to reduce regulations delaying large construction projects.\n\nWhat is Trump doing Tuesday?\n\nTrump has an 11 a.m. intelligence briefing scheduled, but no public events on his agenda after speaking the House Republican Conference in Florida on Monday and signing executive orders to eliminate diversity programs the Pentagon.\n\nGOP lawmakers are meeting to resolve disputes within their party over how to accomplish Trump’s priorities for cutting spending and taxes. If they can reach near unanimity in the closely divided House, Republicans could approve their agenda without Democratic votes.\n\nIn his speech, Trump called the United States a \"meritocracy\" after the elimination of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs in the federal government.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is scheduled to provide her first briefing at 1 p.m.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/21/blinken-senate-gaza-crisis-biden-israel-support/73772129007/", "title": "Blinken questioned by Senate over Gaza crisis, backs Biden stance", "text": "WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken fended off a sweeping attack on President Joe Biden's approach to Israel's war with Hamas from senators across the political spectrum on Tuesday.\n\nBlinken came under forceful questioning about Biden's pause on some offensive weapons to Israel, a State Department report on Israel's conduct in the war and the administration's posture toward Iran at the hearing that broadly focused on the president's foreign policy.\n\nIn an especially fiery exchange, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Blinken near the end of the hours-long hearing, “You funded our enemies, and you undermine our friends, and the world is much, much more dangerous as a result and Americans are at greater jeopardy because of it.\"\n\nFiring back, Blinken told him, \"In fact, we've brought more countries together. We have stronger allies, stronger partnerships, stronger engagement from countries around the world to deal with a very dangerous world than we had.\n\n\"We were alone, we aren't anymore, and America's leading those efforts,\" Blinken said as the hearing concluded.\n\nBlinken is delivering marathon testimony this week at hearings on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have been keen to question the top U.S. diplomat about Israel. He appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations in the morning and has the Senate Appropriations committee in the afternoon. He'll come under questioning again on Wednesday from House members.\n\nProtesters disrupt Blinken\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters interrupted Blinken's opening statements at both committee hearings on Tuesday to condemn the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne protester shouted at Blinken that he \"will be remembered\" as a \"butcher\" and for \"murdering innocent Palestinians,\" as he was led out of the Foreign Relations hearing by law enforcement. Another shouted repeatedly: \"He is a war criminal.\"\n\nAt least one demonstrator carried a homemade sign bearing the name of progressive, anti-war activist group CODEPINK.\n\n\"We're standing with Israel in its efforts to ensure that what happened on Oct. 7 never happens again, as we do everything we can to bring an end to the terrible human suffering in Gaza and prevent the conflict from spreading\" Blinken said moments later, as he continued with his prepared remarks.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Chair Ben Cardin, D-Md., warned as the question and answer portion began that he would not \"tolerate disruption\" in the committee hearing on the Biden administration's annual budget request.\n\nAt the later hearing a succession of demonstrators challenged Blinken again, with a group holding up red, paint-covered hands to silently register their displeasure, as a protester told the Biden administration official, \"This is a holocaust.\"\n\nBlinken hammers the ICC\n\nBlinken won praise early in hearing for his condemnation of the International Criminal Court's announcement on Monday that it would seek warrants for the arrest of Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, on war crimes charges.\n\nThe Biden administration still sees a hostage and cease-fire agreement as the most viable way to bring about the end of the war, Blinken told senators.\n\n\"We remain at it every single day, I think there's still a possibility,\" he said.\n\nBlinken said it was \"wrongheaded\" for the ICC to move to issue the warrants and a \"shameful equivalence\" between the leader of Hamas and Israel that was unhelpful to getting a deal.\n\nIdaho Sen. Jim Risch, the ranking Republican on the committee, said it was one area where they agree. \"On the ICC you got it exactly right, here,\" he said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump sanctioned ICC officials over an attempt to exert jurisdiction over the U.S., which is not a party to court, for actions that it took in Afghanistan. Biden's administration immediately reversed the sanctions when he took office.\n\nBut at the hearing Blinken indicated that the Biden administration is now open to taking action against the ICC following the push for arrest warrants against Israeli officials. He said the administration wants to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to find an \"appropriate response\" and is willing to entertain legislation sanctioning the ICC.\n\n\"I'm committed to doing that,\" Blinken told Risch. \"As you say, the devil's in the details. So let's see what...you've got. And we can take it from there.\"\n\nU.S. military assistance a focus\n\nBlinken came under scrutiny from members of Biden’s political party who have been critical of continued U.S. military assistance for Israel in the war that has lasted more than seven months.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., pressed Blinken to explain why the State Department determined in a report this month that it was “reasonable to assess” that Israel used U.S.-supplied weapons in ways that fell short of humanitarian standards but ruled they did constitute violations of international law.\n\nBlinken said that the U.S. is investigating instances that were alluded to in the report – and some that were not – in addition to formal investigations that Israel is conducting.\n\n“We’re determined that there be no double standard,” Blinken said.\n\nHe maintained that it is “very difficult to make final determinations” when the U.S. does not have personnel on the ground in Gaza and Hamas militants embed within civilian populations.\n\nCommenting on the portion of the report that deals with humanitarian assistance, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., bluntly told him, \"This issue does not require additional investigation. We’ve seen this play out in real time.\"\n\nRepublicans also pushed Biden to explain the weapons hold, with Cruz insisting that Biden and Blinken \"funded the Oct. 7 attacks” and claiming the administration “cut off weapons to Israel” in an especially testy exchange.\n\n“We did not cut off weapons to Israel,” Blinken shot back.\n\nBlinken testified that there is still just one weapons system Biden is holding back over concerns about a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had been sheltering.\n\nHe expressed frustration that a phone conversation in which Biden told Netanyahu he was putting a hold on the offensive weapons leaked to the press.\n\n“There’s no final decision and it remains subject to a discussion,” he said under questioning from Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb.\n\nRicketts kept pushing, and asked, “When was the last time you called for Hamas’ surrender?\"\n\n“Virtually every day,” Blinken responded.\n\nHamas could end the war by surrendering, Blinken added. “We’ve called for that repeatedly. I wish more countries around the world were doing that.”\n\nRepublicans zero in on Iran\n\nCruz also accused Blinken of refusing to enforce oil sanctions against Iran, which provides funding to the militant group Hamas, prompting Blinken to say that Tehran is \"determined\" to get around them.\n\nThe senator had questioned the administration's response to Raisi's death earlier in the back and forth, calling the leader who died in a weekend helicopter crash the “Butcher of Tehran” over human rights abuses in his wind up.\n\nCruz criticized the United Nations for flying the flag at half-mast and asked Blinken if he supported the decision.\n\n“We’re certainly not mourning his death,” Blinken said.\n\nPressed on whether it’s “disgraceful” he replied: “We certainly wouldn’t do that.”\n\nCreation of a Palestinian State\n\nBlinken said the realization of a Palestinian state, which would allow for the normalization of relations between Israel and its neighbors and the full integration of Israel into the region, is the only way to stop the “endless cycles of violence, destruction, death and insecurity.”\n\nThere are 5 million Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza and approximately 7 million Israeli-Jews in the region, he said.\n\n“Neither is going anywhere. The Palestinians are not going anywhere, the Jews are not going anywhere. There has to be an accommodation,” Blinken said. “And there has to be an accommodation that respects and fulfills the rights of everyone concerned.”\n\nBlinken said that it must also be done in a way that includes security guarantees for the Israelis.\n\n“And we are and will be adamant about that,” Blinken said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/02/07/trump-dodge-accountability-senate-impeachment-trial-courts-column/4390755001/", "title": "Trump could dodge accountability in Senate impeachment trial and ...", "text": "Michael J. Stern\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nAsk any die-hard Democrat their most vivid political fantasy and, if they’re honest, they will describe former President Donald Trump in an orange jumpsuit with his hands clenched around two jail cell bars. That image is not the equivalent of the “I’d like a date with Jennifer Aniston” dream because, well, Trump spent four years exploding the heads of prosecutors, ethicists and decent human beings with an unbroken chain of corruption that would make imprisonment a near certainty for most ordinary people.\n\nBut if 2020’s lesson in criminal justice was the deadly disparity between the system’s treatment of Black and white Americans, 2021 is going to be all about the disparity between the powerful and everyone else. And nothing will illustrate that bitter pill better than the events about to unfold around Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThere are a panoply of federal laws that make it illegal for someone to incite “any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States”; agree with others to use force “to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States”; impede “any official proceeding” before Congress; or intentionally disrupt “the orderly conduct of Government business” by engaging in “disruptive conduct” near a restricted building.\n\nA mob 'provoked by the president'\n\nOthers have effectively detailed how Trump fraudulently attempted to convince his supporters that the presidential election was stolen; how he leveraged congressional surrogates to amplify an illicit scheme to maintain presidential power; and how he doused rhetorical hot sauce on an angry mob that converged on Washington to do whatever was necessary to stop the final electoral count that would declare Joe Biden the president-elect.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nTrump’s culpability for an insurrection that breached the heart of American democracy was aptly summarized by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a longtime Trump ally: “The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president.\" McConnell’s “provoked,” and the federal insurrection statute’s “incited,” sound an awful lot like one another.\n\nAnd to those who think that Trump is in the clear because he did not march with the mob to the Capitol, like he promised, there is a federal law that says someone who “counsels, commands, (or) induces” others to commit a crime is just as guilty as the people who physically commit the crime.\n\nAmerica’s first crack at holding Trump accountable will start Monday, when the Senate opens a trial based on the House-approved article of impeachment that charged Trump with “incitement of insurrection.” But the writing is already on the wall: 45 Republican senators recently voted to hold no impeachment trial at all, based on the unsupported position that a former president cannot be impeached. This all but ensures that Democrats will fail to get the 17 GOP votes needed to secure the constitutional remedy of disqualifying Trump from holding an elected public position again.\n\nOnce Trump’s Senate fraternity brothers and sorority sisters give him a pass, the real question is whether the Department of Justice will make good on its name by conducting a full investigation into the many activities of Trump that appear criminal. There is plenty to investigate, from the campaign finance fraud payoff of Stormy Daniels, to the extortion of Ukraine’s president that tied American financial aid to manufactured political dirt on Biden, to the breach of the Capitol that ended in the deaths of five people.\n\nMore important, will DOJ indict Trump if the evidence supports it?\n\nThe initial impediment to any prosecution of Trump is one of perception. Trump corruptly used the department as his personal law firm — protecting himself from accountability and targeting his enemies. Biden and his attorney general are going to want to make a clean break from anything that could be construed as Biden enlisting DOJ to assist in a payback vendetta. That’s why Biden must assure the public that he has instructed his attorney general to erect a barrier between the White House and any investigation of the former president. Then, the attorney general must appoint an independent special prosecutor, preferably a Republican, to handle any Trump investigation.\n\nBy any standard: Whatever legal or constitutional test you apply, Trump incited the violent Capitol attack\n\nIn deciding whether to indict Trump, there will likely be ample evidence. After all, Trump was already named as “Individual 1,” an unindicted co-conspirator in the New York U.S. attorney’s campaign finance prosecution of Trump’s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen. And Trump was regularly churning out damning evidence, like being caught on a recorded telephone call asking the Georgia secretary of state to “find 11,780 votes” so he could beat Biden’s 11,779-vote lead.\n\nTrump’s criminal culpability in that instance was so blatant that former Attorney General Eric Holder tweeted the text of the federal law it violated.\n\nIt is with some trepidation that I hold a pin to the bubble, but the schoolbook ideal of a criminal investigation and the reality are often not the same. Yes, there will be months of witness interviews, reports, subpoenas, video viewings, telephone call transcriptions, grand jury testimony and legal analysis. The evidence and the law will be examined in microscopic detail. But other factors will come into play.\n\nHigh-profile targets of DOJ criminal investigations come with their own set of rules. It is one thing for DOJ to risk losing an ordinary case that will go unnoticed. It’s quite another to lose a case on the world stage against the most high-profile defendant of all — a former U.S. president. Whether this is explicitly discussed among the federal or special prosecutors who investigate Trump, or whether it is quietly implied, it will color consideration of a Trump indictment and ratchet up the quantum of proof required to bring a criminal case.\n\nThe Justice Manual, which sets forth the principles of federal prosecution that act as a guide for all federal prosecutors, states that a prosecution should commence when there is sufficient evidence to “obtain … a conviction.” But in any case against Trump that proceeds to trial, it is almost certain that at least one of the 12 jurors will be a Trump supporter capable of blocking a conviction, no matter how strong the evidence. The Justice Manual considers the circumstance of a popular figure against whom there is strong evidence, but whom jurors are unlikely to convict. It allows, though does not require, prosecution.\n\nStop letting Trump off the hook\n\nIt is this discretion that results in prosecutors often demanding more evidence before prosecuting a politician or celebrity for the same conduct that would bring swift charges against an ordinary citizen. Case in point: Approximately 180 Capitol rioters have been indicted, while the man on whose behalf they acted is boning up on his golf game at his Florida resort.\n\nWe saw this type of “caution” play out with special counsel Robert Mueller, who presented a report bursting with evidence of Trump’s obstruction in the Russia investigation. Mueller was never going to take the heat for indicting Trump because Justice Department precedent says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted. Yet Mueller would not even publicly opine on the task he was hired to perform: Determine whether Trump had committed a crime that would justify an indictment when he left office.\n\nProsecutors considering a Trump indictment will be concerned that in a case in which the notoriety of the defendant might be more important than the evidence, a widely publicized acquittal could undercut the deterrent value of prosecutions across the country. That’s not to say that there will be no prosecution of Trump. The Justice Department has a history of doing the right thing and taking tough cases.\n\nWhether Trump adds “convicted felon” to the most scandal-filled presidency in U.S. history is uncertain, and depends on a complicated process that is likely to have only just begun. What is certain is that Senate Republicans are on course to blow past the impeachment exit ramp — squandering their second opportunity to hold Trump accountable and protect American democracy from the man who brought it to its knees.\n\nMichael J.

At least one state lawmaker noted the issues uncovered by the podcast in his calls for reforms to the Michigan State Police. In a letter to the Free Press, state Sen. Jim Runestad, R-White Lake, said he plans to introduce legislation that would address the issues.\n\nInvestigation finds dubious government grants, resulting in recipient returning funds\n\nA Free Press investigation found the U.S. Small Business Administrations Restaurant Relief Fund awarded more than $7 million in dubious grants to Michigan restaurants.\n\nThe fund was earmarked to provide grants to restaurants that suffered losses from the COVID-19 pandemic. A grant of more than $800,000 was awarded to a metro Detroit restaurant owner. The Free Press investigated the award and the owner, finding that the restaurant closed and was sold prior to the pandemic.\n\nAfter the Free Press’ questions and investigation, the restaurateur returned nearly two-thirds of the grant to the SBA.\n\nCounty says it has taken action to improve conditions in juvenile jail\n\nThe Free Press' three years of reporting on dangerous conditions at Wayne County's juvenile jail continues to spur change. In a March 2024 speech to residents, Wayne County Executive Warren Evans — who runs the juvenile jail — said the county has made significant improvements at the facility, including adding more in-house mental health treatment, hiring about 100 new staffers and boosting pay by 35%, funded by a $10 million budget increase. Since the summer of 2022, the Free Press has reported on the overcrowding and understaffing at the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center, problems that led to what critics have called inhumane conditions. The newspaper continues to report on conditions at the jail, including interviewing a former employee who is worried someone could be seriously injured or killed.\n\nFree Press obtains, publishes disclosures that prompt sweeping review from ethics watchdog\n\nThe administration of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan requires appointees to file annual conflict of interest disclosures. However, the city does not publicly post them anywhere, and when a Free Press reporter tried to obtain them, the city wanted to charge hundreds of dollars.\n\nAfter a battle, the city eventually acquiesced, releasing hundreds of records. Despite releasing the information in a wonky format, the Free Press worked to publish the disclosures in a format easily accessible to Detroiters. The Free Press also used the data to show that at least four out of 10 of the highest-ranking city officials don't actually live in Detroit — including the city's then-deputy mayor, who has since been appointed interim police chief. Subsequently, the Detroit Board of Ethics realized many of the appointees who filed a disclosure with Duggan's administration also needed to file disclosures with that board. The leader of the organization sent out a slew of letters to mayoral appointees in the fall of 2024. Although the Duggan administration initially fought making the information available to the ethics board, it eventually gave in, culminating in the release of 89 additional disclosures. Overall, Free Press reporting led to the most disclosures ever received by the board in a year.\n\nInvestigation into unconstitutional acts by judges raises awareness ahead of possible high court decision\n\nIn 2019, the Michigan Supreme Court determined that trial court judges cannot sentence someone as though they committed a crime for which they were found not guilty. While this act is now considered unconstitutional, the Free Press found an unknown number of people remain in Michigan prisons for exactly this reason — sentenced to years in prison despite a not guilty verdict.\n\nWe highlighted the case of two men: one who shot and killed two people, the second who watched him. The shooter was convicted of two murders and sentenced to life without parole. But he has since been released from prison, since he was under 18 at the time of the shooting. The other man was found not guilty of murdering either person. But the judge determined he played a role in at least one of their deaths, and sentenced him to at least 50 years in prison. Now, despite not pulling the trigger — and spending the last 33 years in prison on a sentence deemed unconstitutional — he must wait longer in prison.\n\nLawyers for this man and others who face similar circumstances asked the Michigan Supreme Court to weigh in and make their 2019 ruling retroactive, so it would apply to any case in the past. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, but the state's highest court could take up the issue at any time.\n\nThe Free Press investigation brought substantial attention to an issue that is not well understood but impacts an unknown number of Michiganders.\n\nDetroit judges may no longer use online chat feature after Freep investigation\n\nThe Free Press immediately jumped on the case of 36th District Court Judge Kenneth King after he had a teen girl detained and threatened with jail for falling asleep in his courtroom. But the Free Press went beyond the initial headlines to uncover arguably more disturbing behavior: King routinely used an online chat associated with livestreaming his proceedings on YouTube to engage with viewers of his court. And while many of those interactions could be considered harmless, others clearly dealt with the substance of proceedings — and happened while King was on the bench.\n\nHis superiors, state officials and other lawyers criticized his actions, but the Free Press showed they had known about his conduct for years. After Free Press reporting, 36th District Chief Judge William McConico said no judge in his court could use the YouTube chat function any longer. This change will have a direct impact on justice in Detroit: Multiple defense lawyers have argued King's use of the chat directly correlated with his decisions on cases.\n\nWayne County cancels contract of former CFO after domestic violence charges revealed\n\nFormer Wayne County CFO Tony Saunders had a lucrative consulting contract with the county canceled after the Free Press revealed details of the contract — and an incident that resulted in Saunders being charged with domestic violence in the beating of his wife in their home.\n\nWe also reported on a second incident that resulted in Saunders being charged with domestic violence.\n\nAfter 18 years, Detroit police reopen investigation into woman killed during 2006 Super Bowl\n\nWith the NFL returning to Detroit for a major event with the 2024 draft, the Free Press looked back at an unsolved murder committed the last time the NFL staged a major event in Detroit — the 2006 Super Bowl.\n\nAs a result of our queries, Detroit police said they would use new technology and resources to see whether evidence they collected 18 years ago would generate new leads that could help them catch the killer.\n\nFree Press uncovers secret agreements between prosecutor and Oxford High officials after school shooting\n\nAfter the historic convictions of James and Jennifer Crumbley, the first parents in America to be held responsible for a mass school shooting, the families of the victims shifted their focus to Oxford High School, where their son killed four students and injured seven people, including a teacher. They argued that school officials also made mistakes that day, and wanted them held accountable. But the prosecutor dealt families' hopes a blow when she announced no school officials would be charged. A Free Press investigation discovered two key school officials who had drawn scrutiny over their decisions involving the shooter had signed confidential agreements with the prosecutor's office that protected them from liability. They had signed these \"proffer agreements\" early on — as the prosecutor built her case against the Crumbleys — and would go on to testify against them. The Free Press investigation prompted the prosecutor's office to release the agreements, which are now the focal point of Jennifer Crumbley's appeal. Her lawyer argues the confidential agreements that we discovered amount to suppressed evidence and Brady violations, and says they are grounds for tossing Jennifer Crumbley's conviction.\n\nJuror explains key factors in groundbreaking conviction\n\nAfter the conviction of the father of the Oxford High School shooter, the Free Press was the only news media outlet to get an interview with a juror, and explain to the public what drove the jury to reach a guilty verdict in this unprecedented and high profile case.\n\nWe found the jury foreman in his home on a country road, and he explained that the storage of the gun was a key issue, along with the shooter's claims that his dad ignored his pleas for mental health treatment.\n\nWe provided readers nationwide with an exclusive, inside view into the deliberation room of this historic case, and explained what issues mattered most to the jury.\n\nMichigan's fatally flawed system for tracking lobbyists' freebies to lawmakers\n\nEye On Michigan, a student investigative reporting program that partners with the Free Press, revealed that the state's system for tracking freebies is broken.\n\nNevertheless, student reporters, working with Free Press data analysts, found that lobbyists lavished more than $6 million in free meals and trips on Michigan lawmakers between 2001-2023, even though flaws in the system make it impossible to determine how much state officials really got.\n\nEye on Michigan and the Freep also created a searchable database revealing how much lobbyists reported giving to every lawmaker who served between 2001 and 2023.\n\nCandidate for U.S. Senate loses close race after investigation reveals he registered to vote at a home where he does not live\n\nRepublican Mike Rogers and Democrat Elissa Slotkin were engaged in one of the most competitive U.S. Senate races in the nation when the Free Press revealed that Rogers was registered to vote at a home that was under construction, did not have a certificate of occupancy, and was not where he actually lived.\n\nOur investigation raised other questions about whether Rogers, who also owned a mansion in Florida, was truly living where he said he was after moving to Michigan a year before the election. Our investigation prompted other news organizations, from MSNBC to our competitor The Detroit News, to run their own versions of our story after we first published it.\n\nWhile Republican Donald Trump won Michigan by nearly 1.5% — with a margin of 49.73% to Kamala Harris' 48.31% — Republican Rogers lost by less than 1.3% — receiving 48.30% to Slotkin's 48.64% in one of the closest U.S. Senate races in the country.\n\nBiden drops out of race on day Free Press poll shows him lagging badly in Michigan\n\nOn July 21, we released a poll done for the Detroit Free Press and its media partners that revealed a shocking response: President Joe Biden, then the Democratic nominee, trailed Republican candidate President Donald Trump by 7 points in Michigan.\n\nIt was a historically bad showing for a Democratic nominee — especially in a state Biden won four years before by 3 points, and that had gone for a GOP nominee (by a much smaller margin) once in 36 years.\n\nThe poll was cited by other outlets — notably Politico, who deemed it the \"Dem freakout of the day,\" noting, \"Democrats have been sending this poll to us all morning. \"Brutal,\" said one former senior Biden official. President Biden dropped out of the presidential race later that same day.\n\nGM suspends arrest powers for contracted private security force at Renaissance Center\n\nA day after our monthslong investigation into allegations of racism and abuse by white private security officers against Black visitors at General Motors' Renaissance Center office complex published in November 2023, GM kicked officers named in federal lawsuits off its properties in Detroit. In January, GM went a step further: The company suspended the private security force’s arrest powers, removed handcuffs from officer uniforms and reduced the number of armed officers in the complex.\n\nWayne County judge candidate defeated after history of violence against women revealed\n\nVoters didn't know much about Wayne County Probate Court judge candidate Daniel Mercier until the Free Press began digging into his background, which revealed that multiple women had accused him of attacking them as well as a history of lying and bad debt.\n\nOur investigation found that two women in Michigan obtained personal protection orders against Mercier and that he was convicted in Florida of domestic violence. Mercier finished last in the four-person race.\n\nSenator introduced legislation to prevent Michigan from taking foster kids' benefits\n\nAfter the Free Press published an article detailing how the state of Michigan takes federal financial benefits from children in foster care to reimburse itself for the cost of their care, state Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor, introduced legislation to end the practice. Although Irwin said the issue had previously been brought to his attention by a constituent, he told the Free Press the article was \"helpful in highlighting the concern and propelling the conversation.\" The legislation introduced by Irwin differs from a previously introduced bill referenced in the story by allowing foster children to keep 100% of their benefit money, which is typically awarded to children who have disabilities or are orphans, instead of an age-based percentage.\n\nReaders donate $25,000 to dad taking care of his dying teenage son\n\nAfter the Free Press wrote a story about Trae Hawthorne, a 15-year-old dying of cancer in a small town in rural Michigan, Trae started a fundraiser not for himself, but for his father, whom he calls \"my hero\" for quitting two jobs to stay at home full time with his dying son.\n\nThe teenager did it not only to raise much-needed funds for the family, but also to let the world know about his dad's selflessness. The act received little attention until the Detroit Free Press wrote about it.\n\nReaders responded with hundreds of small donations that added up in a matter of days to $25,000 and counting.\n\n‘Coldwater Kitchen’ documentary goes international\n\nThe documentary film \"Coldwater Kitchen,\" produced by the Detroit Free Press, was selected for the 2025 American Film Showcase, the flagship film and TV exchange program of the U.S. Department of State. \"Coldwater Kitchen\" chronicles the lives of the men enrolled in the unique culinary arts vocational program at Michigan's Coldwater prison, and the life of the man who runs the program, Chef Jimmy Lee Hill.\n\nFunded by a grant from the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and produced by USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, American Film Showcase works with more than 60 U.S. embassies or consulates each year to host international film screenings and train global storytellers. Coldwater Kitchen co-director Brian Kaufman traveled to Fiji in November 2024 to lead a multiday video journalism workshop for Fijian journalists.\n\nWorking with nearly a dozen reporters from print, television and radio outlets, Kaufman taught character-driven video storytelling techniques designed for journalists who work alone or in small teams, drawing from his repertoire of video projects over a nearly 20-year career at the Detroit Free Press. In addition to the Fiji program, American Film Showcase organized international screenings of \"Coldwater Kitchen\" in Georgia and India, with more engagements expected in 2025. Locally, the film continues to find a wide audience through community engagement screenings. The Michigan Justice Fund, steadfast supporters of \"Coldwater Kitchen,\" hosted screenings of the film for elected officials and advocates working in support of community members directly affected by incarceration.\n\nThe men featured in the film regularly accompany its screenings for panel discussions and dinner and movie events. Chef Dink Dawson and Executive Producer Desiré Vincent Levy spoke at the 2024 Michigan Works! annual conference about the importance of vocational training for returning citizens. In July, Chef Jimmy Lee Hill, Chef Dink Dawson and Chef Ernest Davis, along with the entire film team, traveled to New York City for screenings at Platform by the James Beard Foundation and the IFC Center.\n\nPublic hearing held, conversation advances around Michigan energy rates\n\nAn exploration of how energy rates are determined in Michigan, with a uniquely personal approach to explaining a complex process, generated broader conversation around DTE Energy's 10 straight years of rate increase requests. A Michigan Radio interview that followed publication furthered the discussion, and the piece brought attention to calls for a Detroit public hearing on the matter — which Michigan Public Service Commission officials initially said was unlikely. The MPSC held the hearing, and heard from dozens of angry Detroiters on persistent rate increases. The commission ultimately approved a gas rate increase that was lower than DTE requested. MPSC is still considering an electric rate increase that would raise average annual household billing by $135.\n\nCash-strapped Highland Park School District abandons plan to spend $1 million on abandoned building\n\nHighland Park is a cash-strapped school district that has only a couple of employees, no students and no schools, yet the district was planning to spend $1 million on an abandoned building it hoped to turn into an administration building and potential education center.\n\nThe building is the same one the district sold about 15 years earlier for less than $100,000 to a developer who was supposed to tear it down. After the Free Press revealed the district's plan, board members rejected the deal.\n\nDetroit officials agree to explore opening riverfront parks on fireworks night\n\nA colorful description of the annual Ford fireworks night in Detroit brought attention to the city's long-standing policy of closing riverfront parks to spectators during the display. Detroiters often settle for a sliver of a view of the fireworks despite what could be spectacular viewing from the city's pristine riverfront parks. The parks are closed in an effort to avoid security issues, with little public discussion on the curious strategy.\n\nAfter the Free Press column published, the city council president and the city's Chief Operating Officer promised to explore reopening the parks during next year's display.\n\nBoy abandoned in Jamaica by adoptive parents returns to Michigan\n\nWhen the Free Press learned that a Michigan boy had been abandoned in Jamaica by his adoptive parents for months, we pushed government agencies to explain why no one was helping return the boy home after his Jamaican boarding school was shut down over abuse claims. The Free Press learned his parents never went back to get him, and that government agencies dragged their feet for months, ignoring the boy's pleas for help and his lawyers' requests for intervention. Our reporting would not only detail this boy's hellish nightmare, but exposed the numerous failures of all levels of government, and the lengths advocates went to get him home.\n\nIn the end, our reporting caught the attention of many in the boy's hometown of Traverse City, and inspired a woman to step up and offer to take him in as a foster child.\n\nAs journalists, we aspire to open the world's eyes to the suffering and mistreatment of vulnerable individuals, with the hopes that we can bring about changes and help people. This enterprise piece did just that.\n\nMichigan family seeks novel prosecution after teen driver killed their son — they want his mom charged, too\n\nAfter a teen driver killed his friend in a high-speed car crash, the victim's family reached out to us about a possible legal issue they wanted to pursue: They wanted the driver's mom charged, too, maintaining she knew her son was a reckless driver through an app she had on his phone, but never took the keys away.\n\nThe Free Press investigated, and produced an enterprise story that showed how technology may now be used to hold parents accountable for their child's actions. In this case, the Free Press obtained records that showed the driver had a history of speeding over 100 mph, and his mom would warn him through texts to slow down.\n\nThe story went national as it touched on themes and problems that resonate with families all over: Problematic teenagers. Family fights. Divorce. It was also a story of unimaginable pain, grief, and loss. When we think of impactful journalism — stories that make people feel, think, or act more carefully — this gut-wrenching piece delivers.\n\nThousands of Detroiters remain on water affordability plan\n\nAfter the Free Press wrote about obstacles that barred Detroiters in poverty from a program that reduces monthly water bills to as low as $18 a month, and wipes away back water debt — participants were required to verify that they were still income-eligible to remain on the plan — at least 3,000 households contacted the Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency, which is administering the program, according to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD), to get reconnected.\n\nMobile home residents reach out about housing conditions\n\nAfter we wrote about Michigan mobile home residents fighting rent hikes and worsening conditions, we received a flood of emails from residents also dealing with mobile home troubles or who appreciated the coverage. Readers reached out about rising rent, undrinkable water, aged sewer lines and overall neglect.\n\nStudents across the country learned about a coming memorial ceremony for a longtime Detroit educator\n\nAfter a community member reached out about a memorial service for a longtime Detroit educator, Alfredine Wiley, the Free Press published a story that highlighted Wiley's life. For most of her career, Wiley worked as head of the counseling department at Detroit's Cass Technical High School. After the story was published, Wiley's daughters reported that former students from all over the country who had been touched by Alfredine Wiley were sending RSVPs for the Sept. 14 memorial service.\n\nAfter a more than 20-year wait, a Detroiter was finally able to thank her high school counselor\n\nPriscilla Wade, a successful psychologist in Okemos, reached out to the Free Press in hopes of being able to thank the high school counselor who made it possible for her to attend college in the 1970s. The former high school counselor, Dr. Arthur Divers, was the subject of a \"Detroit Is...\" feature published the previous year.\n\nWade's outreach to the Free Press helped her to reach Divers, whom she invited, along with Divers' daughter, to Osborn High School's Class of 1974 50th Reunion. A story about Wade's long quest to thank Divers was the subject of a \"Detroit Is ...\" feature on Sept. 8, 2024. Wade and others on the reunion's organizing committee also used the story to spread the word in the community about the reunion, which was held Sept. 20, 2024.\n\nArticle helps 87-year-old first-time author spread the word about her book\n\nA Feb. 4, 2004 \"Detroit Is ...\" feature about 87-year-old, first-time author Frances Lewis, significantly helped to spread the word about Lewis' life story, which began in Detroit's Black Bottom. Following the publication of the story, the Free Press received several messages from readers who wanted to purchase Lewis' book.\n\nSt. Patrick Senior Center, Lewis' home away from home, also was contacted by many in the community, and as a result, St. Patrick Senior later hosted a book signing for Lewis. Among the interested community members that were anxious to learn more about Lewis was an eighth grade homeroom class at St. Clare of Montefalco Catholic School in Grosse Pointe Park taught by Mary White.\n\nThe Free Press was contacted by White, who was eager to connect her students to Lewis, which included making arrangements for her students to attend the book signing. White said her students were interested in Lewis' life and journalism.\n\nMacomb County Sheriff candidate who got improper tax break loses close election\n\nWe investigated whether Terence Mekoski, the Republican nominee for Macomb County sheriff, committed voter fraud by registering to vote in a town where he did not live, or received a property tax break he did not deserve because he listed a home where he did not live full-time as his principal residence.\n\nOur first step was to determine where Mekoski really lived, since multiple addresses were associated with him.\n\nAfter examining public records and knocking on doors, the Free Press determined that Mekoski was legally registered to vote at his in-laws' home in Shelby Township. We also determined that he was not entitled to a property tax break he had been receiving at a home in Oregon Township.\n\nOur inquiries prompted township officials to investigate, and Mekoski acknowledged that he was not entitled to the property tax break he had been receiving.\n\nOur story raised questions about Mekoski's integrity and attention to detail, and he lost a close race by a margin of 52% to 48% in a county that his fellow Republican Donald Trump won by a margin of 56% to 42%.\n\nMom finds support for grieving children\n\nAfter friends sent links to a Free Press story about a camp for children who lost someone to suicide, a mom signed up two of her kids.\n\nIn March 2024, the Free Press wrote about a grief camp for kids that was coming to Michigan for the first time ever. Friends of a metro Detroit mom sent her links to the story, knowing that her husband and the father of her children had died from suicide. She enrolled her kids in the camp. We got to know her daughter. And while she and her daughter do not wish to participate in a further story about attending the camp, she believes it was beneficial to the grieving process.\n\nFree Press builds civic pride bringing community behind scenes of long-neglected train station's renovation\n\nAs the Michigan Central Station reopening came to fruition, the Free Press followed along and produced coverage that got people excited about the historic train depot that had been closed since 1988 and became a symbol of blight Free Press coverage of the reopening of Michigan Central Station, the historic train depot that had been closed since 1988 and had become a symbol of blight, helped build excitement and pride as it reopened as a community center and mobility innovation incubator.\n\nThe Free Press told how Ford Motor Co., which bought the derelict building in 2018, spared no expense or detail to restore the station, going so far as to reopen a limestone quarry in Indiana to ensure matching materials. We told of a flooded secret basement, a Romanian clockmaker, the significance of graffiti and how the station had become a community third place, mixing neighborhood youths, bona fide artists and homeless people. Companion stories told of the importance of the station to neighborhoods on both sides of the signature building. Finally, we celebrated with the city as a star-studded concert formally opened the station.\n\nWhen the Free Press saved Thanksgiving ... and a marriage?\n\nNearly everyone cooks, but not all know how. Along with a host of other Thanksgiving tips and techniques, we told our readers how to spatchcock a turkey — splitting it along the backbone and cooking it flat — a method that shortens cooking time. The story prompted this email from a happy reader:\n\n\"Happy belated Thanksgiving! Had to send you a note to thank you for writing the article about spatchcocking. I had said to (my wife) the previous week that we were going to spatchcock the turkey this year due to time constraints. She gave me 'the look' and asked me to explain this method, and why. She was very skeptical of me, and this new method. You then penned your article, and she approved of said technique. Our bird turned out great and was a big hit. An 18-pound bird that I brined as well. Thanks for helping to maintain marital bliss.\"\n\nWe're in the dictionary\n\nMerriam-Webster.com cited a sentence that appeared in a Free Press story as an example of the correct use of the word \"opioid.\"\n\nThanks, Mr. President\n\nA \"Detroit Is ...\" story about the life of 104-year-old Detroiter Julia Esaw, which included her excitement for being able to cast a vote for Kamala Harris in the presidential election, was published on Nov. 3, 2024.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama tweeted a link to the story on the social media platform X the next day. Obama used the tweet to help drum up support for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the hours leading up to the Nov. 5 election. Obama's tweet put the story in front of thousands.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/07/dea-bulk-telephone-surveillance-operation/70808616/", "title": "USA Today: U.S. secretly tracked billions of calls for decades", "text": "Brad Heath\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. government started keeping secret records of Americans' international telephone calls nearly a decade before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, harvesting billions of calls in a program that provided a blueprint for the far broader National Security Agency surveillance that followed.\n\nFor more than two decades, the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration amassed logs of virtually all telephone calls from the USA to as many as 116 countries linked to drug trafficking, current and former officials involved with the operation said. The targeted countries changed over time but included Canada, Mexico and most of Central and South America.\n\nFederal investigators used the call records to track drug cartels' distribution networks in the USA, allowing agents to detect previously unknown trafficking rings and money handlers. They also used the records to help rule out foreign ties to the bombing in 1995 of a federal building in Oklahoma City and to identify U.S. suspects in a wide range of other investigations.\n\nThe Justice Department revealed in January that the DEA had collected data about calls to \"designated foreign countries.\" But the history and vast scale of that operation have not been disclosed until now.\n\nThe now-discontinued operation, carried out by the DEA's intelligence arm, was the government's first known effort to gather data on Americans in bulk, sweeping up records of telephone calls made by millions of U.S. citizens regardless of whether they were suspected of a crime. It was a model for the massive phone surveillance system the NSA launched to identify terrorists after the Sept. 11 attacks. That dragnet drew sharp criticism that the government had intruded too deeply into Americans' privacy after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked it to the news media two years ago.\n\nMore than a dozen current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials described the details of the Justice Department operation to USA TODAY. Most did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the intelligence program, part of which remains classified.\n\nThe DEA program did not intercept the content of Americans' calls, but the records — which numbers were dialed and when — allowed agents to map suspects' communications and link them to troves of other police and intelligence data. At first, the drug agency did so with help from military computers and intelligence analysts.\n\nThat data collection was \"one of the most important and effective Federal drug law enforcement initiatives,\" the Justice Department said in a 1998 letter to Sprint asking the telecom giant to turn over its call records. The previously undisclosed letter was signed by the head of the department's Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Section, Mary Lee Warren, who wrote that the operation had \"been approved at the highest levels of Federal law enforcement authority,\" including then-Attorney General Janet Reno and her deputy, Eric Holder.\n\nThe data collection began in 1992 during the administration of President George H.W. Bush, nine years before his son, President George W. Bush, authorized the NSA to gather its own logs of Americans' phone calls in 2001. It was approved by top Justice Department officials in four presidential administrations and detailed in occasional briefings to members of Congress but otherwise had little independent oversight, according to officials involved with running it.\n\nThe DEA used its data collection extensively and in ways that the NSA is now prohibited from doing. Agents gathered the records without court approval, searched them more often in a day than the spy agency does in a year and automatically linked the numbers the agency gathered to large electronic collections of investigative reports, domestic call records accumulated by its agents and intelligence data from overseas.\n\nThe result was \"a treasure trove of very important information on trafficking,\" former DEA administrator Thomas Constantine said in an interview.\n\nThe extent of that surveillance alarmed privacy advocates, who questioned its legality. \"This was aimed squarely at Americans,\" said Mark Rumold, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"That's very significant from a constitutional perspective.\"\n\nHolder halted the data collection in September 2013 amid the fallout from Snowden's revelations about other surveillance programs. In its place, current and former officials said the drug agency sends telecom companies daily subpoenas for international calling records involving only phone numbers that agents suspect are linked to the drug trade or other crimes — sometimes a thousand or more numbers a day.\n\nTuesday, Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said the DEA \"is no longer collecting bulk telephony metadata from U.S. service providers.\" A DEA spokesman declined to comment.\n\nHARVESTING DATA TO BATTLE CARTELS\n\nThe DEA began assembling a data-gathering program in the 1980s as the government searched for new ways to battle Colombian drug cartels. Neither informants nor undercover agents had been enough to crack the cartels' infrastructure. So the agency's intelligence arm turned its attention to the groups' communication networks.\n\nCalling records – often called \"toll records\" – offered one way to do that. Toll records are comparable to what appears on a phone bill – the numbers a person dialed, the date and time of the call, its duration and how it was paid for. By then, DEA agents had decades of experience gathering toll records of people they suspected were linked to drug trafficking, albeit one person at a time. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, officials said the agency had little way to make sense of the data their agents accumulated and almost no ability to use them to ferret out new cartel connections. Some agents used legal pads.\n\n\"We were drowning in toll records,\" a former intelligence official said.\n\nThe DEA asked the Pentagon for help. The military responded with a pair of supercomputers and intelligence analysts who had experience tracking the communication patterns of Soviet military units. \"What they discovered was that the incident of a communication was perhaps as important as the content of a communication,\" a former Justice Department official said.\n\nThe military installed the supercomputers on the fifth floor of the DEA's headquarters, across from a shopping mall in Arlington, Va.\n\nThe system they built ultimately allowed the drug agency to stitch together huge collections of data to map trafficking and money laundering networks both overseas and within the USA. It allowed agents to link the call records its agents gathered domestically with calling data the DEA and intelligence agencies had acquired outside the USA. (In some cases, officials said the DEA paid employees of foreign telecom firms for copies of call logs and subscriber lists.) And it eventually allowed agents to cross-reference all of that against investigative reports from the DEA, FBI and Customs Service.\n\nThe result \"produced major international investigations that allowed us to take some big people,\" Constantine said, though he said he could not identify particular cases.\n\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush proposed in his first prime-time address using \"sophisticated intelligence-gathering and Defense Department technology\" to disrupt drug trafficking. Three years later, when violent crime rates were at record highs, the drug agency intensified its intelligence push, launching a \"kingpin strategy\" to attack drug cartels by going after their finances, leadership and communication.\n\nTHE START OF BULK COLLECTION\n\nIn 1992, in the last months of Bush's administration, Attorney General William Barr and his chief criminal prosecutor, Robert Mueller, gave the DEA permission to collect a much larger set of phone data to feed into that intelligence operation.\n\nInstead of simply asking phone companies for records about calls made by people suspected of drug crimes, the Justice Department began ordering telephone companies to turn over lists of all phone calls from the USA to countries where the government determined drug traffickers operated, current and former officials said.\n\nBarr and Mueller declined to comment, as did Barr's deputy, George Terwilliger III, though Terwilliger said, \"It has been apparent for a long time in both the law enforcement and intelligence worlds that there is a tremendous value and need to collect certain metadata to support legitimate investigations.\"\n\nThe data collection was known within the agency as USTO (a play on the fact that it tracked calls from the U.S. to other countries).\n\nThe DEA obtained those records using administrative subpoenas that allow the agency to collect records \"relevant or material to\" federal drug investigations. Officials acknowledged it was an expansive interpretation of that authority but one that was not likely to be challenged because unlike search warrants, DEA subpoenas do not require a judge's approval. \"We knew we were stretching the definition,\" a former official involved in the process said.\n\nOfficials said a few telephone companies were reluctant to provide so much information, but none challenged the subpoenas in court. Those that hesitated received letters from the Justice Department urging them to comply.\n\nAfter Sprint executives expressed reservations in 1998, for example, Warren, the head of the department's drug section, responded with a letter telling the company that \"the initiative has been determined to be legally appropriate\" and that turning over the call data was \"appropriate and required by law.\" The letter said the data would be used by authorities \"to focus scarce investigative resources by means of sophisticated pattern and link analysis.\"\n\nThe letter did not name other telecom firms providing records to the DEA but did tell executives that \"the arrangement with Sprint being sought by the DEA is by no means unique to Sprint\" and that \"major service providers have been eager to support and assist law enforcement within appropriate bounds.\" Former officials said the operation included records from AT&T and other telecom companies.\n\nA spokesman for AT&T declined to comment. Sprint spokeswoman Stephanie Vinge Walsh said only that \"we do comply with all state and federal laws regarding law enforcement subpoenas.\"\n\nAgents said that when the data collection began, they sought to limit its use mainly to drug investigations and turned away requests for access from the FBI and the NSA. They allowed searches of the data in terrorism cases, including the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people in 1995, helping to rule out theories linking the attack to foreign terrorists. They allowed even broader use after Sept. 11, 2001. The DEA's public disclosure of its program in January came in the case of a man charged with violating U.S. export restrictions by trying to send electrical equipment to Iran.\n\nAt first, officials said the DEA gathered records only of calls to a handful of countries, focusing on Colombian drug cartels and their supply lines. Its reach grew quickly, and by the late 1990s, the DEA was logging \"a massive number of calls,\" said a former intelligence official who supervised the program.\n\nFormer officials said they could not recall the complete list of countries included in USTO, and the coverage changed over time. The Justice Department and DEA added countries to the list if officials could establish that they were home to outfits that produced or trafficked drugs or were involved in money laundering or other drug-related crimes.\n\nThe Justice Department warned when it disclosed the program in January that the list of countries should remain secret \"to protect against any disruption to prospective law enforcement cooperation.\"\n\nAt its peak, the operation gathered data on calls to 116 countries, an official involved in reviewing the list said. Two other officials said they did not recall the precise number of countries, but it was more than 100. That gave the collection a considerable sweep; the U.S. government recognizes a total of 195 countries.\n\nAt one time or another, officials said, the data collection covered most of the countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean, as well as others in western Africa, Europe and Asia. It included Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Italy, Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe DEA often — though not always — notified foreign governments it was collecting call records, in part to make sure its agents would not be expelled if the program was discovered. In some cases, the DEA provided some of that information to foreign law enforcement agencies to help them build their own investigations, officials said.\n\nThe DEA did not have a real-time connection to phone companies' data; instead, the companies regularly provided copies of their call logs, first on computer disks and later over a private network. Agents who used the system said the numbers they saw were seldom more than a few days old.\n\nThe database did not include callers' names or other identifying data. Officials said agents often were able to identify individuals associated with telephone numbers flagged by the analysis, either by cross-referencing them against other databases or by sending follow-up requests to the phone companies.\n\nTo keep the program secret, the DEA sought not to use the information as evidence in criminal prosecutions or in its justification for warrants or other searches. Instead, its Special Operations Division passed the data to field agents as tips to help them find new targets or focus existing investigations, a process approved by Justice Department lawyers. Many of those tips were classified because the DEA phone searches drew on other intelligence data.\n\nThat practice sparked a furor when the Reuters news agency reported in 2013 that the DEA trained agents to conceal the sources of those tips from judges and defense lawyers. Reuters said the tips were based on wiretaps, foreign intelligence and a DEA database of telephone calls gathered through routine subpoenas and search warrants.\n\nAs a result, \"the government short-circuited any debate about the legality and wisdom of putting the call records of millions of innocent people in the hands of the DEA,\" American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Patrick Toomey said.\n\nListen to Brad Heath detail his investigation into decades of bulk data collection in the audio player below:\n\nA BLUEPRINT FOR BROADER SURVEILLANCE\n\nThe NSA began collecting its own data on Americans' phone calls within months of Sept. 11, 2001, as a way to identify potential terrorists within the USA. At first, it did so without court approval. In 2006, after The New York Times and USA TODAY began reporting on the surveillance program, President George W. Bush's administration brought it under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to use secret court orders to get access to records relevant to national security investigations. Unlike the DEA, the NSA also gathered logs of calls within the USA.\n\nThe similarities between the NSA program and the DEA operation established a decade earlier are striking – too much so to have been a coincidence, people familiar with the programs said. Former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker said, \"It's very hard to see (the DEA operation) as anything other than the precursor\" to the NSA's terrorist surveillance.\n\nBoth operations relied on an expansive interpretation of the word \"relevant,\" for example — one that allowed the government to collect vast amounts of information on the premise that some tiny fraction of it would be useful to investigators. Both used similar internal safeguards, requiring analysts to certify that they had \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" – a comparatively low legal threshold – that a phone number was linked to a drug or intelligence case before they could query the records.\n\n\"The foundation of the NSA program was a mirror image of what we were doing,\" said a former Justice Department official who helped oversee the surveillance. That official said he and others briefed NSA lawyers several times on the particulars of their surveillance program. Two former DEA officials also said the NSA had been briefed on the operation. The NSA declined to comment.\n\nThere were also significant differences.\n\nFor one thing, DEA analysts queried their data collection far more often. The NSA said analysts searched its telephone database only about 300 times in 2012; DEA analysts routinely performed that many searches in a day, former officials said. Beyond that, NSA analysts must have approval from a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court each time they want to search their own collection of phone metadata, and they do not automatically cross-reference it with other intelligence files.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, complained last year to Holder that the DEA had been gathering phone data \"in bulk\" without judicial oversight. Officials said the DEA's database was disclosed to judges only occasionally, in classified hearings.\n\nFor two decades, it was never reviewed by the Justice Department's own inspector general, which told Congress it is now looking into the DEA's bulk data collections.\n\nA SMALLER SCALE COLLECTION\n\nHolder pulled the plug on the phone data collection in September 2013.\n\nThat summer, Snowden leaked a remarkable series of classified documents detailing some of the government's most prized surveillance secrets, including the NSA's logging of domestic phone calls and Internet traffic. Reuters and The New York Times raised questions about the drug agency's own access to phone records.\n\nOfficials said the Justice Department told the DEA that it had determined it could not continue both surveillance programs, particularly because part of its justification for sweeping NSA surveillance was that it served national security interests, not ordinary policing. Eight months after USTO was halted, for example, department lawyers defended the spy agency's phone dragnet in court partly on the grounds that it \"serves special governmental needs above and beyond normal law enforcement.\"\n\nThree months after USTO was shut down, a review panel commissioned by President Obama urged Congress to bar the NSA from gathering telephone data on Americans in bulk. Not long after that, Obama instructed the NSA to get permission from the surveillance court before querying its phone data collection, a step the drug agency never was required to take.\n\nThe DEA stopped searching USTO in September 2013. Not long after that, it purged the database.\n\n\"It was made abundantly clear that they couldn't defend both programs,\" a former Justice Department official said. Others said Holder's message was more direct. \"He said he didn't think we should have that information,\" a former DEA official said.\n\nBy then, agents said USTO was suffering from diminishing returns. More criminals — especially the sophisticated cartel operatives the agency targeted — were communicating on Internet messaging systems that are harder for law enforcement to track.\n\nStill, the shutdown took a toll, officials said. \"It has had a major impact on investigations,\" one former DEA official said.\n\nThe DEA asked the Justice Department to restart the surveillance program in December 2013. It withdrew that request when agents came up with a new solution. Every day, the agency assembles a list of the telephone numbers its agents suspect may be tied to drug trafficking. Each day, it sends electronic subpoenas — sometimes listing more than a thousand numbers — to telephone companies seeking logs of international telephone calls linked to those numbers, two official familiar with the program said.\n\nThe data collection that results is more targeted but slower and more expensive. Agents said it takes a day or more to pull together communication profiles that used to take minutes.\n\nThe White House proposed a similar approach for the NSA's telephone surveillance program, which is set to expire June 1. That approach would halt the NSA's bulk data collection but would give the spy agency the power to force companies to turn over records linked to particular telephone numbers, subject to a court order.\n\nFollow investigative reporter Brad Heath on Twitter at @bradheath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/07"}]}

A barn was also reported to have been destroyed.\n\nIn a release issued late Thursday night, the Delaware County Emergency Management Agency said the storm system \"inflicted significant damage across various parts of the county,\" especially in the Selma area.\n\nAn initial assessment indicated as many as half of the structures in the town — of about 740 people, less than four miles east of the Muncie city limits along Ind. 32 — had been damaged.\n\nHowever, as of 11 p.m. Thursday, only minor related injuries had been reported in Selma, with one person transported to IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital for treatment.\n\nThe county's emergency operations center was \"activated and fully staffed to coordinate response efforts,\" the release said.\n\nDebris removal efforts were underway. A \"reunification center\" had been set up at nearby Wapahani High School to provide \"assistance and support\" residents of the Selma area who were displaced by storm damage or became separated from family members.\n\n(According to the release, Delaware County residents are encouraged to report storm damage through a designated form available online at bit.ly/sendyourdamage.)\n\nAs the severe thunderstorm moved through Delaware County about 7:30 p.m. Thursday, funnel clouds were reported in the Royerton and Selma areas.\n\nAt 8:12 p.m., scanner traffic indicated a tornado was \"on the ground\" in Hamilton Township.

In Kansas, eight people died when high winds and a dust storm caused a massive collision on Interstate 70 involving at least 71 vehicles, said Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Tod Hileman.\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died and at least 27 people were injured statewide during a news conference Sunday. Three people who had been reported missing on Saturday have also since been found alive, according to Reeves. Hundreds more were displaced by the storms.\n\nThe chief medical examiner's office in Oklahoma confirmed four fatalities occurred as a result of the fires or high winds. KFOR-TV reported that a father was killed and his son was severely burned on Friday.\n\nAnother four deaths were reported in two Texas counties after blowing dirt and wildfire smoke caused multiple car crashes Friday, Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Cindy Barkley told USA TODAY. Nearly 40 vehicles were involved in another crash in Randall County, Barkley said, though no life-threatening injuries were reported. \"We had so many crashes that day, I can't even keep up,\" she said.\n\nThree people also died in Independence County, Arkansas, according to the state division of emergency management and 32 people were injured across eight counties. At least three people were killed in central Alabama and damage was reported in 52 of the state's 67 counties, Gov. Kay Ivey confirmed.\n\nSevere weather also caused a tree to fall on a trailer in Brevard, North Carolina, killing two boys, ages 11 and 13, fire officials said Sunday. A tornado watch issued across a large swath of North Carolina and Virginia expired early Monday morning, though the National Weather Service in Wilmington reported the chance of showers and storms would continue.\n\nHundreds of wildfires reported in Oklahoma\n\nThe storm brought 60 to 70 mph winds to Oklahoma on Friday and the sustained gusts knocked down power lines, ripped off shingles from houses, broke tree limbs, felled street signs, caused road closures and filled the sky with dust. More than 130 fires were reported in 44 counties, the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said Friday night.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said about 170,000 acres in Oklahoma burned and promised a \"post-mortem look\" on the causes of the wildfires beyond the high winds and low humidity. \"We think some of the power lines contributed to this,\" he said.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a Fire Weather Watch from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday in several areas as southwest winds with gusts up to 35 to 45 mph are expected to hit much of central and southwest Oklahoma and meteorologists forecast conditions to be worse on Tuesday, posing higher risks for fires.\n\nFamilies return to find homes destroyed by tornadoes, fire\n\nThe fires in Oklahoma destroyed hundreds of homes, including Stitt's farmhouse north of Luther. When Jeremy Cook returned to his neighborhood in Stillwater on Saturday morning, he found his home burned to the foundation.\n\nHe and his children left for safety Friday, loading up three cars full of wedding photos, pets, personal books, and family paintings. Cook said he had prepared as best he could, mowing and cutting any dead trees on his property, \"but when that wind shifted, and that fire started coming, well my brick house burned down.\"\n\nCook said he’s had college friends drop everything to help, strangers dropping off food and water, and fellow churchgoers bringing clothes.\n\n“It doesn't get better than Oklahomans; It really doesn't. They’re always there and there is nobody better than Okies,” Cook told The Oklahoman, which part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nMeanwhile in Mississippi, Tyrene Power and her family found themselves buried under rubble after a tornado struck their home.\n\nPower told the Mississippi Clarion Ledger, also part of the USA TODAY Network, that sheet rock fell on her, which probably protected her from flying glass, but she doesn't remember much of the event including the roof being torn off. Power wasn't injured, but said a friend who was staying with her had to be taken to the hospital.\n\nWhat Power endured on Saturday was so disorienting, she said she didn't know what day it was. She did know that the tornado that struck her home came sometime the previous afternoon. She said she knew the weather was bad, but didn't recognize anything that indicated a tornado.\n\n\"You know, they say you hear a train,\" Power said as she sat in a vehicle Sunday morning to stay warm outside of the remains of her destroyed home. \"We heard no train. It was just the wind and then it was there.\"\n\nRed flag warnings issued across central U.S.\n\nRed flag warnings will also go into effect Monday in parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas, New Mexico and Florida as high winds and low humidity raise the risk of wildfires, the National Weather Service said. Extremely critical fire weather conditions are also expected on Tuesday across southeast New Mexico, northwest Texas and the Texas Panhandle, an area home to more than 1.2 million people, the National Weather Service warned.\n\n\"A Red Flag Warning means that extreme fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and dry vegetation can contribute to extreme fire behavior,\" the weather service in Fort Worth, Texas said. \"Avoid all outside burning and welding today. Do not toss lit cigarette butts outside.\"\n\nMonday weather forecast Dry air, gusty winds trigger red flag warnings across the Plains\n\nRain, light snow coming to Northeast, Central Appalachians\n\nAdditionally, the weather service said a front is expected to bring rain from the Northeast to the southern mid-Atlantic Coast by Monday evening, and the Northeast by Tuesday evening.\n\nLight snow is also expected to fall over the Lower Great Lakes and Central Appalachians through late Monday afternoon, with light snow also developing over parts of northern New England from Monday evening into Tuesday morning.\n\nLight to moderate snow is also expected to develop over parts of the Northern Rockies, Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley on Monday before moving into the North and Central High Plains by Tuesday evening, the weather service said.\n\nFlights delayed during peak spring break travel\n\nThunderstorms brought rain and the threat of strong gusts, hail, and a brief tornado to Florida over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service in Melbourne.\n\nThe severe weather caused a temporary ground stop at Orland International Airport on Sunday, Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson Chris Mulloolytold USA TODAY. More than 120 flights into or out of Orlando International Airport were also canceled and hundreds more were delayed Sunday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware as thunderstorms struck the area during what officials called the busiest weekend of the spring break travel period.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauari, USA TODAY; Rebecca Heliot, Nolan Clay and Josh Kelly, The Oklahoman; Brian Broom, Mississippi Clarion Ledger", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/severe/2024/02/28/tornado-confirmed-licking-county-jersey-warning-columbus-ohio-nws-franklin-county-london/72771764007/", "title": "5 tornadoes confirmed in Greater Columbus, Dayton areas, NWS says", "text": "The Pittsburgh National Weather Service confirmed that an EF2 tornado struck Malaga Township in Monroe County, bringing the total number of confirmed tornadoes to six in Ohio.\n\nFour of the tornadoes struck central Ohio, including both of the EF2 tornadoes with wind speeds of 111 to 136 mph on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale and two of the three EF1 tornadoes with wind speeds of 86 to 110 mph.\n\nThe first tornado to result from the front, an EF1, struck in Montgomery and Greene counties in southwest Ohio, causing damage at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and in the Springfield area.\n\nAs the front moved from approximately southwest to northeast, the second tornado created was an EF2 that struck Clark County and traveled some 15 miles into Madison County. That tornado was believed by NWS to have caused the heavy damage to buildings and small aircraft at the county airport north of London, but that remained under investigation late Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe third tornado was the second spawned in Madison County from the passing front. The NWS said that EF1 tornado began east of London and dissipated just south of West Jefferson.\n\nA fourth tornado, another EF1 tornado struck the Hilliard area, north of Roberts Road, in Franklin County.\n\nThe fifth tornado struck the Blacklick area of Jefferson Township in eastern Franklin County, with wind or tornado damage reported along Havens Corners Road and North Waggoner Road, with the most severe damage occurring along Dixon Road along the Franklin County-Licking County border.\n\nDozens of trees were knocked over, pulled out by their roots or twisted and snapped off. Some trees landed on top of houses or garage roofs, while others brought down power lines and electrical poles or blocked the roadways.\n\nThe NWS said that tornado weakened to a category EF1 as it moved into western Licking County and places like Jersey, causing significant damage to trees, homes and power lines.\n\nThough tornado warnings remained in effect for Licking County and some surrounding counties as the front moved on, no further tornadoes were reported.\n\n\"We're very lucky\": Historic Madison County Barn flattened\n\nJohn Mitchell and his family heard the tornado at 5:03 am.\n\nThey retreated to the basement for safety. After 15 minutes, they emerged, and Mitchell went out in the truck to survey the damage. He drove out to the historic barn that the family owned since 2000, and first noticed the giant pine tree. As he got closer, he realized the historic barn that was built in 1904 had been completely flattened.\n\n\"I wanted to cry [when I saw it]. I still do,\" said Mitchell. Since purchasing the barn in 2000, they had invested in changing out the sleights on the roof and replacing the foundation every few years, as well as years of repainting and other maintenance.\n\nMitchell said he is unsure if the barn can be rebuilt.\n\n\"How do you replace that?\"\n\nOverall, Mitchell emphasized that he and his family were lucky that there were no injuries.\n\n\"It was like a warzone\"\n\nBob Summers woke up around 5:45 a.m. Wednesday to what sounded like a freight train.\n\nSummers, who lives near Pataskala in Licking County, said when he walked out of his house later that morning, his backyard shed had been destroyed by a tree, and a plastic play set was in his yard.\n\nHis two horses, Toro and Jezebelle, survived the storm unscathed, but they had to settle for hay instead of their usual grain breakfast.\n\n\"I'm thinking they don’t like it when their breakfast is missing,\" he said.\n\nA lot of people didn't like it when they went outside in the daylight and saw the damage in the aftermath of the severe weather that moved through central Ohio Wednesday morning.\n\nSummers' neighbor Dave Coleman went to work before the storm rolled through, thinking his home near Pataskala was likely to escape unscathed. However, the storm had other thoughts, leveling Coleman's garage — which housed a classic car collection and motorcycle — and flipped the garage roof vertically. The roof was mangled and wrapped around a tree.\n\n“The sad part of it, that’s what doesn’t make any sense, we were getting some rain and stuff, a little bit of wind, nothing that amounted to (anything),\" Coleman said.\n\nNearby, residents Barbara Yeager and Tracy Nutt, Yeager’s grandfather, were home when the storm hit.\n\n\"It was like a warzone out here, shingles flying, trees flying,\" Nutt said.\n\nTheir roof shingles were scattered up in trees, under cars and across their yard. A branch also fell on one of their cars, punching the back windshield out and denting the roof.\n\nFurther west, along Dixon Road on the Franklin County-Licking County border, there was heavy damage to some homes from high winds and dozens of damaged or downed trees, especially in a heavily wooded area on the west side of the road just north of a large horse farm.\n\nAt noon Wednesday, crews were still removing downed trees and limbs which had fallen across Dixon Road, which was closed between Havens Corners Road and Clark State Road except to local residents and township and tree crews.\n\nIn one yard along Dixon Road, a large pine tree had been blown over from its roots and another twisted off. Across the road, a tree lay on a garage and a large section of sheet metal was wrapped around something at another property, pointing toward the sky.\n\nThe fresh smell of pine emanated from the tree cuttings.\n\nThere was also significant elsewhere in Jefferson Township, on the eastern side of Franklin County. Between the southern end of Dixon Road at Havens Corners Road and the entrance drive to the Morrison Farms East subdivision, a large tree had fallen on the road and there was a report of a motorist who struck it or was struck by it.\n\nFrom there west along Havens Corners Road toward Gahanna and along North Waggoner Road north from Havens Corners to Clark State Road, there were again dozens of trees either blown down or twisted off.\n\nJust east of Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road on Havens Corners, a large downed tree remained leaning on utility wires. Another large tree lay slain with its root ball exposed near the parking lot at the Jefferson Township Volunteer Fire Department station at the corner of Reynoldsburg-New Albany and Havens Corners Road.\n\nOn Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road, about a quarter-mile south of Havens Corners, a broken off tree lay across a car and a truck in a driveway across from the Jefferson Country Club as a tree crew further south removed downed tree debris.\n\nOn the northwest side of Franklin County near Hilliard, one wall of a garage was blown out at the Oldwynne Road home of Andrew and Carole Essex, who were standing outside their house Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We woke up and went down to the basement. We grabbed the kids and went down,\" said Carole Essex, 29. She and her husband, 32, were there with their two young children — a 2-year-old and a 1-month-old — when the storm hit.\n\n\"It sounded like our house collapsed,\" she said. \"I looked at Andy and said, 'Oh, my God; we were hit by a tornado.'\"\n\nEven further west, the storm leveled a hangar at the Madison County Airport and caused damage to several small planes housed within it. A portion of U.S. 40 in the area of the airport remained closed Wednesday for cleanup operations.\n\nSeveral thousand people lost power as a result of downed power lines or electrical poles being damaged in the storm. AEP Ohio had crews out on Wednesday to help make repairs and power was restored for most customers by Wednesday evening.\n\nHow the National Weather Service confirms if a tornado actually touched down\n\nField crews from the National Weather Service in Wilmington began surveying weather damage Wednesday, concentrating on the Interstate 70 corridor between the Dayton and Columbus metropolitan areas where the storm damage appeared to be concentrated.\n\nThe National Weather Service is asking anyone with damage to contact them.\n\nThe field crews will look at the damage, as well as review the radar movements of the storm, to determine whether the damage was caused by a tornado or strong winds.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that a tornado may have touched down east of London and continued eastward into Franklin County.\n\nHere's how Wednesday morning's storm unfolded\n\nShortly after 5 a.m. Wednesday, tornado sirens across Franklin County were activated because of radar-indicated rotation within a strong thunderstorm moving into the area.\n\nThe storm had crossed through Madison County, in the London and West Jefferson areas, with a debris field indicated on radar as wind speeds increased.\n\nThe tornado warning for Franklin County lasted through 5:45 a.m. and was canceled for Licking and Fairfield counties at 6:15 a.m.\n\nHow rare is a February tornado in Ohio?\n\nDecember and January are the least common months for tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. But by late February, severe weather and tornadoes are \"fairly common.\"\n\nAs climate change pushes Ohio springs earlier and fall later, we might see more of these winter tornadoes.\n\nA history of twisters: Tornadoes in Ohio since 1950\n\nTornadoes are most common during spring and summer, especially April through July.\n\nbbruner@dispatch.com\n\n@bethany_bruner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/23/southeast-waking-up-death-destruction-after-brutal-storms/96939804/", "title": "Sunday was worst January day for tornado deaths since 1969", "text": "Doyle Rice\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe Southeast took stock Monday of the wide swath of destruction wrought by the deadliest January day for tornadoes in 48 years.\n\nWith 16 deaths, Sunday became the USA’s worst January day for tornadoes since Jan. 22, 1969, when 32 people died, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nSuch violently destructive storms are rare for January, and Sunday’s storm was particularly deadly, killing 15 people in Georgia and one in Florida. It was also the deadliest day overall since April 27, 2014. Four other people died Saturday in another tornado in Mississippi.\n\nJanuary 2017 is now the second-deadliest January for tornadoes in the U.S. since accurate records began in 1950. Only January 1969 had more.\n\nSurvey teams were out examining damage Monday to determine how many tornadoes hit Georgia, the length of their path and their strength. The tornadoes and violent storms left dozens injured and destroyed homes, businesses and communities.\n\nPresident Trump pledged to aid Georgia's recovery.\n\n\"I just spoke with Gov. Nathan Deal,” Trump said during a White House ceremony. “Georgia is a great state, great people … The tornadoes were vicious and powerful and strong and they suffered greatly. So we'll be helping out the state of Georgia.”\n\nTrump also expressed condolences for victims of storm damage in surrounding states.\n\nDeal declared a state of emergency Monday for 16 Georgia counties. He added that \"all indications suggest\" a request would be made for federal assistance as well.\n\n“These storms have devastated communities and homes in south central Georgia, and the state is making all resources available,” Deal said. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Georgians suffering from the storm’s impact.\"\n\nAbout 4,700 Georgia residents remained without power as of Monday evening, the state's emergency management agency said in a statement.\n\nThere were 37 preliminary reports of tornadoes from Friday through Sunday, according to Patrick Marsh, warning coordination meteorologist with the prediction center. An average January only sees 21 tornadoes. The all-time record number of January tornadoes is 212, set in 1999.\n\nFortunately, there is no more danger of severe weather or tornadoes anywhere in the U.S. for at least the next several days, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nElsewhere Monday, separate storms were slamming California and the Northeast with heavy rain and snow and howling winds. Flood watches and warnings were in effect from San Francisco to San Diego while high wind watches and warnings were posted in New England and portions of the Mid-Atlantic coast as a potent nor'easter cranked up.\n\nA hurricane-force wind warning was in effect for the waters south of Long Island on Monday, where gusts of up to 74 mph were forecast, the National Weather Service said, calling it \"a dangerous storm for mariners.\"\n\n\"The wind along with the drenching rain and soft soil could knock down trees and power lines, resulting in power outages,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Rathbun said. \"The coastal flood threat will be greatest at times of high tide.\"\n\nFerry service was halted Monday between Cape Cod and Nantucket in Massachusetts as wind gusts to 60 mph were forecast.\n\nSnow was forecast for interior portions of the Northeast, where winter storm warnings were in effect. One to 2 inches of rain was forecast to soak areas from Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C., New York and Boston by Tuesday night, AccuWeather said.\n\nIn the West, yet another storm walloped California on Sunday and Monday, dumping drenching rain along the coast and a couple feet of snow in the mountains. Two to 4 inches of rain fell on coastal Southern California during Sunday alone, which had first responders busy setting up roadblocks, performing swift water rescues, clearing debris and repairing power lines, AccuWeather said.\n\nMammoth Mountain, a ski area in the Sierra, announced Monday that it set a record for its snowiest month on record, according to its website. So far in January, the ski area has picked up over 20 feet of snow \"and it's STILL DUMPING!,\" Mammoth announced proudly on Monday.\n\nAfter some lingering storminess Tuesday, dry weather will settle over much of the western U.S. during the middle and latter part of this week and will linger into early next week, AccuWeather said.\n\nMississippi was also recovering Monday after being slammed Saturday by violent weather. Four people died in the southern part of the state when a tornado left a trail of devastation in and around Hattiesburg.\n\nIn Georgia, eight people were killed in a mobile home park in Cook County, and two people were killed in Brooks and Berrien counties, said Catherine Howden, a spokeswoman for the state's Emergency Management Agency. She said at least 23 people were injured. The numbers could rise.\n\nKaren Moore survived when an apparent tornado destroyed a swath of the Sunshine Acres Mobile Home Park in the Cook County seat of Adel. She said the storm woke her up before dawn Sunday.\n\n\"It sounded like a freight train coming through, and I told my husband that is no train, that is a tornado,\" Moore said. \"There was rubble everywhere. ... It took out five trailers, double-wides, I mean, it just turned them.\"\n\nDebra Buckholts, who lives just outside Adel, said she feared for the safety of her friends in Sunshine Acres. Closed roads, power outages and spotty cellphone service have made it difficult to check on friends and loved ones.\n\n\"Half the trailers aren't there anymore,\" Buckholts said. \"There is nothing left of them.\"\n\n\"The total debris cleanup will be weeks at this point,\" said Lee Smithson, executive director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.\n\nContributing: Tallahassee Democrat; WTLV/WJXX, Jacksonville, Fla.; Hattiesburg (Miss.)

Even outdoors, fumes from a long-running parked car can accumulate and create danger if the air is still. In addition, there's an increased chance of being assaulted by someone or getting hit by a moving vehicle when sleeping in a car.\n\nMore than 1.3 million homes and businesses remained without power Wednesday night across a swath of Texas, battered by once-mighty Hurricane Beryl, which has pushed north and now fuels flood and tornado warnings across much of the nation's northern tier.\n\nFor the last two days, Krest's family has spent hours in line for gas and meals at fast food chains like Chicken Express and Jack in the Box. With no timeline on when they’ll have power again, Krest bought some bug repellent to at least keep the mosquitoes away while they’re trying to get some rest.\n\n“I don’t know what we’re going to do,” she said. “I guess we’ll keep sleeping in the car until the power comes back on.”\n\nBeryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, roared through Jamaica, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines last week, toppling buildings and power lines and killing at least 11 people. In the U.S., Texas took the brunt of Beryl when it stormed ashore early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, prompting closures of the largest ports in Texas, including the port of Corpus Christi.\n\nMillions without power as Beryl, tornadoes threaten central US; 8 dead: Live updates\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott announced Wednesday that 67 counties in the state have been approved for federal disaster assistance as part of a major disaster declaration approved by President Joe Biden. The governor said the declaration allows for reimbursement for up to 75% of costs associated with expenses for debris removal and emergency protective measures.\n\n∎ Besides the over 1.3 million homes and businesses out of power reported in Texas, another 43,000 were going without power in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York as Beryl made its way north.\n\n∎ At a news conference in Matagorda, where Beryl entered Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick commiserated with residents about the stifling conditions, saying: \"When you don't have power, when it's pitch black at night when it's as hot as 80 (degrees) during the day and you don't have access to food you normally have, it's a miserable situation.\"\n\n∎ AccuWeather estimated the total U.S. economic loss from Beryl at between $28 and $32 billion. This figure includes direct damage from the storm, job and wage losses, interruptions of the supply chain and flight delays and cancellations.\n\nBeryl tracker: See path and spaghetti models for post-tropical cyclone, hurricane remnants\n\nRemnants of Beryl spawned tornadoes in Kentucky\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service released preliminary estimates on the strength of two tornadoes that tore through Kentucky on Tuesday as Beryl's remnants moved inland.\n\nA supercell thunderstorm formed in western Kentucky and developed what the weather service described as a \"large and dangerous\" tornado that tracked through parts of Union County and crossed the Ohio River into Indiana.\n\nThe weather service said preliminary data indicates the first of the tornadoes, in Union County, was an EF1. The damage was caused by peak winds of 105 mph but no injuries were reported.\n\nThe storm strengthened after it crossed the Ohio River and caused damage in Mount Vernon, Indiana. The weather service's preliminary data showed EF3 damage at a Kenco facility near Indiana 62. It had winds of 140 mph.\n\nNo injuries were reported in Posey County, but 14 people were displaced from a mobile home park north of Indiana 62. The storm had also ripped off roofs and derailed train cars.\n\nHouston hospitals 'backed up' amid power outages\n\nHospitals in the Houston area were strained by the lack of power, according to Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\n\nThe whole health care system was \"backed up\" after hospitals determined that it was unsafe to discharge patients to homes that didn't have power, Patrick said Wednesday.\n\n\"We had a police officer who was shot in the leg, and when the mayor went down to see him the next day, he still didn't have a room,\" Patrick added. \"That's how urgent it was.\"\n\nIn response, officials have set up a medical shelter at NRG Arena — a stadium in south Houston. The facility will house 250 patients discharged from hospitals.\n\n\"It's in the patient's best interest not to send them to a place that doesn't have power, that they can't keep their medications refrigerated,\" Texas Department of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said Wednesday. \"So that's why we provide this additional facility to be able to ease the burden on those hospitals right now that are overcrowded.\"\n\nThe city was also facing an ambulance shortage, according to Kidd. He noted that ambulances had been waiting in emergency departments to offload patients, with some waiting for \"three-plus hours.\" State officials have sent 25 additional ambulances to the city to assist with 911 calls.\n\nTornado warnings and an apparent hit in western New York\n\nAn apparent tornado left significant structural damage in and near the town of Eden, New York, less than 20 miles south of Buffalo, on Wednesday afternoon as a National Weather Service's office in Buffalo issued a series of tornado warnings for the western part of the state.\n\nMark Poloncarz, county executive for Erie County − where Eden is located − said on the X platform the town is under a state of emergency after the apparent twister damaged several farms and injured animals.\n\n\"Thankfully there are no injuries (to people) but there is significant damage to a number of homes and farms on Rt. 75/Sisson Highway in Eden,'' said Poloncarz, who reposted a video showing dozens of fallen and torn-up trees as well as blown-out roofs in houses and barns.\n\nThe Buffalo office cited \"multiple threats today as the remnants of Beryl bring areas of heavy rainfall with localized flash flooding.\" Liam Healy, a meteorologist with CBS affiliate News 8 WROC in Rochester, posted a chart on social media showing the 18 tornado warnings issued by the office Wednesday are more than double its previous high. The office finally called off the region's tornado watch at 7:30 p.m. ET, but said flooding in Lewis County would continue.\n\nSyracuse University canceled summer classes Wednesday afternoon and encouraged employees to go home because of the approaching severe weather.\n\nRainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, locally higher in some places, were expected across portions of the southern Great Lakes into central and northern New York and northern New England by Thursday, the weather service said.\n\nIn Illinois, the state Emergency Management Agency warned residents and visitors to \"grab the umbrella and pay attention to water levels.\" Some flash flooding could affect areas that don't usually have water, the agency said.\n\nStalled storms bring heavy rains to Midwest\n\nThe march across land helped weaken the once-Category 5 Hurricane Beryl to a post-tropical cyclone, but the storm remained dangerous Wednesday. The National Weather Service issued flood watches and warnings across parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nStalled thunderstorms Tuesday brought weather havoc from Missouri to Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. Rainfall of 2-4 inches was common, and some areas had up to a foot rain, AccuWeather said. Areas in and around Chicago were swamped by heavy rains. In nearby East Chicago, Indiana, Emmett Seymour tried to drive through high water and needed a tow truck to extricate his vehicle.\n\n\"Cars smaller than mine went through the water, so I figured ... I probably could make it through,\" Seymour told the local CBS TV station. \"I underestimated it, I guess.\"\n\nTornado warnings in New York state\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Buffalo, New York, issued its fourth tornado warning in about an hour Wednesday at about 1:45 p.m. ET, all of them for the areas around Buffalo and Rochester in the western part of the state. Other tornadoes are possible in central New York.\n\nThe Buffalo office cited \"multiple threats today as the remnants of Beryl bring areas of heavy rainfall with localized flash flooding.\" Despite the possibility of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, the office said the main threat would be damaging winds.\n\nBeryl's remnants were centered 35 miles southwest of Detroit late Wednesday morning with maximum sustained winds of about 30 mph, moving northeast at 20 mph. Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, locally higher in some places, were expected across portions of the southern Great Lakes into central and northern New York and northern New England by Thursday, the weather service said.\n\nIn Illinois, the state Emergency Management Agency warned residents and visitors to \"grab the umbrella and pay attention to water levels.\" Some flash flooding could affect areas that don't usually have water, the agency said.\n\n'Utter chaos' as families scramble for the basics\n\nOn Monday, the power went out at Kelly Pritchard's home in Summerwood, a neighborhood northeast of Houston. With no running water or air conditioning, Pritchard scrambled and found a one-night stay at a nearby hotel for Tuesday, when heat index levels reached triple digits.\n\nIn the meantime, she provided Facebook updates about the daycare she runs, Children’s Lighthouse, which serves more than 200 families across Houston. “It's really heartbreaking, because I know parents who are so stressed out now at this point because they don't have basics,” said Pritchard, 52.\n\nThe daycare had some minor flooding, and the power outages spoiled hundreds of dollars worth of food, Pritchard said. Driving back and forth from Summerwood to Houston, she has seen packed lines outside fast food restaurants and has been stuck in gridlock traffic, largely because of downed traffic lights.\n\n“It’s utter chaos,” she said.\n\nBiden, Abbott bicker over Beryl response effort\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a major disaster declaration for the damage sustained through Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast. But Biden blamed Texas' state leaders for delaying the federal government's response to Beryl, saying the White House had tried for days to track down Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\n\nPatrick is serving as acting governor while Abbott is on a nine-day economic development trip across Southeast Asia. Biden told The Houston Chronicle his office had tried to contact Abbott and Patrick before it received the state’s major disaster declaration Tuesday, which allowed federal emergency relief supplies to flow into the state.\n\nAbbott said in a statement posted to X on Tuesday that Biden did not call him despite having his number. Abbott also said he’s had daily calls with state and local officials during the storm.\n\nPatrick said in a statement Biden was politicizing the hurricane and that state officials needed to determine what their needs were before making the request. He also dismissed claims he was unreachable.\n\n“He obviously did not know his own employees from FEMA were side-by-side with me for 3 days!” Patrick said.\n\nExtreme heat adds to woes in Texas after Beryl\n\nCompounding the power problem in Texas is a heat wave expected to push temperatures above 100 degrees in some parts of the state. Texas is not alone. On Wednesday, the weather service issued excessive-heat advisories, warnings or watches for more than 130 million Americans.\n\nDespite his row with Texas leaders, Biden said the Federal Emergency Management Agency had generators and other resources on the ground to support the state even before the storm hit.\n\n\"The greatest concern right now is the power outages and extreme heat,\" Biden said in a statement. \"We will provide life-saving and life-sustaining activities, and any other federal resource that Texas needs.\"\n\nBeryl made its first landfall July 1\n\nBeryl developed over the Atlantic Ocean on June 28 and quickly intensified into a powerful hurricane before making landfall on Carriacou Island on Monday, July 1. Beryl grew stronger and gained Category 5 status with winds of 165 mph as it roared across the Caribbean. Beryl began to lose some wind power as it hit Jamaica, then made landfall in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. At least 11 people died on its journey across the Caribbean, AccuWeather reported.\n\nContributing: Ryan Reynolds, Houston Harwood, Jon Webb, Sarah Loesch and MaCabe Brown, Evansville Courier & Press; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/26/tornadoes-severe-weather-live-updates/11542636002/", "title": "Tornadoes severe weather updates: 26 dead in Mississippi, Alabama", "text": "ROLLING FORK, Miss. – Severe storms rumbled across parts of the South on Sunday, two days after violent tornadoes smashed through the Mississippi Delta region — one of the country's poorest areas — gutting rural towns and leaving more than two dozen people dead.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center said \"strong tornadoes and very large hail'' were most likely to hit from central Louisiana across central and southern Mississippi and Alabama through the night.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Jackson, Mississippi, retweeted photos of hail that apparently fell in the state Sunday, some of it nearly the size of a baseball.\n\nSearch and rescue teams worked Sunday through the rubble left by the weekend tornadoes. At least 25 people died in a twister that stayed on the ground in Mississippi for more than an hour Friday night. Houses were torn from foundations, trees were stripped of branches, cars were flipped like toys, and entire blocks were wiped out.\n\nRolling Fork in Sharkey County, about 60 miles northwest of Jackson, was devastated so quickly by the tornado that Mayor Eldridge Walker said the sheriff’s department barely had time alert the community of under 2,000 residents.\n\n“And by the time they initiated the siren, the storm had hit and it tore down the siren,'' Walker said.\n\nRoyce Steed, the emergency manager in Humphreys County, compared the destruction in Silver City to the impact of the deadly 2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\n“It is almost complete devastation,” Steed said. “This little old town, I don’t know what the population is, it is more or less wiped off the map.”\n\nOne man died in Morgan County, Alabama, the sheriff’s department there said.\n\nThe supercell that spawned the deadly Mississippi twister that moved across 170 miles also appeared to produce tornadoes that caused damage in northwest and north-central Alabama, said Brian Squitieri, a severe storms forecaster with Storm Prediction Center. Dozens of people were injured, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported. Hundreds have been displaced.\n\nDEADLY STORMS: Tornadoes rip through Mississippi\n\nDevelopments:\n\n►Pope Francis offered a special prayer Sunday for the people of Mississippi “hit by a devastating tornado” during his weekly noon blessing in Vatican City.\n\n►President Joe Biden early Sunday issued an emergency declaration for Mississippi, making federal funding available to Carroll, Humphreys, Monroe, and Sharkey counties, the areas hardest hit Friday night. Biden called the damage \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n►Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves issued a state of emergency and vowed to help rebuild.\n\n►The Federal Emergency Management Agency said 2,000 homes in Mississippi were damaged or destroyed.\n\nTornadoes, storms pound Georgia, let tigers out of their enclosure\n\nTwo confirmed tornadoes slammed into Georgia on Sunday morning, damaging buildings, closing roads because of downed trees and power lines, and even setting free two tigers from an animal park. Gov. Brian Kemp issued a state of emergency order.\n\nA hospital was among several structures battered by a tornado in Milledgeville,Georgia, according to the police department, which posted a photo of a house crushed by a large tree and asked residents to avoid driving unless it was an emergency. Thousands were left without power in Baldwin County, about 25 miles northeast of Macon.\n\nAbout 120 miles west of Milledgeville, another tornado touched down near Cannonville in Troup County, next to the Alabama border, leaving behind \"significant damage,\" the LaGrange Daily News reported. The storm also brought half-dollar size hail. About 100 buildings were damaged, at least 30 of them uninhabitable, and five people sustained minor injuries, officials said.\n\nTwo tigers escaped their enclosures Sunday at Wild Animal Safari in Pine Mountain after the park sustained extensive tornado damage, the park announced on its Facebook page. The post said the park sustained extensive tornado damage but that no employees or animals were hurt.\n\n\"THE TIGERS ARE SAFE!\" the post said. \"Both have now been found, tranquilized, and safely returned to a secure enclosure.\"\n\nResources, officials arrive as residents are told, 'Help is on the way'\n\nAs recovery efforts got started, state and federal leaders traveled to the Delta region to reassure residents that, in Reeves' words, “Help is on the way.”\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell vowed their agencies' support during an afternoon news conference in Rolling Fork.\n\n“We know that this is going to be a long-term recovery event,” Criswell said. “We can see that one of the major issues we’re going to face is housing.”\n\nMississippi's Emergency Management Agency said it has arranged to get a number of immediate resources to those affected, including bottled water, tarps, portable restrooms, batteries, portable chargers, and fuel for generators.\n\n\"It's been my experience, in times like this, that there is no such thing as politics,\" Reeves said. \"This doesn't have anything to do with politics. All this has to do with is helping our friends and our neighbors.\"\n\nHow you can help\n\nThe Mississippi Department of Public Safety is accepting local donations of bottled water, canned goods, and paper products for the victims of the storms. Here are just some of the other ways you can help:\n\nThe Salvation Army's Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi office said it was delivering supplies in mobile feeding units. The agency is accepting donations here.\n\nThe Red Cross said more than 100 trained disaster workers are on the ground in Mississippi and more help was on the way. To donate, visit redcross.org, call 800-RED-CROSS (800-733-2767), or text REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.\n\nSave the Children’s emergency response teams were mobilizing supplies including water, food, diapers, and hygiene kits for families. You can help fund the effort by donating here.\n\nSouth faces severe conditions with cluster of thunderstorms\n\nTrailing Friday's destructive storms and tornados, the region was under a siege of severe weather on Sunday as a cluster of intense thunderstorms moved over parts of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for central and south Mississippi into the night. The weather service also warned of potential supercell tornadoes developing in Alabama for Sunday night.\n\n\"A locally favorable corridor for supercell tornadoes may be developing over portions of south-central Alabama (near and just south of Montgomery) during the next couple hours,\" the weather service said Sunday.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, hail over the size of golf balls was reported in parts of Alabama and Mississippi on Sunday amid intense thunderstorms. In addition to hail, the weather service in Jackson said parts of Mississippi saw wind gusts between 40 mph and 60 mph.\n\nWhere was the worst tornado damage?\n\nThe system cut its ruinous path late Friday northeastward across Mississippi and Alabama, according to AccuWeather. The National Weather Service confirmed a tornado caused damage about 60 miles northeast of Jackson. The small towns of Rolling Fork in Sharkey County and Silver City in Humphreys County bore the brunt of the damage as the tornado swept through at 70 mph.\n\nThe tornado received a preliminary EF-4 rating, the National Weather Service office in Jackson said late Saturday. An EF-4 tornado has top wind gusts from 166 mph to 200 mph, according to the weather service.\n\nTornadoes were deadliest since 2011\n\nThe tornadoes that struck parts of Mississippi and the Deep South were the deadliest in the state in more than a decade, according to National Weather Service records.\n\nIn April 2011, 31 people died in Mississippi during tornadoes that pummeled several states, mostly in the southeastern U.S., weather service meteorologist Chris Outler said. Alabama was hit hardest during a “super outbreak” of hundreds of twisters that killed more than 320 people and caused an estimated $12 billion in damage.\n\nWhere is Sharkey County?\n\nSharkey County, with a population of 3,600, is located in the Mississippi Delta region. About 71% of the county's population is Black and 27% is white, according to 2021 census data. About 35% of the county's households are in poverty, while the county has a median household income of just under $39,000. The nationwide median household income was $70,784 in 2021.\n\nWhile noting the county's high level of poverty, Mayor Walker said Sunday, \"We’re still resilient. I feel confident that we’re going to come back and build this community back bigger and better for our families.''\n\nWalker also said the storm came down so quickly that the sheriff’s department barely had time to alert the community of 2,000 residents. “And by the time they initiated the siren, the storm had hit and it tore down the siren,'' he said.\n\nThe area is no stranger to great challenges. The backbone of the economy is agriculture. In 2019, the Lower Delta suffered extreme flooding that lasted most of the year and few crops were planted. This left farmers without incomes, farmhands without jobs and little money circulating in the local economy.\n\n– Brian Broom\n\nDiner workers survived by sheltering in refrigerator\n\nThe owners and employees at a Rolling Fork diner survived by sheltering together in the restaurant's walk-in refrigerator. The rest of the restaurant was destroyed, photos show.\n\nThe group of eight people huddled inside the cooler at Chuck's Dairy Bar could feel powerful winds pushing the refrigerator along the ground, owner Tracy Harden told USA TODAY.\n\n“All of a sudden the lights flickered and somebody hollered, ‘Cooler!’” and everyone rushed inside while her husband fought against the wind to close the refrigerator door, Harden said. “Before the door closed, he could see the sky,” she said. “It hit that fast.”\n\n– Claire Thornton\n\nWitnesses recall terror when twisters hit\n\nCornel Knight said he was at a relative's home in Rolling Fork with his wife and daughter, 3, when the tornado struck. “You could see the direction from every transformer that blew” despite the darkened sky, he said.\n\nSheddrick Bell, his partner, and two daughters huddled together in a closet of their home in Rolling Fork for 15 minutes as the storm raced through, listening to howling winds that burst windows as his daughters cried and his partner prayed.\n\n“I was just thinking, ‘If I can still open my eyes and move around, I’m good,’” he said.\n\nNighttime tornadoes more deadly\n\nNighttime tornadoes are twice as likely to be deadly as daytime tornadoes, scientists report.\n\nA 2008 study published by Northern Illinois University professors Walker Ashley and Andrew Krmenec found that nighttime tornadoes made up only 27% of all tornadoes from 1950 to 2005 but were responsible for 39% of all tornado deaths.\n\nOne in 32 nighttime tornadoes results in a death compared with 1 in 64 in the daytime. Some reasons for this are obvious, according to Weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman.\n\nUnless lit by at least somewhat frequent lightning, you may not see a tornado at night, Erdman said. \"One challenge the meteorological and social science communities face is getting the public to take shelter immediately, without first 'confirming the threat' of a tornado by looking outside and wasting precious seconds to reach shelter.\"\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nContributing: Christine Fernando, Claire Thornton, USA TODAY; The (Jackson, Miss.)

After Moscow and Kyiv agree to stop hitting each other's power plants and electric grids, negotiators would move on to a potential halt in fighting on the Black Sea − and then to a full ceasefire and peace agreement in the 3-year-old Ukraine war, a White House statement said.\n\nTrump said on social media the talk ended \"with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine. ...\n\n\"That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of Humanity, get the job done!\"\n\nThe White House said that discussions would begin immediately in the Middle East.\n\nTrump's team has been meeting representatives from Moscow and Kyiv separately to nail down a ceasefire and a framework for a deal to end the war. Trump promised a rapid end to the conflict during the 2024 campaign, but he has has been unable to bring about a resolution so far.\n\nSpecial Envoy Steve Witkoff visited Moscow last week. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The interactions followed in-person talks with top Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia and set the stage for Tuesday's call between Putin and Trump.\n\nThey talked for at least an hour and a half, the White House indicated. Officials declined to say how much longer the leaders spoke.\n\nA readout from the White House provided scant details on what was discussed. A Kremlin statement said Trump proposed a 30-day halt on energy infrastructure attacks and Putin immediately gave his military the order. Russia also said a prisoner exchange would happen Wednesday with each side releasing 175 people. An additional 23 severely injured Ukrainian troops would also be transferred, the Kremlin said.\n\nTrump also backed a Putin proposal for U.S.-Russia hockey matches, according to the Kremlin. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Monday, the president said he intended to lay the groundwork for a peace deal and implore Putin to spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers under siege from Russian forces.\n\n\"We had to get Ukraine to do the right thing. It was not an easy situation,\" Trump said. \"But I think they're doing the right thing right now. And we're trying to get a peace agreement done.\"\n\nLast week the United States restored intelligence sharing with Ukraine and lifted a pause on military assistance, as officials awaited Russia's response to the temporary truce.\n\nUkraine agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire on the condition that Russia also accepted the terms of the agreement. That proposal called for a temporary freeze to the conflict and a halt to an intense aerial battle between the two nations.\n\nDisputed territory could be monitored during that time with satellites, intelligence and drones.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously pushed for a truce to bar the use of missiles, long-range drones and attacks on civilian and energy infrastructure. He also offered to halt attacks on Russian ships.\n\nZelenskyy's government has also pushed for Russia to agree to a prisoner exchange, the release of detained civilians and the return of kidnapped Ukrainian children.\n\nProtecting a Russian 'cash cow'\n\nUkraine backers immediately slammed the scaled-back agreement as one that would primarily benefit Russia.\n\nThe agreement would keep Ukraine from striking Russia's oil refineries, said Edward Fishman, the former Russia sanctions lead at the State Department in the Obama administration..\n\n\"It's a big cash cow for the Kremlin, selling petroleum products like gasoline,\" said Fishman, the author of \"Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.\"\n\nAt the same time, Fishman said, the Ukrainians don't want to be seen as an impediment to a ceasefire. \"They're in a tough spot.\"\n\nPutin was likely to pull back from attacks on energy infrastructure in warmer weather anyway, said Luke Coffey, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute.\n\n\"Recognizing the need to offer something to stay in President Trump’s good graces, he delivered only the bare minimum,\" said Coffey, who was senior adviser Britain's defense ministry.\n\nZelenskyy, on a visit to Finland, said in a Telegram message that Europe must be included in any negotiations.\n\n\"Europe must be at the negotiating table, and everything that concerns European security must be decided together with Europe,\" Zelenskyy wrote.\n\nThe Ukrainian president has long been wary of Putin's willingness to abide by a ceasefire. He said Monday that Russia had already had a week to agree to the terms of the proposed U.S. truce − and that additional pressure is needed to force Putin's hand.\n\n\"It’s clear to everyone in the world – even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years – that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,\" Zelenskyy said. \"He’s saying whatever he wants, but not what the whole world wants to hear.\"\n\n'Talking about land'\n\nU.S. officials have said since the talks began that Ukraine would have to make concessions. They range from territory seized by Russia to its dream of NATO membership and include a battle for control of Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\n\nRussia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and launched a large-scale attack against Ukraine in 2022. It is currently in control of roughly 20% of Ukraine's territory, much of it in the east.\n\nTrump indicated over the weekend that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine has been the topic of early discussion. The plant is under Russian occupation.\n\n\"We'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants because that's a big question, but I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides,\" Trump told reporters Sunday.\n\nUkraine is all but certain to lose out on NATO membership for the foreseeable future, U.S. officials have signaled, and it will have to give up at least some of the territory that Russia seized.\n\n\"The Russians can’t conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it’ll be very difficult for Ukraine in any reasonable time period to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014,\" Rubio said last week. \"So the only solution to this war is diplomacy and getting them to a table where that’s possible.\"\n\nRussia has said that NATO membership, which it has used as a pretext for its war, is a nonstarter. It has also rejected a UK-led proposal to put European peacekeepers in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has said it will not sign a peace agreement without firm security guarantees, citing Russia's history of violating ceasefires.\n\nTrump has abstained from making security guarantees beyond an unsigned critical minerals agreement that would benefit the U.S. financially if private companies invest in Ukraine's natural resources. He has offered his support to a European peacekeeping force without detailing any potential U.S. involvement.\n\nIn its statement after Trump's call with Putin, the White House emphasized his desire to lessen tension with Russia.\n\n\"There is also a broader strategy at play in President Trump’s approach to this war that is informed by the realization that the United States needs to reset relations with Russia,\" said Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington this month.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/03/17/trump-putin-ukraine/82487294007/", "title": "Trump-Putin call will cover Ukraine ceasefire, peace deal", "text": "WASHINGTON − President Donald Trump plans to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine and the contours of a possible peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a call Tuesday.\n\nTrump told reporters late Sunday on Air Force One that he hoped to have something to announce by Tuesday, when he's scheduled to speak with Putin.\n\n\"We'll be talking about land, we'll be talking about power plants, that's a big question. But I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much, by both sides, Ukraine and Russia,\" Trump said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed Monday that a call between the leaders would take place on Tuesday. It is their second known conversation since Trump took office in January.\n\nConversations about bringing the war to a close have quickened over the past several weeks as a succession of Western leaders visited Washington, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nIn an Oval Office meeting last Thursday with Rutte, Trump said \"concepts\" of land and Ukraine's entry into NATO were being discussed.\n\n\"We've been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement. There's a power plant involved, you know, a very big power plant involved. Who's going to get the power plant and who's going to get this and that?\" Trump said.\n\nTrump appeared to be referring to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. It has been under Russian control since 2022.\n\nU.S. negotiators met last week in Saudi Arabia with top aides to Zelenskyy. Ukraine agreed to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire with Russia at the end of the session.\n\nRussia has not accepted the terms of the agreement and has accelerated its attacks on Ukraine. The two countries engaged in an intensive aerial fight over the weekend.\n\nZelenskyy has pushed the U.S. to increase its sanctions on Russia in the interim.\n\n\"We will do everything to further intensify diplomacy. We will do everything to make diplomacy effective. But every day now is about defending our independence, our state, and our people,\" he said Sunday on X. \"We must remember – it is the support of our army, all our defense and security forces, and our state that determines everything.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/955068/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-7-december-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 7 December 2021 | The Week", "text": "1. Booster rollout ‘stuck in first gear’\n\nEngland’s booster programme vaccinated fewer people over the weekend than it did before ministers pledged to put it “on steroids”, it has emerged. The number of third jabs delivered was lower last weekend than it was the previous one, prompting accusations that the programme is “stuck in first gear” as the Omicron variant continues to spread. The Telegraph said there is a “blame game” underway on Whitehall, with sources pointing the finger at the UK Health Security Agency, run by Dr Jenny Harries.\n\nBooster jabs could prevent Omicron deaths, study finds\n\n2. Omicron could halt UK’s recovery\n\nGovernment scientific advisers have suggested that Omicron infections in Britain are doubling every three days. Epidemiologists have warned that the variant of concern is likely to become the dominant strain of the virus in Britain within “weeks rather than months”, The Times said. A further 90 cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total to 336. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned the variant may spread more quickly than its predecessors, adding that it could “knock us off our road to recovery”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

West discussing Russia sanctions\n\nWestern leaders have held talks to agree a package of sanctions against Russia should it invade Ukraine. Boris Johnson joined the leaders of the US, Germany, France and Italy to decide a joint strategy “to impose significant and severe harm on the Russian economy” before Joe Biden’s “high-stakes phone call” with Vladimir Putin today, The Times reported. Possible approaches include cutting off Moscow from the international financial settlement system or restrictions on banks similar to those imposed on Iran.\n\nIs Russia getting ready to invade Ukraine?\n\n4. Cummings warns PM over parties\n\nDominic Cummings has warned that it is “very unwise for No. 10 to lie” about parties that allegedly took place during lockdown last Christmas. After Downing Street insisted that “there was not a party”, the former aide to Boris Johnson tweeted that some political journalists were at the events and so are “trying to bury” the story. Tony Blair’s former spokesperson, Alastair Campbell, tweeted: “If it is true journalists were at the No. 10 party or parties when the country was in lockdown they should be identified and fired.”\n\nDominic Cummings vs. Boris Johnson: the rise and fall of a ‘doomed’ relationship\n\n5. Charles and Harry ‘barely speak’\n\nPrince Charles and Harry have “barely spoken” in months and relations between the pair have reached “an all-time low”, according to the Daily Mail. The Prince of Wales was “deeply shocked and hurt” following Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year, the paper said.

Former diplomat Raphael Marshall said the process of choosing who could get a flight out of Kabul was “arbitrary”, adding that thousands of emails pleading for help were ignored and that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions. He also said the department’s “short-hours culture” meant people were “left to die at the hands of the Taliban”.\n\nWhy the ‘knives are out’ for Dominic Raab over Afghanistan\n\n7. Inflation could exceed 5%\n\nThe Bank of England’s monetary policy chief has said inflation is likely to soar “comfortably” above 5% next spring. Ben Broadbent, the central bank’s deputy governor with responsibility for monetary policy, said the figure will be breached when the energy regulator Ofgem raises a price cap affecting millions of households. Investors currently believe there is less than a 50% chance of the bank raising rates from 0.1% to 0.25% in its meeting later this month.\n\n8. China dismisses US Olympic boycott\n\nBeijing has lashed out at the US government’s diplomatic boycott of next year’s Winter Olympic Games, describing it as “posturing and political manipulation”. After more countries said they would consider joining the protest over China’s human rights abuses, officials claimed that US diplomats had not even been invited to Beijing. The White House confirmed it would not send any official or diplomatic representatives to the event in February citing “the on-going genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang”.\n\nWill other nations join US in accusing China of ‘genocide’ against Uighurs?\n\n9.

The watchdogs are probing Digital World Acquisition Corp — the firm set to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group — and have documents about its investors and trading.

She received 49 of the 97 votes, well ahead of Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. of Spain, who finished second with 28.\n\nIn addition to becoming the first female IOC president, Coventry is also the first person from Africa to hold the role.

I'm so grateful that the members saw more than just gender or where I come from.\"\n\nCoventry, a former Olympic swimmer, will assume the office June 24 and serve an initial eight-year term, with the possibility of serving an additional four years upon re-election. Former German fencer and longtime IOC executive Thomas Bach has had the job since 2013.\n\nCoventry had long been one of the favorites to win Thursdsay, and she was believed to have been Bach's preferred candidate. As a swimmer, she competed at five editions of the Summer Games from 2004 to 2016 and won seven Olympic medals. Along the way, she also swam collegiately in the United States at Auburn and later joined the IOC as a member of the athletes' commission in 2013.\n\nCoventry needed to secure 49 votes on the first ballot to win outright and avoid subsequent rounds of voting, in which the candidate who received the fewest votes in each round would be eliminated.

Seb Coe, the president of the international federation that oversees track and field, placed third with just eight votes.\n\nInternational cycling leader David Lappartient (four votes), International Gymnastics Federation president Morinari Watanabe (four votes), Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan (two votes) and International Ski and Snowboard Federation head Johan Eliasch (two votes) rounded out the pool of candidates.\n\n\"We celebrate Kirsty’s election as president of the IOC and eagerly anticipate collaborating with her as she steers the Olympic Movement into the future,\" U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee chair Gene Sykes said in a statement.\n\n\"As we look forward to a transformative decade of Olympic and Paralympic sport in the United States − welcoming the Games back in 2028 and 2034 − a robust partnership with the IOC will be essential. We are confident that under Kirsty’s leadership, the IOC will provide the stability and support necessary to achieve our shared goals.\"\n\nWith Thursday's win, Coventry ascends to one of the most powerful roles in international sports. The IOC is the wealthiest multi-sport organization in the world, with revenues of more than $7.7 billion in the most recent Olympic cycle, from 2021 to 2024.\n\nThe organization is charged with not just planning and operating the Summer and Winter Olympics but also shaping and guiding the Olympic movement around the world. And, as a result, the IOC president regularly schmoozes with heads of state and at times serves as the de facto leader of the global sports community as a whole.\n\nBach, for example, spearheaded the international sporting community's response to the state-backed Russian doping scandal early in his tenure. He also led the IOC through the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Games to 2021 and required the 2022 Winter Olympics to be held behind closed doors.\n\nCoventry will now face a new − and lengthy − set of challenges, including Russia's possible return to the Olympics following its invasion of Ukraine, the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports and simmering tensions in the anti-doping community between the United States and the World Anti-Doping Agency. She will also have to work closely with the United States, which is is slated to host two of the next five editions of the Olympics.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, Coventry was asked specifically about building a relationship with President Donald Trump, who has threatened to withhold visas for transgender athletes ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Games, even if they are cleared to compete by the IOC.\n\n\"I have been dealing with, let's say, difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old. And first and foremost, what I have learned is that communication will be key,\" Coventry said. \"My firm belief is that President Trump is a huge lover of sports. He will want these Games to be significant, he will want them to be a success.\"\n\nCoventry said she will relocate to Lausanne, Switzerland − where the IOC's headquarters are located − in the coming months and resign from her government role in Zimbabwe. She has served as the country's minister of youth, sport, arts and recreation since 2018, drawing criticism for her role in a government that has been accused of silencing political opposition.\n\nIn a recent op-ed published by Newsweek, a pair of policy experts from the Human Rights Foundation wrote that the IOC's election of Coventry would be \"a victory for the brutal regime she has become the soft face of.\"\n\n\"I chose to want to try and create change from the inside. It gets criticized, and that's OK,\" Coventry said. \"At the end of the day, I don't think you can stand on the sidelines and scream and shout for change. I believe you have to be seated at the table to try to create it.\"\n\nBoxing approved for 2028 Los Angeles Olympics\n\nIn other significant news from Thursday's session, the IOC formally approved the inclusion of boxing in the Olympic program for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nBoxing's place at the Games had been in doubt after the IOC's fight with the International Boxing Association, the international federation that previously ran the sport. The IOC cut ties with the IBA in 2023 due to governance concerns and the organization's growing coziness with Russia.\n\nThe emergence of a new federation, World Boxing, over the past 18 months paved the way for the IOC to welcome the sport back into the Olympic fold.\n\n\"This is a great day for boxers, boxing and everyone connected with our sport at every level across the world,\" World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst said following the decision.\n\n\"This outcome has been achieved by a massive team effort ... and would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all of the national federations, boxers, coaches, officials and boxing leaders that have worked together to enable this to happen.\"\n\nMilan Cortina sliding track on schedule\n\nIOC members also received an update from organizers of next year's Milan-Cortina Winter Games − including news about the Cortina sliding center that is supposed to host bobsled, skeleton and luge events.\n\nMilan-Cortina chief executive officer Andrea Varnier told IOC members that efforts to build and prepare the track are on schedule, and athletes are slated to test it next week. Bach called it \"a clear and encouraging report.\"\n\n\"After these reports today I must tell you we are not nervous anymore,\" Bach said. \"The trust in your capabilities remains and has even been reinforced today. We can look forward to brilliant fantastic Winter Games.\"\n\nOrganizers have been scrambling to build and prep the track ahead of next year's Olympics, and there was so much uncertainty over the timeline that they felt compelled to arrange a Plan B. If the track isn't ready, the sliding events will instead take place in Lake Placid, New York.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2023/10/16/ioc-president-thomas-bach-rewrite-olympic-rules-term/71207323007/", "title": "IOC president Thomas Bach will betray Olympic ideals until he's gone", "text": "Every bit of integrity the International Olympic Committee had is going to be in shreds by the time Thomas Bach walks out the door.\n\nThe IOC’s despot has already debased the Games he so claims to love with his devotion to Vladimir Putin and refusal to do anything while Russia blatantly undercuts the principles of the Olympic movement time and again. Now he’s laying the groundwork to be king for life, like the autocrats he’s cozied up to throughout most of his reign.\n\nUnder the current Olympic charter, which Bach himself helped write, the IOC president can serve a maximum of 12 years. Bach was first elected, to an eight-year term, in September 2013, then re-elected for four more years in 2021.\n\nWhich means his tenure as president should end in September 2025, following the election of a new president.\n\nBut lo and behold, some “concerned” IOC members raised the idea Sunday of Bach staying beyond the term limits. It would require the Olympic charter to be rewritten and for a key anti-corruption measure enacted after the Salt Lake City bid scandal to be removed. But what’s a little banana republic governance when it’s to Bach’s benefit!\n\n“A number of these colleagues think and feel an election campaign, so early before the election, would be disrupting the preparations for the Olympic Games in Paris, which are so important for the entire Olympic movement. They would like to avoid this,” Bach said Monday morning.\n\nThis reasoning, if you can call it that, is nonsensical. Given the Olympics are held every two years, an election is always going to overlap with the preparations for a Games. If IOC members are worried about disrupting the leadup to Paris, what’s to keep them from saying the same ahead of Milan in 2026? Or Los Angeles in 2028? Or Brisbane in 2032? Or … you get the picture.\n\nAnd if the preparations for Paris are so fraught the IOC can’t possibly spare the mental bandwidth for an election, whose fault is that? Last I checked, Bach was the IOC president when Paris was awarded the 2024 Olympics and has been president throughout the entire leadup. If the city isn’t ready, that’s on Bach, and is further reason to move on from him, not keep him around even longer.\n\nThere also hasn’t been a parade of IOC members declaring their wish to be the Olympic governing body’s next president. The only one who’s come close is Sebastian Coe — which probably explains Bach’s willingness to trample on Olympic norms once again.\n\nCoe, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in track and field, became president of World Athletics after running the organizing committee for the wildly successful London Games in 2012. And unlike Bach, he’s been steadfast in holding Russia accountable for its many transgressions against the Olympic movement.\n\nRussia had only one track and field athlete at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics because Coe refused to lift a ban imposed as punishment for the country’s sophisticated, state-sponsored doping program. He was similarly tough in Tokyo, when fewer than a dozen Russian athletes were cleared to compete.\n\nAnd while other international federations have gradually caved to Bach’s wish that “individual neutral athletes” from Russia and Belarus be allowed to return to competition despite the ongoing atrocities in Ukraine, Coe has refused.\n\n“The death and destruction we have seen in Ukraine over the past year, including the deaths of some 185 athletes, have only hardened my resolve on this matter,” Coe said in March.\n\nThe only resolve Bach has shown is to sell out the Olympics at every turn.\n\nImagining and implementing a sophisticated doping program to rig the medal count, as Russia did, goes against everything the Olympics represent. So, too, its blatant defiance of sanctions that were already laughably light. But not for Bach! There’s no sin by Putin and Russia he can’t forgive.\n\nChina has a well-documented history of abusing human rights, and its treatment of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang has been characterized as genocide. The Winter Olympics in Beijing made a mockery of the IOC’s supposed priority of sustainability. To Bach, however, President Xi Jinping and China were ideal partners!\n\nBeing the IOC president is a political job, yes. But it’s also a sacred trust. The Olympics are supposed to represent the best of humanity and remind us what we’re capable of when we strive for greatness and refuse to accept the limitations put on us. The IOC, and its president in particular, have no greater responsibility than to foster and protect that environment.\n\nMaybe Bach believed in that mission once, but his actions since taking office have repeatedly betrayed both the ideals behind the Olympics and the people whose sweat and sacrifice make them so awe-inspiring. He’s done enough damage, and doesn’t deserve the chance to do more.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2016/11/02/donald-trump-presidency-los-angeles-olympic-bid/93205186/", "title": "There is concern a Trump presidency would imperil Los Angeles ...", "text": "Christine Brennan\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nTwenty years after the United States last hosted a Summer Olympic Games, there is great concern within U.S. Olympic circles that a Donald Trump presidency could severely damage the chances of the next U.S. candidate to host the Games.\n\nLos Angeles is competing against Paris and Budapest for the right to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The International Olympic Committee is scheduled to select one of those three cities on Sept. 13, 2017, in Lima, Peru, which makes the next 10 months a particularly crucial time for all three cities trying to line up enough international support to win the Games.\n\nWhy an LPGA sex symbol turned down Donald Trump, and what she thinks about him now\n\nNo city vying for the Olympics ever wants controversy attached to its bid, and that’s particularly the case for a U.S. city, which always receives increased scrutiny simply because the United States is the Olympic world’s greatest super power athletically, corporately and financially.\n\nA Trump presidency would make it very difficult for Los Angeles to try to win over IOC voters from Islamic and Latin countries, as well as female IOC members, four people involved with U.S. Olympic efforts told USA TODAY Sports. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThey based their assessment on Trump’s comments during the campaign about Muslims, Mexicans, immigrants and women, as well as his boast caught on videotape that he can sexually assault women.\n\nOne person said that a Trump victory on Election Day next Tuesday would be an 8½ to 9 on a 10-point “catastrophe” scale for L.A.’s chances. Another referred to it as “the ultimate disaster movie.”\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee tried to shelter its 2024 bid city from the nation’s political headwinds by purposely avoiding Washington, D.C., a perennial favorite, in favor initially of Boston, then L.A.\n\nUSGA must move Women's Open from Trump National\n\nIf Trump were elected, the officials said they would do their best to distance L.A. and the state of California from his presidency, focusing the IOC on the strong likelihood that California will have voted overwhelmingly in favor of Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, were powerful proponents of Atlanta’s successful bid for the 1996 Olympic Games, which they attended during Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIn August at the Rio Olympics, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was asked about the impact of Trump and the election on L.A.’s bid.\n\n\"An America that turns inward, like any country that turns inward, isn't good for world peace, isn't good for progress, isn't good for all of us,” he said. “But the America that I saw in 1984, where the face of the world was on the sidewalks of my city, is something that can inspire a nation, not just a city.”\n\nLos Angeles is believed to have a strong chance to win the 2024 Games. The city has been a very successful host of the Olympics twice before, in 1932 and 1984.\n\nThe last Summer Olympics held in the United States were the 1996 Games in Atlanta.

Over in one corner of the foyer sits Richard Carrion, deep in discussion with a fellow member. A few tables away, Ng Ser Miang chats with a colleague over a cup of tea.\n\nAll in the same room, three leading contenders all quietly engaged in the so-far unofficial campaign for perhaps the most powerful job in world sports: president of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nJust don't say out loud that that the race is on.\n\nWith the election nine months away, the campaign to succeed Jacques Rogge is forging ahead behind the scenes without fanfare, policy platforms, debates — or any declared candidates for that matter.\n\nRogge, the Belgian surgeon who has led the Olympic body since 2001, steps down at the end of his term in September 2013. Although no one yet speaks openly about replacing him, the list of potential contenders is an open secret in IOC circles.\n\nSome members are still sounding out their chances, while a few others look certain to run.\n\nThe deadline for declaration of candidacies is not until June, three months before the vote in Buenos Aires on Sept. 10. Candidates are likely to wait until closer to the date before announcing their intentions, thereby avoiding the impression of being too hasty or undercutting the outgoing president.\n\n\"It's little by little coming out in the open,\" Gerhard Heiberg, a senior IOC member from Norway who is not in the running, told The Associated Press. \"It's still too early, but people are preparing for what's going to happen. I think that's good. It's an open field with many possible candidates and that's what we want.\"\n\nHeading the prospective field are Bach, Carrion and Ng. All three were in Lausanne this month for IOC meetings, and they were hard to miss. While Bach and Ng are vice presidents who sit on the ruling executive board, Carrion is no longer a board member and must make an extra effort from outside the inner circle.\n\nAfter the Lausanne meetings, all three men also made the trip to Israel for the 70th birthday celebrations of IOC member Alex Gilady.\n\nBach, a German lawyer and former Olympic fencer, shapes up as the favorite. He ticks several boxes: He's from Europe, the dominant bloc in the IOC. Of the IOC's eight presidents since 1894, only one — Avery Brundage of the United States — came from outside Europe.\n\nThe 58-year-old Bach has been on the executive board — as a regular member or vice president — since 1996. He's a former Olympic athlete, having won the team foil gold medal at the 1976 Montreal Games. As chairman of the IOC juridical commission, he leads most of the investigations into doping cases. He's president of the German Olympic Sports Confederation.\n\nCarrion, chairman of Puerto Rico's largest bank, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, has made his mark as a money man. Head of the IOC's finance and audit commissions, he led the negotiations that secured the record $4.38 billion deal with NBC for U.S. TV rights through 2020. Carrion, 60, also oversees the IOC's financial reserves, which have grown to more than $550 million from $105 million in 2001.\n\nIf Carrion has a drawback, it's that he doesn't have a strong sporting background like Bach.\n\nNg, a 63-year-old member from Singapore, is seen as the candidate from Asia, a continent with growing influence on the world stage. Ng is best known for having led the organizing committee for the inaugural Youth Olympics — Rogge's pet project — in Singapore in 2010. Whether he can marshal the full backing of Asian members remains key to his chances.\n\nBritish bookmakers are even listing odds on the race — with Bach the even-money favorite with Ladbrokes, followed by Carrion at 2-1 and Ng at 6-4.\n\nThere are a handful of others in the frame.\n\nNawal El Moutawakel, the Moroccan who won a gold medal in the women's 400-meter hurdles at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, confirmed recently that she was thinking about a possible run. She was elevated to the IOC vice presidency in July and holds a high-profile position as head of the coordination commission for the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAnother woman, longtime U.S. member and former IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, is a possible candidate. The former rower, who chairs the women and sports commission, ran for IOC president in 2001, but was eliminated in the first round. DeFrantz has failed in several attempts to return to the executive board since then.\n\nTwo Swiss members, Rene Fasel and Denis Oswald, are also weighing their options. Fasel is president of the International Ice Hockey Federation and led the IOC oversight panel for the 2010 Vancouver Games. Oswald, the former longtime head of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations, chaired the IOC commissions for the 2004 Athens and 2012 London Games.\n\n\"There are a few colleagues who are trying to convince me to run,\" Oswald told The Associated Press. \"I haven't decided yet. I will have to assess the situation and my chances. I will make a decision in a few months, probably.\"\n\nIn the end, a field of four or five candidates would seem likely.\n\n\"Nobody is talking openly and declaring any firm intention but it's always pretty much the same names floating around,\" Oswald said. \"I have the feeling that more than one (are) in the situation where they don't know yet and still wait to see how it develops and talk with some people.\"\n\nRogge was elected to an initial eight-year term and was re-elected unopposed to a final four-year mandate in 2009. The succession battle is developing as the 70-year-old Rogge, coming off recent hip replacement surgery, looks his age — a far cry from the sturdy and youthful man who took over 12 years go.\n\nMembers believe the election campaign should not overshadow the remainder of his presidency.\n\n\"Jacques Rogge is still the president and should not be disturbed by candidates going out openly at this stage,\" Heiberg said. \"I hope the longer it takes before that starts, the better. The closer we get to the day for the voting, the better.\"\n\nHolding off before declaring a candidacy can have strategic advantages. Once members become official candidates, they are covered by tight ethics rules that restrict election campaigning.\n\nUnder rules drawn up the ethics commission, candidates must limit their travel to promote their campaign. So, until then, members can still benefit from traveling to meetings or conferences where they can approach colleagues and privately discuss the election.\n\nThe ethics code also prohibits candidates from using social media to promote themselves and bars them from organizing any public meetings or taking part in any debate. The intention is to \"prevent any excesses\" and conduct the campaign with \"dignity and moderation.\"\n\n\"In a way I think it's not a political election,\" Oswald said. \"It shouldn't be at least. We know each other pretty well. I don't think we need to have a campaign the American way. The president who is able to have the best financial support is the one who is going to be able to win pretty much. It's good that we don't have something similar.\"\n\nRogge, meanwhile, has pledged to remain neutral in the race. The idea of grooming a successor or endorsing a candidate has never been an issue.\n\n\"It's certainly our president's attitude in general not to show any preference,\" Oswald said. \"We have to respect that. I'm pretty sure he won't give any instruction or show any specific support to anyone.\"\n\nFor now, the instruction is simple: Shhhh! The campaign has yet to begin.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2013/08/06/bach-says-doping-scandal-wont-hurt-his-ioc-hopes/2625753/", "title": "Bach says doping scandal won't hurt his IOC hopes", "text": "AP\n\nThomas Bach is a candidate for president of the International Olympic Committee\n\nHe says revelations about a doping scandal in Germany in the 1970s will not hurt his chances\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Thomas Bach believes the revelations of a government-backed doping program in West Germany in the 1970s will not hurt his chances to become the next president of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nBach, an IOC vice president who heads Germany's national Olympic body, said he was personally behind the study that was published Monday and revealed a culture of doping among West German athletes for decades.\n\nThe report, an embarrassment to German sport, comes less than a month before Bach contests the election to succeed Jacques Rogge as IOC president.\n\n\"My IOC colleagues know that I myself initiated the study,\" Bach told the German dpa news agency on Tuesday. \"They've known my zero-tolerance policy on doping since decades, especially as chairman of various disciplinary commissions.

Dpa said the researchers have the right to publish names but appear to fear legal consequences if they do.\n\nDagmar Freitag, chairwoman of the sports committee of the German parliament, said the full report should have been published and that its abridged version raised more \"questions than it gave answers.\"\n\nAt the same time, an article in Der Spiegel news magazine says members of the 1966 World Cup team tested positive for traces of an amphetamine. West Germany lost the final 4-2 to host England.\n\n\"We have to call a spade a spade,\" said Clemens Prokop, president of the German athletics federation.\n\nSpeaking in Munich, Prokop said that was the only way to remove West German athletes from blanket doping suspicion.\n\nBavarian justice minister Beate Merk called for an anti-doping law because sports federations were unable to \"systematically clear up and punish\" doping.\n\n\"We have to act, we have to uncover, not cover up ... we need an anti-doping law worthy of its name,\" Merk said.\n\nThe report also mentions a letter from FIFA's medical officer at the time of the 1966 World Cup, Dr. Mihailo Andrejevic, to the president of the German athletics federation.

The weeklong meetings will have the flavor of a political carnival replete with last-minute campaigning, backstage vote-chasing and round-the-clock lobbying by spin doctors, consultants and strategists.\n\nWhile most IOC members are primarily interested in the Sept. 10 presidential election, the first big vote comes on Sept. 7 with a secret ballot on the 2020 host city.\n\nIt's a three-way contest between Tokyo, Madrid and Istanbul.\n\nAll three are repeat candidates: Istanbul is making its fifth overall bid, Madrid a third straight attempt and Tokyo a second try in a row.\n\nTokyo has been seen as a slight front-runner, though the leak of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant is causing concern. Madrid — once counted out because of Spain's economic crisis — has picked up momentum recently and now looks like a legitimate challenger. Istanbul has slipped following the anti-government protests and doping scandals in Turkey and the escalating war in neighboring Syria.\n\nWith each bid facing political, economic or other drawbacks, the winner could be determined not for its positive attributes but for having fewer weaknesses than its rivals.\n\n\"There's no obvious choice,\" senior Canadian IOC member Dick Pound told The Associated Press. \"Where do you go? None of the three is risk free. Probably somebody ends up backing into it this time.\"\n\nEach city offers a different narrative. Istanbul would bring the games to a new part of the world, to a predominantly Muslim country for the first time, to a city linking Europe and Asia. Madrid has most of the venues ready and would spend the least. Tokyo offers safety and reliability at a time of global uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, the decision could center on which city offers the least risk. After taking gambles by sending the 2014 Winter Games to Sochi, Russia, and 2016 Olympics to Rio de Janeiro, some members feel it's time to opt for certainty. Delays in Rio are causing serious concerns and the IOC is eager to avoid more headaches.\n\n\"We're looking for the city which we can look toward to be the most secure option at this stage, given global uncertainties and the fact that we're entering into a new era with a new presidency,\" longtime Australian IOC member Kevan Gosper said. \"We're looking for a safe pair of hands.\"\n\nThat sentiment works in favor of Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964 and has repeatedly played up its case as being the \"safe\" choice. Tokyo also received the best overall review in an IOC technical report this summer.\n\n\"Of course we know how serious the Japanese are and we know they would deliver what they propose for sure,\" Swiss IOC member and presidential candidate Denis Oswald said.\n\nThe last few days and hours of the campaign could be vital. The final presentations on the day of the decision could swing a few votes that decide the outcome. Leading the bid delegations will be prime ministers Shinzo Abe of Japan, Mariano Rajoy of Spain and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.\n\nWith a majority required for victory, the city with the fewest votes from the 100-or-so members is eliminated after each round. In this case, the vote is expected to go the maximum two rounds.\n\n\"I think the ultimate choice will be a matter of a difference of two, three votes, not more than that,\" Rogge said.\n\nMembers often vote for personal, sentimental or geographical reasons. Some will still be undecided when they get to Buenos Aires.\n\n\"IOC members vote with their hearts, not with their heads,\" veteran Norwegian member Gerhard Heiberg said. \"They will look at the presentations and vote right there and then, not thinking that this is seven years ahead. That could decide who will take the gold medal.\"\n\nTokyo also can benefit from the sentimental factor of using the Olympics to help rebuild the nation's spirits after the 2011 tsunami and earthquake. Yet, it's the fallout from the disaster that is now posing the bid with its biggest challenge — the leak of radiation-tainted water into the Pacific from the crippled plant.\n\n\"Japan has got to recover from the real effects and perceived effects of the biggest nuclear meltdown since Chernobyl,\" Pound said. \"That's not chopped liver.\"\n\nMadrid's bid has been hindered by the economic meltdown in Spain, which has been mired in recession for most of the past four years and has a 26.3 percent unemployment rate. In addition, Rajoy has been embroiled in a party financing scandal, and Spain's record on doping and handling of the Operation Puerto case have dogged the bid.\n\nBut Madrid, and a speech by Crown Prince Felipe, made the biggest impact in presentations to IOC members in Lausanne, Switzerland, in early July. The Spaniards hammered home this point: The games pose no economic risk, 80 percent of the venues are ready, the construction budget will be only $1.9 billion ($10 billion less than Istanbul's).\n\nThe message resonates at a time when the Olympics are being criticized for being too expensive— the price tag for construction in Sochi is more than $50 billion. Madrid's strong showing in the 2012 and 2016 races also underlines its capability of securing votes.\n\nOnce seen as a favorite because of its compelling story line, Istanbul — which bid previously for the 2000, '04, '08 and '12 Olympics — has been scrambling to keep in contention after a tumultuous summer in Turkey.\n\nImages beamed around the world of police using force on anti-government protesters in the heart of Istanbul in June rocked the bid. More than 30 Turkish track and field and other athletes were suspended for doping. FIFA complained of empty seats at the Under-20 World Cup in Turkey. Civil war continues to rage in Syria, with Western countries now weighing military action in response to suspected chemical weapons attacks.\n\nThree days after choosing the host city, the IOC will pick a leader who will lead the organization through the 2020 Games for a term of eight years — and a potential second term of four years. Rogge is stepping down after completing 12 years in the job.\n\nMaking up the record six-man field are IOC vice president Bach of Germany; vice president Ng Ser Miang of Singapore; finance commission chairman Richard Carrion of Puerto Rico; executive board members Sergei Bubka of Ukraine and C.K. Wu of Taiwan; and former board member Oswald.\n\nIt shapes up as a three-man race, with Bach the favorite and Carrion and Ng the challengers.\n\nBach, a 59-year-old lawyer, has long been viewed as the man to beat. He ticks the most boxes: former Olympic athlete and gold medalist (team fencing in 1976), long-serving member on the policy-making board, chairman of the legal commission, head of anti-doping investigations, negotiator of European TV rights, president of Germany's national Olympic committee.\n\n\"If you were handicapping, you'd have him in front, but whether it's by a nose or a neck or open water, I don't know,\" Pound said.\n\nThe voting process is the same as for the bid cities.\n\nSome of Bach's supporters believe he could win in the first round. If not, things could get trickier, as it's not clear where the votes will go in the next rounds. Wu and Bubka appear to be the most vulnerable of going out first.\n\nIf Bach is elected, he would continue Europe's hold on the presidency. Of the IOC's eight leaders, all have come from Europe except for Avery Brundage, the American who ran the committee from 1952-72.\n\nBach brushes off the pressure of being the front-runner and exudes confidence heading into the final days.\n\n\"I take this campaign like I prepared for a big competition as an athlete,\" he told the AP. \"You know how important good training is, that it's very helpful if your test events are going well. This can give you confidence. But, on the other hand, all that does not count when it comes to the grand final. That is the same for Sept. 10. You want to see the competition taking place. I'm really looking forward to this day.\"\n\nWrestling, meanwhile, looks set to end its seven-month limbo and win back its place in the 2020 Games. The vote will take place on Sept. 8, with squash and a combined baseball-softball bid also vying for the single spot on the program.\n\nWrestling, featured in every Olympics except for 1900, was dropped from the list of core sports by the IOC executive board in February, a stunning decision that provoked an international outcry. The United States joined with unlikely allies Russia and Iran in fighting to save the sport.\n\nWrestling governing body FILA responded quickly, replacing Raphael Martinetti as president and electing Nenad Lalovic, adding two new weight classes for women and enacting rule changes to make the sport more fan-friendly. In May, wrestling easily made it onto the shortlist for inclusion in 2020.\n\n\"I have no doubt it will happen,\" Oswald said. \"It was such a mistake. It has to be corrected.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2013/09/03/ioc-human-rights-issues-bid-cities/2760625/", "title": "IOC is asked to consider human rights in selecting host", "text": "Kelly Whiteside\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nIOC will select 2020 host city at meetings in Buenos Aires\n\nPride House has compiled resource guide for IOC voters\n\nGroup says IOC has potential to promote positive change in the world\n\nBUENOS AIRES -- Given the backlash over Russia's anti-gay legislation heading into February's Winter Olympics in Sochi, the International Olympic Committee is being asked to consider human rights issues as much as it considers venues and finances when awarding future Games.\n\n\"Beijing set a pretty high bar in terms of human rights abuses and Russia is giving them a run for their money,\" Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, told USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday.\"Our message well before the human rights catastrophes of Sochi has been you cannot have a successful Olympics where you have major human rights abuses.\"\n\nAs the IOC begins meetings today in this Argentine capital dubbed \"the City of Tango,\" it too will engage in a dance full of passion and power. By the time the 125th IOC session closes next week, a new president will be elected and either Madrid, Tokyo or Istanbul will be awarded the 2020 Summer Games.\n\nWith this backdrop, as well as the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, gay rights groups in 33 cities in 21 countries had plans Tuesday to participate in a \"Global Speak Out\" against Russia's anti-gay laws. Andre Banks, executive director of All Out, called the event \"one of the largest global demonstrations for gay rights and human rights in history.\"\n\nAdvocate group Athlete Ally has urged the 101 IOC members to choose Madrid, the most friendly of the 2020 candidates to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, to \"make sure the Sochi Games never happen again.\"\n\nAccording to a recent Pew Research Center survey about whether homosexuality should be accepted or rejected by society, 88% of those polled in Spain said it should be accepted. In Turkey, 78% said it should be rejected. In Japan, 54% agreed with acceptance. The survey of 39 countries with 37,653 respondents was released in June.\n\nPride House International has put together a resource guide for IOC voters on the three countries with links to reports from Human Rights Watch, the U.S. State Department and the United Nations.\n\n\"We're not telling voters in Buenos Aires who they should vote for, but we want to remind them that their own charter declares that sport is a human right and that sport must be free from discrimination,\" said Lou Englefield, director of Pride Sports UK and coordinator of Pride House International. \"The IOC has huge potential for promoting positive change in the world.\"\n\nWhen criticized for not forcefully speaking out against human rights issues in China, Russia and Brazil (the 2016 Olympic host is Rio de Janeiro), IOC leaders have repeatedly said they rely on \"quiet diplomacy,\" reminding their critics that they are a sports organization, not a government or political body.\n\nLast month Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists asked the six IOC presidential candidates for their views on various rights issues, including the anti-gay laws in Russia. In response, the IOC sent a letter on behalf of the candidates.\n\n\"Whilst we clearly expect any Olympic Games, regardless of their location and including the next edition in Sochi, to take place without any form of discrimination, it is important to stress that the IOC's remit is limited to the scope of the Games,\" the IOC wrote. \"For instance, the IOC cannot influence national legislation and has to respect the law of any host country.\"\n\nThe 2020 host city will be selected Saturday. Madrid may be the choice for LBGT rights advocates and Tokyo may be the most stable economic and political choice, but recent Olympics have been awarded to cities that have never hosted before. The 2016 Summer Games in Rio will be the first Olympics in South America.

Kennedy, making potentially tens of thousands of pages of unredacted records available to the public for the first time.\n\nThe release of the files comes after Trump signed a day one executive order in January aimed at fully releasing government documents related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother and presidential candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe contents of the documents, and whether any previously unreleased information is in them, wasn't immediately clear. Historians quickly said they would need time to assess the flood of files to understand if they were significantly different from previous releases.\n\nSo far, nothing in the documents has changed the long-held findings that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 while the then-president rode in a motorcade in Dallas.\n\nRead the JFK files\n\nLooking to read the JFK files yourself? You can find them on the National Archives' website here.\n\nMost of the files are scans of documents, and some are blurred or have become faint or difficult to read in the decades since Kennedy's assassination. There are also photographs and sounds recordings, mostly from the 1960s.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nReport from Russia: Oswald was a lousy shot\n\nOne document dated Nov. 20, 1991 appears to be a teletype of U.S. intelligence reporting on Lee Harvey Oswald, his time in the Soviet Union, his stormy relationship with his Soviet wife – and his apparently poor marksmanship.\n\nThe document says that a KGB official named Nikonov reviewed files from the feared Soviet security service, the KGB, to determine if Oswald “had been a KGB agent.”\n\nReuters reported that the document cited a report from an American professor named E.B. Smith who reported he had talked in Moscow about Oswald with KGB official “Slava” Nikonov, who said he had reviewed five thick files about the assassin to determine if he had been a KGB agent.\n\n“Nikonov is now confident that Oswald was at no time an agent controlled by the KGB,” the document says.\n\nFrom the description of Oswald in the files, Nikonov “doubted that anyone could control Oswald, but noted that the KBG (sic) watched him closely and constantly while he was in the USSR.”\n\nNikonov also commented that Oswald had “a stormy relationship with his Soviet wife, who rode him incessantly/”\n\nThe KGB files “also reflected that Oswald was a poor shot when he tried target firing in the USSR,” the document said.\n\nSome conspiracy theorists have latched onto bits and pieces of the CIA’s files on Oswald, including those about his erratic behavior, as proof he either didn’t act alone – or didn’t actually have anything to do with Kennedy’s assassination.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nIs that really true?! Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter for all answers.\n\nDocuments touch on Lee Harvey Oswald theories\n\nSome of the documents also include references to various conspiracy theories suggesting that Oswald left the Soviet Union in 1962 intent on assassinating the popular young president.\n\nDepartment of Defense documents from 1963 covered the Cold War of the early 1960s and the U.S. involvement in Latin America, trying to thwart Cuban leader Fidel Castro's support of communist forces in other countries.\n\nThe documents suggest that Castro would not go so far as to provoke a war with the United States or escalate to the point \"that would seriously and immediately endanger the Castro regime.\"\n\n\"It appears more likely that Castro might intensify his support of subversive forces in Latin America,\" the document reads.\n\n– Reuters\n\nWhat did experts initially say about the JFK files?\n\nJames Johnston, author of \"Murder, Inc.: The CIA under John F. Kennedy\" told USA TODAY that he wasn’t expecting any bombshells, given that virtually all of the relevant agencies – including the CIA – had promised to turn over everything they had years ago to the National Archives in 1988.\n\n“If it was going to embarrass the agency or tell a different story, they wouldn't have turned them over to the National Archives in the first place,” said Johnston, who was a staff member of the congressional Church Committee that investigated the CIA in 1975. “And if they were withholding them before, I’m guessing they would continue to withhold them.”\n\nJohnston cited one particular document that he knows exists but that he says hasn’t been turned over to the National Archives – the first one-on-one conversation between President Lyndon Johnson and CIA Director John McCone right after Johnson took office after Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nMcCone was long suspected of withholding information from the Warren Commission, the panel Johnson created to investigate Kennedy’s murder, according to Philip Shenon, author of “A Cruel and Shocking Act: The Secret History of the Kennedy Assassination.”\n\nMcCone was kept on as CIA director by Johnson and pledged full cooperation with the commission, which was led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, Shenon wrote in a 2015 Politico article about his book’s findings. He testified that the CIA had no evidence to suggest that Oswald was part of any conspiracy, foreign or domestic, but rather a former Marine and self-proclaimed Marxist who acted as a delusional lone wolf.\n\nThat depiction of Oswald was ultimately adopted by the Warren Commission in its final report. But years later, Shenon said, the CIA itself acknowledged that McCone had withheld information from commission investigators.\n\nWhat is the Warren Commission?\n\nSeveral of the documents released Tuesday are tied to the Warren Commission: But what is it?\n\nAfter Kennedy was shot in 1963, his successor Lyndon B. Johnson created a commission to investigate the assassination. The Warren Commission determined that Oswald, who was arrested and later shot by a nightclub owner on live television, acted alone.\n\nStill, the assassination has fueled intense debate and a myriad of theories challenging the conclusion of the Warren Commission. Polls have shown that many Americans believe Kennedy’s death was part of a wider conspiracy.\n\n– Christopher Cann\n\nPart of Trump’s promise of ‘maximum transparency’ at the nation’s intelligence agencies\n\nTrump himself did not immediately post about the document release. But Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of National Intelligence, hailed their release, saying it was part of Trump’s promise for “maximum transparency and a commitment to rebuild the trust of the American people in the Intelligence Community (IC) and federal agencies.”\n\nCritics have long accused the intelligence community, and CIA in particular, of withholding potentially revelatory information about the case. Still, intelligence officials over the years have insisted that they have released everything important and that what’s left was withheld only to protect highly classified sources and methods of gathering intelligence and protecting sources.\n\nIn a statement, Gabbard said that she immediately sent out a directive across the intelligence community after Trump’s Monday announcement ordering everyone to provide all unredacted records within the collection of documents about Kennedy's assassination the national archives for immediate release.\n\nJFK file experts said those documents almost certainly have all been made public and viewed already, but with mostly minor redactions.\n\nNot all documents posted online Tuesday night\n\nThe documents were released just before 7 p.m.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration, the keeper of the documents, posted them with this statement:\n\n“In accordance with President Donald Trump’s directive of March 17, 2025, all records previously withheld for classification that are part of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released.”\n\nThe National Archives said it partnered with agencies across the federal government to comply with the President’s directive in support of Executive Order 14176. It said the records are available to access either online or in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats, at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland.\n\n“As the records continue to be digitized, they will be posted to this page,” the National Archives said, suggesting that not all of the documents were being released on Tuesday in digital form.\n\nThe National Archives also said some information might still be withheld under court seal or for grand jury secrecy, and because some tax return information is subject to Internal Revenue Code prohibitions.\n\n'People have been waiting for decades for this'\n\nThe digital document dump came one day after Trump announced the files would be released during a visit to the John F. Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts, which he's taken over as board chairman.\n\n\"People have been waiting for decades for this,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading,” Trump added. “I don't believe we're going to redact anything.”\n\nThe CIA and Federal Bureau of Investigation, which were involved in JFK assassination investigations and in the document release, had no immediate comment.\n\n'An encouraging start'\n\nJFK assassination scholar Jefferson Morley said in a statement late Tuesday night that the release of the first tranche of documents “is an encouraging start.”\n\n“We now have complete versions of approximately a third of the redacted JFK documents held by the National Archives,” or 1,124 of approximately 3,500 documents, said Morley, vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a non-profit that promotes access to historical government documents\n\nHe is also author of the JFK Facts newsletter and three books on the CIA that portray the agency’s involvement in the events leading up to the assassination.\n\n“Seven of ten JFK files held by the Archives and sought by JFK researchers are now in the public record,” Morley said. “These long-secret records shed new light on JFK’s mistrust of the CIA, the Castro assassination plots, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and CIA propaganda operations involving Oswald.”\n\nBut the release does not include two thirds of the promised files, or any of 500-plus IRS records or 2,400 recently discovered FBI files, Morley said.\n\n“Nonetheless,” he said, “this is most positive news on the declassification of JFK files since the 1990s.\"\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nA mad Justice Department scramble to meet Trump’s deadline\n\nTrump’s order reportedly set off a scramble within the Justice Department’s National Security Division to meet Trump's deadline, according to ABC News and Reuters.\n\nIn an email just before 5 p.m. ET Monday, a senior official within DOJ's Office of Intelligence said that even though the FBI had already conducted \"an initial declassification review\" of the documents, \"all\" of the attorneys in the operations section now had to provide \"a second set of eyes\" to help with this \"urgent NSD-wide project.,” ABC News reported Tuesday.\n\nThe process of releasing the files was set in motion on Trump’s first day in office on Jan. 20, when he signed an executive order aimed at fully releasing all government documents related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother and presidential candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nA new FBI tranche of 2,400 JFK records\n\nLast month, the FBI said it found some 2,400 new records linked to Kennedy's assassination as well.\n\nThe agency said it was in the process of passing the documents to the National Archives and Records Administration. It's unclear what revelations, if any, are contained in the newly discovered files.\n\nKennedy’s assassination has long been the subject of conspiracies after Oswald, the Marine veteran identified as Kennedy's assassin, was shot and killed days later.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's Health and Human Services secretary, has called for release of the files to see if any U.S. officials were involved in the assassination or potential coverup. Several U.S. investigations had found no such evidence.\n\nWhile millions of government records related to the Kennedy assassination have been previously released, some information remains classified and redacted. Trump said he instructed his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, to oversee the release of the remaining files.\n\nA federal law passed in 1992 required the Kennedy assassination records to be fully released by Oct. 26, 2017 unless the president at the time determined their release would cause \"identifiable harm\" to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations of such gravity that it \"outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\"\n\nTrump was president when the 2017 deadline arrived. He ordered the release of nearly 2,900 records, but kept others secret because of concerns by the CIA and FBI that their release could hurt national security.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden acted in 2021, 2022 and 2023 to give agencies more time to review the records.\n\nThe documents released in 2017 included details on the FBI and CIA investigations into Oswald and information on covert Cold War operations.\n\nJosh Meyer is USA TODAY's Domestic Security Correspondent.

Historians have said they would need time to assess the flood of files to understand if they significantly differed from previous releases.\n\nWhy did Trump release files on the JFK assassination?\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 23 to release government documents related to the assassinations of Kennedy, as well as Kennedy's brother and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth,\" the order states. \"It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay.\"\n\n\"A lot of people are waiting for this... for years, for decades,\" Trump said when signing the order, adding: \"And everything will be revealed.\"\n\nJFK's speech at the University of Michigan and the Peace Corps\n\nAccording to the University of Michigan, on Oct. 14, 1960, Sen. John F. Kennedy, who was running for president at the time, gave an unprepared campaign speech to students on the steps of Michigan Union.\n\nIn the speech he challenged students to devote a few years of their life to working in developing countries.\n\nAfter the speech, 1,000 University of Michigan students signed a petition calling for the establishment of the Peace Corps program.\n\nToday, the U.S. government agency sends volunteers to international communities to address local concerns. The organization has sent more than 240,000 volunteers across 60 countries since it was established in 1961.\n\nKennedy's limousine on display at the Henry Ford\n\nThe presidential limousine in which Kennedy was riding when assassin Lee Harvey Oswald murdered him in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn. The limousine was refurbished and used by presidents into the 1970s.\n\nAfter its assembly at Ford’s Lincoln plant in Wixom in 1961, the limousine was sent to Hess & Eisenhardt, specialty vehicle manufacturers in Cincinnati, Ohio, which customized and modified it. The car had no armor plating or bullet-proof glass because, at the time, the emphasis was on visibility, not protection. During customization, the car was also extended 3½ feet in length and painted a deep metallic blue.\n\nAfter Kennedy's death, President Lyndon B. Johnson had the car be painted a traditional black.\n\nPresidents Johnson and Richard Nixon used the vehicle as a parade vehicle, while Presidents Ford and Jimmy Carter kept it as a backup vehicle. The limousine was finally retired in 1977.\n\nWatch coverage of Kennedy's assassination\n\nYou can watch 32 hours of CBS television coverage of the Kennedy assassination on YouTube via David Von Pain's JFK Channel.\n\nCBS also maintains a web page with clips from the day of the shooting, as well as stories and documentaries.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/19"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/crime/958891/why-have-the-jfk-assassination-files-been-kept-secret-for-so-long", "title": "Why have the JFK assassination files been kept secret for so long ...", "text": "Thousands of classified documents relating to the assassination of John F.

Of primary concern is that still-living intelligence and law-enforcement informants from the 1960s and 1970s could be at risk of intimidation or even violence if they were publicly identified.\n\nSo will they be released in full and on time?\n\nLast year Biden ordered a review into the remaining files, issuing a memo delaying the documents’ release until this month unless federal agencies persuaded him to give them even more time.\n\nHis administration “is now facing a federal lawsuit from a New York-based lawyer who discovered that the CIA, FBI, DEA and other agencies are hell-bent on keeping the files secret”, said the Daily Mail, “lending more credence to the incredulity of conspiracy theorists with each passing year”.\n\nIf Biden makes the documents public on 15 December, as promised, “he would have broad bipartisan and bicoastal support”, said NBC News.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2,000 US voters conducted by the Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi, seven out of ten want the president to honour his commitment made last year and release the final trove of JFK assassination records in full.\n\nHalf of voters believe the assassination involved multiple conspirators while 38% said Oswald was the lone gunman, the poll showed.\n\n“There’s not a lot that unites a lot of American voters these days, but one of the few things that does is to see President Biden release the long-overdue JFK files as he promised,” said Amandi.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans", "Catherine Garcia", "Amrita Gill", "Harold Maass"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/20/jfk-files-social-security-trump/82567111007/", "title": "Their Social Security info was released in JFK files. One plans to sue", "text": "WASHINGTON – In its zeal to release unredacted secret documents from the government’s JFK assassination files, the Trump administration has made public the Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information of potentially hundreds of former congressional staffers and other people.\n\nAt least one of them, USA TODAY learned Thursday, plans to take legal action.\n\n“I intend to sue the National Archives,” said Joseph diGenova, a former top Justice Department official and Trump campaign lawyer. “They violated the Privacy Act.”\n\nDiGenova, the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C. during the Reagan administration, said the information about him that was made public stemmed from his involvement with the Church Committee in the 1970s, which investigated misdeeds by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nUnder the Privacy Act of 1974, federal agencies are generally prohibited from disclosing records without the written consent of the individual, especially in cases where it reveals sensitive information.\n\nAnother former Church Committee staffer, James Johnston, told USA TODAY his personal information, including Social Security number, was made public in the files released by the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nThe Archives posted thousands of pages of newly unredacted government files on the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Tuesday evening, a day after President Donald Trump told the media they would be released.\n\nBut it is virtually impossible to tell the scope of the breach because the National Archives put them online without a way to search them by keyword, some JFK files experts and victims of the information release told USA TODAY.\n\n“Your Administration doxxed former public servants who staffed 1977-79 congressional investigation by revealing their SSNs. Many are still alive. Completely unnecessary & contributed nothing to JFK assassination understanding,” said Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who has represented current and former spies and other officials in cases against the government.\n\n“I trust you will provide them free credit monitoring,” Zaid said in one of several posts on X.\n\nZaid told USA TODAY the he “saw a few names I know and I informed them of the breach.” The disclosures were not limited to staffers on the Church Committee but included other congressional investigative bodies that touched on the Kennedy assassination, including the House intelligence committee.\n\n“Hundreds were doxxed but of that number I don't know how many are still living,” Zaid said in an email. For example, he said, former Democratic Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee “is on the list but she obviously passed away.”\n\nZaid said the Chief Counsel and Staff Director of that committee was also doxed, but USA TODAY is not using his name because he is still alive and was unavailable for comment.\n\nZaid, who has fought for decades for the JFK records to be made public, said many of the thousands of investigative documents had been made public long ago with everything declassified and unredacted except for the personal information.\n\nReleasing that information now, he told USA TODAY, poses significant threats to those whose information is now public, including dates and places of birth, but especially their Social Security numbers.\n\n\"The purpose of the release was to inform the public about the JFK assassination, not to help permit identity theft of those who actually investigated the events of that day,” Zaid said. “This decision was completely avoidable and either reflects intention or incompetence.\"\n\nUSA TODAY is reaching out to other people whose names and private information were contained in the files for comment. The Justice Department and National Archives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n‘Sloppy and unprofessional’\n\nIn all, the National Archives released more than 60,000 pages related to Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nMany if not most of those pages had been previously disclosed, but with redactions that had been whittled down by various reviews and public declassifications over the years, including by the Biden administration.\n\nDespite Trump’s order, Trump administration officials acknowledged that only a portion of them were posted online on the National Archives webpage under the headline “JFK Assassination Records — 2025 Documents Release.” More are expected to be posted later, officials said.\n\nFear of threats and identity theft\n\nDiGenova, a former top Justice Department official, has for years been a staunch and very public defender of Trump. As a result, he said the breach might result in physical threats against him, and financial theft. He said some threats in the past have been serious enough to require him to report them to the FBI.\n\n“I can tell you that the whatever the review process was, it did not include notifying people who were alive and whose personal identifiable information was included for release, which is a violation of the law,” diGenova said. “And so the people physically doing the review process at the National Archives and the FBI were sloppy and unprofessional.”\n\nDiGenova was part of the November 2020 legal team tapped by Trump to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election he lost to Joe Biden. He told USA TODAY that he doesn’t blame Trump for the breach, even if the president did order the files to be unredacted and released on what seemed to be an impossible timeline.\n\nLawyer: 'not Trump's fault'\n\nMost of the tens of thousands of files were already in the government’s possession, but with sensitive information like Social Security numbers – and the names of confidential CIA assets – blacked out for security reasons.\n\n“This is not President Trump's fault. This was the fault of the people responsible for reviewing the records,” diGenova said. “Your job as a reviewer is to get it right. They got it wrong.”\n\nAll they had to so is say, ‘Mr. President, we need more time. There’s a lot of personally identifiable information in here,” diGenova said. “And if they just said, ‘What the hell, let’s just throw all this out there, then that's another reason they should all be sued.”\n\nJosh Meyer is USA TODAY's Domestic Security Correspondent.

What to know about JFK ...", "text": "President Donald Trump's administration began the process of releasing more than 60,000 previously classified files on the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Tuesday, some of which have not previously been seen by the public.\n\nThe National Archives began posting documents to its website Tuesday and will continue to do so in the coming days. Historians have yet to uncover any exceptionally new or bombshell information that changes our fundamental understanding of the events, but are still sorting through the wealth of scanned paper files, photos and audio recordings.\n\nThe release was part of a day-one executive order issued by Trump to declassify government documents related to the assassination of JFK, his brother Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nBut what does declassifying information entail? Can Trump declassify anything he wants? And how does information become classified in the first place? Here's what to understand about classification and declassification amid the buzz around the JFK files.\n\nRead what was in JFK docs: Trump releases classified JFK files on assassination. Here's what they say.\n\nHow does information become classified?\n\nInformation becomes \"classified\" when it's determined by the government to be sensitive, especially if its release could pose a threat to national security. Usually, this refers to documents and data that are stored by certain government agencies and contain such information that cannot be made available to the public or unauthorized parties.\n\nAlso often called \"classified national security information,\" information can only be classified if \"an official determination is made that its unauthorized release would damage national security,\" according to the National Archives. While paper documents are the most common source of classified information, photographs, maps, motion pictures, videotapes, databases, microfilms, hard drives, CDs and more can be classified.\n\nA group of specially trained government officials called Original Classification Authorities (OCA) exist to determine what is considered classified and assign the classification level. However, most classifications are made by \"derivative classifiers,\" or simply put, a normal government employee authorized to classify documents. This can be done via employees consulting guidelines for appropriate classification or when an employee is creating a new document by pulling information from an existing classified one, in which class the classification carries forward, according to Justsecurity.org.\n\nThe levels of classification are determined by the extent of supposed damage that could be done were the information improperly released.\n\nThe three levels are Confidential, Secret and Top Secret, according to the archive. Information that could cause \"exceptionally grave damage to the national security\" gets \"Top Secret,\" the highest level of protection. Information that could cause \"serious damage\" is \"Secret,\" and \"Confidential\" is the lowest level of risk and therefore classification.\n\nHow does information become declassified?\n\nInformation can be declassified through several avenues, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Automatic declassification occurs after a period of time has passed as determined by the original classifying authority. Records that are 25 years old or older and have been determined to have permanent historical value are subject to automatic declassification unless they fall under an exemption.\n\nInformation can also be declassified when it no longer meets the standards for classification under Executive Order 13526, which established the current protocol in 2009. This can happen due to simple things like the passage of time, changes in circumstance or improper categorization.\n\nPublic interest declassification is much less common but occurs when \"public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the national security.\" The Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB) advises the President of the United States regarding issues of national classification and declassification policy.\n\nThis form of declassification is complex and has explicit procedures and standards for who can do what. It can be done via executive orders, such as the \"Declassification Reviews of Certain Documents Concerning the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001\" signed by former President Joe Biden on Sept. 3, 2021.\n\nWas any new information declassified in the JFK documents?\n\nWhile Trump’s administration touted that the released documents would include a treasure trove of unredacted records available to the public for the first time, nothing thus far has changed our fundamental understanding of the events.\n\nConspiracy theories of government involvement and unknown accomplices have swirled in the decades since the assassination. The declassified information has not changed the long-held findings that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy thus far, however.\n\nMuch of what had not yet been seen by the public was the result of redactions that were removed in the new release. Some have said this was done \"sloppily,\" leading to at least one pending lawsuit after the Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information of potentially hundreds of former congressional staffers were also released with the documents.\n\nJames Johnston, author of \"Murder, Inc.: The CIA under John F. Kennedy,\" previously told USA TODAY he didn't expect any bombshells. It's likewise worth noting that all agencies involved promised to turn over all documents they had to the National Archives in 1988.\n\n\"If it was going to embarrass the (CIA) or tell a different story, they wouldn't have turned them over to the National Archives in the first place,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Josh Meyer, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2025/02/23/release-jack-smiths-findings-in-trump-classified-documents-case/78955045007/", "title": "Release Jack Smith's findings in Trump classified documents case", "text": "Dirk Q. Allen\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nColor me \"surprised\" that some deep-pocketed private citizen or organization hasn’t sued the Department of Justice to get the report by Special Prosecutor Jack Smith on the Donald Trump classified documents case in Florida released to the public.\n\nHundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars were spent on the probe − don’t taxpayers have a right to see the report? It might even fall under the purview of the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe case was one of four indictments leveled against Trump during the Biden administration − some call it \"lawfare,\" others call it \"holding Trump to account for illegal behavior\" − and certainly the easiest to follow.\n\nThe indictment resulted from what most observers could see with their own eyes in the wake of an Aug. 30, 2022, FBI raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The former president had dozens of documents on-site, had kept the documents, apparently hid the documents, and failed to return the documents. His attorney even added the line “as far as I know” to an earlier affidavit she signed guaranteeing that Trump had returned all of the documents − because she didn’t want to get disbarred for potentially lying on a sworn statement.\n\nTrump’s response to the indictment was, “I had every right to have those documents.” He has insisted that the Presidential Records Act protected his possession of the documents.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWell, did it? We’ll never know at this point − in July of 2024, the case was thrown out by Federal District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, who ruled that Smith’s appointment as a special prosecutor was unconstitutional.\n\nThat would be news to the late President Richard Nixon, because it was his decision to fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox − the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of Oct. 20, 1973 − that blew up the Watergate obstruction case and started the road to his August 1974 resignation.\n\nWhile Smith appealed Cannon’s ruling, the case became a moot point when Trump was re-elected president. The appeal was withdrawn as Smith prepared to resign − but should the documents report Smith was required to prepare be hidden from public view?\n\nThe simple question is: What did he find out? News organizations today − and historians 100 years from now writing about this tumultuous period − would no doubt like to access Smith’s findings.\n\nTrump objected to its release, presumably because he felt it would injure his reputation. But does he really have a reputation to injure? Half the country likes him, and half the country does not. That’s not likely to change based on Smith’s documents report.\n\nWhen there was some question about how a jury would deal with the classified documents in the case, I actually sent Judge Cannon a letter suggesting she could simplify the matter by “stipulating” as to the documents so that jurors would not actually have to see them. I didn’t realize that Judge Cannon had so little interest in actually adjudicating the case. She subsequently ordered Smith’s report buried in January 2025.\n\nThere are two intriguing legal questions in this matter that are still hanging fire: Is it unconstitutional for the DOJ to appoint a special prosecutor? And does the Presidential Records Act actually protect presidents who leave office with classified documents?\n\nThose questions won’t get resolved now − but Smith’s report on the matter truly deserves to see the light of day.\n\nDirk Q.

Kennedy will be released to the public this week on the order of President Trump.\n\nThe documents — expected to be released by Thursday — will likely contain multiple references to the activities of assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City, where he traveled in September 1963, just two months before he shot and killed Kennedy in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nThose documents, said Kennedy assassination expert and author Gerald Posner, could be embarrassing to prominent Mexicans, who may have provided information to the CIA and other U.S. agencies in the days before and after the assassination.\n\n“There may not be deep, dark secrets in there, but the release could be embarrassing to people who were involved,\" said Posner, author of the 1993 book Case Closed, which determined that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy. \"You have to remember that Mexico City in the 1960s was a hodge-podge of intrigue where everyone was spying on everyone else.\n\n\"There may be people who were informing to the CIA at the time who have moved on to careers in politics and business, and the revelation that they were informing will be embarrassing to them,\" Posner said.\n\nThe documents, contained in more than 3,000 files, were to be released automatically by Oct. 26 under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 unless Trump decided to stop them. Each file could contain hundreds of individual documents.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted that he would allow the release of the documents. \"Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nOdd alliance for disclosure\n\nRoger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant, political consultant and author, told conspiracy theorist Alex Jones last week that he urged Trump to release the documents and that CIA Director Mike Pompeo \"has been lobbying the president furiously not to release these documents.\"\n\nPosner and Stone, who have different conclusions about who killed Kennedy and why, have joined together for public events in recent weeks arguing for the release of the documents.\n\nAlthough the files contain information that is decades old, their release could still potentially compromise the sources and methods used by intelligence agencies.\n\nKennedy's assassination rocked the nation, and Lyndon Johnson, the new president, created a special commission led by Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren to investigate the killing. The Warren Commission concluded in 1964 that Oswald acted alone.\n\nHowever, multiple aspects of the assassination have fueled conspiracy theories for more than 50 years. They include:\n\n• Oswald's murder on Nov. 24, 1963, by nightclub owner Jack Ruby led to speculation that Ruby targeted Oswald as part of a larger plot.\n\n• The revelations in the 1970s about the various attempts by the Kennedy administration — led by the president's brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy — to kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro spurred theories that Castro had President Kennedy killed before Kennedy could kill Castro.\n\n• A former Marine sharpshooter, Oswald had defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 and returned in 1962. Some conspiracy theories speculated that Soviet leaders may have recruited Oswald, who met his wife, Marina, while he lived in Minsk.\n\n• Oswald passed around leaflets in New Orleans, his hometown, in support of the pro-Castro \"Fair Play for Cuba Committee\" in August 1963.\n\n• Oswald traveled in Mexico City in September 1963, where he met with officials at that city's Cuban embassy as he tried to get a visa to travel to Cuba and then to the Soviet Union. Documents related to this period are part of the new trove set to be released this week, Posner said.\n\n• The Kennedy administration attempted to recruit members of the Mafia to kill Castro, leading to theories that the Mafia was somehow involved in the Kennedy assassination.\n\nThe Church Committee\n\nIn 1975 and 1976, a Senate investigation led by then-senator Frank Church, D-Idaho, revealed abuses by the CIA and FBI and many of the details of plots to kill Castro. A House investigation report in 1979 concluded that Kennedy was probably killed as the result of a conspiracy.\n\nIf Trump allows the documents to be released, they will be free of any redactions, so readers will be able to see them as they were originally written. That, Posner said, is one reason that those named in them have reasons for concern.\n\nAlso, Posner said, there will be news about issues unrelated to the assassination itself.\n\n\"All of those will cause a flash of excitement,\" he said. \"For one thing, there’s supposedly a handwritten letter by Jackie Kennedy about the (JFK) funeral. There’s a letter from (former FBI Director J. Edgar) Hoover that’s been closed for all these years. There’s the testimony of (former CIA counterintelligence chief) James Jesus Angleton from the 1970s before the Church Committee.\"\n\nPosner cautioned that the National Archives' computer servers may be frozen by the huge amount of interest in the new documents. That raises the potential for more conspiracy theories, as tidbits of information flood the Internet without the proper context.\n\nBy the time more accurate analyses of the documents are done, Posner said, false stories will spread before the truth can catch up to them.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump to allow release of thousands of JFK files by National Archives\n\nTrump breaks bread with former foe Ted Cruz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/florida/2025/03/19/trump-kennedy-assassination-files-florida-space-center-bunker-peanut-island-jack-ruby/82516747007/", "title": "Trump released JFK files.

Kennedy was the first sitting president to visit Tampa, Florida\n\nKennedy made history on Nov. 18, 1963, by being the first sitting president to visit Tampa, Florida. It was his last travel destination before being shot during a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, just four days later.\n\nThe former president landed at MacDill Air Force Base. Upon arrival, he was welcomed by then-Tampa Mayor Nick Nuccio, U.S. Rep. Sam Gibbons and U.S. Sen. George Smathers, Axios reported.\n\nWhile in Tampa, Kennedy spoke at Al Lopez Field, the International Inn, and Fort Homer W. Hesterly Armory. He then drove along Franklin Street, Dale Mabry Highway and Grand Central Avenue, which was renamed Kennedy Boulevard after he was assassinated.\n\nFlight schools on Florida's Atlantic coast\n\nFlying runs in the Kennedy family.\n\nIn 1944, Kennedy underwent 10 days of flight training at an Embry‑Riddle seaplane base in Miami, Florida, during World War II, according to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\nOver 50 years later, his son, John F. Kennedy Jr., used the alias John Cole while in Vero Beach, Florida, as a licensed student pilot at the former FlightSafety Academy at the Vero Beach Regional Airport in December 1997. John-John obtained his private pilot's license from there on April 22, 1998, according to Federal Aviation Administration data.\n\nFlying on the Treasure Coast: John F. Kennedy Jr. was Vero Beach flight school student and CJ Cannon's regular in 1990s\n\nKennedy family homes in Palm Beach, Florida\n\nThe Kennedy family spent the majority of the 20th century vacationing in Palm Beach County, Florida.\n\nWhile in Florida, Kennedy wrote “Profiles in Courage” and much of his 1961 inaugural address, as staff members hunkered down for days at the Palm Beach Towers and The Colony Hotel to plan the new Kennedy administration.\n\nIn 1961, the Secret Service and a contingent of Navy Seabees secretly built a bomb shelter on Palm Beach County's Peanut Island for JFK in case of nuclear war. Kennedy is said to have visited the bunker twice.\n\nKennedy Palm Beach history: 60 years later, JFK's memory lives in Palm Beach\n\nNASA’s Kennedy Space Center near Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\nKennedy was a champion of U.S. space exploration in the 1960s as America raced against the Soviet Union.\n\n“First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth,” Kennedy said during a joint session of Congress on May 25, 1961.\n\nOn March 7, 1962, The Launch Operations Center was established as an independent NASA field center on Merritt Island, Florida, according to NASA.\n\nIt was renamed Kennedy Space Center on Nov. 29, 1963, five days after the assassination, by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nOn July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission, which launched from Cape Kennedy, Florida, which is now known as Cape Canaveral.\n\nWhy did Donald Trump release JFK assassination documents?\n\nOne of the executive orders Trump signed on his first day in office in January 2025 aimed at fully releasing government documents related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy; his brother and presidential candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-New York; and civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWhile millions of government records related to the Kennedy assassination have been previously released, some information remains classified and redacted. Trump said he instructed his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, to oversee the release of the remaining files.\n\nWhy haven't JFK assassination files been released before?\n\nKennedy's assassination records were required to be fully released by Oct. 26, 2017, per a federal law passed in 1992. However, records could be withheld if the sitting president determined the release would cause identifiable harm to:\n\nMilitary defense\n\nIntelligence operations\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nConduct of foreign relations\n\nOutweighing the public interest in disclosure\n\nIn 2017, Trump ordered the release of nearly 2,900 records, but kept others secret because of concerns from the CIA and FBI that their release could hurt national security. From 2021 to 2023, former President Joe Biden acted to give agencies more time to review the records.\n\nWhere can I find JFK assassination files?\n\nThe assassination records can be found on the National Archives website.

Kennedy was fatally shot and long after official inquiries ended, thousands of pages of investigative documents remain withheld from public view. The contents of these files are partially known — and intriguing — and conspiracy buffs are not the only ones seeking to open them for a closer look.\n\nSome serious researchers believe the off-limits files could shed valuable new light on nagging mysteries of the assassination — including what U.S. intelligence agencies knew about accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald before Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nIt turns out that several hundred of the still-classified pages concern a deceased CIA agent, George Joannides, whose activities just before the assassination and, fascinatingly, during a government investigation years later, have tantalized researchers for years.\n\n\"This is not about conspiracy, this is about transparency,\" said Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post reporter and author embroiled in a decade-long lawsuit against the CIA, seeking release of the closed documents. \"I think the CIA should obey the law. I don't think most people think that's a crazy idea.\"\n\nMorley's effort has been joined by others, including G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel for a House investigation into the JFK assassination in the 1970s. But so far, the Joannides files and thousands more pages primarily from the CIA remain off-limits at a National Archives center in College Park, Md.\n\nOthers say the continued sealing of 50-year-old documents raises needless questions in the public's mind and encourages conspiracy theories.\n\n\"There is no question that in various ways the CIA obfuscated, but it may be they were covering up operations that were justifiable, benign CIA operations that had absolutely nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination,\" said Anthony Summers, a British author whose sequel to his JFK book Not In Your Lifetime will be released this year.\n\n\"But after 50 years, there is no reason that I can think of why such operations should still be concealed,\" Summers said. \"By withholding Joannides material, the agency continues to encourage the public to believe they're covering up something more sinister.\"\n\nTo understand the attention to the Joannides files, it's necessary to go back to 1963 and to review what's known about Oswald that put him on the CIA's radar.\n\nIt's also important to recall the differing conclusions of the two official investigations of the JFK killing — one denying any conspiracy, the other suspecting one — and how much or how little cooperation investigators received from CIA officials, including Joannides himself.\n\n___\n\nOswald was a loner and an enigma even to those closest to him. He was \"as difficult to understand as anyone I've studied in 35 years as a professional historian,\" said David Kaiser, whose 2008 book, The Road To Dallas: The Assassination of John F. Kennedy, drew on tens of thousands of documents released in the 1990s.\n\nStill, plenty was learned about Oswald after the shooting in Dallas. And, it's now clear, he was not unknown to the U.S. government before that.\n\nAssassination investigators learned that Oswald had formed a group in New Orleans in the summer of 1963 that ostensibly supported Cuban leader Fidel Castro (Oswald was the only local member) and had been involved in a street altercation with anti-Castro demonstrators that was captured by a local television station.\n\nPamphlets Oswald had in his possession bore an address of a local anti-Castro operation connected to a former FBI agent with ties to organized crime, investigators discovered. That and other information has led researchers to believe that Oswald may have been part of a counterintelligence operation to discredit the group he had joined, the Fair Play For Cuba Committee, and that the street scene was a setup.\n\nIf so, who would have overseen such an operation?\n\nDeclassified documents show that Joannides, while based in Miami, was the CIA case officer for the anti-Castro Student Revolutionary Directorate (DRE), the group involved in the street fracas with Oswald.\n\nWhat did this all add up to, if anything? Official investigations of the Kennedy assassination were not able to provide complete answers.\n\nThe Warren Commission, which concluded in 1964 that Oswald acted alone and was not part of a conspiracy, was never told about the CIA's possibly relevant anti-Castro activities, despite the fact that former CIA director Allen Dulles was a Warren Commission member.\n\nWarren Commission staff counsel Burt Griffin, now a retired judge, calls it \"an act of bad faith\" by the CIA.\n\n\"I think they had an obligation to tell the chief justice (Earl Warren, commission chairman) about that, and then that decision would have been his and the commission's to make,\" Griffin said.\n\nIn separate interviews with the Associated Press, Griffin and fellow staff counsel David Slawson stood by the Warren Commission's conclusions.\n\nEach pointed to a series of personal rejections behind Oswald's deadly action: Weeks after he made an unsuccessful attempt in Mexico City to get a visa to Cuba, his wife Marina rejected his attempts to reconcile their rocky marriage. It was during Oswald's visit, the night before the shooting, to the suburban Dallas home where his wife and two young daughters were staying that he packed up his disassembled Mannlicher-Carcano rifle to take to work the next day, the Warren Commission determined. That next morning, he removed his wedding ring, left his money with his wife, and departed to carry out the assassination.\n\n\"If she had taken him back,\" Slawson said, \"he wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nMore complex and sinister theories about his motivation have been offered, of course, some flowing from the release in the 1990s of previously classified documents.\n\nKaiser, the historian, has postulated that Oswald, long seen as a devout leftist, was in fact being manipulated by right-wing and mob elements in his final months and that his visit to the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City in the fall of 1963 was part of an attempt to reach Cuba and kill Castro. Release of documents held by those governments could be revealing, Kaiser said.\n\nBy the time the House Select Committee on Assassinations convened in the mid-1970s to probe the Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. killings, other congressional investigations had exposed the CIA's activities in the early 1960s, including plots to assassinate Castro.\n\nThose revelations would be overshadowed, however, by the House committee's JFK conclusion: That sound impulses recorded on the microphone of a Dallas police officer amounted to evidence of a shot from the infamous \"grassy knoll\" in Dealey Plaza, and thus of an additional gunman besides Oswald firing from a building window.\n\nKennedy, the committee's final report said in carefully tempered language, was \"probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy. The committee is unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy.\"\n\nSubsequent analyses have cast doubt on the acoustic evidence, and the issue is considered unresolved.\n\nThat evidence was, of course, only part of the mountains of material considered by the committee, some of it from the CIA. And the CIA's liaison to the committee was none other than George Joannides, by then retired from the agency.\n\nBlakey, the committee's chief counsel, recalled how the CIA brought in Joannides to act as a middleman to help fill requests for documents made by committee researchers. \"He was put in a position to edit everything we were given before it was given to us,\" Blakey said.\n\nBut Blakey didn't learn about Joannides' past until Morley unearthed it in files declassified years later.\n\n\"If I'd known Joannides was the case officer for the DRE, he couldn't have been liaison; he would have been a witness,\" Blakey told AP.\n\nBlakey added: \"Do I think I was snookered, precisely like the Warren Commission was? Yes.\"\n\n___\n\nWhich brings us back to the still-secret investigative files — about 300 pages of which relate to Joannides.\n\nFirst, some background:\n\nCertain files held by the Warren Commission and House Select Committee were originally ordered sealed, for privacy, security and other considerations, well into the 21st century.\n\nDecades passed before public pressure spurred by Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK changed that.\n\nCongress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which established the Assassination Records Review Board, or ARRB, to carry out release of records related to the assassination. As a result, about five million pages of documents have been released and are available for review at the National Archives and Records Administration in Maryland.\n\nBut the review board agreed to withhold about 1,100 records — each record comprises 1-20 pages — that are considered to contain information about confidential sources or methods or have national security implications.\n\nThe JFK Act required all records to be released by 2017, but it left some wiggle room for agencies to petition to have records withheld if disclosure would compromise \"military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations.\"\n\nIt is unknown whether the CIA will try to keep some documents classified past 2017; if it does, that may only increase Morley's resolve.\n\n\"You have to wonder what is so important in a 50-year-old document,\" he said. \"I've come to the conclusion that they're guarding something big, and that has stiffened my determination.\"\n\nA CIA spokesman, Ned Price, said the agency has complied with the law in releasing documents and the archives center \"has all of the Agency's documents and files on the Kennedy assassination. Price didn't comment on the Joannides material specifically, citing Morley's lawsuit.\n\n\"The classified information contained in the files remains subject to the declassification provisions of the Act,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the documents sit in metal boxes on shelves in \"a big room that's temperature- and humidity-controlled,\" said Martha Murphy, the Archives' chief of special access and Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nAmong those are the Joannides files. An index created by the CIA and provided to the Associated Press by Morley describes many of the files as containing information on Joannides' travel, training and personnel evaluations as well as memos pertaining to the CIA's interactions with the House Select Committee on Assassinations.\n\nMorley's interest dates to the 1990s when he covered the newly-formed ARRB. He filed suit for the Joannides documents in 2003 and has pried loose several hundred pages since then.\n\nA federal judge dismissed the case in 2010. But in June, a federal appeals court overruled a lower court that had denied Morley's request to be reimbursed for attorneys' fees. \"Records about individuals allegedly involved in President Kennedy's assassination serve a public benefit,\" the decision said.\n\nMorley does not suggest the Joannides files point to agency involvement in the assassination itself, but more likely that their release would show the CIA trying to keep secret its own flawed performance before the assassination.\n\n\"The idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was some unknown quantity to CIA officers was false,\" Morley said. \"There was this incredible high-level attention to Oswald on the eve of the assassination.\"\n\nAssuming that Oswald fired the fatal shot, he said, \"These top CIA case officers are guilty of negligence.\"\n\nBlakey isn't optimistic about getting all of the documents from the intelligence agency.\n\n\"They held stuff back from the Warren Commission, they held stuff back from us, they held stuff back from the ARRB,\" he said. \"That's three agencies that they were supposed to be fully candid with. And now they're taking the position that some of these documents can't be released even today.\n\n\"Why are they continuing to fight tooth and nail to avoid doing something they'd promised to do?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/17"}]}

So do his wife and children. Raukola's parents do the same with their sauna, in their house, his friends and work colleagues in theirs.\n\nWhen Raukola and his two brothers met up last month in Finland's capital to catch up on the things brothers catch up on when they have not seen each other in a while, they did so in a quiet and unchanging place made of fragrant hard wood, warmed to 175 degrees and with easy access for a dip in the Baltic's icy waters.\n\n\"Sometimes Finnish people say saunas are like churches. I think that's a really strong word. Maybe too strong,\" said Raukola, 35, a mechanical engineer, as he or one of his brothers periodically stood up to pour water on hot stones that created a burst of steam that raised the heat and humidity levels in Helsinki's Kulttuurisauna.\n\n\"What I think they are trying to say is saunas are where Finnish people go to calm themselves; to reset their minds to the 'zero point'; to process what has happened to them in the daytime and to think about solutions.\"\n\nFinland has a lot of saunas: an estimated 3 million for its population of 5 million, according to government figures. The Nordic country also routinely scores high in global surveys, indexes and reports that compare countries on various quality of life and good-governance metrics. Last month, Finland was crowned the happiest country in the world for the seventh year in a row by the United Nations’ World Happiness Report.\n\nU.S. fails to crack top 20: 2024 World Happiness Report\n\nBut ask a Finn what makes them seemingly so content with life, and while they may jokingly attribute it to some rare combination of steam and heat, they are likely to say happiness just doesn't happen, it's made. Kind of.\n\n\"It's a bit of a mystery to me, but it's always our saunas that get mentioned in the reports about how happy we in Finland apparently are,\" said Teemu Tallberg, a professor of military sociology at Finland's National Defense University. He and other researchers say Finland's \"consensus\" society and general preparedness levels for achieving goals and managing unexpected crises − war, if it comes to it − may play the bigger role.\n\nIn fact, Frank Martela, a business professor at Finland's Aalto University, has said it's clear that Nordic countries such as Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and Norway − which all regularly outperform other nations in international gauges that seek to measure how well societies function − are doing something right when it comes to engineering the conditions for happiness, even if \"happiness\" is a term that defies easy categorization.\n\nWell-functioning democratic institutions, generous welfare services\n\nAll of these countries have well-functioning democratic institutions and relatively generous welfare services. They score well on surveys that track equality legislation, lack of corruption, social cohesion and trust, enjoy high levels of freedom, media literacy, human rights and access to public goods, and have low levels of income equality.\n\nMartela has also noted that the U.N.'s World Happiness Report is actually based on one single question: \"Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to ten at the top. Suppose we say that the top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you, and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?\"\n\nAfter several thousand people answer this question about where they feel they are standing on the ladder, an average is calculated. The average is the happiness score for the given country. Of the more than 140 nations surveyed for the most recent happiness index, the U.S. landed in 23rd place, compared with 15th in 2023. A lot of Americans, in other words, placed themselves pretty far down the ladder compared with people in Finland.\n\nPrecisely why that is falls outside the scope of this story. But it may be worth pointing out, in an election year, that the movie \"Civil War\" just opened in the U.S. theaters. Its plot revolves around a U.S. government that has become a dystopian dictatorship and extremist militias who regularly commit war crimes.\n\nSharing an 833-mile border with Russia\n\nHappiness in Finland, for historical reasons, may be closely linked to ideas about resilience, researchers say.\n\nFinland became a full member of the NATO military alliance in April only last year, a direct reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Finland has a long and strained relationship with its massive neighbor that has required it to adopt coping strategies, particularly military-related ones.\n\nNot only does Finland share an 833-mile border with Russia, but in the 17th and 18th centuries various monarchs of the Russian Empire repeatedly tried to conquer Finland, which was then part of a Swedish kingdom.\n\nAfter Sweden lost a war with Russia in 1809, Finland became a self-governing part of the Russian empire until 1917, when it declared its independence in the wake of the Russian Revolution. Then Finland fought off a Soviet invasion when Josef Stalin's Red Army attacked in 1939 in what's known as the Winter War.\n\nToday, Finland maintains a widely supported system of military conscription, and 8 out of 10 Finns, surveys show, say they would be prepared to defend Finland themselves militarily in all situations.\n\nAxel Hagelstam, director of research at Finland's National Emergency Supply Agency, the Nordic country's version of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that partly because of Finland's history and because it has \"never taken off the table\" the possibility of new conflict with Russia, Finland \"built resilience\" into many aspects of its security strategy. He believes that has a \"calming effect\" on Finnish society overall.\n\nIn practice, this resilience ranges from \"household preparedness\" workshops and classes for the public aimed at teaching cooking skills to keeping well-maintained bomb shelters. Finland's government keeps extremely close tabs on and has partnerships with about 1,500 private companies considered crucial for supply chains. It is currently developing models, for example, for what to do to keep grocery stories running if power is cut.\n\n\"Resilience doesn't happen in isolation,\" Hagelstam said.\n\nTuula Luoma, a civil defense planner for the city of Helsinki, said that \"if a light is broken, we fix it today, not tomorrow\" as she showed off a cavernous bomb shelter about 700 feet below an apartment block, one of dozens in Finland's capital that can withstand radiation and chemical attacks as well as collapsing buildings struck by conventional weapons. The bomb shelters in Helsinki have a collective capacity for 900,000 people for a population of 630,000. But the Finns are nothing if not thinkers-ahead.\n\nThe extra space was created for any tourists who might happen to get stuck in the city during a war.\n\n'Weaponized use of migrants'\n\nStill, Finland's preparedness for war or disaster doesn't mean everything in the country is rosy all the time.\n\nFinland is trying to adopt temporary legislation to block asylum seekers from Russia after the Finnish border authority said more than 1,300 asylum seekers from nations including Yemen, Somalia and Syria entered Finland from Russia between August and December last year. About 900 of them entered in November alone. In comparison, the number before last August had averaged just one person a day.\n\nOne border police intelligence officer said Russia has \"weaponized the use of migrants\" on Finland's border by canceling their Russian claims and busing then to Finland's border. The officer, who did not want to be publicly identified because of the sensitive nature of his work, said the situation was likely to \"worsen\" in time.\n\nAs a consequence, Finland has closed its border with Russia, a move that has drawn pushback from humanitarian organizations who say denying asylum seekers access to a territory impinges on their human rights.\n\nAnd some studies and reports have suggested that people of African descent consider Finland one of the most racist countries in the European Union, with nearly half of those surveyed experiencing racial harassment.\n\nGuns laws, mental health and criminal responsibility in Finland have also been in the spotlight recently after a 12-year-old boy killed another child and injured two in a school shooting in a city north of Helsinki.\n\nAccording to the Small Arms Survey, a Switzerland-based research project, Finland, which tightened its gun laws more than a decade ago in response to several school shootings, has the most guns per capita of any nation in the European Union at 32.4 per 100 inhabitants. It has the seventh-most in the world behind only the United States, Yemen, Montenegro, Serbia, Canada and Uruguay, according to the survey.\n\nRaukola, the sauna enthusiast, said he appreciates how communication from Finland's authorities is \"transparent\" on key issues. He also said his visit last month to Helsinki's Kulttuurisauna with his brothers, intended to mark his older brother's birthday, \"was just somewhere to go.\" He said it was not an \"exceptional moment\"; on the contrary, it was the most normal thing they could think of to do to have fun, relax and be happy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/01/02/fact-check-denmark-among-happiest-countries-but-isnt-no-1/4107107001/", "title": "Fact check: Denmark among world's happiest countries, but isn't No. 1", "text": "The claim: Denmark is ranked the happiest country in the world; 33 hours work in a week, $20 minimum wages, free university, medical and child care\n\nEvery year ahead of the United Nations' World Happiness Day, on March 20, a report is released that ranks 156 countries on their happiness based on income, life expectancy, freedom, social support, trust and generosity.\n\nAccording to one social media post, Denmark has turned up at the top of list.\n\n\"Denmark is ranked as the happiest country in the world with 33 hours work in a week, $20 minimum wages, free universities and medical care, free child care and low level of Corruption,\" reads a Dec. 30 Facebook post to the group Mysterious Facts which has since been deleted.

The \"happiness costs of these risks are very large,\" according to the report.\n\nThe meme provides no source of information or date; it is possible the first claim could have been true at the time the meme was created, as Denmark has been previously ranked first in World Happiness Reports.\n\nA search of the text included in the post results in a blog post with an almost identical version of the claim from 2016, a year when Denmark was ranked first. Denmark also made the top of the list in 2012 and 2013.\n\nNordic countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, have appeared on the top 10 of the World Happiness Report since it started publishing its annual rankings in 2012. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, Nordic countries occupied the top three spots.\n\nThe report found that Nordic citizens are exceptionally satisfied with their lives because of reliable and extensive welfare benefits, low corruption, well-functioning democracy and state institutions and small population.\n\nFact check: Over 159 million people voted in the US general election\n\nWork hours, university, medical and child care\n\nBeyond overall happiness, the post makes claims — some true — about why Danes might be so happy.\n\nWhile the post states an average workweek in Denmark is 33 hours, a full-time workweek in Denmark is typically 37 hours distributed over five days, according to the city of Copenhagen. It/ notes that workweeks can be longer for those in a managerial position or self-employed.\n\nStaying extra hours is discouraged, and most employees leave the office around 4 p.m. to pick up their children and begin preparing for dinner, according to the official website of Denmark. In the last weeks of July, offices are shut down as Danes take time off to enjoy a short summer and every employee is legally entitled to five weeks of paid vacation per year.\n\nEmployees are also not allowed to work more than 48 hours per week on an average of a four month period due to the EU's Working Time Directive, which was implemented in Denmark's Working Enviornment Act in 2017.\n\nThe post states the nation's minimum wage is $20 an hour. But Denmark lacks a federally mandated minimum wage, according to Investopedia. However, trade unions work to ensure that workers are paid a reasonable rate and try to keep the average minimum wage at $20 per hour. As of 2020, minimum wages in the country hover around $16.60 per hour, according to Check In Price.\n\nMinimum-wage.org, says Denmark's average minimum wage is $18 per hour and annual minimum wage is $44,252.00. A November 2020 article from Market Watch says wages in Scandinavia are among the highest in the world at $17.69 per hour.\n\nSchooling is largely free, as the post claims. Higher education in Denmark is free for students from the European Union or European University Association and for students in exchange programs, according to the Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science. Education is also free for students who have a permanent residence, a temporary residence with possibility of obtaining permanent residence or a resident permit.\n\nIt is also worth noting that every Danish student receives a rough estimate of $900 per month, the Washington Post reported.\n\nIn Denmark, the health care system is financed through an income tax of 8% and provides universal access to citizens and legal residents, USA TODAY reported. So while the post states medical care is free, it lacks the context that taxpayers do cover the cost.\n\nThe public child care system in Denmark is based on a partially free system, and some day care institutions have waiting lists. However, most guarantee a place for children from the age of 1, according to Work in Denmark. The child care facilities receive financial support from the state and the most payable out of pocket amount by parents is 30% of the cost. Child care is not free, as claimed.\n\nThe reason Denmark can afford to provide these services is because it has one of the highest tax rates in the world, with the average Dane paying a total of 45% in income taxes, according to BBC. In fact, most Scandinavian countries offer higher education, child and medical care, and parental leave due to their high levels of taxation. In 2018, Denmark's tax-to-GDP ratio was 44.9%, Norway's was 39% and Sweden's 43.9%, which compares to a ratio of 24.3% in the U.S., according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nThe post is accurate in claiming that Denmark has low corruption. The 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Denmark as the least corrupt country in the world for the fifth year in a row due to its degree of press freedom, access to information, independent judicial systems and strong standards of integrity for public officials.\n\nIn 2018, New Zealand and Denmark were both ranked as the least corrupt, according to World Population Review, which notes that there is no exact way to measure corruption but many use the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International.\n\nFact check: Pregnant women do receive vaccines, but more study needed on COVID-19 shot\n\nOur ruling: Partly False\n\nThe claim that Denmark is ranked the happiest country in the world due to its short workweeks, high minimum wage, and free university and health and child care is rated PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. Finland has been ranked the happiest country in the world for the last three consecutive years, with Denmark holding a spot in the top three. Denmark also has 37-hour workweeks, not 33, and there is no minimum wage. Services of higher education, child and medical care and parental leave are available due to their high levels of taxation; they're not offered for free.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

St. John’s has held the title of the healthiest county since 2014.\n\nLee County came in 11th healthiest, a move up from 12th place last year and a steady improvement from coming in 20th place in 2015.\n\nThis is the ninth year that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has conducted annual county health rankings across the United States, where communities view their standing as a badge of honor or a call to action. The foundation conducts the annual assessment with the University of Wisconsin Public Health Institute.\n\nThe foundation examines health outcomes, access to medical care, and socioeconomic factors such as child poverty rates and single-parent households.\n\nOverall in Florida, 21 percent of children live in poverty, while the rate is 12 percent among the top-performing counties in the U.S. and a national child poverty rate of 20 percent.\n\nIn Collier, 18 percent of children are living in poverty; and 22 percent of the children in Lee live in poverty.\n\n“The time is now to address long-standing challenges child poverty,” Julie Willems Van Dijk, director of county health rankings with the foundation, said in a news release. “Every community should use their county health rankings data, work together, and find solutions so that all babies, kids and adults, regardless of their race or ethnicity, have the same opportunities to be healthy.”\n\nAfter St. John’s and Collier as the two healthiest counties, the next three are Martin, Seminole and Miami-Dade.\n\nThe least-healthy county is Union, in north central Florida where Lake Butler is located, followed by Putnam, Madison, Gadsden and Dixie counties.\n\nIn Collier, 16 percent of adults report they are in fair or poor health, while 17 percent of adults in Lee say they are in poor or fair health.\n\nThe smoking rate among adults is 11 percent in Collier and 14 percent in Lee. The state smoking rate is 15 percent.\n\nWhen it comes to obesity, which has reached epidemic numbers in the U.S., 25 percent of adults in Lee are obese, slightly below the state obesity rate of 26 percent. In Collier, 20 percent of adults are obese.\n\nCollier’s lower obesity rate compared to the state stood out to Nancy Lascheid, co-founder of Neighborhood Health Clinic, which serves working poor residents in Collier who do not have insurance.\n\n“We have been providing healthy diets and exercise classes on Saturday morning at the Neighborhood Health Clinic for 12 years,” she said. “We’re proud of our patient successes, but there is still a lot of work to do.”\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta peg the adult obesity rate nationally at 36 percent.\n\nAngela Smith, health officer with the Florida Department of Health in Lee County, said Lee shows strength in healthier behaviors and quality of life.\n\n“The county health rankings help us to understand what factors have influenced good health in our community and how we can continue to make Lee County a healthy place to live, learn, work and play,” Smith said in a statement.\n\nOfficials with Lee Health, the public hospital system in Lee, said the improved ranking is welcomed.\n\n“The latest rankings show that we are making improvements in our community’s health,” Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “There is still work needed to help our community, especially children, understand the long-term health effects of lifestyle choices. Lee Health is dedicated to continuing to make progress by encouraging everyone to make healthy choices that promote physical and mental well-being.”\n\nMore: Naples ranks No. 20 on list of fastest growing cities in the country\n\nWhen it comes to low birthweight babies, 8 percent are born below healthy weights in Lee, and the rate is 7 percent in Collier, the data shows. In the top-performing counties around the nation, the low birthweight rate is 6 percent, but the overall national rate is 8.2 percent, according to the data.\n\nAfter a decade of improvements, the rate of low-weight births is beginning to creep up again, according to the foundation. Low birthweight is a key indicator of overall health status in communities.\n\nIn comparing Collier to St. John’s, Collier has a larger population that is more diverse, with the Hispanic population accounting for nearly 27 percent of Collier’s population. That compares to the Hispanic population accounting for 6 percent of the total population in St. John’s, according to epidemiology staff at the Florida Department of Health in Collier.\n\nWhile population size is important for overall health, demographics and social economic status play a much greater role, according to the health department.\n\nCollier has improved in several categories and stands out for lower adult smoking and excessive drinking rates, according to the health department.\n\n“Our rankings are a result of the community making healthy changes in their lives,” Stephanie Vick, administrator for the health department in Collier, said in a statement. “The decisions our residents make to quit smoking, eat more fruits and vegetables, increase physical activity, and put safety first, along with the dedicated work of a variety of stakeholders, impacts the health of our entire community.”\n\nDr. Allen Weiss, president and chief executive officer of the NCH Healthcare System, which brought the community health initiative the Blue Zones Project to Southwest Florida in 2015, said Collier is doing well.\n\nThe obesity rate is lower, and the physical inactivity rate of 19 percent is well below the Florida rate of 24 percent. The excessive drinking rate is 15 percent in Collier, while the state rate is 18 percent. In Lee, 19 percent of adults admit to excessive drinking.\n\n“Overall we are good,” Weiss said. “Our goal is not to be beat St. John’s, our goal is keep people well and healthy. It is reassuring we stay at this top level.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/local/2017/03/17/two-naples-mansions-among-priciest-homes-sale-florida/99129246/", "title": "Two Gulf-front mansions in Naples among priciest homes for sale in ...", "text": "Laura Layden\n\nlaura.layden@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4818\n\nWith the luxury market making a comeback in Naples, two posh Port Royal mansions are among the priciest homes for sale in Florida.\n\nThe beachfront homes — with Gordon Drive addresses — recently landed on a list of the 10 most expensive residential listings in the state. The rankings, published last month and generated by PropertyShark.com, included homes priced from $58 million to $195 million. Yes, $195 million.\n\nThe Naples properties making the list are at:\n\n» 2500 Gordon Drive, ranked No. 8, with an asking price of $60.9 million.\n\n» 2750 Gordon Drive, in 10th place, with a price of $58 million.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAt $54.9 million, a third Port Royal estate, at 3100 Gordon Drive, narrowly missed the list. (It originally was put on the market for $68 million in 2014.)\n\nThe three mega-mansions are in a class by themselves in Naples.\n\nThe next-closest listing based on asking price is at $49 million — also in Port Royal, on Galleon Drive, according to Trulia.com.\n\nFrom there, listing prices drop to $30 million or less.\n\n\"Fifty million-plus is rarefied air,\" said Bill Earls, a luxury home specialist with John R. Wood in Naples. \"There are only so many people on the planet Earth that can buy a property like that. But they have to be interested in Florida. They can't be foreign from China, with no interest in the United States.\"\n\nRelated: Collier County sixth, Lee 32nd in U.S. among 'Best Places to Get a Mortgage'\n\nSelling ultra high-end real estate takes time, but it helps when consumer confidence is higher, as it is now — and the uncertainty of the 2016 presidential election is in the rear-view mirror.\n\n\"You have to be extremely successful and wealthy individuals to be able to play in this market,\" Earls said.\n\nOf the most expensive trio of listings in Naples, the 15,995-square-foot estate at 3100 Gordon Drive has been listed on the market the longest — more than 910 days.\n\nThe newest to hit the market is 2500 Gordon Drive, made publicly available again about 200 days ago. Marketing efforts picked up with the start of the busy winter season last year. Its listing agent is Gulf Coast International Properties.\n\nHere's a look at the listings:\n\n» With five bedrooms and six baths, the Island Colonial-style home at 3100 Gordon Drive is on nearly 5 acres, with 277 feet of sandy shore. Built in 2009, it includes a seven-car garage, retractable motorized glass walls, luxury gardens and a 66-foot-long pool with a spa and sun shelf. It last sold in March 2012 for $47.3 million, an eye-popping price that made headlines as one of the most expensive homes ever sold in Naples.\n\n» Known as La Capanna, the estate at 2750 Gordon Drive spans 18,172 square feet on 1.55 acres. The Mediterranean-inspired, resort-like estate has six bedrooms, 14 bathrooms (eight full and six half), a home theater, a beachside game room, a five-bay collector's garage, a two-story rotunda with waterfront views, a 500-bottle wine room, state-of-the-art electronics, a fitness center, his and her studies, and a zero-edge pool, which appears to vanish into the horizon. It recently underwent a four-year, $8 million renovation, making it even bigger and more stately.\n\n» The lavish five-bedroom estate with seven bathrooms (six full and one half) at 2500 Gordon Drive has a Lowcountry architectural style, with elements that developed in the 1700s in Georgia and Tennessee. An ornate gate opens to stands of palm trees, verdant lawns and privacy hedges around the main home. The grounds include several guest houses, a pool and pool house, a few garages, a sun room and service buildings, and even a \"secret garden.\" The property has been visited by presidents and has hosted large charity events.\n\n\"They are all like works of art. They are all incredibly beautiful in their own right, and they are unique. When you see them firsthand, it's hard to deny how special they are,\" said Larry Lappin, a luxury home specialist who is part of an ultra high-end real estate team with Earls.\n\nThe power team has the listings at 2750 Gordon Drive and 3100 Gordon Drive.\n\nRelated: Naples tops in the nation again for well-being, happiness\n\n\"If you have visited La Capanna, then no explanation is necessary, and if you haven't been there, no explanation is possible,\" Lappin said.\n\nSince the last Super Bowl, Earls said $5 million to $10 million homes have been selling \"almost every day,\" so the high-end \"market is really alive again.\" In the seven months leading to the presidential election, that wasn't the case.\n\n\"It was the biggest living soap opera in the history of the United States,\" Earls said of the presidential run. \"Nobody wanted to talk about anything but Trump and Clinton.\"\n\nThis year Earls said he and Lappin have sold more than $80 million worth of property. They've had more showings over the past few months than they did in the previous six months.\n\n\"The activity somehow begets activity,\" Lappin said.\n\nAlso helpful are the recent headlines Naples has generated as a great place to live and work. Last week Naples and the nearby communities of Immokalee and Marco Island took the top spot as the healthiest and happiest place in the nation for the second year in a row in the Gallup-Healthways State of American Well-Being 2016 Community Rankings.\n\nNaples saw fewer luxury home sales in 2016 than in 2014 and 2015, with both sales price and volume down. Port Royal and Olde Naples were hurt most, in part due to larger home inventories, said Michael Polly, president and managing broker for Royal Shell Real Estate in Naples.\n\nIn Collier County, 31 residential properties have sold or gone under contract for $5 million or more since Jan. 1, Polly said. Additionally, he said, four other homes have gone pending and two have sold for more than $10 million since the beginning of the year.\n\nLast week an open house at an estate home on Galleon Drive priced at $13.9 million attracted 11 prospective buyers, Polly said, adding that it's \"pretty good traffic\" for a property in that market.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of adjustments in the prices of some of these properties so that some that were a little overzealous have come more in line with the market. The factors of confidence in the economy and more realistic pricing have brought the interest back in that market in Naples,\" Polly said. \"It will stabilize and be at more of an equilibrium as the year moves on.\"\n\nRelated: Southwest Florida's top 10 home sales of 2016\n\nHowever, the renewed interest in multimillion-dollar homes doesn't mean the $50 million-plus mansions will sell in a snap or even this year, he said, acknowledging they're a different breed.\n\n\"That is a narrow market,\" he said \"Look at those price points.\"\n\nPhilip Collins, a luxury property specialist with William Raveis Real Estate in Naples, said a home in Port Royal recently went under contract for about $18 million (the most expensive home sold in Collier County last year fetched less than $15.2 million). He declined to give the address of the pending sale, pointing out it's not a done deal. He said he wouldn't be shocked to see one of the $50 million-plus properties sell this year, as wealthy buyers are feeling more confident about the economy and where the country is headed with the election of President Donald Trump.\n\nOn average, Collins said about 60 homes sell in Port Royal a year. That number dropped to 36 last year, he said, but he expects sales this year to be much stronger.\n\nOne of his company's newest listings is at 655 Galleon Drive in Port Royal, which is going for $5.75 million. The single-family home, with four bedrooms and four bathrooms, is older, built in 1971, and much smaller than the mega mansions, spanning 3,567 square feet, and it's getting serious looks.​\n\n\"We have had some interest already, and it does have a nice water view, and the house has been renovated,\" Collins said. \"It is on the lower end price wise on navigable water.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the Top 10 priciest homes on the market in Florida, many are found in Palm Beach. At No. 2 on PropertyShark.com's list is Il Palmetto, Netscape co-founder Jim Clark's 60,350-square-foot Italian Renaissance mansion on South Ocean Boulevard in the small beachside community of Manalapan, priced at $137 million.\n\nThe most expensive property in Florida on PropertyShark.com's list, The Gemini, a mega mansion sitting on more than 15 acres in Manalapan, with 33 bedrooms and 47 bathrooms (13 half-baths). The fortress is also one of the priciest in the country. Listed at $195 million, the home stretches more than 63,000 square feet. Its owners, the Ziff publishing family, finished a major renovation of the property in 2003.\n\nShortly after PropertyShark.com released its Top 10 list, the Donahue family announced they're exploring the sale of 70 acres of beachfront property on Keewaydin Island and Gordon Pointe in Naples. Though the offering is unpriced, some have speculated it could sell for $100 million to $150 million to the right buyer.\n\nRelated: Naples family might sell 70 'amazing and unique' acres that include beach\n\nThe holdings comprise property the family has acquired over more than 40 years, beginning with a home off Gordon Drive. The offering includes:\n\n» Ready-to-build lots on the northern tip of Keewaydin.\n\n» A lounge for arriving and departing guests.\n\n» A 4,700-square-foot lodge.\n\n» A beachfront single-family estate with nearly 16,000 square feet.\n\n» Tennis courts.\n\n» A helicopter landing pad. (If you don't have a helicopter, the only way to get to the island is by boat.)\n\nA day after the listing hit the market, Robert McEwan, one of two CBRE agents representing the sellers, said after a short period of marketing, there would be a call for offers.\n\n\"There is just not another property like this in the state of Florida,\" McEwan said. \"We anticipate a lot of interest. We anticipate it will sell quickly.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/03/23/swiss-cities-rank-high-quality-life/448843002/", "title": "Three cities in Switzerland — Zurich, Geneva and Basel — rank high", "text": "Helena Bachmann\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nGENEVA — Switzerland's three largest cities always rank in the Top 10 places to live in the world, so what's the secret to a good life in Zurich, Geneva and Basel —besides the spectacular views?\n\nThis country known for chocolate, cheese and fondue can also boast about legendary Swiss efficiency.\n\n“Everything works, is well organized and on time.

Copeland was torn between between singing “Eye to Eye” from the film “A Goofy Movie” and “Remember Me” from “Coco.”\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning Hough told Copeland both songs were good, but he personally loved the idea of him doing “Remember Me” because he could be more intimate with it and “there’s some magic there.”\n\nAmerica agreed.

Congrats Jay,” a hyped fan stated.\n\n'OMG, Jay'\n\nCopeland broke the mold with his performance on Sunday, becoming the first competitor of the night to start off his song by walking down the catwalk.\n\nHe exuded a calm, cool and collected persona as he sang, seasoning his performance with a blend of falsetto and his full voice.\n\nHe had the crowd screaming early on and they gave him an encore when he finished.\n\n“Idol” judge Kate Perry was floored.\n\n“OMG, Jay. Wow. Well, Jay for the win,” said Perry, while dressed in an Ariel costume from Disney’s \"Little Mermaid” movie.\n\n\"I love that you started in a different position. It’s called showmanship,\" she added. \"You’re the only one so far that has really used the stage to their advantage. Come on, we want the stage to be used up. We want that energy and you did it.”\n\nFellow “Idol” judge Luke Bryan was enchanted by Copeland, too, because he’s been taking their advice, which includes being more careful about his song selection.\n\n“This is the second week in a row that you really gave us like timeless performances and your choices are just such classics sounds,” Bryan said. “That usage of your falsetto throughout the whole song was something we hadn’t heard really all year.”\n\nThe country star went on to say that his approach over the last few weeks have been “so classy, classic, timeless – all of those words.

The rankings, published last month and generated by PropertyShark.com, included homes priced from $58 million to $195 million. Yes, $195 million.\n\nThe Naples properties making the list are at:\n\n• 2500 Gordon Drive, ranked No. 8, with an asking price of $60.9 million.\n\n• 2750 Gordon Drive, ranked 10th, with a price of $58 million.\n\nAt $54.9 million, a third Port Royal estate, at 3100 Gordon Drive, narrowly missed the list. (It originally was put on the market for a record $68 million in 2014.)\n\nThe three mega-mansions are in a class by themselves in Naples.\n\nThe next-closest listing based on asking price is at $49 million — also in Port Royal, on Galleon Drive, according to Trulia.com. From there, listing prices drop to $30 million or less.\n\n“Fifty million-plus is rarefied air. There are only so many people on the planet Earth that can buy a property like that. But they have to be interested in Florida. They can’t be foreign from China, with no interest in the United States,” said Bill Earls, a luxury home specialist with John R. Wood in Naples.\n\nSelling ultra high-end real estate takes time, but it helps when consumer confidence is higher as it is now — and the uncertainty of the 2016 presidential election is in the rear-view mirror.\n\n“You have to be extremely successful and wealthy individuals to be able to play in this market,” Earls said.\n\nOf the most expensive trio of listings in Naples, the 15,995-square-foot estate at 3100 Gordon Drive has been listed on the market the longest — more than 910 days.\n\nThe newest to hit the market is 2500 Gordon Drive, made publicly available again about 200 days ago. Marketing efforts picked up with the start of the busy winter season last year. Its listing agent is Gulf Coast International Properties.\n\n“They are all like works of art. They are all incredibly beautiful in their own right, and they are unique. When you see them firsthand it’s hard to deny how special they are,” said Larry Lappin, a luxury home specialist who is part of an ultra high-end real estate team with Earls.\n\nThe power team has the listings at 2750 Gordon Drive and 3100 Gordon Drive.\n\n“If you have visited La Capanna then no explanation is necessary, and if you haven’t been there no explanation is possible,” Lappin said.\n\nSince the last Super Bowl, Earls said $5 million to $10 million homes have been selling “almost every day,” so the high-end “market is really alive again.” In the seven months leading up the presidential election that wasn’t the case.\n\n“It was the biggest living soap opera in the history of the United States,” Earls said of the presidential run. “Nobody wanted to talk about anything but Trump and Clinton.”\n\nThis year Earls said he and Lappin have sold more than $80 million worth of property. They’ve had more showings over the past few months than they did in the previous six months.\n\n“The activity somehow begets activity,” Lappin said.\n\nAlso helpful are the recent headlines Naples has generated as a great place to live and work. Last week Naples and the nearby communities of Immokalee and Marco Island took the top spot as the healthiest and happiest place in the nation for the second year in a row in the Gallup-Healthways State of American Well-Being 2016 Community Rankings.\n\nNaples saw fewer luxury home sales in 2016 than in 2014 and 2015, with both sales price and volume down. Port Royal and Olde Naples were hurt most, in part due to larger home inventories, said Michael Polly, president and managing broker for Royal Shell Real Estate in Naples.\n\nIn Collier County, 31 residential properties have sold or gone under contract for $5 million or more since Jan. 1, Polly said. Additionally, he said, four other homes have gone pending and two have sold for more than $10 million since the beginning of the year.\n\nLast week an open house at an estate home on Galleon Drive priced at $13.9 million attracted 11 prospective buyers, Polly said, adding that it’s “pretty good traffic” for a property in that market. “I’ve seen a lot of adjustments in the prices of some of these properties so that some that were a little overzealous have come more in line with the market. The factors of confidence in the economy and more realistic pricing have brought the interest back in that market in Naples,” Polly said. “It will stabilize and be at more of an equilibrium as the year moves on.”\n\nHowever, the renewed interest in multimillion-dollar homes doesn’t mean the $50 million-plus mansions will sell in a snap or even this year, he said, acknowledging they’re a different breed.\n\n“That is a narrow market,” he said “Look at those price points.”\n\nPhilip Collins, a luxury property specialist with William Raveis Real Estate in Naples, said a home in Port Royal recently went under contract for about $18 million (the most expensive home sold in Collier County last year fetched less than $15.2 million). He declined to give the address of the pending sale, pointing out it’s not a done deal. He said he wouldn’t be shocked to see one of the $50 million-plus properties sell this year, as wealthy buyers are feeling more confident about the economy and where the country is headed with the election of President Donald Trump.\n\nOn average, Collins said about 60 homes sell in Port Royal a year. That number dropped to 36 last year, he said, but he expects sales this year to be much stronger.\n\nOne of his company’s newest listings is at 655 Galleon Drive in Port Royal, which is going for $5.75 million. The single-family home, with four bedrooms and four bathrooms, is older, built in 1971, and much smaller than the mega mansions, spanning 3,567 square feet, and it’s getting serious looks.\n\n“We have had some interest already, and it does have a nice water view, and the house has been renovated,” Collins said. “It is on the lower end price wise on navigable water.”\n\nWhen it comes to the Top 10 priciest homes on the market in Florida, many are found in Palm Beach. At No. 2 on PropertyShark.com’s list is Il Palmetto, Netscape co-founder Jim Clark’s 60,350-square-foot Italian Renaissance mansion on South Ocean Boulevard in the small beachside community of Manalapan, priced at $137 million.\n\nThe most expensive property in Florida on PropertyShark.com’s list, The Gemini, a mega mansion sitting on more than 15 acres in Manalapan, with 33 bedrooms and 47 bathrooms (13 half-baths). The fortress is also one of the priciest in the country. Listed at $195 million, the home stretches more than 63,000 square feet. Its owners, the Ziff publishing family, finished a major renovation of the property in 2003.\n\nShortly after PropertyShark.com released its Top 10 list, the Donahue family announced they’re exploring the sale of 70 acres of beachfront property on Keewaydin Island and Gordon Pointe in Naples. Though the offering is unpriced, some have speculated it could sell for $100 million to $150 million to the right buyer.\n\nThe holdings comprise property the family has acquired over more than 40 years, beginning with a home off Gordon Drive. The offering includes:\n\n•Ready-to-build lots on the northern tip of Keewaydin.\n\n•A lounge for arriving and departing guests.\n\n•A 4,700-square-foot lodge.\n\n•A beachfront single-family estate with nearly 16,000 square feet of space.\n\n•Tennis courts.\n\n•A helicopter landing pad. (If you don’t have a helicopter, the only way to get to the island is by boat.)\n\nA day after the listing hit the market, Robert McEwan, one of two CBRE agents representing the sellers, said after a short period of marketing, there would be a call for offers.\n\n“There is just not another property like this in the state of Florida,” McEwan said. “We anticipate a lot of interest. We anticipate it will sell quickly.”\n\nA look at the listings\n\n3100 Gordon Drive\n\n• Island Colonial-style home built in 2009\n\n• On 5 acres, with 277 feet of sandy shore\n\n• five bedrooms and six baths\n\n• Seven-car garage\n\n• Retractable, motorized glass walls\n\n• Luxury gardens\n\n• 66-foot-long pool with a spa and sun shelf\n\nIt last sold in March 2012 for $47.3 million, an eye-popping price that made headlines as one of the most expensive homes ever sold in Naples.\n\n2750 Gordon Drive,\n\nknown as La Capanna\n\n• Mediterranean inspired, resort-like estate\n\n• 18,172 square feet on 1.55 acres\n\n• Six bedrooms, 14 bathrooms (eight full and six half)\n\n• Home theater\n\n• Beachside game room\n\n• Five-bay collectors garage\n\n• Two-story rotunda with waterfront views\n\n• 500-bottle wine room\n\n• State-of-the-art electronics\n\n• Fitness center\n\n• His and her studies\n\n• Zero-edge pool, which appears to vanish into the horizon\n\nIt recently underwent a four-year, $8 million renovation, making it even bigger and more stately.\n\n2500 Gordon Drive\n\n• Lowcountry architectural style, with elements that developed in the 1700s in Georgia and Tennessee\n\n• Five-bedroom estate with seven bathrooms (six full and one half)\n\n• An ornate gate opens to stands of palm trees, verdant lawns and privacy hedges around the main home\n\n• Several guest houses\n\n• Pool and pool house\n\n• A few garages\n\n• Sun room\n\n• Service buildings\n\n• A “secret garden”\n\nThe property has been visited by presidents and hosted large charity events.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/us/peter-harley-solo-row-us-to-france-trnd/index.html", "title": "Peter Harley, 61, is set to row from the US to France. The entire ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOver the next couple of months, one man will attempt to row close to 4,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nPeter Harley, 61, hopes to set sail next week, weather permitting, from Virginia Beach and make his way to La Trinité-sur-Mer, France.\n\nHe told CNN on Thursday he estimates the entire rowing journey will take anywhere from three to four months.\n\n“I’m not nervous,” Harley said. “I’ve been in boats at sea in South Africa for many years, so I kind of know what’s coming and I’m not afraid of it.”\n\nHarley said he was inspired to take on such a trek while in his home country of South Africa a few years ago, but after he moved to the United States in 2019, the goal became more attainable.\n\nThe ocean rowing boat features storage space, a sleeping cabin and solar panels. North Atlantic Challenge\n\nHarley will make his idea a reality when he launches himself into the Atlantic in a 24-foot boat. It’s not quite a typical rowboat and is designed to handle less-than-ideal conditions.\n\nOcean current conditions and weather will play a huge part in his journey, but Harley is confident in the vessel.\n\n“If the boat were to capsize, it’s designed to re-right itself,” Harley said. “Bad conditions pass by eventually, so I’ll have to ride things out.”\n\nThe vessel is equipped with a sleeping cabin, plenty of storage and solar panels for communication and navigation purposes. But: “The bathroom, I’m afraid, is just a bucket,” Harley said.\n\nAlso onboard the boat is a desalinator, which converts ocean water into clean drinking water.\n\nThe solar panels will give Harley the ability to stay in constant communication with his daughter, Bonnie Evans, back home, who has helped him prepare along the way.\n\nEvans told CNN she is more excited than nervous for her father. “If there’s anybody I know that can do this, it’s certainly my dad.” Evans said. She described him as a meticulous person who has every detail of this journey calculated out.\n\nPeter Harley and his daughter, Bonnie Evans, who says she's very proud of her father and his journey. North Atlantic Challenge\n\nAnd preparation for the trans-Atlantic journey has been no joke: 28 months of training, 13 of which were 7 days a week.\n\n“It’s been a very intense process and requires a tremendous amount of discipline, dedication and focus,” Harley said.\n\nThinking about the trek so far in advance has helped Harley mentally prepare. He says he isn’t worried about the loneliness aspect of the journey either, as he’s experienced lots of time alone before.\n\nHe’s also had to change up his eating habits over the past eight months to get his diet right for all the time away from a kitchen. While onboard, he’ll eat protein bars, oatmeal and even pasta.\n\nThe intensity of the event has also inspired the father-daughter duo to turn it into a fundraiser for three charities: 5 Gyres, the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation and the Best Friends Animals Society.\n\n“We wanted to touch on three components: the planet, people, and animals,” Evans said of their choices.\n\nIf Harley lands successfully in France, he will go down in history as the first to do so. Two prior attempts have failed.\n\n“I’ve prepared as much as I can,” Harley said, “I’m as strong as I can be, I’m as fit as I can be, I’ve done as much as I can I just have to get it done.”", "authors": ["Sara Smart"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}]}

This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\" Trump said in his post on Truth Social. \"WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY.\"\n\nTrump responds to Roberts' statement\n\nTrump's call for impeachment escalated his increasing attacks on federal district judges who have sided against his administration on several fronts, including its efforts to cut the federal workforce through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have accused judges of trying to control the executive branch's power.\n\nTrump responded to Roberts' statement in a Fox News interview aired Tuesday night. \"Well, he didn't mention my name in the statement. I just saw it quickly,\" Trump said. \"But many people have called for the impeachment of this judge. I don't know who the judge is, but he's radical left.\"\n\nAsked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham whether he would defy a court order, Trump said: \"No, you can't do that. However, we have bad judges. We have very bad judges, and these are judges that shouldn't be allowed.”\n\nHow are judges impeached?\n\nAlthough rarely executed, Congress has the authority to impeach federal judges through the same process as other federal officials.\n\nThe House of Representatives can impeach a judge with a simple majority, but votes from two-thirds of the Senate are required to convict the judge and remove them from office ‒ making a conviction highly unlikely under the Senate's current makeup with 47 Democratic senators. Only 15 federal judges have ever been impeached and only eight have been convicted.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, introduced articles of impeachment against Boasberg, saying Congress “will not tolerate politicized judges unconstitutionally usurping the President’s authority.” Other House Republicans, including Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., have drafted articles of impeachment targeting other federal judges who have ruled against Trump.\n\nMaryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said his GOP colleagues are trying to impeach judges “for the crime of upholding the rule of law against Trump’s plainly lawless acts.”\n\nThe Justice Department has also asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to remove Boasberg from the case.\n\nRoberts previously warned about threats to the court\n\nBefore the change in administrations, Roberts warned in his December year-end report that the independence of the federal courts is under threat, including from attempts to intimidate judges and possible defiance of court orders.\n\n“Public officials certainly have a right to criticize the work of the judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others,” wrote Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee who became the 17th chief justice of the United States upon his Senate confirmation in 2005.\n\nWhat public officials don’t have the right to do, he said, is defy court opinions.\n\n“Within the past few years, however, elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,” Roberts said, without giving examples.\n\nRoberts has criticized Democrats, too\n\nIn 2020, Roberts criticized comments Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., made at a rally outside the Supreme Court when the justices were considering a high-profile abortion case.\n\nSchumer said justices had “released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.”\n\nRoberts called the comments “inappropriate” and “dangerous.”\n\nRoberts called Trump out in 2018\n\nIn 2018, Roberts also spoke out after Trump characterized a federal judge who ruled against his administration as an “Obama judge.”\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts said in a statement. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n\nTrump pushed back.\n\n“Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have `Obama judges,’ and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,” he tweeted.\n\nShould Roberts do more?\n\nGabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, said Tuesday Roberts needs to do more to ensure the judiciary’s independence.\n\nThat includes working with Congress to take the U.S. Marshals Service – which carries out court orders − out of the control of the executive branch, Roth said.\n\nHe also said safety training needs to be mandatory for every federal judge and security must be increased.\n\nWhat led to Trump's call for impeachment?\n\nBoasberg tried to temporarily block deportation flights on Saturday through oral and written orders after Trump cited the seldom-used 1798 Alien Enemies Act to remove nearly 300 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua from the United States.\n\nBut two deportation flights that had already left Texas for El Salvador via Honduras did not return to the United States despite the orders.\n\nThe 18th-century law allows the deportation of anyone from a designated enemy country who is not a naturalized citizen without providing the individual due process. Justice Department lawyers have refused the judge’s demand that they provide information about the flights.\n\nWhite Houses press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday the Trump administration complied with the judge’s written order, arguing the Venezuelans were deported before it was released. But when pressed about a verbal order from the same judge that came earlier, Leavitt cited legal “questions” whether a verbal order carries the same weight as a written order.\n\nTrump's border czar” Tom Homan doubled down on the administration’s mass deportation campaign on Monday, saying he plans to continue the aggressive roundups and removals despite the court ruling.\n\n“We're not stopping,” Homan told Fox News in an interview. “I don't care what the judges think. I don't care what the left thinks. We're coming.”\n\nLee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the Venezuelans, said the administration appeared to have defied the judge’s order. “There’s been a lot of talk during the last several weeks about a constitutional crisis, throwing that term around,” Gelernt said Monday. “I think we’re getting very close to it.”\n\nA Justice Department lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, told Boasberg his written order was not valid if it was issued after the flights had crossed into international territory. The Justice Department said the judge’s oral order was also unenforceable.\n\nThe administration has argued the Tren de Aragua gang members pose a national security threat.\n\nBut Boasberg, in his order, said the Alien Enemies Act does not \"provide a basis for the president's proclamation given that the terms invasion, predatory incursion really relate to hostile acts perpetrated by any nation and commensurate to war.\"\n\n(This story has been updated with more information and photos.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/18"}]}

Police believe the suspect shot at the cars at least three times in addition to using the improvised explosives to start the fires.\n\nThe FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force has been pulled in to aid the investigation, though it is \"too early\" to definitively classify the incident as a terrorist act, FBI Special Agent in Charge Spencer Evans said in the briefing.

Federal ATF agents are also assisting in the investigation that started earlier this year when someone smashed windows, painted Cybertruck windshields with large red Xs and tried to start a fire. Local media reported that someone at that time also painted \"Nazi Cars\" at the dealership about an hour northwest of Denver.\n\n\"These incidents were not only unlawful, dangerous, and unsettling, they also created an atmosphere of discomfort and worry,\" Loveland Police spokesman Chris Padgett. \"Those who work at the business, along with those living in the community, have had to deal with such concerns since the first incident on January 29th.\n\nPolice said the suspect goes by the names Lucy Grace Nelson and Justin Thomas Nelson.\n\nPadgett said federal charges are likely forthcoming. Nelson faces Colorado charges of using explosives or incendiary devices while committing a felony, along with criminal mischief. They are free on a $100,000 bond but it was unclear whether they have an attorney.\n\nMusk has rapidly become a target of anger by left-wing activists following his decision last year to endorse Trump for president. Musk now runs Trump's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" and has been scything through federal agencies to cut staff and spending, although courts have blocked some of those efforts.\n\nOn Monday, social media content creator and car salesman Russell Richardson posted a video showing how two customers traded in Teslas because they were upset with Musk, a trend he said reflected what \"a lot of people\" are doing.\n\n\"They felt a certain way and they were willing to put their money where their mouth was, and get rid of the product they were driving to get something else,\" said Richardson, who posts as 'Russ Flips Whips.' \"Not too many people can say that.

A security guard was on scene at the time but was not hurt, police said.\n\nPolice are working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on the case.\n\nPolice said they are collecting evidence and reviewing surveillance footage captured in the area around the time of the most recent shooting.\n\n“An ATF explosive detection K-9 was on scene again to help look for possible shell casings,” police said.\n\nAuthorities aren’t sure what motivated the shooter to target the dealership but other Tesla dealerships have been “targeted across Oregon and the nation for political reasons,” police said.\n\nMore on last week’s shooting\n\nThe first shooting, which happened around 1:46 a.m. last Thursday on March 6, led to three damaged cars, a damaged wall and a broken computer monitor.\n\nWhen Tesla employees showed up to work that Thursday morning, they found out the building had been shot at. Investigators said at least seven shots were fired, according to the Tigard Police Department.\n\nNo one was present during that shooting, so no one was hurt, police said.\n\nInvestigators working the latest cases in Oregon ask that anyone who saw or heard anything at the Tigard dealership call 503-718-TIPS or email tips@tigard-or.gov.\n\nWhy are people targeting Tesla?\n\nSince President Donald Trump’s reelection, SpaceX and Tesla owner Elon Musk has unofficially helmed the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nUnder Trump and Musk’s leadership, about 100,000 of the country’s 2.3 million federal workers have taken buyouts or been fired so far, according to Reuters.\n\nMusk previously made headlines when he directed the sending of mass emails on Feb. 22 to federal workers asking for details on what they did at work over the previous week. He asked for five bullet points and for workers to \"CC\" their managers.\n\nTesla dealerships targeted in multiple states\n\nRecently, reports of vandalism and fires have been made at Tesla dealerships in multiple states, including other parts of Oregon.\n\nIn Salem, a 41-year-old man was charged this month for two separate incidents at a Tesla dealership, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon. The man, Adam Matthew Lansky, was charged with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device, the office said in a press release.\n\nThe first incident was on Jan. 20, the office said. Someone called the Salem Police Department about an individual throwing Molotov cocktails at the dealership. On Feb. 19, someone called officers to the same dealership about an individual shooting into the building and a vehicle.\n\nBoth incidents were linked to Lansky through surveillance footage, and he was arrested on March 4.\n\nSince December, Tesla’s stock has dropped by 50%, and President Trump has vocally supported Musk during this period.\n\nAfter five Tesla vehicles were spotted at the White House recently, Trump said he would consider categorizing those vandalizing Tesla dealerships and committing violent acts against Tesla owners as “domestic terrorists.”\n\n“I think (Musk has) been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people,” Trump said. “And I just want people to know that he can't be penalized for being a patriot. And he's a great patriot.”\n\nTesla dealerships also used to hold protests\n\nEver since Musk took a role in President Trump's administration, communities have held protests in retaliation.\n\nProtesters in Portsmouth, New Hampshire met at a Tesla showroom as part of a \"Tesla Takedown\" event around the country, reported the Portsmouth Herald, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nOne protester, Diane Kolifrath, said the group showed up to keep Musk from taking away the country’s democracy.\n\n\"There are far more of us that want to preserve the democracy than those who want to put us under,” she told the newspaper. “We are committed to advocating for social justice, environmental protection, and economic equality.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, USA TODAY; Deb Cram, The Portsmouth Herald; Eric D.

A trail of blood leads dozens of feet down the white roof’s slope.\n\nA black AR-style rifle lies nearby.\n\nOne officer’s voice on the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit body camera footage counts scattered bullet casings. “Looks like at least eight,” he says. In another moment, a Secret Service officer in a dark suit asks about suspects and injuries.\n\n“I’m just trying to get clear information to relay back to D.C.,” he says, waving his cell phone.\n\nThe scenes were captured in the chaotic minutes after a shooter took aim at former President Donald Trump on July 13 in Pennsylvania. They also marked the start of what has become a sprawling FBI-led investigation to find out how, and why, Crooks opened fire, shooting Trump’s ear and leaving another rally-goer dead.\n\nTwo weeks since the shooting shook the nation, FBI director Christopher Wray’s testimony last week in a congressional hearing, along with other testimony and media reports, have helped sharpen the picture of the shooter’s meticulous planning in the week leading up to the assassination attempt.\n\nThat included revelations that Crooks searched online for “How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?” visited the rally grounds, practiced at a gun range and used a rifle with a collapsible stock that might have been easier to conceal. He flew a drone in the area the day of the July 13 rally and had two crude explosive devices in his car parked near the site, designed for remote detonation.\n\nDetails have fueled the ire against the Secret Service for failing to prevent the shooting, but so far they fail to explain why an isolated young Bethel Park man – who lived with his parents, worked at a nursing home and was planning to continue his studies after earning an associate’s degree – became a would-be assassin.\n\nWhile many initially linked the attack to America’s heated political divides, more than 220 interviews, including with Crooks’ parents, and an examination of his home and some of his electronic devices and accounts have yet to uncover evidence of a clear motive, political or otherwise. Nothing in Crooks’ life that might have precipitated violence has emerged.\n\n“We’d love to have a road map that tells us exactly what he was thinking,” Wray said at the hearing Wednesday. “We haven’t found that yet.”\n\nAfter mass shootings, Americans have become accustomed to the painful wait for the answer to “why.” But the lack of obvious motive thus far for such a targeted attack on a former president and candidate has made that void particularly confounding.\n\nWas Crooks suffering from mental illness? Suicidal? Was he seeking infamy? Did he believe such an act would help him regain control of his life?\n\nWhile answers may still surface, experts say there may never be any fully satisfying explanation, especially if the evidence doesn’t fit into pre-existing notions about what lies behind an assassination attempt.\n\n“The challenge for all of us who aren’t committing this kind of violence is it doesn’t make any sense to us,” said Katherine Schweit, a former FBI special agent who authored a study to aid responses to active shooter incidents.\n\nA week of preparation and planning\n\nOn the morning of July 13, Thomas Matthew Crooks’ plans seemed to be in place.\n\nHe had been preparing since July 6, when he is believed to have registered for the Trump rally, conducted a Google search for how far away assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was from JFK in 1963 and visited the rally site in Butler, roughly 54 miles to the north of his home.\n\nHis efforts seemed to go unnoticed not just by law enforcement but by his parents, both licensed counselors, with whom he lived in Bethel Park, a middle-class neighborhood of one- and two-story brick homes dotted with 1950s metal awnings set among hilly streets with green lawns.\n\nNearby was Bethel Park High School, where as a student he often wore hunting clothes and was quiet – and where in the wake of the shooting former classmates disagreed over whether he was bullied. In May, he finished his associate’s degree after studying engineering science at the Community College of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh.\n\nAt some point, packages marked “hazardous materials” had been delivered to the house, according to the Wall Street Journal, which noted law enforcement officials said they might have been used in making the two explosives found in his vehicle and one in his home.\n\nAt the nursing home less than a mile from his house, where Crooks worked as a dietician’s assistant, he had asked to take Saturday off, ABC reported.\n\nOn Friday, one day before the rally, Crooks – who’d joined a sportsmen’s club with rifle and pistol ranges – went to shoot at a range, Wray told Congress without specifying where. He was a firearm enthusiast, and the family had 14 guns in the house. Last year, he purchased his AR-style rifle from his father – one his father had owned for a decade – in a private transaction that did not require a background check or paperwork.\n\nHis parents haven’t spoken publicly about whether they noticed their son showing signs of distress or talking about politics in the lead-up to the shooting. His father is a Libertarian and his mother a Democrat. Crooks donated $15 to ActBlue, a political action committee supporting Democrats, in January 2021, the day of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. But that fall, he registered to vote in Allegheny County as a Republican.\n\nWhen the day of the rally arrived, Wray said Crooks told his father that he was going to shoot at the range. “He didn’t go to the range and he didn’t come back,” Wray said.\n\nInstead, Crooks ran some errands that morning, apparently buying a ladder from a Home Depot according to a bloody receipt found on him after snipers shot and killed him.\n\nHe also purchased 50 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Among the gun stores contacted by police following the shooting was the Allegheny Arms & Gun Works, open Saturday mornings in a strip mall near a nail salon and a Mexican restaurant. Josh Rowe, the store’s co-owner, previously told USA TODAY that he was cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nIt takes about an hour to reach the rust-belt working-class city of Butler from Crooks’ home, and authorities say he was in Butler that morning.\n\nOfficials have not said which route he took, whether he crossed the Ohio River in downtown Pittsburgh or perhaps took the bridge over Neville Island, which is home to the Robert Morris University Island Sports Center, part of the college he had planned to attend in the fall.\n\nThe drive to Butler requires exiting onto winding, two-lane country roads before the Farm Show comes into view. On that day, American flags were hung from the lifts of two trucks in preparation for the Trump rally that evening.\n\nWearing a T-shirt that bore the logo of Demolition Ranch, a popular YouTube channel hosted by a gun influencer, Crooks stayed at the site for 70 minutes that morning, Wray said, then left before returning in the afternoon. He parked a car containing explosive devices, a Hyundai Sonata, according to the Wall Street Journal, somewhere near the venue.\n\nHis drone flew at about 3:50 p.m. for about 11 minutes, apparently live streaming over an area about 200 yards from the stage where Trump would speak, the FBI said. The drone didn’t record video, Wray said.\n\nAt some point that Saturday, Crooks’ parents called the police to say they were concerned because he had gone missing, Wray said, although he wasn’t certain if that was before or after the shooting.\n\nWray also said this week the FBI is still trying to determine if the shooter carried the rifle with him that day or had hidden it somewhere ahead of time.\n\nSome law enforcement officials spotted Crooks with a backpack and identified him as suspicious, Pennsylvania law enforcement officials have said. One officer reportedly took two photos of him and texted them around.\n\nCrooks still managed to approach the American Glass Research building, which abuts the rally grounds.\n\nThe search for a motive\n\nOne day after Crooks nearly took Trump’s life – and killed 50-year-old firefighter and father Corey Comperatore, while wounding two others – FBI officials told reporters they had yet to uncover a motive.\n\nAbout two weeks later, despite assigning hundreds of agents, gaining access to the shooter’s phone and interviewing hundreds of people, why he showed up at the Farm Show rally with a rifle still remains a mystery – unusual in the age of social media and the Internet.\n\n“A lot of the usual kind of low-hanging-fruit places that we would find that have not yielded significant clues,” Wray testified Wednesday.\n\n“Having said that, we have seen indications that he was interested in public figures,” Wray added.\n\nCrooks’ search history included seeking information about President Joe Biden, the Democratic National Convention, Attorney General Merrick Garland, a British royal and Wray himself, according to New York Times reporting that cited two unnamed officials.\n\nSchweit, a former FBI special agent, told USA TODAY that after two weeks of work the lack of definitive evidence of a politically partisan motive for trying to assassinate Trump may be telling.\n\n“It makes me think they might never find anything hard and fast – I mean, these investigators know what they’re doing,” Schweit said.\n\nAlong with looking up Oswald’s assassination of President John F. Kennedy, officials told lawmakers on July 17 that Crooks researched high school mass shooter Ethan Crumbley, who is serving a life sentence after killing four of his Oxford, Michigan classmates when he was 15 years old, according to CNN and the Washington Post.\n\n“That has been a common trend among many juvenile mass shooters – they will do research, they will copy and want to emulate other attackers,” John Horgan, a Georgia State University psychology professor who researches violent extremism, told USA TODAY.\n\nSchweit said sometimes a person decides to commit targeted violence before they have a target in mind. Take the 2016 Pulse shooter, Omar Mateen, who killed 49 and wounded 53 at an Orlando gay nightclub in 2016, she said. It was later learned that Mateen, who pledged allegiance to ISIS’s leader, didn’t have Pulse as the planned target before that night, and may not have even known it was a gay nightclub.\n\n“He decided to go ahead and commit targeted violence, and then he had to find the right targeted violence to commit,” Schweit said.\n\nCrooks had also researched major depressive disorder, officials reportedly told lawmakers on July 17. That has raised questions about whether Crooks dealt with mental health issues.\n\nA desire for suicide can be a factor when it comes to explaining violent acts that can result in the death of the perpetrator, according to Colin Clarke, a terrorism and security researcher at The Soufan Group consultancy.\n\n“My own take on why he did it was, I think this was somebody that was deeply depressed, struggling with mental illness, decided that they were going to end their life, and wanted to do it in a really high profile way,” Clarke told USA TODAY.\n\nWray also said Wednesday that many people described Crooks in interviews as a loner. The ongoing analysis of his devices, geolocation data and accounts fit that description, he said.\n\n“His list of contacts for example is very short compared to what you would normally see from most people,” Wray said. But because Crooks used encrypted applications, the FBI is still trying to access that content as part of its ongoing investigation, Wray said.\n\nIt’s more common, however, for such perpetrators to reveal key plot points and intentions to friends, family members or co-workers, Horgan said.\n\n“I think anyone who plans an event like this knows that we are going to pick apart their motivation,” Horgan said. “So either they take steps to conceal and confound us, or, quite frankly, they just don't care.”\n\nInvestigation continues into how, and why\n\nAs Trump took the stage just after 6 p.m., Crooks was moving into position.\n\nThe roof of the industrial building 150 yards from Trump’s podium, which houses a company that manufactures equipment for the bottle industry, didn’t have a guard on the roof even though police were reportedly stationed inside.\n\nThe FBI said investigators believe Crooks climbed the roof by scaling mechanical equipment on the ground and piping on the side of the building. It was hot that day – in the 80s – and hotter up on the roof.\n\n“Someone’s on top of the roof,” a man said in a video posted on social media, after Trump had started speaking. Crooks began shooting nearly a minute and a half later, a Washington Post analysis found.\n\nPennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris testified that Crooks was on the roof for roughly three minutes before he fired, CNN reported.\n\nAt 6:12 p.m., Trump was swarmed by Secret Service agents and led wounded from the stage.\n\nIt didn’t take long after the shooting for outrage among lawmakers to build over what critics said were security lapses in protecting the former president. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, excoriated by a congressional committee, resigned over what she acknowledged was a significant failure.\n\nWhile last week’s congressional grilling is now past, the FBI investigation into how and why it happened is still ongoing. That includes continuing to dig into the shooter’s electronic devices and accounts, some of which remain to be examined.\n\nThere’s likely more to learn about the source of the explosives. Wray said the two devices in the car had receivers that could allow them to be detonated remotely, and the object with an antenna found on the roof with Crooks was a transmitter. However, the FBI so far believes detonation from the roof wouldn’t have worked because the receivers were switched off.\n\nIn addition, although the FBI believes Crooks only managed to fire eight shots, the fact that he had dozens of rounds of ammunition with him during the attack raises questions about the scope of his intentions.\n\nIt’s typical for a perpetrator to come to the scene of a targeted shooting with more ammunition than they could possibly shoot, which can help them feel more in control, according to Schweit. The ammunition and explosive devices could also indicate an interest in killing more people than just Trump, even if Trump was the primary target.\n\nIt’s possible time will help fill in the blanks when it comes to motive.\n\nFor years, the public had little information on why 64-year-old shooter Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a Las Vegas concert in 2017. But a trove of FBI-released documents in 2023 indicated he may have been driven by anger at how casinos were treating him.\n\n“We’re going to leave no stone unturned,” Wray said. “The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI’s investigation is very much ongoing.”\n\nOn Thursday, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa released the body cam footage from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit, obtained via congressional request.\n\nIn a statement, Grassley said he was concerned by the “fragmented and delayed chain of communication between local law enforcement” and the “seemingly delayed response in identifying and disabling a potential detonator device” related to the shooter’s explosives.\n\nThe three videos together run 28 minutes, starting at around 6:27 p.m., minutes after the former president was shot. By then, Crooks lay prone on the roof above, face down – shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\n“I’m trying to figure out how this guy got here,” a Beaver County officer asks in one clip as he approaches the single-story building outside the security perimeter.\n\nHe was not the only one who was confused. In the aftermath, a friend from a community college mathematics book club texted Crooks’s phone on learning that he had been identified as the shooter, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n“Isn’t that crazy,” the friend wrote, “they think it’s you.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/01/new-orleans-vehicle-crash-bourbon-street-fatalities-shooting/77375188007/", "title": "New Orleans truck attack investigators look for motive behind rampage", "text": "An armed man drove a speeding truck into a New Year's Eve celebration on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter early Wednesday, killing at least 15 and injuring more than 30 before being shot and killed by police in what the FBI is calling a terrorist assault.\n\n\"We are working with our partners to investigate this as an act of terrorism,\" the FBI said in a statement.\n\nThe pick-up truck crashed into the crowd at high speed around 3:15 a.m. CST and within moments the driver started firing on police officers from inside the vehicle, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said.

The ISIS flag was found in his vehicle, which he rented to conduct this attack.\"\n\n\"The law enforcement intelligence community are continuing to look for any connections, associations or co-conspirators,\" Biden said. \"We have nothing additional report at this time, the investigation is continuing to be active, and no one should jump to conclusions.\"\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nLoved ones begin to identify victims: 'Beloved teammate' and 'outgoing'\n\nLaw enforcement and officials in New Orleans have not publicly identified any of the victims but family and friends began to identify some of the 15 people killed on Wednesday.\n\nMartin \"Tiger\" Bech, 28, a former Princeton football player; Nikyra Cheyenne Dedeaux, an 18-year-old who recently graduated high school; father of two Reggie Hunter, 37; and 27-year-old mother Nicole Perez were among those killed in the attack.\n\nMelissa Dedeaux, Nikyra Cheyenne Dedeaux's mother told USA TODAY, that her daughter likely wanted to have some fun before starting a nursing program in January.

As he negotiated his second divorce two years ago, his attorney attached records to court files indicating Jabbar’s finances were limited.\n\nJabbar enlisted in the Army in 2007, at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan when more than 100,000 U.S. troops had deployed to war zones, according to the Army and a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jabbar deployed to Afghanistan from Feb. 2009 until Jan. 2015.\n\nAfter his deployment, Jabbar joined the Army Reserve and continued serving as an IT specialist until July 2020.

The driver, the sole occupant of the vehicle who has not yet been named by authorities, drove the vehicle up and down Las Vegas Boulevard before pulling in front of the Trump hotel.\n\nThe vehicle sat there about 15 seconds before the explosion went off, killing the driver, McMahill said. Police later discovered gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters, and large firework mortars in the back of the vehicle.\n\nThe explosion occurred hours after the deadly attack involving a truck in New Orleans on New Year's Day. President Joe Biden said federal authorities are investigating whether there may be a link between the fatal truck assault and the explosion in Las Vegas.\n\n— Eve Chen, Bailey Schulz, and Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nVehicles in New Orleans, Vegas incidents rented from same company\n\nTuro confirmed Wednesday that the vehicles involved in the Las Vegas explosion and New Orleans attack were rented from the peer-to-peer car rental service.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families,\" Turo said in a statement. \"We are devastated by these horrible incidents, and remain dedicated to helping the authorities however we can.\"\n\nTuro said its trust and safety team is working with law enforcement to \"share any information that could be helpful in their investigations.\"\n\nThe company noted that it does not believe that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat and that the company was not aware of any information suggesting the two incidents are related.\n\n— Thao Nguyen\n\nSecurity barriers in French Quarter were being replaced prior to attack\n\nSecurity barriers along Bourbon Street had been malfunctioning and were in the process of being replaced before Wednesday's attack, officials said.\n\nThe city began removing the barriers, known as bollards, in November as part of its Super Bowl infrastructure plan. Super Bowl LIX is scheduled to be played on Feb. 9 at the Caesars Superdome, about a mile from where the attack occurred.\n\n\"Bollards were not up because they are near completion, with the expectation of being completed by Super Bowl — way before Super Bowl,\" Cantrell said.\n\nThe bollards were initially installed in 2017 in response to recent \"vehicular attacks on pedestrian malls around the globe,\" according to officials. But shortly after the system was installed, the bollards began to malfunction due to being clogged by Mardi Gras beads, Cantrell said.\n\n— Thao Nguyen\n\nSugar Bowl postponed; Mardi Gras, Super Bowl security\n\nBourbon Street is a nightlife hub that draws thousands for New Year's Eve celebrations in New Orleans.\n\nThe city was also due to host the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the University of Georgia Bulldogs Wednesday night in the Sugar Bowl but the classic college football playoff quarterfinals annual match was postponed 24 hours until Thursday at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans due to the attack.\n\n\"We live in the fun and games world with what we do, but we certainly recognize the importance of this, and we're going to support it 100 percent,\" Jeff Hundley, the CEO of the Sugar Bowl, said during Wednesday afternoon's wide-ranging press conference.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he mobilized about 100 members of the National Guard in a military police unit to help protect New Orleans and the Sugar Bowl while authorities investigate the attack.\n\n\"It is important for our citizens and guests of the state to know that we’re doing everything that we can to secure their safety and the city,\" Landry said. \"The Superdome and the surrounding area is safe.\"\n\nLandry said he planned to attend the Sugar Bowl college football game to demonstrate it is safe.\n\n\"I’ll tell you one thing: Your governor is going to be there,\" Landry said. \"That is proof, believe you me, that the facility and the city is safer than it was yesterday.\"\n\nLandry said he had expected to issue an emergency declaration Thursday to coordinate local, state, and federal authorities for Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 and for Mardi Gras, which is scheduled to begin on Monday.\n\nThe Louisiana governor added that he moved the declaration to Wednesday because of the attack. The Sugar Bowl New Year's parade took place Tuesday afternoon in the same area as the crash.\n\nBourbon Street closed, scene under investigation\n\nAuthorities said Wednesday afternoon that the popular Bourbon Street corridor will remain closed because it’s an “active crime scene,” Cantrell said.\n\nBourbon Street runs through the center of the quarter, which is beloved around the world for its bars, hotels, boutiques, museums, and restaurants – representing a melting pot of African diaspora and French cultures. Locals are known to explain to visitors that the cultural district represents the northern coast of the Caribbean.\n\nEach year, the Carnival Season starts in January in New Orleans, leading to Mardi Gras parades every February or March in and around Bourbon Street. This year, celebrations tied to the Super Bowl are expected to add to the overflow of festivities.\n\nThe historic street blocks that make up the French Quarter comprised the original town of New Orleans founded by the French in the early 1700s, and many of the buildings, known for their wrought iron balconies, are over 200 years old.\n\nThe French Quarter survived flooding from Hurricane Katrina better than other parts of town because the geography of New Orleans means some areas farther from the Gulf Coast are actually nearer to sea-level elevation. Nestled on higher ground along the Mississippi River, the French Quarter was not inundated after canals in neighborhoods to the north were overwhelmed when Katrina hit the city in late August 2005.\n\nBiden briefed on attack; Trump responds\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who traveled from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to Camp David in Maryland on Wednesday, issued a statement noting that he is continually briefed by federal law enforcement leadership and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBiden added that the attack was being investigated as an \"act of terrorism.\"\n\n\"I am grateful for the brave and swift response of local law enforcement in preventing even greater death and injury,\" the president said in the statement. \"I have directed my team to ensure every resource is available as federal, state, and local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining threat of any kind.\"\n\nThe FBI, Justice Department's National Security Division, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and federal prosecutors in Louisiana are working with state and local law enforcement in response to the attack, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, on his Truth Social platform, called the attack \"pure evil.\"\n\n\"When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true,\" Trump said. \"The crime rate in our country is at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones, including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!\"\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said on social media that those responsible for the attack would be brought to justice and threatened to seek the death penalty.\n\n\"In Louisiana we have the death penalty and we will carry it out!\" Murrill wrote on X.\n\nDetails on Wednesday's attack emerged almost instantly on social media. NOLA Ready, the city's official disaster preparedness agency, confirmed before 6 a.m. CST that there had been a \"mass casualty incident involving a vehicle that drove into a large crowd on Canal and Bourbon Street.\"\n\nIt said there were injured patients who had been transported by New Orleans Emergency Medical Services, adding: \"Public safety partners are responding on scene.\"\n\nDC security heightened ahead of major events, Trump inauguration\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., heightened its security Wednesday across the city out of an abundance of caution after the New Orleans attack, though there is no known threat to the city, according to Paris Lewbel, deputy director of communications for the department.\n\n\"While we do not discuss specifics regarding operations, tactics, or staffing, the community will notice an increased police presence throughout the city,\" Lewbel said. \"As the nation’s capital, we maintain a heightened level of security at all times to ensure the safety of our residents, businesses, and visitors.\"\n\nHigh-profile events that could attract crowds to the city in the immediate future include the convening of the new Congress on Friday, the counting of Electoral College votes on Monday, former President Jimmy Carter's funeral proceedings Tuesday through Thursday, and President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\n“As we approach upcoming major events in the District of Columbia, MPD will continue working with our local and federal partners to assess potential threats and make any necessary adjustments to safeguard the community,” Lewbel said.\n\nSecurity addressed for other college bowl games\n\nThe Sugar Bowl is one of the oldest bowl games in the country, along with the Orange Bowl and Sun Bowl.\n\n\"The Sugar Bowl is huge. Lots of people will be watching,\" Juliette Kayyem, a former top U.S. Department of Homeland Security official, told CNN. \"It should go on. The police department has lots of resources to draw on. It can protect the investigation and also draw on other local and state resources to protect people going to the bowl.”\n\nShe added: “This is the way that big cities have to work. Unfortunately, we want to provide what might even be security theater at this stage, lots and lots of law enforcement presence to make the city and people attending understand that they are safe, to stop anyone who might want to copycat at this stage, and then you let the investigation and the mourning continue simultaneously. It's just the nature of how these things happen is that you have both these horrible incidences, and then you have to prepare for the next big event. And this is when we've seen in prior instances as well.”\n\nIn Atlanta, the Peach Bowl game between the University of Texas Longhorns and Arizona State Sun Devils kicked off on Wednesday hours after the city's police department said on social media that it planned to have heightened security in light of the New Orleans attack.\n\nOfficials in Pasadena, California, where the prestigious Rose Bowl kicked off Wednesday afternoon, also expressed their condolences for New Orleans. According to the Pasadena Now news site, officials planned to move ahead with the game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Oregon Ducks. They reassured the public about Rose Parade security.\n\n“The Tournament of Roses and the City of Pasadena extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans following this morning’s tragic events,” the statement read. “We stand in solidarity with the entire state during this difficult time.”\n\nIt added, “The City of Pasadena undergoes months of preparations leading up to the Parade and Game in coordination with our Federal, State, County and Local partners. We continually train throughout the year with our Tournament of Roses and Rose Bowl Stadium partners for various scenarios . . . The Parade is a top-level Federal event and we have to ability to call in additional resources if the need exists.”\n\nThe University of Georgia expressed solidarity with the city of New Orleans, adding that it is working to determine if any of its students or faculty were among the victims of Wednesday's attack.\n\n\"We are horrified and saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred in the early hours of New Year’s Day in New Orleans,\" the University of Georgia said in a post on X. \"University personnel are working to determine if any UGA students, faculty, staff, alumni or fans were among the victims. We offer our deepest condolences to all the victims and their families, and we stand in solidarity with the New Orleans community.\"\n\nNew Orleans police said they'll be ready for upcoming events. The department is deploying resources at a level like other recent major events, such as the Taylor Swift concert. NOPD will work alongside local, state and federal partners to provide extensive security coverage across the city.\n\n“Residents and visitors can expect to see a strong presence of marked and unmarked police vehicles, as well as officers on foot, bike, and horseback as part of the department’s Mounted Patrol,” Kirkpatrick said. “This increased visibility will enhance public safety, provide crowd control, and allow for rapid response to any incidents.”\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/05/two-cases-going-viral-question-police-force-profiling/2885769/", "title": "Two cases going viral question police force, profiling", "text": "Yamiche Alcindor\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSocial media is playing a stronger role in bringing police excessive force to the forefront\n\nOne man shot after car broke down%3B other run over by a police cruiser\n\nSome say the internet scrutiny can lead to unfair accusations against police\n\nThe stories of two black men killed during interactions with police officers have set the internet ablaze and resurfaced questions about racial profiling, police brutality, and the power of social media.\n\nMarlon Brown, 38, and Jonathan Ferrell, 24, both lost their lives during incidents with police officers who have now come under fire for their actions. A video of a police cruiser chasing Brown and then rolling over his body led to the officer's firing and an ongoing campaign to see charges brought against that officer.\n\nAn officer who shot Ferrell, who was unarmed, 10 times is now facing a voluntary manslaughter charge.\n\nExperts say both cases illustrate that social media and technology have led to closer scrutinization of police behavior. Many pointed to the case of Rodney King, the black motorist whose videotaped 1991 beating by white police officers helped spark the deadly Los Angeles riots, as an example of the historical power of earlier technology.\n\n\"In the past, the police would make up stories that were inaccurate because they were the only witnesses,\" said Kevin Flesch, a criminal defense attorney who has worked on police brutality cases since 1996. \"They can't sort of ban together as they did before and these things can go viral because you can see them more quickly.\"\n\nIn his view, the stories of Brown and Ferrell and the national attention they are getting is indicative of this change. The outrage that has ensued has brought pressure that may not have been possible without the ability to spread the word about these stories. Websites and social media conversations carried the stories out of southern cities and into the living rooms of people across the country.\n\nFor Brown, the video of him running from police in DeLand, Fla. moments before he was killed remains a central part of his story. On May 8 at about 12:30 a.m.,a police officer tried to pull over Brown for a seat belt violation. In response, Brown took off in the car and later began running on foot from police. In a police dash camera video, Officer James Harris is seen driving behind Brown. What happened next remains an issue of contention.\n\nThe medical examiner's report says Brown slipped while he was running and Harris' vehicle came to rest on top of Brown who then suffocated. Brown's autopsy was conducted by Shiping Bao, a controversial figure who also conducted Trayvon Martin's autopsy and has since been fired. However, Marie Herrmann, Chief Medical Examiner of Volusia County reviewed the findings and signed off on them.\n\nStill, Brown's family maintains that the police officer struck Brown and should be charged with homicide. A video of the chase has gone viral eliciting arguments about what is shown. Despite the differing opinions, DeLand Police Chief William Ridgway, after viewing the tape, fired Officer Harris.\n\n\"The actions taken by Officer Harris that night are not consistent with our department's training, directives, or accepted practices or techniques,\" said Ridgway in a statement, adding that the department is continuing to internally review the incident.\n\nFerrell's death in Charlotte, N.C. got an even quicker response from police and the public. At around 2 a.m. Sept. 14th, Ferrell , after dropping off a co-worker, likely missed a curb and ended up in a ravine, said Christopher Chestnut an attorney for Ferrell's family. The young man then kicked out a window in the car and knocked on the door of a nearby home. A woman who was home alone with her child called 911 and reported that a burglar was attempting to enter her home.\n\nMinutes later, three police officers arrived, Chesnut said.\n\nAccording to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, Ferrell ran towards the officers. One unsuccessfully tried to taser him. The other, Officer Randall Kerrick, fatally shot Ferrell 10 times. The same day police charged Kerrick with voluntary manslaughter saying he used excessive force.\n\nThough it appears Kerrick will have to explain his actions to a judge, Chesnut is still pushing for the police dash camera video of the incident to be released. He says it shows a barefoot Ferrell approached officers with his hands up and recorded the rapid fire shots.\n\nAllowing the public to see the video will help the country address why it happened and how Ferrell's story connects with Brown's and others, Chestnut said.\n\n\"America should address and confront the image of black men,\" said Chesnut, explaining that stereotypes of black men as dangerous contributed to Ferrell's death. \"I don't think race is the factor but I think it was a factor that led to him being shot 10 times.\"\n\nBen Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon, agrees and is now helping Brown's family push for charges. Like several others, Crump says Brown's race made officers chase him for a seemingly minor offense.\n\n\"There seems to be an insensitivity for the life of young black males,\" Crump said. \"It seems to suggest that it's OK to be reckless when it comes to police interactions with black males.\"\n\nBacking that stance up is what Brown's family says is objective evidence: the video of the last moments of Brown's life.\n\n\"Once America had seen the video, a lot of people's opinions changed,\" said Krystal Brown, Marlon Brown's ex-wife. \"Little old DeLand is the spotlight for Marlon but injustice is happening everywhere.\"\n\nBut Bill Manion, a forensic pathologist in New Jersey, also believes Brown was not hit by the car. Manion says Brown lacked fractures in his legs, arms, hips, head and other areas that would be consistent with such an impact.\n\nIn this case, what some in the public think they see is not supported by science.\n\nThe dilemma can cause people to wrongly second guess police officers, said Todd Walther, president of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 9. The organization is providing the attorney for Kerrick, who is a member, to fight the charges in Ferrell's death.\n\nWalther wouldn't talk about Kerrick but did offer that training not technology makes officers act correctly.\n\n\"People make judgements on two seconds of a video that may be twenty minutes long,\" he said, \"You just have to wait and see the entire story that comes out in any situation.\"\n\nNo doubt, many people are waiting to see how the stories of Ferrell and Brown play out.\n\nKing's beating by four white police officers following a high-speed car chase was caught on videotape by an amateur cameraman, who gave a copy to a local TV station. Three officers were initially acquitted of assault and excessive force charges. A mistrial was declared for a fourth. However, riots followed and later, two officers were convicted of federal charges. King got a $3.8 million settlement in a civil rights case.\n\nIn 2009, Victor Steen, 17, was killed while riding his bike when he refused to stop for a police officer, according to various reports. The officer fired a taser at Steen and then ran the teen over with his police cruiser. The incident was captured on video and viewed nearly 30,000 times on YouTube. A judge later ruled that the officer had not committed any crimes, reports said.\n\nKrystal Brown, last Friday, filed a complaint with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Medical Examiners Commission saying the findings of the Volusia County Medical Examiner's office \"defy logic, common sense, and seemingly scientific principles.\" She's asking for an independent investigation into Brown's death and into whether Herrmann violated any rules.\n\nLast Saturday, the family of Ferrell buried the young man who had hoped to become a mechanical engineer and who was working two jobs to save money to go school. His family may likely face his killer in court.\n\nAt each solemn step, the public will be watching.\n\nMark Anthony Neal, an African & African-American Studies professor at Duke University, said that type of mass surveillance will help others question the acts of police officers but may also desensitize people to such stories.\n\n\"There is still a difficulty in seeing the humanity of black men,\" Neal said. \"Our ability to capture these stories overwhelms our ability to process them.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/31/helicopter-crash-victims-army-blackhawk/78094399007/", "title": "Army IDs 2 soldiers killed in helicopter, plane crash", "text": "The U.S. Army on Friday released the names of two of the three soldiers who were killed Wednesday when their Black Hawk helicopter collided with a passenger jet near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\nPending identification, Army officials say 28-year-old Staff Sgt.

LaReau\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nBeau Boeckmann stood outside his Ford dealership in the San Fernando Valley last week staring at a thick cloud of smoke that enveloped the sky a mere 9 miles to the south. The raging Palisades wildfire was far enough away for Boeckman to feel secure at that moment, but close enough to stir a sense of unease in his gut.\n\nBoeckmann owns Galpin Ford, one of the nation's three largest Ford dealerships that sells about 20,000 new and used cars a year. He thanked \"the grace of God\" that his business and employees remain unharmed. But a customer who lost their home and car to the wildfires has already shown up to buy a new car. Boeckmann has no sense yet as to how many more will appear or how many vehicles have been destroyed. But he expects it will be a lot based on the destruction he sees.\n\n“There is more than one dark cloud over Los Angeles — there's a physical black cloud and an emotional one,” Boeckmann told the Free Press on Monday evening, describing his state of mind as one of shock at the devastation.\n\nExperts agreed. Human tragedy notwithstanding, the wildfires continued to sweep through the nation's second-largest car market this week and thousands of vehicles will likely be totaled by the time it is over. The result will impact both Detroit automakers and car buyers, as a rush in demand to replace destroyed cars drives prices higher — especially in the used car market where inventory remains tight.\n\n\"Depending on the severity of the number of vehicles lost, a large amount would have an impact on (used car) prices at a national level,\" said Jonathan Banks, general manager of vehicle valuations at J.D. Power. \"To put this in perspective, it is believed that 250,000 vehicles were lost in Hurricane Sandy in 2012. We predicted a $300 per unit increase from this impact.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nBanks did not recall the final impact, but he knew it \"exceeded our estimate in 2012.\"\n\nThousands of vehicle sales already lost\n\nThe number of vehicles destroyed in the fires is not yet known, but photographs show many skeletal charred remnants of what were once cars.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Forestry, more than 12,300 structures have been destroyed since the fires started shortly after midnight Jan. 1. That figure includes vehicles as \"structures,\" fire officials have said in published reports. At least 25 people are reported to have died. The total economic damage and loss is estimated to be $250 billion to $275 billion, according to AccuWeather.\n\nKevin Roberts, director of economic and market Intelligence at car shopping site CarGurus, told the Free Press its analysis showed about 25,000 new and used vehicles are listed in ZIP codes that have been impacted by evacuation orders or warnings in Los Angeles County. This represents about 6% of listings within the state of California in a region that typically features higher-priced vehicles. Roberts said the average list price for new and used cars in the impacted ZIP codes is $52,000, 25% higher than the average listing in the state.\n\nThe Los Angeles market is the second-largest car market in the United States behind New York City. Los Angeles accounts for about 800,000 retail sales of new vehicles a year, or 6.1% of the retail auto sales in the nation, said Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Power. Detroit accounts for 2.3%.\n\nJominy said J.D. Power's data showed that during the first week of the fires, Los Angeles' share of new vehicle sales fell 0.6%, or by about 1,000 vehicles from Dec. 31 through Jan. 5. While the drop could be related many things, Jominy said “concerns about fire and buying a car at that time\" is the most likely cause to keep car buyers from purchases.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, the data firm estimated that for January, sales of new vehicles in Los Angeles could decline by 5,000 to 13,000 vehicles as people either delay purchases to get their lives back in order — or they buy a used car.\n\nBut for those who want a new vehicle, the Detroit automakers could see overall sales gains. Los Angeles is such a vast market that even if only some of the people who lost cars in the fires opt to buy a new vehicle rather than a used one, the Detroit Three would experience an uptick, Jominy said.\n\n“Not to ignore the human element here, but there typically is a small upside in times like this and it comes in the form of people replacing lost vehicles and puts more car buyers in the marketplace,” Jominy said. “But after a couple of months, things stabilize.”\n\nBob Smith, executive director of the Greater Los Angeles New Car Dealers Association, told the Free Press late Wednesday that most franchise car dealerships in Los Angeles are operating, but many dealership employees have lost homes. Smith said the association will work with the National Auto Dealers Association, which has a relief fund to help those people get back on their feet.\n\nSmith said there are \"a million stories\" of people who know someone who has been impacted by the fires, but it's difficult to ascertain how many have lost their cars. Still, he is confident that, beyond a boost in used cars, Los Angeles car dealerships will also see a surge in new car sales in terms of leases.\n\n\"I'm just spitballing, but I'd have to guess there are some 2,500 vehicles on the low end that will need to be replaced, and 5,000 on the high end,\" Smith said. \"But I'm guessing.\"\n\nAutomotive industry: Detroit Auto Show flaunts the old and the new at iconic car show\n\nHow high will used prices go?\n\nThe reason experts anticipate the used car market will see most of the demand for replacement vehicles from the fires is because most people will not get an insurance payout for weeks, Jominy said, but they need a vehicle immediately. Given that they don't have a trade-in and perhaps no insurance payout yet, they seek what is most affordable.\n\nWhile used vehicle prices are high, they remain lower than that of new cars. The average transaction price for a new car in the fourth quarter was about $45,000 compared with a used car at an average of $28,740, according to J.D. Powers' Banks.\n\nBanks said buyers coming into the market looking for a newer model used vehicle will be facing supplies about 8% below last year or 15% below levels in 2019. That's because three-year lease returns are scarce with expected supply close to 30% below 2019 levels.\n\nCox Automotive data said used vehicle inventory nationally at the start of January was 2.217 million vehicles, but that figure only counts the used cars available through registered dealerships, not used cars for sale by private owners.\n\nTight supply pushed the average monthly payment for a used car to $541 a month last year compared with $416 in 2019, before COVID-19 hit, Banks said. That's still below the average monthly payment for a new car, which was $725 a month for December, he said. That figure includes both purchases and leases factored together.\n\nBanks said many used vehicles are likely to be shipped from other states to California to meet demand there. That, combined with the already-tight supply of used vehicles nationally, will increase overall demand for wholesale used models, thus driving up the prices.\n\n\"That being said, I don't expect the upward movement to be too severe because prices are already high,\" Banks said. \"There may be some expensive vehicles in the direct area, and I would encourage consumers to look beyond their immediate area to find the right vehicle they need at a good price.\"\n\nOn the new side, all is good\n\nBanks agreed with others that this catastrophe should help boost new vehicle sales for those who do choose to replace their destroyed vehicle with a new product. In that case, it likely won't force higher prices because inventory of new cars is strong.\n\n\"I would expect discounts will still be available and remain unchanged,\" Banks said of new cars.\n\nThe available number of new vehicles has been near 3 million for most of the fourth quarter, roughly double what it was just two years ago and close to pre-pandemic norms, said Mark Schirmer, Cox Automotive's director of industry insights and corporate communications. He added that December was a strong sales month, pulling down the nation's available new car inventory to 2.88 million vehicles as of Jan. 16.\n\n\"So certainly product is available for those who need replacements. There are, of course, the logistics of moving vehicles into local dealers. That will take time,\" Schirmer said. \"Vehicle shipping costs are also lower year over year by 2.8%, and have been generally tracking lower through 2024.\"\n\nSchirmer said hopefully the evacuation efforts got most vehicles out of the path of the fire, but noted, \"we've seen the images of burned-out cars — but we don't have an estimate on the number lost. It likely won't be enough to overwhelm the available supply of replacement vehicles.\"\n\nWhat the automakers are doing to help\n\nIn the meantime, some automakers are doing what they can to help Los Angeles residents affected by the fires.\n\nFord Motor Co. spokesman Said Deep told the Free Press that most of Ford's 83 dealerships in the Los Angeles region have been open and operational. Some were closed due to the proximity to fires and others reported power outages, Deep said, but all employees and their families are safe.\n\nThe automaker is giving the employee pricing plan to those consumers affected by the fires, Deep said. In addition, Ford Credit is offering deferred payments to existing customers impacted by the fires.\n\nFord also announced two grants. One for $100,000 will go to the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation and one for $150,000 to the California Community Foundation's Wildfire Recovery Fund. Ford Philanthropy also supports the American Red Cross, Feeding America and Team Rubicon, which provide shelter, food and other on-the-ground support.\n\nIt is still too early to determine how many General Motors vehicles have been impacted to assess the inventory needed to replenish the area, GM spokeswoman Tara Kuhnen told the Free Press in an email. But to help Los Angeles drivers, GM turned on complimentary OnStar Crisis Assist Services for Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac customers impacted by the wildfires, Kuhnen said.\n\n“The health and safety of our employees and their families is our highest priority, and we have closed our facilities in the affected area,” GM said in a statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Honda announced it is doubling its previously announced $500,000 donation for disaster relief funds to the American Red Cross, bringing the total to $1 million to support the people impacted by the wildfires. Honda Financial Services and Acura Financial Services also are offering payment extensions and lease deferrals to customers impacted by the fires.\n\nStellantis said it will offer employee pricing to those affected, and its finance partners are also providing relief to affected customers.\n\nDetroit vs. LA as car capital\n\nBack at Galpin, Boeckmann said he had a staff meeting to tell his team to go through its vast customer database to see who might be in affected wildfire areas and to give them a call — but not to sell them a car. Rather, to offer them help.\n\n\"If they need a car, I’m happy to give them a car to use for a while,\" Boeckmann said. \"You’re not calling to get something, you’re calling to give something.\"\n\nWhen the smoke clears — both literally and figuratively — Smith, of the Greater Los Angeles New Car Dealers Association, said the auto industry will put the survivors back on wheels.\n\n\"Detroit is the car capital, but LA makes a claim for that title, too, because of how widespread and populated it is. The people who don't leave, will need cars,\" Smith said. \"People who want to rebuild, will find a way to get repositioned in cars. If there's any silver lining to this, it's that there's good inventory of new vehicles in the market to satisfy those people who need them.\"\n\nFree Press staff writers Eric D.

Often, the only sound comes from rustling leaves as they fall in a chill October breeze. That said, according to some visitors, other sounds might be heard, including the laughter of children.\n\nAs such, they often draw historians, folklorists, paranormal investigators, and the merely curious. But whatever beliefs a person has about the supernatural, one thing is known for certain: in our local cemeteries, one can find not only secrets of the dead, but stories of those who lived.\n\nAmong them: people who were enslaved, treated as property both by law and custom. But like everyone, they had hopes, dreams, and humanity. And, they had names, to be remembered: Thomas. Flova. And those whose names were not recorded, or which are now unreadable due to weather, wear or damage.\n\nIn the same earth lies graves of those who held others in bondage, and so the ground itself becomes a place of history's terrible reckoning.\n\nThere are those who went to their graves early, from injuries sustained in war, or from diseases whose causes were little understood, but whose toll was writ large in death, and grief.\n\nNeed a break?

So it went for one Joseph Palmer, in Leominster.\n\nAs Halloween nears, places of burial may find themselves a particular lure for those in search of ghosts, or rumors of ghosts. They are places to visit to learn, understand, and to pay respects.\n\nIn putting together these brief cemeteries of some of the region's most striking graves and cemeteries, there are rules, written and unwritten, that should always be observed:\n\nRespect local visiting times. A night visit might be tempting, but it's almost universally prohibited except by special permissions.\n\nMany headstones are attractive for grave-rubbing, but if not done correctly, this can damage delicate stones. If you don't have permission and don't know how to do it properly, just don't do it.\n\nYes, the atmosphere of many cemeteries lend themselves to spooky photo shoots and TikTok videos, but the same courtesies apply. Get any required permissions, or look for other locations.\n\nAbove all, cemeteries and graves are places of sanctity. Learn, listen, and as the saying goes, leave nothing but footsteps, take nothing that does not belong to you, and bring with you the knowledge that graves can bestow upon the living.\n\nRural Cemetery in Worcester\n\nRural Cemetery in Worcester — more commonly known as Grove Street Cemetery — is definitely haunted ... not by ghosts or vampires, but by history. A beautifully landscaped cemetery established in 1838 and still active today, the cemetery is the final resting place of many of the families and towering figures who built the city. Indeed, names written on tombstones and mausoleums are echoed on public buildings, parks and more across the county: Thayer, Crompton, Bancroft, Clark and more. For a history buff, the cemetery is a touchstone to the city’s past, a reminder that, in many ways, the people who built the city and made it what is today are still with us today. For journalism aficionados, there’s one resident who stands above all others: Isaiah Thomas Sr.\n\nThomas was the publisher of the Massachusetts Spy, a Revolutionary War-era newspaper which was one of the country’s first, and one of the first to take an editorial stand against the British in the days leading up to the war. Although the editorials were written under pseudonyms, Thomas was forced to retreat to Worcester, where he continued publishing.\n\nThomas’ early resistance to British oppression was one of the sparks that lit the Revolution, so it seems strange that his tomb – conveniently placed near the cemeteries entrance – is rather nondescript, only identifiable by a plaque, although someone thought to put a small American flag in front of the grave, giving Thomas a modicum of the respect he deserves.\n\nWandering the paths aimlessly from there, one can meander into several of the city’s forefathers. The tomb of Jonas G. Clark – founder of Clark University – is clean and polished, practically glistening in the morning sun. Others are more worn with time. (It should be noted that several of the graves, including Thomas’, where relocated from cemeteries on the Worcester Common and Mechanics Street). History – and the cemetery’s caretakers – have been kind to the markers. But, time has taken its toll. One marker seems to simply be a rough-hewn stone, inscribed with only the words, “The Inn of a traveler on her way to Jerusalem.\" If there was ever any other identifier on the stone, it’s no longer visible.\n\nPerhaps the most strikingly beautiful and well-maintained mausoleum belongs to music teacher Walter Scott Kennedy and his wife, Ellen Frances Rogers — who was reputed to be the wealthiest woman in Worcester in the early 20th century.\n\nThe couple also left the city Elm Park’s Rogers-Kennedy Memorial, also known as “The New England Settlers.” Visitors can peek through the windows inside the mausoleum, which is as clean and well-kept as the building’s outside. On the walls are inscribed the words, “Death is no departure but arrival/no falling asleep, but waking/It is life which is the night, and death is daybreak.”\n\nAll told, Rural Cemetery is an inspiring place to visit, almost every inch of its beautiful grounds punctuated by some piece of Worcester history, long-gone specters of yesterday echoing quietly to remind the city of its past, lest it be forgotten. ― Victor D. Infante\n\nEvergreen Cemetery in Leominster\n\nLeominster’s Evergreen Cemetery has an oddly appropriate name, given the number of people buried there whose stories resonate today. Families in the city have buried their deceased relatives there for more than 150 years. Near the wrought-iron front gate, rows of small marble footstones mark the graves of U.S. military veterans of many wars and conflicts in the distant and not-so-distant past. .\n\nAcross from 248 Main St. lies a grave marker famous enough that someone created a Google Maps tag for its location. The first thing that draws your eyes to the marble stone isn’t the name, Joseph Palmer, but the carving of Palmer himself, with an enormous, long, Santa Claus-esque beard that became highly controversial in Leominster during his time.\n\nAfter serving in the War of 1812, Palmer returned and began growing out his facial hair, a daring move at a time when men were expected to be clean-shaven, and everyone was expected to follow such rules.\n\nAuthor Jeff Belanger, who researches and writes about New England lore, devoted a 2021 episode to Palmer's story in the New England Legends Podcast, which Belanger cohosts with Ray Auger. Belanger cited an 1890 Boston Globe article that stated Palmer grew the beard because of his Christian faith, but was subsequently accused by his pastor of worshiping the devil.\n\n“When people stick out because of the way they choose to dress, style their hair, or in this case, wear their facial hair, other folks take notice, and for whatever reason, some people get mad about the nonconformists,” Belanger said during the episode.\n\nIn May 1830, Palmer was walking through Fitchburg when four men armed with razors surrounded him, held him down, and tried to shave off his beard. He managed to escape by stabbing two of them with a pocketknife, but he was arrested for assault. He pled not guilty and was jailed for 15 months.\n\nPalmer kept the beard for the rest of his life. He died in1873. Beneath the carving on Palmer’s tombstone, above his name, there’s an inscription: “Persecuted for wearing the beard.”\n\nDue east of Palmer’s grave where the cemetery meets the trees, there is a long strip of grass without headstones or names, the legacy of a pandemic that ravaged Leominster 100 years before COVID-19.\n\nDuring the 1918 influenza pandemic, one of the deadliest in recorded history, 20 unidentified residents who succumbed to the virus were buried in one unmarked mass grave at Evergreen.\n\nIn late 2018, a century after the 1918 flu and only one year before COVID-19 was first detected in China’s Hubei province, the Leominster Historical Commission held a memorial ceremony for the unnamed influenza victims.\n\n“The bodies would decompose, and the people were afraid of infection, so they had to be immediately buried,” commission chairman Don Piermarini told the Sentinel & Enterprise. “The health department wanted you to get rid of that body as fast as possible.”\n\nWithin two years of that ceremony, when COVID-19 ripped through the world, mass graves and virus fatalities would re-enter the nationwide public consciousness. In April 2020, as New York City experienced catastrophic COVID death tolls, morgues became overfilled, and on Hart Island, where New York buries its unidentified or unclaimed bodies, 138 people were buried in one week.\n\nThere were other parallels between the 1918 flu and the most intense period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn both crises, Leominster shut down public gatherings of any kind, and residents were expected to wear masks that covered their noses and mouths in order to prevent virus particles from spreading through the air. Both viruses had, and COVID-19 still has, the potential to cause lifelong damage to survivors’ bodies.\n\nIn 2012, the Leominster Historical Society placed a marker on the Evergreen Cemetery mass grave, and though grass has grown over some of its corners, it’s still noticeable in the wide grass between two rows of older headstones.\n\nThe marker reads, “Here are buried some of the victims of the 1918 – 1919 influenza pandemic. May they rest in peace.” ― Meg Trogolo\n\nHope Cemetery in Worcester\n\nSitting between St. John's and Notre Dame Cemeteries, Hope Cemetery is one of the oldest remaining burial grounds in the area.\n\nIn autumn, 168 acres of rolling land is illuminated by the brilliant colors of the surrounding fall foliage, a crisp breeze keeps visitors comfortable as they walk the incredibly clean grounds.\n\nEstablished in 1852, the cemetery replaced at least six other local burial grounds were deemed overcrowded, with bodies of the deceased exhumed and relocated there. Thus, Hope Cemetery became Worcester's second garden cemetery, with a focus not only on those buried there, but also but the environment for those coming to visit their loved ones.\n\nAs with many cemeteries dating to the distant past, several ghost stories that go hand-in-hand with the cemetery between Webster Street and Hope Avenue. In the past, visitors have reported hearing children's laughter, specifically near a statue of Christ holding an angel. Other stories tell of a tall woman who tends to the flowers, but who always seems to disappear when approached.\n\nThe grounds are owned and operated by the city of Worcester, and burials take place year-round, with an average of 250 each year.\n\nThere are a number of notable internments including Elizabeth Bishop, considered one of the most important and distinguished American poets of the 20th century. Loring Coes, the inventor of the Monkey wrench has a family plot. Abby Kelly Foster, a 19th century feminist, and her husband Stephen Foster, an abolitionist are buried, as well as Robbert Goodard, the inventor of the first liquid-fueled rocket.\n\nAccording to the Friends of Hope Cemetery, \"Any citizen of Worcester has the right to be buried in Hope Cemetery. If the person or the family is unable to pay for burial, space is provided without cost.\"\n\nIt is the diversity within the cemetery that is most catching. With specific sections for Civil War veterans including members of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment — one of the first Black regiments to fight in the Civil War — religious groups and sects such as Orthodox Christian and a Jewish section with a completely different design. On top of the specific sections, there is an amalgamation of public plots; Worcester residents from all walks of life lie next to one another peaceful and at rest.\n\nMyriad languages decorate a plethora of headstones and monuments. Through etchings, many celebrate the lives lived. Some unique items could be seen on gravestones during a recent visit, including coins, small Mancala pieces, envelopes, and a chrome balloon animal in the style of Jeff Koons. Traditionally, leaving coins and other items, a tradition dating at least to Roman times, signifes respect, including for military veterans.\n\nWhether visiting a loved one, taking a historical trip to see one of Hope Cemetery's notable residents, or trying to hear the laughter of ghostly children, Hope Cemetery is a stunning place to spend an afternoon. ― Sarah Barnacle\n\nBay Path Cemetery in Charlton\n\nWhen people think of John “Grizzly” Adams, a hunter who rose to fame in the 1800s by training bears to perform, they picture him in California, where he moved during the 1849 gold rush and made his name. Or, they think of the popular 1970s TV series, with the late Dan Haggerty in the title role.\n\nHowever, Adams hailed from Massachusetts, raised in Medway, and a distant cousin of President John Adams, according to information on findagrave.com and other sources. His final resting place is in Charlton’s Bay Path Cemetery, on a little hill near the center of town surrounded by historic stone walls.\n\nBorn in 1812, Adams spent his younger years working for a circus, hunting and catching wild animals in northern New England’s forests. In 1849, he went west to try his luck searching for gold, but instead found himself back at the intersection of trapping and show business, including working with circus showman P.T. Barnum.\n\nSome seven Adams family gravestones stand in a row at Bay Path, not far from the cemetery’s Muggett Hill Road entrance, including “Grizzly” Adams’ parents, sister, wife, and children. The tallest of them, decorated with a carving of a man and a bear, belongs to Grizzly himself.\n\nIn addition to Adams’ original gravestone, the Charlton Historical Society placed a shorter marble stone a few feet away in 1976, reading “Grave of Grizzly Adams.”\n\nMany who fought in the American Revolution are also buried at Bay Path Cemetery, notably John Spurr, who threw English tea into Boston Harbor as part of the 1773 Boston Tea Party, and who fought in the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. A marker next to Spurr’s grave commemorates his eight years in the Continental Army.\n\nSpurr settled in Charlton after the war and built a house at 27 Main St., close to the cemetery, and which is on the National Registry of Historic Places. He died in 1816 and is buried next to several relatives, a few feet from the stone wall that separates the cemetery from Dresser Hill Road.\n\nCuriously, historical records show two men named John Spurr who participated in the Boston Tea Party. The other John Spurr died in 1822, is buried in Providence, Rhode Island, and, according to a 2023 WPRI Channel 12 article, also has a marker next to his grave denoting military service in the American Revolution.\n\nMoses Dodge, born in Sutton in 1762, also served in the Continental Army’s Massachusetts regiment. Dodge, his son Gibbs Dodge, and other members of his family are buried in a tomb built into a small hillside next to the cemetery’s Muggett Hill Road entrance.\n\nIn the cemetery’s southeast corner is a stone column marking the graves of the Marble family, including Hiram Marble, who spent years digging for buried treasure every single day.\n\nMarble’s story started two centuries before he was born, with an urban legend from the initial days of English colonization in Massachusetts. Early residents of Lynn passed down stories about a pirate named Tom Veal who stashed plundered valuables in a local cave, but was trapped inside when an earthquake struck.\n\nHiram Marble belonged to Charlton’s Spiritualist church, part of a popular 1800s movement that believed that the living could communicate with the spirits of the dead. In 1852, he claimed he had contacted Tom Veal through the barrier between this life and the next and Veal had told him the treasure was in a spot in Lynn called Dungeon Rock.\n\nMarble moved his family to Lynn, bought the property that Dungeon Rock sat on, and began digging a tunnel with help from his son Edward, determining where to carve next by holding séances to contact Veal again.\n\nNeither Hiram, who died in 1868, nor Edward ever found the buried treasure. Hiram himself is buried alongside his wife Arminda beneath a column at Bay Path Cemetery, and looking at his grave, it’s easy to wonder whether he ever found Tom Veal in the afterlife or tried to communicate with the living from the other side of the veil between worlds. ― Meg Trogolo\n\nMeeting House Hill Cemetery in Princeton\n\nMany cemeteries in colonial New England began as churchyards where parishioners were buried. Princeton’s Meeting House Hill Cemetery is among them, located on a hillside close to Mount Wachusett where the town’s first church, or meeting house, once stood.\n\nThe gravestones face west, and many of them are made from slate, which makes the carvings on them still easy to read centuries later. Several veterans of the American Revolution are buried there, including Capt. Elisha Allen, a farmer whose epitaph reads, “Inhumanly murdered by Samuel Frost, July 16, 1793.”\n\nFrost had been tried for the murder of his father in 1789, but was acquitted on grounds of insanity. Allen hired him to work on the farm, thinking it was safe, but he was proven wrong when Frost beat him to death with a garden tool while the two worked in a field. This time, Frost was convicted and given the death penalty, and he was hanged publicly in Worcester three months later on Oct. 31, Halloween night.\n\nNear the center of Meeting House Hill is a trio of slate gravestones that tells pieces of a story tied to the end of slavery in Massachusetts.\n\nKwaku “Quock” Walker was born into slavery in Central Massachusetts in the 1750s, and grew up working alongside his family on James Caldwell’s farm in Barre.\n\nCaldwell and his wife promised Walker that on his 21st birthday, he would be free, but Caldwell died before he could fulfill that promise. His wife remarried a man named Nathaniel Jennison, who refused to honor that promise. Walker left the Jennison farm, but was caught and beaten.\n\nIn 1781, Walker sued Jennison for assault and battery in the Worcester County Court of Common Pleas in the first of a string of cases.\n\nIn the end, the court ruled that he was a free man. Chief Justice William Cushing told the courtroom that “slavery is inconsistent with our own conduct and Constitution and there can be no such thing as perpetual servitude of a rational creature.”\n\nMoses Gill, a justice on the court who lived in Princeton, ruled in two of those cases, and one aspect of the Walker story that isn’t often told is that Gill was an enslaver himself.\n\nGill enslaved at least three Black workers as domestic servants in his Princeton home. They are buried in a row at Meeting House Hill Cemetery beneath small, elaborately carved gravestones near the Gill family plot.\n\nOne is Flova, a woman who died at 41 years old in 1778. Another is Thomas, a man who died at 89 years old in 1782. A chip has fallen off the top corner of the third stone, removing the name of the man buried there, but the bottom of the stone says he died at 39 in 1776.\n\nEach slate stone is engraved with a face surrounded by swirled designs and bears the deceased’s name, date of death, age at death, and one more piece of information: “a Negro Servant to the Hon. Moses Gill Esq.”\n\nEngravings such as the ones on their gravestones were expensive at the time. In1953, Ethel Mirick wrote in the Princeton News that Thomas’ long life “was bespeaking of the care which Gill bestowed upon his black servants.”\n\nHowever, as the saying goes, even a gilded cage is still a cage.\n\nThough the church that once stood above it is gone, replaced by houses with views of the Boston skyline dozens of miles away, the markers of the past remain, serving as a reminder that American slavery was not limited to areas south of the Mason-Dixon line — white colonists enslaved African families in classic, picturesque New England towns like Princeton, too. — Meg Trogolo\n\nShaker Cemetery in Harvard\n\nAlong Harvard's Shaker Road, your eye might be drawn to a stone wall, typically of many found in New England, and a simple white gate with a sign that reads, Harvard Shaker Cemetery, 1971-1918. What's different about this cemetery, however, is that very few graves are marked by traditional stones. The majority are white, cast-iron signs, pocked with rust, and with the names of the deceased written on a broad banner at the top.\n\nThe curious shape has prompted the nickname, \"Lollipop Cemetery,\" which belies both the gravitas of this resting place, and the lives of those who are interred here.\n\nThe Shakers were and are a religious and social community who left an indelible stamp on the town of Harvard, and the region. Almost unique historically among faith movements, they embraced gender and racial equality, with both male and female leaders.\n\nThe Harvard Historical Society relates that at least 331 Shakers were buried here between 1792 and 1929. In the 1850s, the village population peaked at about 200, with members' landholdings totaled more than 2,000 acres. But in the Civil War era, the population dropped dramatically, including the departure of some members.\n\nIn 1879, the Shakers started replacing many stone markers with the cast-iron ones, with a stone marker reading, \"Harvard Shakers\" added by the town, which in 1945 would come into possession of the cemetery.\n\n\"It is pretty unusual looking, and that is one of the things that attracts people to it,\" said Judy Warner, assistant to the board of the Harvard Historical Society. \"The cemetery was one of the first things the Shakers did after they settled in Harvard.\"\n\nWork on the cemetery began in earnest in 1792. \"They fenced and cleared an acre of land. It took them eight days with four yolk of oxen to make the stone walls around it. There are journal entries about that,\" Warner said. The last recorded burial in the cemetery took place in 1929.\n\nAs to why the Shakers eventually replaced most of the stone markers with the cast-iron ones, Warner said the reason was likely practical, with problem-solving and practicality as a hallmark of Shaker beliefs. But there's something more: while the cast-iron markers bear names, Warner noted that in many Shaker settlements, graves often were marked with stones that simply read, \"Shakers.\"\n\nSome graves belong to people, including children, who died very young, not unusual in a time when diseases and accidents often took an early toll. However, many of those interred lived long and apparently healthy lives, including Ezra B. Newton, a 47-year member of the Shaker community, who lived to 101.\n\n\"The Shakers were sort of noted for longevity. They had a reasonably good life, compared to the general population,\" Warner said. \"They often attributed their good health to the water that they had, and actually later sold Shaker Spring Waters, and they touted the health benefits.\" This water came from a now-extinct spring that ran from Harvard's Shaker Village under land now part of Route 2.\n\nAs for Newton, he gained prominence locally, with a celebration in 1895 to mark his 100th birthday.\n\nThe cemetery has 12 graves belonging to the Myrick family, including Elijah Myrick, a Shaker elder and trustee of some 40 years, held patents for several inventions, including a type of cast-iron chimney cap.\n\nWarner observed, \"The Shakers were quite different from some other communities in that they loved modernization. They were not loathe to accept new ideas. They wanted to be up to date.\"\n\nWarner is not only a keeper of history; she's also a neighbor to the cemetery. Although most visitors treat the cemetery respectfully, it has been a target of vandalism, and theft of the striking markers. \"People should just be respectful and not damage anything, or think they need a souvenir,\" Warner said. \"Some markers were broken, and have been repaired.\"\n\nWarner notes something that is true of all cemeteries: \"It is a holy place.\" — Margaret Smith", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/24"}]}

Free speech and peaceful protests are the lifeblood of our democracy, and student activists have always been at the center of the fight for justice,\" the post said. \"Political speech is protected by our constitution and peaceful civil disobedience should never be the basis for deportation. Protect your right to dissent and take action with the @ACLU.\"\n\nBen & Jerry’s said it also planned to include a link to an ACLU petition in support of Khalil.\n\nThe company also alleged that Unilever had blocked a planned post in celebration of Black History Month in February.\n\nIn another filing in February, Ben & Jerry’s alleged suppression of their social views. The company said Unilever ice cream chief Peter ter Kulve unilaterally banned it from \"issuing any posts criticizing President Trump\" pending further review.\n\nTer Kulve previously banned a planned post on hot-button issues when Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20 because the post mentioned the incoming president, Ben & Jerry's said in the filing.\n\nUnilever threatened Ben & Jerry’s with dismantling of independent board\n\nIn the initial lawsuit filed back in November, Ben & Jerry’s alleged that Unilever had threatened to dismantle the independent board created in 2000.\n\nThe ice cream maker alleged that Unilever made the threats to the company after they attempted to support Palestinian refugees.\n\n“Unilever threatened to dismantle the Independent Board and sue the board members individually if Ben & Jerry’s–with its decades-long motto of ‘peace, love & ice cream’– issued the statement supporting ‘peace’ and a ‘ceasefire’,” the filing said.\n\nRegarding Stever, Ben & Jerry’s alleged that the reasoning for his proposed removal by Unilever is purely due to his “commitment to Ben & Jerry’s Social Mission,” rather than “any genuine concerns regarding his performance history.”\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Trump poised to crack down on 'woke' corporations", "text": "Corrections & Clarifications: This story was updated to clarify that Pete Hegseth is a former Fox News host.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump promoted the idea that white Americans were targets of racism and made reversing Joe Biden’s “woke takeover” of Washington a priority of his second term in office.\n\nNow with Republicans in control of the White House and both branches of Congress in 2025, the president-elect is in a position to make good on his promises to crack down on corporations that do business with the federal government.\n\nOn the chopping block: diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\n“President Trump has been very clear about ending the woke DEI garbage infecting this country, and the American people voted overwhelmingly to do just that,” said Trump spokesman Steven Cheung.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nTrump is staffing his government with loyalists who want to de-“woke” America, from Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host and decorated combat veteran who is Trump’s choice to be Pentagon chief, to Brendan Carr, Trump’s pick for Federal Communications Commission chairman.\n\nStephen Miller, one of Trump’s longtime aides who has been tapped as a top policy architect in the new administration, has spent the past four years spoiling for this fight, filing dozens of legal actions against “woke” corporations.\n\n“As every day passes and you read more about the types of people he is appointing to different positions, organizations have to take this very seriously,” said Allan Schweyer, a principal researcher with business research group The Conference Board.\n\nIn his first term, Trump used executive power to bar the federal government and government contractors from conducting racially “divisive” and “un-American” diversity training and started a tip line for whistleblowers to turn in their employers. Trump’s Labor Department questioned whether diversity initiatives to increase the ranks of Black executives at Microsoft and Wells Fargo violated federal laws barring racial discrimination.\n\n“A lot of what the president-elect wants to do, he can do through executive order. He doesn’t need congressional approval. And it’s pretty far-reaching,” Schweyer said. “There’s a lot that the new administration can do to discourage DEI in the private sector.”\n\nWith multiple levers he can pull, Trump could make sweeping changes.\n\nIn the Project 2025 playbook, the Heritage Foundation think tank wants the incoming administration to strike terms like DEI from “every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.”\n\nProposals from other activists include directing the Justice Department to investigate programs to boost diversity and abolishing Biden-era rules that bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance, a hawk on DEI, co-sponsored legislation as an Ohio senator to eliminate all federal DEI programs.\n\n“President Trump launched the fight against left-wing racialism in his first term,” said Christopher Rufo, a DEI opponent and a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning think tank Manhattan Institute. “Now he has the opportunity to finish it.”\n\nTrump election seen as DEI referendum\n\nAfter the murder of George Floyd in 2020 forced a historic reckoning with race in America, businesses pledged to make their workforces and their leadership better reflect the communities they serve.\n\nEmployees of color are underrepresented at every level of power in corporate America, according to USA TODAY data investigations. One analysis in 2023 found that white men account for 7 in 10 executive officers in the nation’s largest companies. About 1 in 7 of these companies had executive teams made up only of white men.\n\nProponents say DEI programs help companies hire and retain diverse talent and create environments that boost innovation. JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and other business leaders have repeatedly stressed that diversity is good for business.\n\nBut four years after those 2020 promises, the political landscape has shifted.\n\nThough corporate diversity efforts are broadly supported by the American public – especially younger Americans – they face growing scrutiny in the courts and in statehouses across the country as right-wing foundations, think tanks and political operatives push “race-neutral” policies.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision in 2023 to ban the consideration of race in higher education only emboldened attacks on workplace programs.\n\nTwo men fought for jobs in a mill 50 years later, the nation is still divided.\n\nPublic sentiment has also shifted. Consumer boycotts that slashed sales forced some brands like Bud Light and Target to retreat from marketing campaigns to the LGBTQ+ community. Major brands like Ford and Lowe’s have abandoned initiatives and overhauled teams after pressure campaigns from anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck.\n\nA few companies folded at the mere threat of being called out publicly, according to Starbuck. The keyboard warrior, whose signature social media meme is a grim reaper knocking on the doors of Fortune 500 companies, said he's preparing a new list of targets going into the holiday season.\n\n“The battle for opinions, how the public feels about this, we are winning that war, and that’s huge. That has a bigger psychological, real-world effect than almost anything else,” Starbuck said.\n\nA new Pew Research Center survey found American workers’ opinions on the role of DEI in the workplace have become more negative since last year.\n\nAbout half – 52% – of employees said DEI at work is mostly a good thing, down from 56% in February 2023. The share of workers who said DEI is a bad thing – 21% – is up 5 percentage points since last year.\n\n“A lot of people are exhausted by the idea of corporations being involved in partisan agendas. They just want to go into big-box stores and buy a product or a good, and they don’t want to be preached at,” said Daniel Cameron, the former Kentucky attorney general who runs 1792 Exchange, a conservative group fighting “woke capitalism.” “I think that’s ultimately why we are seeing the pendulum swing back.”\n\nLuke Hartig, president of reputational risk firm Gravity Research, said Trump’s decisive victory created a narrative “that this election was a referendum on DEI and a range of so-called woke policies.”\n\nFor Amber Cabral, a former inclusion strategist at Walmart who put in 12- to 14-hour days to keep up with demand from large corporations for her leadership consulting practice after Floyd’s murder, that narrative had devastating consequences.\n\nFor months, mounting attacks on corporate DEI rattled clients who worried they would become the next target. Then Trump’s fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail gave them cold feet and they put off making any commitments until after the election, she said.\n\nWith her small Atlanta firm already out nearly $500,000 in contracts, Cabral said, she decided to call it quits just hours after Trump’s acceptance speech. Colleagues told her she's not alone.\n\n“In this election cycle, DEI was weaponized,” Cabral said. “What the work really is and how it can help us all has been completely obliterated.”\n\nDEI advocates: Corporations won't retreat\n\nWith many in the private sector braced for turbulence, Joelle Emerson, co-founder and CEO of the diversity strategy and consulting firm Paradigm, has a less pessimistic view. She said the impact of the election and a second Trump presidency remains to be seen.\n\nMore than 60% of corporate executives surveyed by The Conference Board viewed today's political climate for corporate DEI as very or extremely challenging, and most expected continued or escalating pushback.\n\nEven so, fewer than 10% of the organizations planned to scale back their DEI commitments over the next three years. Research shows employees want diverse and inclusive workplaces, DEI advocates say, and corporations also will face pressure from progressive forces over the next four years.\n\n“Instead of abandoning diversity, equity and inclusion, I think we’ll see companies adjust,” Emerson said.\n\nIn the face of mounting attacks, business leaders shored up DEI programs to make them less vulnerable to legal challenges and public criticism.\n\nThey have backed away from initiatives like hiring targets that conservatives say are illegal quotas and from executive bonuses tied to DEI goals.\n\nMore than half of senior executives surveyed by the Conference Board said they had adjusted how they refer to DEI over the past year. Another 20% were considering doing so. A growing number have dropped mentions of diversity goals in shareholder reports.\n\nThese days, few companies go out of their way to publicly promote their diversity programs. Major corporations such as Walmart and Salesforce declined or did not respond to requests to make executives available to discuss their DEI programs.\n\nMicrosoft pointed USA TODAY to its recent diversity and inclusion report. “We remain deeply committed to D&I because it is what creates transformational solutions to the most complex challenges for customers, partners and the world,” the report reads.\n\nEmerson said corporations may shrink from the hyperpolarized debate over DEI but most are not abandoning the work, which can include broadening candidate pools and creating mentorship and coaching programs open to all.\n\n“The majority of leaders I speak with know that harnessing diversity and fostering inclusion is critical to future business success. They want to be able to cast wider nets, to hire and advance the best people and create cultures where people can do their best work,” she said.\n\nFranklin Turner, co-chair of government contracts and global trade practice with the law firm McCarter & English, represents large corporations preparing to transition from an administration that embraced DEI to one that rejects it.\n\nThe Trump White House will increase pressure on companies that rely on federal funding, and those companies may make some adjustments to policies or training materials, Turner said. But he does not expect wholesale changes.\n\n“I don’t see the C-suites at companies – and I work with a lot of them – taking an intentional step back,” Turner said.\n\nDavid Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at the NYU School of Law, said he hopes to see organizations do more than that over the next four years.\n\n“I am hoping to see more organizations go on the front foot rather than just the back foot,” Glasgow said. “This work is going to continue. It may need a rebranding. It’s possible people might need to be careful about how they talk about it.\n\n\"But there is no universe where even the most hostile presidency is going to be able to completely eliminate an entire field of work because there are too many people out there who care about creating organizations that are respectful, that are inclusive and where people have equal opportunity.”\n\n(The story has been updated to correct a job title and remove attribution of a statement reflected in an earlier version.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/07/11/ford-motors-knew-focus-fiesta-had-flawed-transmission-sold-them-anyway-car-recall/1704480001/", "title": "Ford knew Focus, Fiesta had flawed transmission, sold them anyway", "text": "Ford Motor Co. knowingly launched two low-priced, fuel-efficient cars with defective transmissions and continued selling the troubled Focus and Fiesta despite thousands of complaints and an avalanche of repairs, a Free Press investigation found.\n\nThe cars, many of which randomly lose power on freeways and have unexpectedly bolted into intersections, were put on sale in 2010-11 as the nation emerged from the Great Recession. At least 1.5 million remain on the road and continue to torment their owners — and Ford.\n\nThe automaker pushed past company lawyers’ early safety questions and a veteran development engineer’s warning that the cars weren’t roadworthy, internal emails and documents show. Ford then declined, after the depth of the problem was obvious, to make an expensive change in the transmission technology.\n\nFREE PRESS INVESTIGATION: OUT OF GEAR\n\nInstead, the company kept trying to find a fix for the faulty transmission for five years while complaints and costs piled up. In the interim, Ford officials prepared talking points for dealers to tell customers that the cars operated normally when, in fact, internal documents are peppered with safety concerns and descriptions of the defects.\n\nThe automaker faces thousands of angry customers, including former loyalists who say they will never buy another Ford; hundreds of millions in repair costs, many times without actually fixing the cars; and litigation so serious the company this spring warned investors of the financial threat posed by defects in what Ford called its DPS6 transmission.\n\nApart from the legal risks, “Total quality related spending for DPS6 could reach $3 billion,” read a 2016 internal report that projected the costs through 2020.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday to the Free Press, Ford said conversations about \"challenges common to innovative new technology\" were \"normal exchanges.\" It said many customers were unaccustomed to the feel of the transmission and acknowledged that, \"After the new transmission was on the road, other problems developed. We acted quickly and determinedly to investigate the problems. ... While we eventually resolved the quality issues, the solutions were more complex and took longer than we expected. We regret the inconvenience and frustration that caused some consumers.\" It acknowledged discussion of switching to a different transmission and said it made choices based on what it thought \"best for customers.\"\n\nFord Focus recall: Automaker recalls 58,000 vehicles that could get deformed fuel tank\n\nTo understand what happened, the Free Press reviewed hundreds of pages of internal documents, emails and court filings from the past decade in which Ford engineers and managers discussed concerns and sought to control damage from the dual-clutch transmission, which enabled the company to tout gas mileage near 40 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe Free Press also analyzed consumer complaints to federal safety officials, finding accounts of 50 previously unreported injuries amid more than 4,300 entries about the unreliable transmissions. No deaths are publicly known to have been linked to the defect.\n\nFord’s position has consistently been that even if the cars slip out of gear while people are driving and they must coast to the side of the road, the cars don’t pose a safety risk because power steering, brakes, passenger restraints and other functions continue to work. Its statement to the Free Press for this story reiterated that \"vehicles in which DPS6 was installed were and remain safe.\"\n\nOthers believe the cars are dangerous, including thousands of vehicle owners, a leading consumer safety advocate and a longtime former Ford quality engineer who spoke to the Free Press. Federal regulators in 2014 conferred with Ford and declined to launch a formal investigation or order a recall of the transmissions.\n\nInternal discussions persisted at Ford for years, at times becoming heated. Consumer blowback came quickly, with the first complaints about the transmissions filed with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration within months of the 2011 Fiesta going on sale. That model year Fiesta was the first vehicle with the DPS6, hitting the market in March 2010, followed by the 2012 Focus, which reached dealerships in March 2011.\n\nLawsuits on behalf of U.S. owners allege the company defrauded buyers. Ford denies the allegations, but made headlines after settling claims in Australia and Thailand.\n\n‘Lessons Learned’\n\nA high-level, confidential analysis by Ford in 2012 acknowledged rushing the cars to production, taking shortcuts to save money and apparently compromising quality protocols instituted with fanfare by then-CEO Alan Mulally. That review, obtained by the Free Press, also said the transmissions would be phased out and a different technology used going forward, but that didn’t happen. The Focus went out of production after the 2018 model year; the 2019 Fiesta is the last of the line.\n\nBy the time of the 2012 review, which was labeled “Lessons Learned,” Ford had sold more than half a million of the cars.\n\n“There is no fix at this time,” system testing engineer Tom Hamm wrote separately in an October 2012 email to four colleagues. “We have a task force working on the issue but they haven’t identified any fixes at this time.”\n\nAmong the documents the Free Press obtained is a presentation in which Ford told NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigations in 2014 that the problems occurred as vehicles aged. That contradicts internal emails, hundreds of consumer complaints about problems in both new and older cars, and an affidavit in 2018 by Ford’s North American powertrain quality manager saying part of the issue was with transmissions “not yet broken in.” The official also said in the affidavit that Ford learned of the problem in 2011.\n\nBut on Aug. 31, 2010, just six months before the 2012 Focus hit the market, product development engineer Tom Langeland emailed colleagues and supervisors describing “nasty launch judder” — intense vibration from a stop — that “did not clear up after many miles of driving.”\n\n“We also cannot achieve a driveable calibration that will get us to production,” he wrote. “The clutch torque delivery MUST BE IMPROVED.”\n\nT-boned in Saginaw\n\nFourteen months later, a Saginaw driver in a 2012 Focus that had been driven only 500 miles reported this to federal safety authorities: “I was stopped at a parking lot exit waiting to enter a thoroughfare, engine idling, with my foot lightly on the brake. Suddenly, the car accelerated forward, into the traffic lane, as though someone had pressed the accelerator pedal to the floor. I took a 45 mph T-bone on my driver’s side door.”\n\nThe driver reported that his “elderly wife suffered a severe heart bruising from the seat belt” and that he figured he was saved by the air bag.\n\nDozens of owners from throughout the country reached out to the Free Press to share their experiences:\n\n“What is it going to take? Does someone have to die before they get these cars fixed?” asked Carrie Armstrong, 42, of Hendersonville, Tennessee. “When I am on the interstate and almost get hit by a diesel truck just because my car will not accelerate and get into gear? I put my life in danger every day I get behind the wheel of this car just to go to work.”\n\nShe said she has taken her 2015 Focus to the dealership 10 times for repair. “I bought it new and it started acting up on me two months after I bought it. I thought, ‘I shouldn’t be having these transmission issues right now.’ ”\n\nShe added: “I’ve got a $5,000 car note left. It’s almost paid off. I’ve owned a Ford Escort, a Ford Explorer, a Ford Fusion and several Mustangs. I’ve put my trust in this company.”\n\nArmstrong’s repeated repairs are a common experience: Ford’s internal 2016 DPS6 update, marked “SECRET” on each page, notes that 350,000 of the cars “have already reached 3+ repairs in US.”\n\nLillian Karamanian, a retired clothing store owner from Troy, got rid of her 2011 Fiesta shortly after taking it for a repair. “I wanted to know if I would notice a difference on the surging, hesitation and lack of power. The response was that it would take at least 500 miles of aggressive driving in order to break in the fix and be able to notice a difference. I did everything I was supposed to do and nothing changed. It never got fixed. I kept thinking ‘this is crazy.’\"\n\nKyle McIlmurray, 30, a journalist from Grand Rapids, said his family has always been loyal to Ford. He bought his 2015 Focus new and started seeing transmission symptoms immediately. “I’m pressing on the gas, it’s not going. It’s sputtering. Eventually, it will catch for a rather rough acceleration. Thankfully, I’ve had no serious issues on the road. Sometimes it feels like the car isn’t gonna go, (or) the car is accelerating way faster than I want it to go.”\n\nLegal filings representing current and former owners claim that their 2012-16 Focus and 2011-16 Fiesta cars were prone to “shuddering, slipping, bucking, jerking, hesitation while changing gears, premature internal wear, delays in downshifting and, in some cases, sudden or delayed acceleration.”\n\nMany owners, in their NHTSA complaints, pleaded with regulators to recall the cars.\n\nThe 2012-16 Focus and 2011-16 Fiesta equipped with the DPS6 have been the subject of 18 recalls for a range of defects, but none for transmission repair.\n\nFord has conducted customer service programs for updates and replacement parts and has extended the warranty on the transmissions. By late 2016, Ford documents show, “technical fixes to the Control Module and Clutch are in production and available for both vehicle assembly and service,” but supply of the parts was thousands short of what was needed for replacement. Some owners have gotten new DPS6 transmissions under warranty that have not solved the problems.\n\nFord Focus recall: Automaker recalls 58,000 vehicles that could get deformed fuel tank\n\nInternal warnings\n\nMany within Ford foresaw the problems, according to materials obtained by the Free Press, which included 41 lawsuit exhibits filed in customer litigation. Thirty-one exhibits in that set of lawsuits remain out of public view.\n\nFord’s lawyers argued against making the documents public early this year, saying, in part, \"In fact, the 72 documents that … Plaintiffs propose to file highlight the fundamental deficiency in their Complaint: like the Complaint, these documents merely show that Ford — both before and after Plaintiffs purchased their vehicles — identified and addressed various issues of varying significance with the transmission.\"\n\nThe documents show that Ford lawyers told engineers in 2008 they were worried about the safety of the dual-clutch technology, which had encountered problems during early use by Volkswagen in Europe.\n\nFord would be putting this transmission into low-priced, high-volume vehicles for the first time. Corporate lawyers maintained, as noted repeatedly in emails by engineers obtained by the Free Press, that the transmissions’ tendency to slip out of gear, if combined with other conditions, would result in a “Severity 10” rating. That’s the worst possible rating under global engineering protocols designed to minimize risk and comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards set by the U.S. government.\n\nThe cars and transmission technology were critical to Ford at the time. The vehicles were developed as the company lost more than $30 billion from 2006-08.\n\nThe coming recession would send General Motors and Chrysler to bankruptcy in 2009, with Ford surviving thanks to a $23 billion line of credit secured in late 2006, in Mulally’s early months as CEO. But Ford was hardly out of the woods. Sales of its cash cow, the F-Series pickup, had plummeted as gas prices surged and construction activity froze. Mulally told lenders he would cut costs and boost development of the fuel-efficient cars Americans needed at the time.\n\nA new presidential administration also turned up the pressure on all automakers, including Ford, to make their entire fleets more fuel-efficient. Before the new Fiesta and Focus would go to dealers, recently inaugurated President Barack Obama in May 2009 announced aggressive fuel-economy standards to require automakers to hit an average across their fleets of 35.5 mpg in 2016.\n\nFord promoted the DPS6 as offering the fuel economy and acceleration of a manual transmission with the operational ease of an automatic.\n\n“With gasoline already more than $4 per gallon in some American cities, the new fuel-saving dual dry-clutch Ford PowerShift six-speed automatic is the right transmission at the right time,” a March 2011 news release said as the new Focus went to dealers.\n\nProgram calibration manager George Herr, who responded with concern to Langeland’s email six months earlier that “we … cannot achieve a driveable calibration,” was quoted in the news release praising the technology, as was Piero Aversa, the program engineering manager, who was copied on Herr’s follow-ups.\n\n10 years of secrets\n\nResponding to lawyers’ concerns as the transmission was being developed, Ford quality supervisor Johann Kirchhoffer wrote in an email on June 27, 2008, that stalling “alone is not hazardous.”\n\n“We have evidence that VW had a recall of a number of transmissions with a potential ‘Unintended Neutral’ occurring with low volumes,” he continued. “We are pursuing any effort to reduce the occurrence of an ‘Unintended Neutral’ event to a so-called ‘Broadly Acceptable level.’”\n\n“Unintended neutral” refers to the transmission slipping out of gear.\n\nWhile lawyers acknowledged that the engineers might be able to reduce the defect’s severity rating, the legal “team has evidence that this event is customer safety critical and should be rated as an SEV 10 event losing power entirely,” Kirchhoffer wrote.\n\nHe did acknowledge that a no-warning “Neutral Event including an Engine Stall is hazardous with respect to customer perception.”\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2008, Ford engineer Greg Goodall wrote that a Severity 10 rating was “supported” by the Ford office of general counsel, vehicle safety and quality technical specialists.\n\n“Items are rated Severity 10 because no mechanism exists for customer warning prior to failure,” said the internal report, written 17 months before the release of the 2011 Fiesta.\n\nGoodall’s document proposed a technical solution, but it’s unclear from the documents available to the Free Press if the plan was used or how Ford resolved the legal questions. The coming years would show, though, that the so-called neutral events were not fixed.\n\nA month before the Focus went to dealers, Craig Renneker, then acting director of transmission and driveline engineering, emailed Richard Bonifas, a customer service manager at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, where the cars were being built.\n\n“The 2012 Focus vehicles equipped with the DPS6 transmission may experience a shudder/shake on start up or when slowing to a stop … ship the vehicles to the dealers with the level of shudder we currently have and continue our efforts towards a permanent resolution ASAP,” Renneker wrote on Feb. 21, 2011. “That’s just my opinion and it’s not a popular one.”\n\nBut that’s what happened — and problems became immediately apparent. While problems had been reported with the 2011 Fiesta, they mushroomed with release of the Focus, which was more than 300 pounds heavier than the Fiesta and demanded more of the transmission.\n\nBuyers started flooding dealership repair departments, complaints hit the NHTSA website and Consumer Reports in October 2011 lowered Ford’s reliability rating, in part because of the transmission.\n\n“Ford’s drop can also be attributed to problems with new technologies … and the new automated-manual transmission used in the Fiesta and Focus,” the magazine said.\n\nMulally’s quality system\n\nFord was supposed to have a system in place to protect against such problems.\n\nMulally, who said he would benchmark Ford against Toyota, started a simple red-yellow-green system to boost the company’s quality. He earned media attention for using the system as part of his weekly management meetings to illustrate the status of projects. A green light meant things were on track; a yellow light indicated caution with a plan in place; a red light indicated a critical situation with corrective action needed.\n\nAt first, his direct reports suggested more green lights than he thought plausible, and as time went on, yellow and red lights emerged. The tactic, Mulally said at the time, was meant to foster candor and collaboration in place of competition and jockeying for promotion — and improve quality.\n\nBut the 2012 “Lessons Learned” review found that during development of the Fiesta, delayed decisions required engineers to work under compressed schedules, and they failed to meet a series of milestones. That led to late identification of noise, vibration, launch judder and “shift quality issues” that resulted in development of faulty hardware and software.\n\nThe review is attributed to top engineering and development officers, including Raj Nair, who was head of global product development and chief technical officer. He later ascended to president of Ford North America before leaving the company.\n\n“What is the cost of poor quality?” is the title of a page in the internal report, which notes “significant” action is required to “get to competitive quality levels.” An accompanying chart notes that the 2011 Focus — before use of the DPS6 — had 23 unhappy customers per 1,000 surveyed while the new 2012 Focus had 266 unhappy customers per 1,000 — after just three months of ownership.\n\nThe report noted “trade-offs” of performance in favor of cost and fuel economy. It said use of a dry clutch rather than a wet clutch led to harsh shifting and other issues.\n\nThe DPS6 is different from the automatic transmissions most people are used to, but it operates the same way: Shift to Drive or Reverse and go.\n\nThe guts of a dual-clutch transmission like the DPS6 are more like a manual than a conventional automatic transmission, but the driver does not have to shift gears. These transmissions can improve fuel economy and weigh less than a conventional automatic, key reasons Ford developed the DPS6.\n\nThe technology is widely used today, often by luxury brands and sports cars such as Porsche. There are two kinds of dual-clutch transmissions: wet-clutch and dry-clutch. The difference is whether oil lubricates the clutches. The DPS6 was a dry-clutch design, which leads to higher temperatures and potential performance problems, engineers say.\n\n‘Issues increased’\n\nFord’s 2012 review showed that things went south from the start. The transmission architecture was selected 12 months later than normal — “limiting up-front engineering development time, resulting in ‘open’ deliverables at key program milestones,” the report said, citing compression of program approval, prototype verification, launch readiness and mass production.\n\n“At each early checkpoint, it became more apparent” that the transmission systems for the 2011 Fiesta program “were not capable to meet customer expectations,” the review said.\n\nA page was devoted to milestone failures with 23 “red” alert issues related to calibration and “115 software changes required before launch” for the 2011 Fiesta.\n\nThe memo noted that as the project headed toward launch, “issues increased rather than declined.”\n\nThe 2012 report also said upgrades to the dual-clutch system “will not be pursued,” because of an agreement to change technology made that October.\n\nHowever, the report says alternatives would delay launch of future model years, add production and factory costs and reduce fuel economy, creating the risk Ford could run afoul of federal mpg requirements.\n\nThe change was not made, and Ford for years continued tweaking the DPS6, adjusting calibration, clutch materials and fixing a seal leak. Documents show that parts ran in short supply in late 2016 for the latest fix at that time.\n\n‘1-800 snitch line’\n\nAt issue, a quality control engineer with years of experience at Ford told the Free Press, was the high cost of substituting a different transmission in low-cost vehicles with a thin profit margin.\n\nUpper management was not informed of the unfolding crisis at the start in order to contain liability, said the engineer, who worked with Ford colleagues in 2010 trying to troubleshoot the situation.“People tried not to overly communicate how big the problems were.”\n\nThe engineer, who no longer works at Ford and requested anonymity out of concern it might jeopardize his career in the auto industry, said the company had previously identified transmission issues in high-profit trucks and disrupted everything to issue “stop ships to limit quality exposure” and fix those problems. The DPS6 transmission was treated differently.\n\nIn this case, the engineer said, design and release engineers, calibration development engineers, manufacturing engineers, customer service engineers and transmission engineers all knew the transmissions were bad but kept it quiet.\n\n“The quality office at Ford is a separate operation from product development. They’re supposed to take issues to the top floor,” the engineer said. “These vehicles never passed the tests. Work is supposed to be complete at FEC — Final Engineering Completion. It wasn’t. The quality operating system failed. Inputs from customers were ignored. Corrective actions weren’t effective.”\n\nHe added, “Everyone was worried about getting out of the manufacturing contracts. But it could’ve been done.\n\n“They had people complaining on launch teams, people hired to drive our vehicles. Vehicle manufacturing had been lied to by product engineering. You’re supposed to take corrective action. People did not fix the problems. They felt like it would hurt profits. They knew they had the fuel economy up and they couldn’t solve the root cause of the problem.”\n\nHe continued, “Everybody working on this project knew it had issues and they were afraid to call the 1-800 snitch line. We were all afraid to tell the truth.\n\n“You want to know why you don’t want to do anything about it? It’s work. It comes right back at you — drop everything you’re doing, work around the clock and you’re on the hook to explain what you’re doing and the weight of the company is on your shoulders and it’s incredibly stressful and intense. You face the repercussions of publishing recovery plans and explaining three times a day to upper levels of management. You have no time to do the rest of your job and you put your Superman cape on and fix things.”\n\nHe noted that some people involved were promoted. “This DPS6 situation didn’t impact anybody’s career.”\n\nPull to the side\n\nAs years wore on, Ford would make the case in emails, internal documents and an affidavit that if the steering, turn signals and other power worked in the car, then the situation couldn’t be considered dangerous. In theory, people could turn on a blinker and steer to the side of the highway if the car slipped into neutral at 70 mph.\n\nPatricia Smith, who lives in Tennessee, told the Free Press she had just that experience. In June, she said her 2013 Focus had been in the repair shop for six months. She was borrowing a car to get to her job as a store clerk; her husband works at a foundry.\n\n“Last time I drove (the Focus), I was going down the interstate between two trucks and it feels like the car goes into neutral on the freeway. You have to pull over to the side. It’s just not dependable,” she said.\n\nSimilar incidents have led to injury accidents, according to reports to federal regulators.\n\n“While driving 70 mph, the vehicle stalled and lost power,” the driver of a 2015 Focus reported to a NHTSA official. “As a result, another vehicle crashed into the contact’s vehicle” on July 1, 2016, in Ladera Ranch, California. A passenger sustained a neck injury from a seat belt, and the driver reported unspecified injuries and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, the report says.\n\nThe Montclair, New Jersey, driver of a 2014 Focus with 1,145 miles on it reported to NHTSA: “On June 23, 2014, while traveling on the highway, the subject vehicle ‘stalled’ without warning, despite attempting to restart the vehicle, the driver was unable. The subject vehicle was struck from behind causing personal injury.”\n\n‘They made fun of me’\n\nFor years, Ford engineers and their supervisors exchanged emails confirming that a serious problem existed with no identifiable solution.\n\nMore than a dozen consumers told the Free Press that dealership mechanics told drivers they didn’t understand how the cars work or know how to properly operate them. Customers including Liliana Van Bibber, 53, a homemaker in Coppell, Texas, said when she went back to the dealership for repair of her 2013 Fiesta, “They made fun of me.”\n\nChristopher Myers, 31, an insurance agent from Jacksonville, Florida, said when he went to the car dealer with his 2013 Focus, “They told me I can’t drive.”\n\nIn reality, the problems had Ford’s attention.\n\nAfter a 2011 Fiesta was brought to a Hempstead, New York, service department for moving forward while in reverse, veteran Ford engineers David Lemke and Tom Hamm in Livonia exchanged emails, obtained by the Free Press, that were labeled “High” importance in early May 2011: “Tom … Make the call down there ASAP … find out more details. Ford Safety Office wants to get involved.”\n\nHamm, as a transmission testing engineer, emailed a colleague on May 10 to keep the dealership from pulling the transmission, to “hold off on the swap,” until it can be examined. “I wouldn’t be asking if it wasn’t a safety issue.”\n\nThe Free Press interviewed more than 80 consumers from all over the country in May and June who had called the paper after a story about DPS6 litigation. Many of the drivers are working-class buyers who can’t afford more expensive cars.\n\nEldon Cooper, 50, of Mountain Home, Arkansas, never imagined coming home from multiple tours of duty in the Mideast and then having to fight Ford. He bought his 2013 Focus to get to Veterans Administration appointments, being medically retired after 19 years.\n\n“I’ve waited for parts at least 63 days,” the U.S. Army veteran said in June. “Basically, we’re stuck with this car. You wouldn’t think you’d have transmission issues with a brand new car. At 34,000 miles, it had problems they never did diagnose.”\n\nDenny Robertson, 40, of Greenville, Texas, depends on his 2013 Fiesta to get to medical appointments too. “We’re on a set income. We’ve gone through hell.” His wife, an amputee, apologized for crying during the interview. “We’re trying to get to the point that we can save a little money, but since I had open heart surgery last year we have no savings and sink a little more down each month with medication costs.”\n\nCustomers say that while repairs often are covered by warranty, they are asked to pay for diagnoses they can’t afford. Many owners told the Free Press they have given up hope for a fix after multiple attempts.\n\nSecret crisis manual\n\nDealership service shops were inundated right away.\n\nMatt Trent, a Ford transmission manager in Livonia, emailed his team Dec. 5, 2012, that 1,400 Focus vehicles had been returned to dealerships with complaints.\n\nFord dealerships were forwarding pages and pages and pages of reports involving the Focus and Fiesta from across the country, chronicling transmission issues and customer frustrations, some even threatening to sue trying to get action.\n\nIn July 2013, Bob Thomas Ford in Hamden, Connecticut, reported that the owner of a new Focus “loves his vehicle but just wants it to run properly.” The customer pleads for someone to stop the bucking and jerking and demands Ford do something to fix the problem. “Customer wants to know if he is expected to wait until there is a class action suit to sue Ford.”\n\nThe company in 2014 extended the warranty on transmissions in the 2010-14 Fiesta and 2012-14 Focus, and created a six-page “talking points” guide to help dealers work with customers.\n\n“We will not proactively communicate with the press,” said the guide.\n\nSample questions and answers in the guide include:\n\nAre the affected vehicles safe to drive? Yes.\n\nWhy don’t you see this as a safety issue? Safety recalls are necessary when a defect poses an unreasonable risk of accidents or injuries.\n\nHave there been any accidents or injuries due to this condition? Ford does not expect any accidents to occur as a result of this condition.\n\nCustomers also were complaining to NHTSA, giving detailed accounts involving transmission failure, replacements needed after just a few miles, accidents and warnings of potential fatalities, including reports from members of Congress on behalf of constituents.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican, noted issues with a 2012 Focus. Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat, a 2012 Fiesta. Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, a 2013 Focus. Former Rep. John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican now assistant secretary of commerce for economic development in the Trump administration, a 2013 Fiesta. Rep. Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, a 2014 Focus. And Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, a 2016 Focus.\n\nThe company had issued several letters urging people to go to their dealerships for adjustments.\n\nAt one point, separate emails show, a Ford team’s frustration boiled over:\n\n“This unit will need a new trans,” wrote David Snyder, a Ford supervisor, to the chief engineer for global product development, at 12:15 p.m. April 15, 2013.\n\nEngineers reply that the cause of the problem, in this case grinding, has not been identified.\n\n“So what is the customer to do?” Snyder asks the whole team by email the next day. “We have identified that the transmission has a defect, which would require the transmission to be replaced, I believe … how is the customer issue going to be resolved? Just tell the customer to live with the issue?”\n\n“When will we have a fix or TSB (technical service bulletin for customers)?” asked engineer Alberto Cruz, this time copying 11 people at the company.\n\nTransmission engineer Hamm forwarded Cruz’s question only to product engineer John Robarge just one minute later — at 8:15 a.m. April 25: “Can you tell me smart a**?”\n\nInternal emails show growing distress and urgency in early 2013.\n\n“I’m tired of looking like the bad guy for repairing all these DPS6 transmissions, when truthfully Ford’s the bad guy here,” said an email sent Feb. 22, 2013, from a Jacksonville, Florida, dealership. “Let’s be honest. Ford produces a horrible product and we trans guys get the wrath of it. My warranty clerk thinks I’m insane and it’s like pulling teeth to get paid for all the work we have to do on these things. The input shaft seals are only good for about 10K miles at best. And by replacing them as well as the clutch, the car’s only going to return again and again and again. I do 4 or 5 a week on average. ... I would love to know how Ford intends to fix this.”\n\nAlso in February 2013, a team of about 30 people “wholly devoted to working on the DPS6 transmission” was assembled to do a “deep dive,” working 10 hours a day, seven days a week, in Sterling Heights. The team comprised Ford engineers and personnel from the company that manufactured the transmission, Getrag, and others, according to a September 2018 affidavit from Christopher Kwasniewicz, currently North American powertrain quality manager. He was systems manager for the DPS6 from 2013-16.\n\n‘Too many to ignore’\n\nThe Free Press documented at least 4,377 complaints to NHTSA for the 2011-16 Fiesta and 2012-16 Focus transmissions — a high number for the consumer reporting system.\n\nFor context, complaints relating to these transmissions are nearly 50% higher in a shorter time period than complaints to NHTSA of dizziness and nausea from occupants of the 2010-18 Ford Explorer, which are the subject of a federal investigation.\n\nMany more complaints likely were filed based on transmission flaws. The Free Press analysis eliminated dozens of reports of engine stalling, even though Ford documents show that to be a DPS6 symptom, because of the possibility that the stall was related to a separate fuel system problem. Other complaints were excluded because they lacked sufficient detail to be sure they were transmission-related.\n\n“Four thousand complaints would certainly get our attention. That’s too many to ignore,” said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group. “Incidents involving an inability to accelerate suggests that the threat is not just to owners of these vehicles but others on the road. It suggests a callousness towards life. Fact is, unintentionally losing power on the highway can lead to crash deaths. It’s not good. It’s not safe.”\n\nHe was puzzled why the vehicles have not been recalled to fix the transmissions.\n\n“The law is specific where you don’t need to wait for a body count,” Levine said. “It may be we don’t know of further tragedies, not that there haven’t been some.”\n\nWhile Ford has maintained that the Focus and Fiesta transmission problem does not pose a safety risk, in June of this year, the company recalled 123,000 2013 F-150 trucks because of a transmission calibration issue. The vehicles had been reprogrammed as part of another recall, but the updates did not fully prevent such problems as an unintended downshift.\n\n“Depending on vehicle speed, an abrupt transmission downshift to first gear without warning could result in loss of vehicle control, increasing the risk of a crash,” Ford’s recall notice said.\n\nThing is, tracking injury and death is nearly impossible under these circumstances because a police officer is never going to diagnose a transmission issue, said Levine.\n\nSome Focus and Fiesta drivers reported neck injuries, bruised ribs and thousands of dollars in hospital bills to NHTSA. Again and again, owners wrote, “I was lucky I wasn’t killed.”\n\nReport to regulators\n\nIn 2014, the Office of Defects Investigations at NHTSA looked at the issue.\n\nThe Free Press obtained a letter dated Nov. 19, 2014, from Steve Kenner, Ford global director of automotive safety, to Kevin Vincent, NHTSA chief counsel. It said the company a week earlier provided an overview of information related to the DPS6 transmission “in the context of the agency’s recent questions concerning 2011 through 2015 model year Ford Focus and Fiesta vehicles.”\n\nThe memo refers to an online presentation also obtained by the Free Press whose participants from Ford included a senior research engineer, internal investigations manager, global automotive safety compliance assistant director, the transmission engineering manager and transportation quality supervisor.\n\nThe presentation to federal regulators offers information that appears to downplay the nature of the defect:\n\nThe report said the transmission issue “is a progressive condition” related to a vehicle’s age. But internal documents and NHTSA complaints show repeatedly that customers with new vehicles experienced problems.\n\nFord told regulators “multiple symptoms” consistently precede “complete loss of mobility.” Customer complaints do not support that characterization, Free Press interviews and the review of NHTSA records found. Ford told NHTSA it was developing software to provide an “overt” warning. A separate document obtained by the Free Press showed in fact that two company vice presidents were seeking approval from then-CEO Mark Fields, who succeeded Mulally in 2014, to “develop and test a software strategy” that “provides early warning to customers.” The software was to be released nine months later, in August 2015. The software “will more easily satisfy NHTSA’s requirements,” the approval request noted.\n\nThe change, which was to be in place five and a half years after the first car with a DPS6 went on sale, would not remedy the transmission problems; it was intended to warn drivers when their car was about to slip into neutral. A subsequent document showed that the warning was included in a service update.\n\nIn another part of the 2014 report to regulators, Ford said its engineers installed a transmission part from a customer’s car — a “mechatronic actuation module” — in a company fleet vehicle. This is what happened:\n\nEvent 1: Trans went to neutral at 40 mph. Coasted to a side street. Re-engaged after sitting for one or two minutes and moving the shift lever.\n\nEvent 2: Drove 3 more miles then turned into a parking lot. Trans went to neutral while driving in the parking lot. Stopped vehicle, shifted to Park, shifter then became locked in Park. After a few minutes, was able to shift out of Park and re-engage trans.\n\nEvent 3: Driving in the same parking lot trans went to neutral. Re-engaged after a minute or so.\n\nEvent 4: Drove on the road for 1 mile, trans went to neutral, coasted to a parking lot. Shut engine off and waited 20 minutes without trying to restart.\n\nEvent 5: Started engine, engine light was still on. Drove on highway, trans was shifting in and out of neutral with no movement of the shift lever. This would occur even at the stop lights. Continued to drive to interstate.\n\nEvent 6: Drove 5 miles, entered the interstate. After several miles at 60 mph trans went to neutral, coasted to the shoulder, stayed in neutral. Shifted to Park, turned engine off, immediately restarted and re-engaged.\n\nEvent 7: Drove a couple more miles and exited the interstate. On the exit ramp trans went to neutral, stayed in neutral. Shifted to Park, turned engine off, restarted and re-engaged. Drove back to the Ford parking lot.\n\nFord’s presentation highlighted that, despite the many problems, “mobility was consistently regained.”\n\nIn response to “Customer complaints of ‘no starts,’ ‘loss of gears’ and ‘loss of motion,’” the bottom of a page in the report notes: “Engine continues to run, power steering, power brake assist, electrical and restraint systems remain operational.”\n\nFord on Tuesday, in response to the Free Press asking whether a car losing acceleration is a safety problem, replied, \"You should contact NHTSA. ... They have looked at this issue quite thoroughly and have not (issued a recall) in this case. Nor have governing bodies in other markets.\"\n\nIn response to a Free Press inquiry about Fiesta and Focus transmissions, NHTSA said in June that it “conducted a pre-investigative review of the relevant information in 2014 and elected not to open an investigation. The agency has monitored the situation since that time.”\n\n$3 billion headache\n\nBehind the scenes, things continued to worsen for Ford.\n\n“While OGC (Ford’s office of general counsel) is resolving class actions, risks from consumer claims and regulatory investigations are growing,” said the “SECRET” December 2016 report from Bennie Fowler, group vice president of quality and new model launch, and Jim Vanslambrouck, a quality director. “Government agencies are investigating Ford for potential consumer fraud and whether the symptoms pose a safety concern.”\n\nSpending for the transmission “could reach $3 billion, including $1.1 billion approved to address customer satisfaction,” the December 2016 “DPS6 Update” said.\n\nFord devoted a page in the report to “litigation and government investigations,” noting that “consumer litigation is increasing in all regions.”\n\nPending U.S. lawsuits include:\n\nA class-action case based in federal court in Los Angeles covering 1.9 million owners and former owners. In these cases, members of the certified class are treated the same in each state and certain claims are capped according to the terms of the settlement. A $35 million settlement is under appeal in this case, with a consumer group arguing it’s a bad deal for owners. Opponents point out that an estimated 94% of the vehicles' owners will not qualify for relief based on negotiated conditions.\n\nA Michigan-based “mass action” filed in Wayne County District Court brought by 12,300 buyers who have opted out of the class action. In a mass action, the cases are combined, but each plaintiff must prove certain facts and can win individual damages that are not capped.\n\nAbout 970 individual lawsuits from across the country bundled together in federal court in Los Angeles. Dozens of these have been settled recently by Ford.\n\nAbout 110 coordinated lawsuits from across the country are bundled together in California Superior Court. Dozens of these also have been settled recently.\n\nLawyers who have negotiated with Ford say the company has offered settlements of more than $75,000 to individual plaintiffs in California, which is known for its strong consumer protection laws. They note Ford has lost its only trial to date on the matter in California, with a judgment of more than $700,000. The company conceded liability of more than $145,000 in damages, but challenged a fraud claim and lost.\n\nOverseas, Ford paid a fine of $10 million ($7.6 million U.S.) to the Australian government for the “unconscionable” mistreatment of consumers blamed as bad drivers when they complained of transmission issues.\n\n“Ford knew the symptoms of the quality issues with the vehicles were experienced intermittently, but required customers to demonstrate them on demand in the presence of a dealer in order for repairs to be undertaken,” Rod Sims, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman, said in April 2016.\n\nThat case involved about 10,500 customer complaints over Focus, Fiesta and some EcoSport models made from 2011-15 with DPS6 transmission.\n\nFord acknowledged that it “took too long to identify the issues” because the company was “overwhelmed with the volume of complaints.”\n\nThen in September 2018, the South Bangkok Civil Court handed down the first Thai class-action ruling of its kind, ordering Ford to pay 23 million baht (about $746,000 U.S.) to compensate 291 owners of Focus and Fiesta vehicles with defective transmissions, plus legal fees and other costs.\n\nFields ordered to testify\n\nIn April, lawyers for Fiesta and Focus owners in the Los Angeles-based litigation subpoenaed the deposition of former CEO Fields. His lawyers tried to block the testimony.\n\nBut U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia Otazo-Reyes in Florida, where Fields lives, ordered in June that he be deposed. Plaintiffs contend he played a key role in what they allege was a cover-up and was a primary decision maker who attended crucial meetings and was involved in negotiations with Ford’s supplier, in which Ford claimed the transmission was defective.\n\n“Mark Fields is being deposed in our case because during the time he was head of the company, Ford concealed dangerous safety defects in Focus and Fiesta autos equipped with the DPS6 PowerShift Transmission that Ford could not fix,” said Michael Resnick, who is representing hundreds of car owners in California and is co-counsel in the Michigan case.\n\nFields, who was president of Ford’s Americas division when the Focus and Fiesta were developed, now is a senior adviser with the industrials team at TPG Capital, a global private equity firm. He is scheduled to testify in late July. An attorney for Fields did not respond to messages from the Free Press seeking comment.\n\nThe Free Press investigation could not determine whether Mulally, CEO from 2006-14, was directly involved in any of these decisions. Ford is fighting to keep confidential internal documents that plaintiffs’ lawyers believe could include Mulally. None of the documents or lawsuits available to the Free Press indicates when the board of directors was briefed about the transmissions or whether board members were involved in decisions to move ahead despite concerns.\n\nNow, the ongoing issues are among the challenges facing CEO Jim Hackett, who took the helm in 2017 with Fields’ departure.\n\n‘Ford’s silly stupid rules’\n\nWhile Ford was telling owners, prospective buyers, dealers, and domestic and foreign governmental agencies that transmission issues were “normal,” behind the scenes the company was fighting the supplier that manufactured the transmission.\n\nOn March 20, 2014, senior purchasing manager Thomas Miller wrote, “Our involvement is one focused only on manufacturing of the DPS6, not the design. Getrag … owns the design and Ford is not allowed to even have the component drawings for the DPS6. As Ford believes strongly this is a design failure, Getrag should reimburse Ford for 100% … we need to be clear where the responsibility lies.”\n\nIn the 2016 DPS6 update, Fowler, the VP of quality and new model launch, noted that a “seal and clutch settlement” with Getrag involved a $50 million payment that released the German supplier from claims as well as a $250 million maximum payout over 10 years related to a settlement among Ford, Getrag and another supplier. Getrag, now owned by Canada-based supplier Magna International after a bankruptcy, continues to have a 50-50 joint venture with Ford known as Getrag Ford Transmissions.\n\nMeanwhile, internal emails show that dealers tangled with Ford headquarters in September 2016, challenging whether the company was exercising good faith and expressed frustration over endless repairs. Dealers sent tech feedback to Ford service engineer Jeremiah Cannon:\n\n“I follow Ford’s silly stupid rules and when it comes back it’s on Ford,” wrote a tech. “When I get those stupid reprogram (technical service bulletins), I reprogram it and ship it, I don’t care if it’s fixed or not. Ford doesn’t want to spend money on proper verification of concern and verify concern was resolved and well I damn sure won’t spend my money or time to do it for them. NOT MY JOB.”\n\nYear after year, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on repair costs that eat into Ford profits.\n\nSo it’s no surprise that Ford urged its team to cut costs associated with expensive warranty repairs.\n\n“We are working to reduce our warranty spend for the DPS6. As we look to every area to contribute, we should continue to challenge ourselves … to reduce the billable labor hours,” Renneker, the acting transmission and driveline engineering chief, wrote on Aug. 30, 2016.\n\nThat idea alarmed service engineer Cannon.\n\n“We ALWAYS look to skin the folks who are doing the repair as a way to save money due to a flawed component. … we are looking at a systemic issue that is only going to get worse.”\n\nRenneker replied later the same day: “I have to present to Bennie Fowler early next month on the steps we can take to reduce the — $700M warranty bill coming to us for DPS6.”\n\nTwo years earlier, Fowler had complained about repair costs in an email to powertrain purchasing and customer service managers. “Team, we will need your help to improve our fourth-quarter performance … everyone is getting rich off the dps6. This has cost us 3 dollars per share in stock price.”\n\n'It's a bad deal'\n\nIn April 2019, Ford warned shareholders of legal exposure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. “We are currently a defendant in significant number of litigation matters relating to the performance of vehicles equipped with DPS6 transmissions,” said the last item on a 70-page document dated April 25 and signed by Cathy O’Callaghan, Ford vice president and controller. “We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts alleging damages based on state and federal consumer protection laws and breach of warranty obligations. Remedies under these statutes may include repurchase, civil penalties and plaintiff’s attorney fees. In some cases, plaintiffs also include an allegation of fraud.”\n\nFord and its customers are watching the U.S. Court of Appeals for a decision any day on whether the $35 million settlement in the class-action suit will survive a challenge by a consumer group that argued the amount is unfair. The proposed settlement caps cash payments at $2,325 per class member.\n\n“It’s a bad deal,” said Michael Kirkpatrick, an attorney for the nonprofit Public Citizen consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., which intervened as an independent third party for free.\n\n“I don’t have access to what Ford knew or when they knew it,” he told the Free Press in June. “There is strong evidence that Ford knew of a defect and covered it up and continued to sell the vehicle. That’s the allegation in the class-action complaint, and that’s why we think the relief is inadequate. Not just a defect that manifested itself after sale, and the manufacturer had no reason to know and an obligation to just fix it. It’s a much more valuable case because of the fraud.”\n\nFord told the Free Press on May 9, regarding the proposed class-action settlement, “Ford is committed to providing our customers with top-quality vehicles. We continue to deny the allegations in this lawsuit but rather than continuing with the litigation, Ford entered into a settlement agreement with lawyers representing these plaintiffs. That settlement is fair and appropriate and we look forward to final court approval.”\n\nIf the pending class-action settlement is thrown out, Ford will be forced to restart negotiations or risk trial. If that happens, attorneys have said, Ford faces a potential $4 billion liability. And consumers who didn’t know about the case when it started years ago may become aware of the litigation and bring individual lawsuits.\n\nFord’s explanation\n\nOn Sept. 5, 2018, Kwasniewicz, the North American power train quality manager, signed an affidavit in the Michigan mass action that said he was systems manager for the DPS6 transmission from 2013-16. Among his statements:\n\n“In 2011, in the very early days of production of DPS6-equipped Focuses, Ford became aware of an issue pertaining to green clutches in DPS6 transmissions. Specifically, Ford became aware that clutches in DPS6 transmissions that were ‘green,’ or not yet broken in, were exhibiting rattle noises and first gear judder.”\n\n“After the launch of DPS6-equipped vehicles, Ford at times had difficulty determining whether some symptoms being complained of were caused by the transmission’s normal operation or by a quality issue or both,” he said.\n\nKwasniewicz also said, “After the vehicles accumulated even more mileage, beginning around 2014, customers reported concerns with transmission function, including intermittent starting problems, lack of power … and intermittent concerns of loss of transmission engagement while driving.”\n\nFord’s internal documents and NHTSA complaints show that many DPS6-equipped vehicles exhibited problems immediately.\n\nKwasniewicz also repeated Ford’s contention that the transmission troubles aren’t dangerous.\n\n“The DPS6 transmission has not demonstrated any pattern of safety-related failures, and Ford concluded that none of the quality issues associated with the PowerShift transmission pose a safety concern,” the affidavit said.\n\n‘I’m fighting back tears’\n\nFiesta and Focus owners watch and hope for the best.\n\nMichelle Hughes, 43, of Flint bought her 2012 Fiesta new to drive to work at a Saginaw hospital, where she cleans and sterilizes surgical instruments.\n\n“I loved my car, but the last two years, the transmission malfunction light has come on over and over again. I don’t have the money to go and have it looked at. You’re at a stop light and you push on the gas, sometimes it won’t go. You have to literally hold the gas down. But when the car finally goes, it's like a rocket taking off. I only drive it if I have no other choice, or can't find a ride to work. I don’t drive it on the expressway anymore. Now it overheats on top of everything else.”\n\nShe continued, “The lady asked what Ford could do to help me and I said I wanted them to just buy back my car or give me a different car. I don’t need anything fancy. Just dependable, so I can get to work and take care of my family. It’s OK for me to drive myself in a car I don’t feel safe in, but I don’t want my kids in that car. I’m fighting back tears, it’s overwhelming. I can lay down and I can cry or I can keep going. I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Ford get the best of me. But I bought my car brand new and paid cash with no financing. My mom passed away and I used the money she left me.”\n\nKen Stern, the Novi-based lawyer handling the mass action case, said consumers feel betrayed.\n\n“We’re witnessing a corporation overwhelmed by greed and, in its lust for a favorable balance sheet and profits, willing to lie and to abuse their loyal customers,” he said.\n\nWhy, some people wonder, have so many people reported problems while many have not. The engineer who attended months of early crisis resolution meetings when the Fiesta and Focus were first launched said that young drivers and people who have driven mostly used cars simply don’t recognize the transmission problems for what they are. Some cars have not exhibited the worst of the symptoms, and some irregularities are accepted as normal.\n\nUntil they’re not.\n\n“They’re nice little cars and they get good gas mileage,” said Jamie Booth, 51, of Mio who bought a used 2012 Focus last year to go to work as a caregiver for people with disabilities. Her daughter saved up for a 2012 Focus to commute to classes at Michigan State University in Lansing.\n\n“I didn’t realize my daughter Shelby was having issues with her transmission,” Booth said. “She didn’t realize what it was, that it was not accelerating like it should. Then she drove my car and said it does the same thing.\n\n“When you go to accelerate, it feels like the tires are spinning but they’re not moving. ... Honestly, I thought it was traction control. Like it was happening on ice. But now it’s still doing it in the summer. When I brought it to the Ford dealer, they said not to worry, it’s fine,” Booth told the Free Press.\n\nThe noise under the hood in her car was so loud that Booth thought “it almost sounded like something alive in the front of the car was trying to get out. The car wouldn’t start. We had a towing company get it. The transmission guy said he drove it 10 miles no problem and parked it. The next morning it wouldn’t start. The closest repair shop is almost two hours south of me. And my 23-year-old daughter is on I-96. The transmission is unpredictable but the dealer says everything is perfectly fine.”\n\nShe said they “put a new ‘brain’ in my daughter’s car that cost us $1,100.”\n\nRyan Karczeweki, 34, a business intelligence analyst from Royal Oak, said he’s getting ready to replace his clutch for the third time on a 2014 Focus. It would likely be more but he just can’t go to the dealership repair shop as much as needed.\n\n“I commute from home to Detroit for work. The engine starts sputtering,” he said. “I just want to pay off the car as quick as possible — I owe $9,200 — and get a new car. It is the focal point of my financial life, the top priority. This car has been a disaster, pretty much.”\n\nFrom launch to lawsuits: how it happened\n\nJune-October 2008: Engineers’ emails show that Ford lawyers are concerned about safety.\n\nBefore March 2010: As the 2011 Fiesta moved toward launch, transmission “issues increased rather than declined.”\n\nAug. 31, 2010: Engineer Tom Langeland emails a program boss and others six months before launch of 2012 Focus saying “we cannot achieve a driveable calibration.”\n\nOct. 29, 2010: First of what would be more than 4,300 complaints to NHTSA about the DPS6.\n\nFebruary 2011: Transmission and driveline director tells factory he wants to ship the vehicles to dealers and continue working on a solution to defects.\n\nMarch 14, 2011: 2012 Focus goes to dealerships; news release calls it the “right transmission at the right time.”\n\nAugust 2012: High-level review finds “At each early checkpoint, it became more apparent” that the transmission systems “were not capable to meet customer expectations.”\n\nAugust 2012: Separately, an engineer emails “We have no fix.”\n\nOct. 13, 2014: VP of Quality Bennie Fowler says the transmission “has cost us 3 dollars per share in the stock price.”\n\nNovember 2014: Federal regulators get a web presentation from Ford on DPS6 defects. They decline to order a recall.\n\nDecember 2016: Ford report says 350,000 of the affected vehicles “have already reached 3+ repairs in US.”\n\nDecember 2016: Ford expects costs from the DPS6 flaws to be $3 billion.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/05/hatch-chile-crisis-cream-puff-sweetener-ben-jerrys-spat-news-around-states/117869556/", "title": "Hatch chile crisis, cream puff sweetener: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: More than 500 hunters across the state have bought licenses to hunt feral pigs and coyotes at night, authorities said. It’s a new approach to try to control the destructive animals in Alabama, Al.com reports. State lawmakers passed a bill last year to allow the nighttime hunting. It’s aimed at targeting the wild pigs, which cause more than a billion dollars in damage annually, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Experts say that nighttime hunting could help control the population but that trapping and killing is the best way to do so. Feral pigs – also called feral hogs, swine and wild boars – roam Alabama and other Southern states, rooting up crops and pastures and stomping through forests, fences and gardens.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management announced Tuesday that it is moving ahead with a new environmental review of oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after the interior secretary said she found “multiple legal deficiencies” in a prior review that provided a basis for the first lease sale on the refuge’s coastal plain earlier this year. The federal land agency said there will be a public process to determine the scope of the review and identify major issues related to a leasing program. Information gathered during that process will influence development of the review, according to an agency notice. President Joe Biden, in a January executive order, called on the interior secretary to temporarily halt activities related to the leasing program, review the program and, “as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts of the oil and gas program.” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in June said her review identified deficiencies in the record underpinning the leases, including an environmental review that failed to “adequately analyze a reasonable range of alternatives.” She announced plans at that time for the new review and halted activities related to the leasing program while the analysis was pending.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Phoenix Zoo is asking the public to help name one of its black-footed ferret litters. The zoo is caring for 27 black-footed ferret kits, and officials say it’s the most successful breeding season in 20 years. The first litter was born in May and the last in June. The Phoenix Zoo is one of six facilities worldwide breeding black-footed ferrets for release to the wild. The species is considered one of North America’s most endangered. Once thought to be extinct in the wild, the black-footed ferret has returned to its native habitat through reintroduction efforts facilitated by state, federal, tribal and nongovernmental wildlife conservation partners. The zoo has produced over 500 black-footed ferrets in 30 years of involvement with the breeding program, with many released into the wild in prairie grasslands in Arizona and other parts of their native range.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson pressed forward Tuesday with efforts to allow schools to mandate face masks as the state’s coronavirus cases continued to spiral, but he faced heavy opposition from fellow Republicans over the move. Hutchinson called the majority-GOP Legislature back into session to take up the change to a state law he signed in April prohibiting mask mandates by schools and other governmental bodies. The agenda for session started Wednesday also includes a proposal to prevent the state from having to resume making supplemental unemployment benefits to thousands of residents. Hutchinson has faced growing calls to revisit the ban as the state’s cases and hospitalizations surge. Arkansas on Monday reported its biggest one-day jump in hospitalizations since the pandemic began. “Local school districts should make the call, and they should have more options to make sure that their school is a safe environment during a very challenging time for education,” Hutchinson said. The governor is focusing on schools with students under the age of 12, since they’re not currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations. Arkansas has one of the lowest inoculation rates in the country, with only about 36% of the state’s population fully vaccinated against the disease.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Some farmers in one of the country’s most important agricultural regions will have to stop taking water out of major rivers and streams because of a severe drought threatening the drinking water supply for 25 million people, state regulators said Tuesday. The Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency resolution empowering regulators to halt diversions from the state’s two largest river systems. The order could apply to roughly 86% of landowners who have legal rights to divert water from the San Joaquin and Sacramento river watersheds. The remaining 14% could be affected if things get worse. The rule won’t take effect for another two weeks and includes exceptions for some uses, such as water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, sanitation and generating electricity. Without the order, officials warned much of the state’s drinking water supply would be at risk if the drought continues into next year. “This decision is not about prioritizing one group over the other but about preserving the watershed for all,” said E. Joaquin Esquivel, chair of the Water Resources Control Board. The vote came one day after regulators halted water diversions from another Northern California river system, the Upper Russian River, warning Lake Mendocino would be empty by the end of the year, “putting both people and wildlife in harm’s way.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Christian baker found to have violated the state’s anti-discrimination law by refusing to make a birthday cake for a transgender woman has appealed the ruling to the state appeals court. In a notice filed Monday, lawyers for Jack Phillips asked the appeals court to review the June ruling by a Denver judge by looking at both procedural issues and whether the ruling violated Phillips’ constitutional rights to freedom of speech and religion. Judge A. Bruce Jones ruled that attorney Autumn Scardina was denied a cake that was blue on the outside and pink on the inside to celebrate her gender transition on her birthday because of her transgender status in violation of the law. While Phillips said he could not make the cake because of its message, Jones said the case was about a refusal to sell a product, not compelled speech. Phillips won a partial victory at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 for refusing to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple when the court found the state civil rights commission showed anti-religious bias when it sanctioned Phillips.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A bronze sculpture depicting Italian immigrants is the top choice of a city panel to replace a statue of Christopher Columbus that was removed from a city park last year amid protests. The design by Branford sculptor Marc-Anthony Massaro has been chosen by the Wooster Square Monument Committee to replace the Columbus statue that had stood for 128 years in Wooster Square, the New Haven Register reports. The choice is being submitted to the Board of Alders and three other city agencies for final approval. Massaro’s work is titled “Indicando la via al futuro,” Italian for “pointing the way to the future.” It shows a boy, his older sister and their parents, newly arrived in America from Italy with suitcases. The father is holding the boy, who is pointing to something in the distance. Massero made a one-sixth-scale model of the image. “I think the committee felt that his proposal exemplified the story that we are telling – that is, the story of Italian immigration,” said William Iovanne, co-chairman of the Monument Committee. “His sculpture is incredible.” Columbus statues across the country have been removed amid widespread racial injustice protests. The city Parks Commission had voted to take down the statue amid demands by many residents, including Italian Americans.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: With the delta variant of the coronavirus spreading, state health officials recommended Tuesday that unvaccinated people get tested weekly and announced more ways to access testing, including take-home kits offered at libraries. In a statement, Gov. John Carney, the Division of Public Health, and the Delaware Emergency Management Agency urged everyone 12 and older to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and encouraged anyone who is unvaccinated to get weekly virus testing to prevent additional infections. Unvaccinated people also should undergo testing five to seven days after exposure to someone confirmed to have the coronavirus and should quarantine at home under such circumstances, especially if they develop symptoms. Cases climbed steadily in Delaware during the month of July, and more than 100 new cases have been reported every day for the past five days, officials said. Officials stress that the vaccine is effective against severe disease and death from the variants that are circulating in the United States. Only a small proportion of fully vaccinated people get infected, and those infections tend to be mild, officials said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Museum of Women in the Arts is planning its first major renovation in more than 30 years, but visitors can check it out for free this week before work closes the building down for two years, WUSA-TV reports. Officials said ahead of the long-term closure for changes and upgrades beginning Monday, the museum is offering free entry and extended hours. The two-year project will be the museum’s first major renovation since its doors opened in 1987. “We need an updated building to complement the groundbreaking work we do to champion women artists,” the museum said on its website. The museum is hoping to raise $66 million through a donation campaign to fund the renovations. Key improvements include enlarged gallery space, a new destination for researchers and education programs, enhanced amenities and accessibility for visitors, and infrastructure and storage upgrades to improve the long-term conservation and security of the museum’s collection of more than 5,500 works. NMWA purchased a landmark 78,810-square-foot former Masonic temple in 1983. “Updates to the building will refresh our space and heighten our impact as the only major museum in the world dedicated to women in the arts,” said Susan Fisher Sterling, the museum’s director.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Florida won’t put any state money into the parent company of Ben & Jerry’s unless it reverses a decision to stop selling ice cream in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. The Republican governor said the State Board of Administration added London-based Unilever to its list of “scrutinized companies” that boycott Israel. This means if Ben & Jerry’s position on Israel is not reversed in 90 days, Florida will not invest in or contract with Unilever or its subsidiaries. “As a matter of law and principle, the state of Florida will not tolerate discrimination against the state of Israel or the Israeli people,” DeSantis said in a news release. “I will not stand idly by as woke corporate ideologues seek to boycott and divest from our ally, Israel.” The company’s founders, Bennett Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, said in a recent New York Times opinion piece that they no longer control the company but approve of the action in Israel as reflecting their progressive values. “We are also proud Jews,” the founders said. “But it’s possible to support Israel and oppose some of its policies, just as we’ve opposed policies of the U.S. government.” Unilever’s 400 brands also include Dove personal care products, Lipton tea and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations continue to rise rapidly, with some hospitals voicing concern as they fill with patients infected with the coronavirus. The state Department of Public Health on Tuesday reported 9,100 new positive tests but said that number included new reports dating back until Friday that hadn’t been included because of data transfer problems with electronic reporting. With the data dump, the state’s seven-day average rose above 4,000 cases, almost 11 times higher than when cases bottomed out in late June. The current seven-day average is the highest since Feb. 10 and higher than Georgia’s peak in July 2020. The state’s rolling average peaked above 9,500 in mid-January. Hospitalizations also continued their rapid increase, climbing above 2,600 statewide Tuesday. Statewide, 26 hospitals reported to the Georgia Coordinating Center that they were turning away all patients or new intensive care patients, including seven of 11 hospitals in the Piedmont system and half of the 10 hospitals in the Wellstar system. Dr. Alan Brown, chief medical officer of the Brunswick-based Southeast Georgia Health System, told The Brunswick News that the contagious delta variant and low vaccination rates have led to the system’s hospitals having 10 to 20 times as many patients as they had in early July.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials wrongly arrested a homeless man for a crime committed by someone else, locked him up in a state hospital for more than two years, forced him to take psychiatric drugs, and then tried to cover up the mistake by quietly setting him free with just 50 cents to his name, the Hawaii Innocence Project said in a court document asking a judge to set the record straight. A petition filed in court Monday night asks a judge to vacate the arrest and correct Joshua Spriestersbach’s records. The filing lays out his bizarre plight that started with him falling asleep on a sidewalk. He was houseless and hungry while waiting in a long line for food outside a Honolulu shelter on a hot day in 2017. When a police officer roused him awake, he thought he was being arrested for the city’s ban on sitting or laying down on public sidewalks. But what he didn’t realize was that the officer mistook him for a man named Thomas Castleberry, who had a warrant out for his arrest for violating probation in a 2006 drug case. It’s unclear how this happened, as Spriestersbach and Castleberry had never met. Spriestersbach somehow ended up with Castleberry as his alias, according to the Hawaii Innocence Project. Spriestersbach’s attorneys argue it all could have been cleared up if police simply compared the two men’s photographs and fingerprints.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: Police in eastern Idaho are warning residents that counterfeit pain pills laced with a dangerous synthetic opioid have been found in the region. The Pocatello Police Department said a bag of about 3,000 pills that contained fentanyl – but that were disguised to look like less-potent oxycodone – were found at a local trailhead last month. Investigators fear the pills could cause lethal overdoses. “These pills are extremely dangerous and essentially impossible to discern as being fake or legitimate by appearance alone,” said Pocatello Police Capt. Bill Collins. “We have seen lots of overdoses in our area because of fentanyl, which we have found laced with methamphetamine, heroin and other pills. We don’t want anyone touching them, and we certainly don’t want anyone to ingest them.” Collins said the Pacific Northwest region has been “inundated” with similar pills in recent months, “but we haven’t seen them left out in the open in this quantity before.” The 3,000 or so pills – with a street value Collins said is somewhere around $60,000 – are colored and marked to resemble Oxycodone 30mg, a commonly prescribed medication for chronic or severe pain. Fentanyl is a controlled substance about 100 times more potent than morphine that is usually used to treat patients with chronic or severe pain after a surgery.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state will effectively end immigrant detention and further restrict local law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with federal immigration authorities under a plan Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed into law Monday. The new law targets local government agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement allowing jails to house immigrant detainees awaiting court hearings. Current contracts must end by January 2022, and new agreements are prohibited. Currently, three Illinois counties – Kankakee, Pulaski and McHenry – have such agreements at local jails and house roughly 260 immigrant detainees overall, according to ICE. “Every family, every child, every human being deserves to feel safe and secure in the place that they call home,” Pritzker said at an event in Aurora where he signed several other immigration-related measures. The measure likely ends the federal agency’s power to detain immigrants in Illinois. Most detainees in ICE custody nationwide are held in privately run facilities. The agency owns and operates only a handful of its own detention centers, and none exist in Illinois. The state barred private detention in 2019 following several failed attempts to build a new facility near Chicago.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Supreme Court on Tuesday denied an emergency request by state Attorney General Todd Rokita to stall Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s lawsuit challenging the increased power state legislators gave themselves to intervene during public health emergencies following conservative objections to his COVID-19 actions. Rokita petitioned the Indiana Supreme Court last month after a Marion County judge ruled against arguments from his office that he alone has the legal authority to represent the state in court and can decide whether the new law is allowed under the state constitution. The Republican attorney general asked the Indiana Supreme Court to order the trial court hearing the case to “cease all proceedings” in the lawsuit, arguing that Holcomb’s lawsuit does not meet the narrow standard for cases filed with the high court. The court turned down the emergency request 5-0 without comment. A request for a permanent writ is still pending, with briefs due Friday. The next hearing in Marion Superior Court is scheduled for Sept. 10. Holcomb’s lawsuit argues that the law passed this year over his veto by the Republican-dominated Legislature is unconstitutional because it gives lawmakers a new power to call themselves into a special legislative “emergency session” during governor-declared statewide emergencies.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A teenager who was critically injured in an amusement ride accident that killed his younger brother last month was released from the hospital Tuesday. David Jaramillo, 16, went home from Blank Children’s Hospital after having been placed on life support following the July 3 accident on the Raging River raft ride at Adventureland Park in Altoona. David initially was placed in a medically induced coma, and when he first regained consciousness, he could neither see nor speak. As of Friday he has regained his vision, speech, and ability to walk and eat solid food. “They say I’m mostly fine,” David said. “I just have to go to a few more speech therapy sessions and make sure my brain is OK.” That his recovery has been so quick and medical treatment so successful is nothing short of God’s work, said his father, also named David. The Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, went to Adventureland to celebrate David’s birthday. Their boat on the ride, which has been a staple of the park since 1983 and uses a conveyor belt to push circular rafts through rapids, flipped upside down within seconds, causing all six to hit their heads on the surface below and trapping them in their seatbelts underneath the water. At least one other family who rode on one of the boats within minutes of the Jaramillo family reported problems with their raft. Amber Estrada, 31, said last month that the boat carrying her family at times struck and dragged along the bottom of the human-made river and that her family felt unsafe.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State Attorney General Derek Schmidt said he will prosecute any violations of election laws in Douglas County upon which the district attorney refuses to act. Douglas County District Attorney Suzanne Valdez, a Democrat, said last week that her office will not prosecute violations of new voting laws that took effect July 1. She said they are too vague and too broad and threaten “to create felons out of dedicated defenders of democracy.” Among the provisions is one that makes it illegal to “give the appearance of being an election official.” State-level voter engagement groups contend that could criminalize their work if Kansans mistake volunteers for election officials. Schmidt, a Republican seeking his party’s nomination for governor, urged law enforcement agencies in the county to refer election law cases to him, the Wichita Eagle reports. “Thousands of Kansans will go to the polls tomorrow in the municipal primary elections,” Schmidt said Monday. “Citizens throughout our state deserve assurance that state election-integrity laws will be enforced and election crimes, like all other crimes, will be prosecuted when warranted by the evidence.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Fatal drug overdoses – an ongoing scourge that has ravaged communities in the state – surged nearly 50% last year, and isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was a “major contributing factor,” a state report concludes. More than 1,964 Kentuckians died from drug overdoses in 2020, according to the report from the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and the Office of Drug Control Policy. The official count easily eclipsed the state’s prior record level of fatal drug overdoses and mirrored a national increase in overdose deaths, the report said. Kentucky’s rising death toll was driven by opioid abuse. A key factor was the prevalence of fentanyl – involved in about 71% of the state’s overdose deaths for the year, according to the report, issued Tuesday. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid increasingly added to other illicit drugs to boost potency. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers. But the Office of Drug Control Policy pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a “major contributing factor” in the surge in deaths. “The interruption of routine for those in recovery, the sense of isolation, economic concerns and anxiety all contributed to the dramatic increase recorded,” the report said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Education leaders said Tuesday that state standardized test results show public school students who attended in-person classes during the coronavirus pandemic outperformed those who relied on distance learning. The Advocate reports the disparities surfaced on LEAP 2025, standardized tests that measure what students in grades 3-12 know about math, English, science and social studies. Students took the tests in April and May. Louisiana’s goal is for students to achieve mastery or better – the fourth-highest of five achievement levels. The education department said in grades three through eight, the rate of students who scored mastery or higher on the English and math portions of the test was 15% higher for students who spent the 2020-21 school year in the classroom compared to those who relied on online instruction. Students who used distance learning had an 11% greater rate of scoring unsatisfactory on the exams – the lowest achievement level. State Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said in a statement the test results show it’s “absolutely critical that we keep our students in the classroom for this upcoming year while mitigating the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Maine Public Utilities Commission has opened an investigation into a lack of phone numbers available in the 207 area code, the only code used in the state. The investigation centers on the number-forecasting practices of the provider Verizon, the Portland Press Herald reports. Last year, an assessment found that Maine no longer had access to most of the 8 million phone numbers in the area code. Because of expected demand, Maine’s area code could run out of usable numbers by late 2024, according to the newspaper. Carriers said that Maine should join the 25 states in the country that have added multiple area codes. Maine Public Utilities Commission said it questions how Verizon distributes numbers to people. “Verizon may be using unrealistic forecasting goals, unnecessarily tying up available phone numbers,” PUC Chairman Philip Bartlett said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has fired its principal flutist, months after distancing itself from her controversial social media posts. The orchestra didn’t offer a specific reasons for its decision to dismiss Emily Skala on Tuesday, but it comes six months after the orchestra publicly rebuked her for social media posts that questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines as well as the efficacy of face masks. She also questioned the authenticity of the presidential election results. BSO President and CEO Peter Kjome said in a statement that Skala was fired under the progressive discipline policy agreed to with the Musicians’ Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. “Ms. Skala has had discipline imposed upon her over these past few months for violating several policies; unfortunately, she has repeated the conduct for which she had been previously disciplined, and dismissal was the necessary and appropriate reaction to this behavior,” the statement said. Skala had been suspended from work duties and told The Baltimore Sun she was notified by phone Tuesday that she had lost her job of 33 years. “I’ve only ever wanted to state my truth,” Skala said. “I’m not going to sit passively by.” It wasn’t clear whether “repeated conduct” in the statement refers to new social media posts.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The famous islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are facing serious impacts from rising sea levels and more powerful coastal storms driven by climate change, a new environmental report released Wednesday warns. The “State of the Coast” report by the Trustees, a prominent Massachusetts conservation group, says the popular tourist destinations off Cape Cod risk losing hundreds of acres of marshlands to flooding and billions of dollars in coastal homes, buildings and infrastructure to erosion. What’s more, roughly 900 structures on the two islands may experience daily tidal flooding by 2050 as sea levels are predicted to rise more than 2.5 feet, the organization said. “The impacts of flooding and erosion on these beloved islands will affect thousands who live and work there and the thousands more who visit each summer,” said Tom O’Shea, a managing director at the Trustees. The island communities, which also include the small and sparsely populated Elizabeth Islands, also known as Gosnold, are taking climate change seriously, the organization said in its report. Island communities have hired staff focused on climate change and begun resiliency work – redesigning harbors, replenishing sandy beaches, raising roads and creating living shorelines to protect against coastal erosion.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: While COVID-19 upended and ended the lives of thousands of Michiganders, taking a profound emotional toll, the challenges of 2020 did not seem to bring about a rise in suicides, which early data indicates dropped last year after rising significantly over the previous decade. According to provisional data from the state health department, Michigan recorded 1,284 deaths by suicide in 2020, down nearly 200 from the 1,471 recorded in 2019 and more than 250 from the 1,547 deaths in 2018. Nationally, suicides dropped from 47,511 in 2019 to 44,834 in 2020, a decline of 5.6%, preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. In Michigan, suicides have been on the rise for years, increasing annually with few exceptions over the past decade. The decline indicated by preliminary data comes despite Michiganders and Americans reporting they felt more anxious and depressed – and GOP state lawmakers promising pandemic regulations would lead to skyrocketing suicide rates. The data came as a surprise to the state’s suicide prevention coordinator. “I think everybody’s assumption … was that there would be a dramatic increase,” said Patricia Smith, who leads the state health department’s prevention efforts.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a state law requiring individuals to have a permit to carry a handgun in public is constitutional and does not violate the Second Amendment. The ruling comes in the case of a man who was charged with carrying a pistol without a permit. Nathan Hatch was arrested in 2018 after Metropolitan Airport Commission police stopped to help him after his truck broke down. He told officers he had a gun in the back seat and did not have a permit, and officers found a loaded pistol. Hatch was convicted of a gross misdemeanor. On appeal, he tried to strike down the state’s permit-to-carry statute, arguing it violated his right to bear arms and failed to survive strict scrutiny because it was not narrowly tailored to advance the state’s interests. The Supreme Court disagreed. “Considering the undisputed compelling governmental interest in ensuring public safety and the narrowly tailored provisions of the statute to achieve that interest, we conclude that the permit-to-carry statute withstands strict scrutiny,” the justices ruled. “We therefore hold that the permit-to-carry statute does not violate the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The sheriff of the state’s largest county has died, almost two weeks after he tested positive for the coronavirus amid an outbreak of the illness at a jail he oversaw, despite being vaccinated. The Hinds County Sheriff’s Department said an ambulance was sent to the home of Sheriff Lee Vance on Wednesday morning. “Sheriff Vance was non-responsive when medical personnel arrived and pronounced deceased,” the department posted on Twitter. The sheriff’s office announced July 23 that Vance had tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and was in isolation at home. It was not immediately known whether that illness caused his death. Vance was elected sheriff in 2019. He had served more than 30 years with the Jackson Police Department and was chief from 2014 to 2017. Vance had been vaccinated against COVID-19, and he tested positive as cases of the virus were spreading rapidly at the Hinds County jail.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Gov. Mike Parson announced Tuesday that he made good on his promise to pardon a couple who gained notoriety for pointing guns at social justice demonstrators as they marched past the couple’s home in a luxury St. Louis enclave last year. Parson, a Republican, on Friday pardoned Mark McCloskey, who pleaded guilty in June to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and was fined $750, and Patricia McCloskey, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment and was fined $2,000. “Mark McCloskey has publicly stated that if he were involved in the same situation, he would have the exact same conduct,” the McCloskeys’ lawyer Joel Schwartz said Tuesday. “He believes that the pardon vindicates that conduct.” The McCloskeys, both lawyers in their 60s, said they felt threatened by the protesters, who were passing their home in June 2020 on their way to demonstrate in front of the mayor’s house nearby in one of hundreds of similar demonstrations around the country after George Floyd’s death. The couple also said the group was trespassing on a private street. Mark McCloskey emerged from his home with an AR-15-style rifle, and Patricia McCloskey waved a semiautomatic pistol, according to the indictment. Special prosecutor Richard Callahan said his investigation determined the protesters were peaceful.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte announced the allocation of over $35 million in coronavirus relief dollars Wednesday. More than $32 million will go toward COVID-19 screening and testing in schools. Over $1.6 million will go toward an employment and training program that assists people supported by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program gain skills and workforce experience. Gianforte said the funds will help SNAP recipients become self-sufficient. Currently, the program is only available in three Montana counties: Yellowstone, Missoula, and Lewis and Clark. Gianforte also approved $1.2 million for a program that provides early intervention services for infants with significant developmental delays or disabilities. The Montana public health department reported that enrollment in the program dropped by 48% during the coronavirus pandemic. About 1,540 infants were served by the program in the 2020 fiscal year. Over $300,000 will go to Montana’s Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act grant to provide training and technical support to teams responding to child abuse in the state.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: An 8-foot bulge near the north end of Offutt Air Force Base’s single runway will disappear during a $198 million reconstruction project that is the most extensive in its history. For the past five months, construction equipment has been swarming over Offutt’s 2-mile runway, chewing it to bits and depositing it into giant piles of rubble, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Much of that concrete will eventually be recycled, mixed with other fill, and compacted to form a base for the new runway. The hump was one of the airfield’s quirks. It and the 8-foot valley toward the south end were gentle enough that they never posed a threat to pilots, said Lt. Col. Derrick Michaud, director of the 55th Wing Runway Project Management Office. The paved runway still in use was put down in 1941 to accommodate the Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant, which produced more than 2,000 military aircraft during World War II. The runway was extended to its current length in the mid-1950s. Over the years, the original concrete was patched and repaired but never completely replaced. The runway had deteriorated so badly by 2015 that it was ranked as the worst of any at the 17 bases operated by the Air Force’s Air Combat Command.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An uptick in coronavirus cases driven by the highly contagious delta variant and Nevada’s flagging rate of vaccinations has pushed hospitalization rates in the state past levels seen in a surge last summer, well before vaccines were available. Nevada reported Tuesday that 1,148 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, and 67 others were suspected to have the illness. Those are levels last seen in late January but below the peak seen since the pandemic began. That came in December, when hospitals were pushed to near capacity, with few people having access to vaccines and many gathering over the holidays. On Dec. 15, Nevada reported 1,857 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Now, hospitals have more COVID-19 patients than during a previous surge last summer, when 972 were hospitalized and 174 were suspected of having the virus. As of last week, the Nevada Hospital Association said seven hospitals were reporting a surge in cases above licensed bed counts, and five had staffing shortages. There were 231 COVID-19 patients in intensive care last week – about half the peak of 460 seen Dec. 22. There were 142 people on ventilators, less than half the level seen at the peak the same December day.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nJaffrey: A theater that offered entertainment from 1922 to 1976 before it closed is reopening. A ribbon-cutting is scheduled for Thursday at the Park Theatre in Jaffrey. The theater has been rebuilt to feature two auditoriums seating 450. They will feature movies, live theater – including children’s productions – concerts, lectures and community gatherings. Construction began in 2019. “This project is the culmination of the efforts of more than 1,000 people. We are so proud to present the new theatre to our town, the region, and New England,” Nancy Belletete, theater board president, said in a statement. On Thursday, two classic films will be presented as part of a “Quarter Day” in the auditoriums: “Field of Dreams” and “Cinderella.” The ticket price will be 25 cents for either film, with popcorn costing 10 cents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJackson: Six Flags Great Adventure will host three daylong COVID-19 vaccination clinics this month. All guests who receive a shot on site will also get a free ticket to the park’s Wild Safari Drive-Thru Adventure for the 2021 season. Vaccinations will be available 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday, with additional clinics Wednesday, Aug. 11, and Tuesday, Aug. 17. The park has partnered with the Ocean County Health Department for the free vaccination clinics, which will take place in the Membership Building in the park’s outer mall. Participants will have their choice of the two-shot Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Reservations are not required, and parking fees may apply. “We’re honored to partner with the Ocean County Health Department to encourage New Jersey residents and our out-of-state guests to get vaccinated,” Six Flags park president John Winkler said in a statement. “The vaccination helps us protect ourselves and those we love.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state prides itself on having the best chiles in the world, but a shortage of farmhands could leave a big portion of this year’s bumper crop rotting on the vine. “We have one of the best chile crops the state has ever seen because the weather just set up perfectly in most areas,” Joram Robbs, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association, told the Santa Fe New Mexican on Tuesday. “There are some farmers that got hit by monsoons in a negative way, but there’s tons of chile on these plants, so we’re going to see a huge loss if we don’t get it picked.” Some GOP lawmakers and farmers in the Hatch Valley are blaming the labor shortage on the extra unemployment insurance benefit payments they believe are keeping workers at home instead of in the field, and they’re urging Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to “immediately” cut them off. In a letter to the governor, Sen. Crystal Diamond of Elephant Butte and Reps. Rebecca Dow of Truth or Consequences and Luis Terrazas of Silver City contend the supplemental unemployment benefits are responsible for a lack of workers “in virtually every area of our state’s economy.” Joe Paul Lack, who grows chile in addition to onions and pecans, said he’ll probably only be able to harvest half of the 80 acres of onions he grew this year because he doesn’t have enough workers.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New York International Auto Show has become a casualty of the coronavirus’ fast-spreading delta variant. Show organizers said Wednesday that they’ve decided to cancel it this year, a little over two weeks before the scheduled start. The reasons are the growing spread of the variant and recent restrictions announced by state and local officials to fight it. “Over the past few weeks, especially within the past few days, circumstances have changed, making it more difficult to create an event at the high standard that we and our clients expect,” Mark Schienberg, the show’s president, said in a statement. The show was scheduled to begin with a press day Aug. 19. The next show will come in April 2022, spokesman Chris Sams said. The event was scrubbed before automakers’ trucks left warehouses to start moving into the Jacob Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, Sams said. He said current government precautions wouldn’t have stopped this year’s show, but organizers feared the situation could worsen between now and the start. Once the trucks depart, costs to automakers grow, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Young people would need parental permission now before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in legislation approved unanimously Tuesday by the state Senate. The bill, which now must return to the House for consideration, contains a parent or guardian requirement for vaccines approved by federal regulators for emergency use, such as the Pfizer COVID-19 shot. It’s currently the only COVID-19 vaccine available to children as young as 12. North Carolina law currently allows those under 18 to make the vaccine decision on their own “if they show the decisional capacity to do so,” according to the state Department of Health Human Services. DHHS said it’s expected most teens would receive parental consent anyway. But legislators wanted more assurances that parents will have the say over whether their child gets an immunization still authorized for emergency use. The consent provision is contained within a bill that also would expand the types of medications immunizing pharmacists can administer. The state health director would issue standing orders for immunizing pharmacists to administer more medications without a doctor’s prescription. Those would include certain nicotine smoking cessation programs, some oral contraceptives or those delivered via a skin patch, and prenatal vitamins.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: An attorney for a man accused in the gruesome killings of four people at a property management firm said Wednesday that the case amounts to a rush to judgment based on bad information that led to the wrong conclusion. A prosecutor, though, said every piece of the puzzle leads to the defendant. Chad Isaak, 47, of Washburn, is on trial for the April 1, 2019, deaths of RJR Maintenance & Management co-owner Robert Fakler, 52, and co-workers Adam Fuehrer, 42, and spouses Bill and Lois Cobb, 50 and 45. He pleaded not guilty to four counts of murder and three other counts. It was one of the most heinous crimes in North Dakota history, defense attorney Bruce Quick acknowledged in his opening statement. Three of the victims were shot and stabbed. Combined, the four of them were stabbed about 100 times. Prosecutor Karlei Neufeld began the trial being livestreamed from Mandan by describing the horrific crime scene and said evidence would include photos, surveillance video, lab reports, bullet fragments, and a knife and other things found during searches of the suspect’s home and vehicle. Quick spent a good chunk of his opening statement pointing out what evidence was overlooked or not investigated, saying law enforcement was under a “tremendous amount pressure to solve this case.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Mike Carey, a coal lobbyist backed by former President Donald Trump, beat a bevy of Republicans in central Ohio, while Cuyahoga County Council member Shontel Brown pulled out a victory for the Democratic establishment in Cleveland, in a pair of primary elections for open House seats Tuesday. The special elections were both viewed as a measure of voters’ influences, though low turnout and huge candidate fields complicated interpreting the results too broadly. In both races, party leaders showed they still held sway. Carey’s race reinforced Trump’s status as GOP kingmaker, particularly after the former president’s preferred candidate lost a special election in Texas last week. Brown’s primary win over progressive Nina Turner handed another blow to a liberal wing that has been challenging the Democratic old guard with a more confrontational style. Turner, a leading national voice for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns, was for many months the best known and most visible among 13 Democrats running in the fiercely fought primary and the choice of Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others. But Brown – a centrist backed by Hillary Clinton, influential House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, the Congressional Black Caucus, leading unions and many local leaders – prevailed after a surge in national attention.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 150,000 Oklahomans have qualified for Medicaid under an expansion of the program approved by voters, and state health officials say they suspect many more residents are eligible but haven’t yet applied. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority reported Monday that 154,316 people have qualified for the additional health benefits. Of those, nearly 91,000 live in urban areas and about 63,000 in rural Oklahoma. About half are between 19 and 34 years old. “We are currently working with our community partners to reach those hard-to-find eligible adults,” said OHCA CEO Kevin Corbett. “We encourage Oklahomans to spread the word to their family and friends in hopes of providing health care coverage to those who need it.” After a decade of Republican resistance, Oklahoma voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment last year to expand eligibility for benefits. Now, an individual who earns up to $17,796 annually or $36,588 for a family of four qualifies for Medicaid health care coverage. The Health Care Authority has projected that about 215,000 residents would qualify for expanded Medicaid for a total annual cost of about $1.3 billion. The estimated state share would be about $164 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, some counties – most where less than half of the area’s adult population is vaccinated – are experiencing their highest hospitalization numbers of the pandemic. Statewide coronavirus-related hospitalizations increased to 379 patients Tuesday, 39 more than the previous day. Some hospital officials, including those at Oregon Health & Science University, said they are postponing some surgeries that are not urgent, KOIN-TV reports. In addition, Oregon health officials reported 1,575 newly confirmed and presumptive COVID-19 cases Tuesday, the most since early January. “The vaccines that we currently have available to us in Oregon, and across the United States, are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and death from COVID-19,” Dr. Dean Sidelinger, the state epidemiologist, said Friday. “But that depends on people being vaccinated.” About 29% of adults in Oregon are unvaccinated, and more than 102,000 vaccine doses have been thrown away due to non-use. The impacts of the virus on unvaccinated people are apparent when looking at high infection rates in counties with low vaccination rates, such as those in eastern Oregon, including Baker, Malheur, Morrow, Umatilla, Union and Wallowa counties.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A Republican state senator who wants to have the committee he leads force three counties to turn over election machines, ballots and related material said Tuesday that he thinks subpoenas will be issued in the next two weeks. Sen. Doug Mastriano of Franklin County told the conservative-friendly outlet Newsmax that he’s working on a broad subpoena to York, Tioga and Philadelphia counties. “Obviously I can’t operate on my own, so I have a committee, so the committee will have a vote, hopefully in the next week or two, that will authorize the committee, and me as their chair, to send the subpoenas to three counties,” he said. The deadline for voluntary compliance that Mastriano gave the counties expired in recent days – officials in Tioga and Philadelphia have said no, and York has raised concerns but has not directly turned him down. Mastriano has been a leading proponent in Pennsylvania of former President Donald Trump’s attempt to reverse his election loss. Mastriano was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, when Trump encouraged a mob that subsequently forced their way past police into the seat of federal legislative power. He said Tuesday that the subpoenas would help the committee look into the November election as well as the May 2021 primary in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Fifteen more nonprofits have each been awarded $10,000 as a part of the state’s vaccine incentive program, which releases the awards as more residents get inoculated, Gov. Daniel McKee announced Tuesday. The RI Gives Vax Challenge launched last month awards grants to nonprofits that have been on the front lines of the pandemic response for every 5,000 people in the state who get a first dose of a vaccine. 15,000 first doses have been administered since the program was announced, the state Department of Health said. “It takes a team to get the job done, and Rhode Island is lucky to have so many nonprofits stepping up to keep us safe, support vaccination efforts and help those in need,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. Nearly 660,000 people have been fully vaccinated in the state, and almost 80% of adult Rhode Islanders are now at least partially vaccinated, according to state health officials. “It is inspiring to see Rhode Islanders stepping up to help organizations that are delivering food, housing and health care to those most affected by the pandemic,” said Neil Steinberg, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, which is partially funding the $750,000 initiative. “But make no mistake, more resources will be necessary.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The mayor is considering issuing a school mask mandate, a move he says would protect vaccine-ineligible children amid the coronavirus’ resurgence. The effort would put Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, a Democrat, at odds with Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, as well as the GOP-controlled Legislature, which recently barred such policies for all public schools. Benjamin, who has previously declared a state of emergency during the pandemic, said during a City Council meeting Tuesday that he was considering issuing a new one, which he said would allow him to impose mask requirements in schools within the city’s limits. Because adults, as well as children age 12 and older, are eligible to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Benjamin said he was not considering a universal mask mandate – only one intended to protect age-ineligible kids. “The challenge is that our babies are unvaccinated,” said Benjamin, currently in his third and final term as Columbia mayor and among South Carolina’s most notable Democrats. “If we as a community are not willing to do what is necessary to keep them safe and keep them alive, then that is indeed a statement on who we are as a people.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Education leaders say that as the new school year approaches, the state doesn’t have enough teachers and support staff, a situation they attribute to the coronavirus pandemic. State Education Secretary Tiffany Sanderson said every school district in South Dakota is dealing with staffing shortages for the upcoming year. “The open positions right now, going into the school year three weeks away, we still have almost 120 unfilled positions for classroom teachers,” she said. Sanderson said some teachers decided to retire earlier than planned because of COVID-19. She said schools are also looking for additional staff to help students who need tutoring or special assistance to make up for lost learning during the pandemic. Sioux Falls Superintendent Jane Stavem said her district is having trouble finding enough bus drivers and other support staff. Stavem said she is concerned the pandemic will make college students rethink pursuing a teaching career, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. “The complexities that our staff dealt with in just the dailiness of teaching were immense, and it was very exhausting,” she said. Stavem said one way to recruit more teachers is to raise their salaries. The Sioux Falls school board voted in May to raise the base pay for new teachers from $37,000 to $41,000.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state has sent nearly half a million dollars to farmers who have vaccinated their cattle against respiratory diseases and other maladies over the past two years. But Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who grew up on his family’s ranch and refers to himself as a cattle farmer in his Twitter profile, has been far less enthusiastic about incentivizing herd immunity among humans. Even though Tennessee has among the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country, Lee has refused to follow the lead of other states that have offered enticements for people to get the potentially life-saving shots. Lee hasn’t always been against incentivizing vaccinations. Tennessee’s Herd Health program began in 2019 under Lee, whose family business, Triple L Ranch, breeds Polled Hereford cattle. The state currently reimburses participating farmers up to $1,500 for vaccinating their herds, handing out $492,561 over the past two fiscal years, according to documents from the Tennessee Agriculture Department. Lee, who so far has avoided drawing a serious Republican primary challenge in his 2022 reelection bid, has been accused of complacency in the face of the deadly pandemic. Tennessee’s vaccination rates for COVID-19 hover around 39% of its total population, versus more than 49% nationally for the fully inoculated.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Texas from allowing state troopers to stop vehicles carrying migrants on the grounds that they may spread COVID-19 as worries and new cases are rising along the U.S.-Mexico border. The temporary order by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone of El Paso is at least a short-term victory for the Biden administration, which had warned that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s plan would create more problems amid high levels of summer border crossings in Texas – particularly in the Rio Grande Valley, which one U.S. official called the “epicenter of the current surge.” In a sign of the growing strain, local officials there who have rebuffed Abbott’s hard-line immigration actions to jail border-crossers and build new barriers declared a local state of disaster this week as coronavirus cases climb and as capacity at migrant shelters is stretched. Cardone said Abbott’s directive would have the effect of “exacerbating the spread of COVID-19.” She scheduled another hearing for next week. Abbott spokesman Renae Eze said that the decision was “based on limited evidence” and that the governor’s office looked forward to providing evidence to the court.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s hospitals are feeling the strain as coronavirus cases increase, the vast majority among unvaccinated people, officials said Tuesday. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called the latest wave a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” yet maintained the state wouldn’t be following New York in requiring people to show they got their shots. Still, if private companies require some sort of proof, the state would support them, he said. “The delta variant is highly contagious, and it’s spreading rapidly. Our hospital ICUs are filling up, and our health care workers are feeling the strain,” he said. Hospitals have a shortage of qualified health care workers more than a year into the punishing pandemic. Intensive care units around the state have exceeded 100% capacity multiple times over the past several days, according to officials with Intermountain Healthcare. The state had more than 6,000 new cases over the past week, and about 90% of those were among unvaccinated people, hospital system officials said. There’s also a national shortage of a medication shown to be effective in treating COVID-19 called Tocilizumab, doctors said. Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who said she still suffers the effects of her own battle with COVID-19, was blunt: “Everybody who is unvaccinated is part of the problem,” she said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Performance venues across the state that were closed by the COVID-19 pandemic will get up to $18.7 million in federal funding to help them survive, according to Vermont’s congressional delegation. The money for the 59 locations comes from the Small Business Administration Shuttered Venue Operators Grants, which are available to live music venues, movie theaters and performing arts organizations affected by the pandemic. The three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation said what began as the “Save Our Stages” movement over a year ago has now materialized into meaningful relief for the affected venues. “Our independent live music and entertainment venues not only bring joy and energy to our downtowns and communities, they are economic engines that help make Vermont such a special place to live and visit,” said the statement by Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy and independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. The program provides support to businesses in the music and entertainment sector that were forced to shut their doors due to coronavirus restrictions. The grants have served as a lifeline for the venues, the statement said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state House gave initial approval Wednesday to a spending plan for billions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief money, a day after the Democratic majority flatly rejected a Republican-proposed alternative. The chamber ultimately advanced the legislation on a bipartisan vote of 71-25. The budget proposal crafted by Gov. Ralph Northam and fellow Democratic leaders calls for spending most of Virginia’s $4.3 billion share of the American Rescue Plan funding on initiatives aimed at helping small businesses, improving air quality in public schools, bolstering mental health and substance abuse treatment, increasing broadband access, and replenishing the state’s depleted unemployment trust fund. Republicans, in the minority in both chambers, have complained that they were kept out of the budget-writing process and were stifled by Democrats in the House who allowed no amendments to be offered in committee and squashed a GOP counterproposal offered on the floor Tuesday by House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert. Gilbert was given two minutes to discuss his proposed alternative. Democrats said their budget would help struggling families and businesses.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amid a tough summer for agriculture across the state, with crops like berries struggling under record heat and drought, some farmers now worry about how smoke in August could stunt the growth of some crops should the haze intensify and linger, KOMO-TV reports. Jennifer Schuh has worked with her father Steve Schuh for decades in the Skagit Valley, growing everything from corn to berries, squash, cucumbers and pumpkins. She said a long stretch of thick smoke could hurt their crops. Steve Schuh isn’t letting the potential of damaging smoke worry him, but he acknowledged ash can block a plant’s access to light and food. “They don’t function right if they’re all covered in smoke,” said Steve Schuh. While smoke has stayed in the upper levels of the atmosphere in Western Washington this week, communities in Central and Eastern Washington have battled wildfires and bad air quality for weeks. Some winemakers say smoke has not affected their wine grapes so far, but it could get bad in August. “They can get something called ‘smoke taint,’ ” said Nick Bond, the Washington state climatologist. “That is especially a problem right before they’re harvested.” Bond said wildfires could intensify in the next few weeks, posing a threat to agriculture around the region.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: People who inject drugs in Kanawha County should have expanded access to sterile syringes, testing and treatment in response to one of the nation’s highest spikes of HIV cases, according to federal and state recommendations released Tuesday. The report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state’s Department of Health and Human Resources, and the health department in its largest county comes amid a new West Virginia law that tightens requirements for needle exchange programs. Other guidance resulting from the CDC investigation includes getting the community involved in addressing the HIV outbreak and doing more analysis of public health data to understand the extent of injection drug use in Kanawha County. The agency also recommends expanding and improving so-called harm reduction programs that connect people with substance abuse treatment, recovery support and other health services. And it outlines actions that should be taken by agencies such as health departments, social services, clinical and correctional settings, and public safety. The report found there were 63 new intravenous drug-related HIV cases in the county from January 2019 through May 13 of this year. Before 2019, the average number of such cases in the county was below five per year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Anyone who gets vaccinated against COVID-19 at a clinic at the Wisconsin State Fair will get a free cream puff, Gov. Tony Evers said Wednesday. AMI Expeditionary Healthcare will run the free clinic at the fair in West Allis, the governor said. The clinic will offer Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Anyone who gets a shot there will receive a voucher for a free cream puff redeemable at the Cream Puff Pavilion. The incentive comes as COVID-19 cases are surging across the state, driven largely by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus that causes the disease. The fair begins Thursday and is scheduled to run through Aug. 15.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike should resume wearing masks indoors in most of the state amid a rise in infections of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus, the state health officer said Wednesday. Fifteen of Wyoming’s 23 counties – including Laramie, Campbell, Sweetwater, Albany and Fremont – had moderate to high virus transmission, according to a health department dashboard. People should wear masks indoors in those and 10 other counties, said Dr. Alexia Harrist, the state health officer. “We are deeply concerned. The delta variant has really changed the COVID fight we have on our hands. Unfortunately, Wyoming’s low vaccination rate makes our state more vulnerable to this highly contagious variant,” Harrist said. A recent survey of more than 5,000 people with lab-confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases in Wyoming showed that 95% were not fully vaccinated against the disease, the health department said. About one-third of residents are fully inoculated, according to the department. That’s one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the U.S.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/08/florida-no-shade-law-endangers-airport-workers-outdoor-laborers-farmworkers-gardeners/73611783007/", "title": "Florida no-shade law endangers airport workers, farmworkers", "text": "Kate Cimini\n\nUSA TODAY Network-Florida\n\nNAPLES, Fla. – In South Florida, one of the state's hottest regions, María González works outdoors cleaning planes.\n\nGonzález spends her nights on the airport tarmac doing deep cleans of planes – scrubbing away feces, vomit, animal and human hair and more. Often, she said, airline staff turn off the plane’s air conditioning to save gasoline and money and let it sit on the asphalt, which radiates heat.\n\n“Hay mucho calor, entonces uno sude y sude y sude,” González said. “El calor se duplica ahora porque empiece el verano.”\n\nIn English: it gets so hot on the planes as she cleans that she can’t stop sweating. And in the summer? The heat doubles.\n\n“Me siento como mal, como yo me fuera a desmayar,” said González, explaining that her blood pressure drops, and she often feels so ill that she thinks she’s going to faint.\n\nBut in April, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law banning local municipalities from requiring employers to give heat breaks to outdoor workers such as González, a move DeSantis himself admitted to media was to slap back at one of Florida’s most progressive municipalities, Miami-Dade County, one county south from where she works.\n\nOnly Miami-Dade County required employers to provide heat breaks to begin with.\n\nDeSantis' office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nStill, his decision to get rid of home rule in a state that values small government and is one of the hottest states in the nation took some local officials aback and infuriated outdoor workers and their advocates in some of the hottest regions of the state.\n\nIn a warming world, outdoor workers and organizations that protect them say heat and water breaks are a matter of life and death.\n\n“These pro-heat stress bills are really about making sure no one is held accountable if something bad happens to workers…if they get sick or die in extreme heat,” said Florida District Director for Miami-based custodial workers' union SEIU 32BJ Helene O’Brien.\n\nFlorida holds municipalities to a heat standard that doesn't exist\n\nFlorida House Bill 433 states that cities or towns don’t have a right to require employers to provide heat or shade breaks that the state or federal government doesn’t already require. Absent a state department of worker safety, Florida falls under federal OSHA jurisdiction, which covers most private-sector workers in the state.\n\nHowever, neither the federal government nor Florida has a heat standard that requires breaks at certain temperatures or sun exposure; advocates say the language is frustratingly vague. Federal workplace safety agency OSHA instead requires breaks \"long enough for workers to recover from the heat.\" And while OSHA requires employers to provide water for workers, it doesn’t require that employers give their workers time to drink the water.\n\nThe vagaries of the policy have allowed some companies to push the limits – until their workers feel the effects. And the threat of an OSHA investigation doesn't always strike fear into the hearts of management or owners.\n\nJust last summer, one farmworker, 29-year-old Efraín López García, died from heat exposure just hours into his first day on the job at a Homestead fruit farm. It was July 6, and the heat index hit 105 degrees that day, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe farm labor contractor that employed him, McNeill Labor Management, was found to have exposed workers to direct sunlight and failed to implement protections. Despite its role in López García’s death, the company is now fighting the $27,655 in proposed penalties OSHA imposed upon the business.\n\nGonzález says her employer, HHS Aviation, a cleaning company that contracts for Delta Airlines, has also ignored federal workplace safety standards.\n\nHHS Aviation does, in theory, provide water, González said. But not in practice.\n\nAfter multiple employees complained about a lack of water, which is against federal law, management purchased and placed a water cooler in the break room two months ago, she said. However, Gonzalez added, there is no water in it – and there has never been.\n\nThis leaves González and her coworkers thirsty, even dehydrated. She carries water to work, but doesn’t have a place to store it outside her locker. She can’t carry it with her while cleaning, or waiting for a plane to arrive – she can only drink when she is on break near her locker. She said she was unaware of any other water sources available to the employees.\n\nHHS Aviation disputed González's accounts of the heat and lack of water in her workplace, insisting that employees were allowed to refuse to board a plane and begin cleaning until it was fully cooled, and were trained to stop working when it was unsafe to do so. Additionally, in an email, the company said employees have had access to clean drinking water since operations began Sept. 19, 2023. Too, HHS said, break areas contained bottled water and hallways sported communal water fountains.\n\n\"HHS Aviation is committed to the health and safety of our team members, as they are our most valuable asset. We ensure all team members receive access to water, proper training, proper functioning tools and equipment, and designated rest periods,\" wrote marketing vice president Shannon Steck in an email. \"We comply with all Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations, Transportation Safety Administration programs and directives, and applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.\"\n\nAfter the USA TODAY Network-Florida called HHS Aviation and Delta Airlines about González's complaints, she said management finally filled the water cooler in the break room.\n\nDelta Airlines declined to comment.\n\nThough O'Brien says SEIU 32BJ has filed federal complaints against HHS Aviation on González and her coworkers' behalf, OSHA and other federal agencies can be slow to act. And González and her union point to HB 433 as an example of the state not having workers’ backs, either.\n\nWhile the federal government is working on adding a heat standard for workers, it won’t be in place for at least two years, if not more – and will likely be killed if Trump wins the November election, worker advocates and heat experts say.\n\nAlthough Florida has hamstrung its municipalities with this law, O'Brien said laborers still have other options to fight the heat and negotiate better working conditions for themselves: unionization.\n\n“Maybe we need to be bigger at the state level and hold employers accountable for mistreatment of workers,” O’Brien said. “People are going to organize and going to fight … with whatever channels they have.”\n\nClimate change, increasing heat lead to more emergency room visits, deaths\n\nDeSantis signed HB 433 less than a year after an “ocean heat wave” killed off entire coral reefs around Florida, such has never been seen before in recorded history. That tipped over into human exposure, too.\n\nThat same year, nearly 2,000 died from heat exhaustion across the U.S. In Florida, 215 people died between 2010 and 2020 from heat, University of Florida data shows.\n\nA 2023 report out of the National Conference of Citizenship found heat-related deaths in Florida shot up by 88% between 2019 and 2022.\n\nClimate change and a warming world is increasing the number of days of extreme heat humans are exposed to. According to NASA, the summer of 2023 was the hottest on record.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the Centers for Disease Control found in 2024 that emergency visits for heat-related illnesses surged in 2023, especially among men and adults aged 18 to 64: or, as University of Connecticut’s Korey Stringer Institute CEO Douglas Casa noted, the demographic most likely to work outdoors.\n\nCasa studies the effects of heat on the human body. His heat lab has been the recipient of more than a dozen Department of Defense grants in recent years, researching cooling strategies, and physiological and clinical implications of heat stress.\n\nHeat exposure-related illnesses and deaths are almost certainly undercounted, as discrete heat-exposure events and a lifetime of chronic dehydration can lead to shortened lifespans from kidney and heart disease, Casa said.\n\nThe effects of heat on outdoor workers may be even more serious than the current science shows, Casa said.\n\n\"Laborers are between ages 30 to 70, and they don’t have a two-hour practice or game; they’re doing 12-hour shifts and they are on medications and have other problems,\" Casa said. \"And we take care of them the least amount. Laborers have been kept out of the loop in the long term.\"\n\nDeSantis kills home rule on heat regulations with new law\n\nFlorida House Bill 433, which DeSantis signed into law in April, prohibits local governments from requiring shade or water breaks for outdoor workers, or even giving preference to employers based on their heat exposure requirements.\n\nBut only one county of 67 – Miami-Dade County – had such a requirement already in place. The county had recently passed an ordinance requiring employers to give outdoor workers 10-minute breaks in the shade for every two hours worked outside.\n\nMiami-Dade's \"heat officer,\" Jane Gilbert, is charged with designing mitigation strategies to help protect workers from the heat, some of which this law effectively killed.\n\nStill, Gilbert said in a statement, her staff members have not given up.\n\nShe cited her office's work expanding tree canopy, designating cooling sites during heat season, installing nearly 2,000 air conditioning units in public housing and providing heat safety trainings for personnel who work with homeless residents as examples of her continued dedication to combating heat.\n\n“We will continue to do everything within our power to ensure the people of Miami-Dade County are safe from extreme heat,\" Gilbert said.\n\nBut in the absence of the stick, there still exists the carrot.\n\nGovernments can put all sorts of incentives in place to protect workers, such as fast-tracking permits, reducing taxes or providing grants to companies that commit to protecting workers on the job, said Kathy Baughman McLeod, CEO and founder of gender and climate-focused organization Climate Resilience for All.\n\nBaughman McLeod has worked in climate resiliency for roughly 25 years, including at the Arsht-Rockefeller Resilience Center, Bank of America, The Nature Conservancy and, finally, at the Office of the State of Florida’s Chief Financial Officer. The latter she credits with shaping her career, as well as her understanding of government and conservation.\n\nBaughman McLeod added that local governments interested in improving their response to intensifying heat should also work to improve data around heat's effects on health and community, as it is poorly understood.\n\n\"Heat is killing more people than any other hazard,\" said Baughman McLeod. \"It's silent and invisible. This law ... is the total opposite direction of where we should be going.\"\n\nElsewhere, local government officials were discomfited by the passage of the law.\n\nIn conservative Collier County, two hours due west of Miami and subject to similar temperatures, Commissioner Bill McDaniel wondered at why the law got rid of home rule on a subject that just one county in Florida had passed restrictions on. It felt like an unnecessary overreach, he said, though he added he felt the government had no place between an employer and its employee.\n\n“I have to say two things: I don’t like state mandates on local government, ever,” McDaniel said. But, he added, “I believe the onus is on the employer and not the government to mandate things that good employers should be doing anyway.\"\n\n“Two, I know that 99% of employers that employ people that work outside already take care of those people. They cherish their employees.”\n\nIf they don’t, he said, they won’t have any left.\n\nGrower: Shade, electrolyte-infused water and regular breaks improve farmworker performance\n\nAs McDaniel suspected, at least some employers already offer shade and water breaks to their outdoor workers and they intend to continue the practice, such as Collier County's Immokalee-based Pacific Tomato Growers owner and Sunripe Certified Brands CEO Jon Esformes.\n\nFarm workers labor outdoors for hours at a time. The work they do, often under the hot sun, creates its own sort of heat. Their bodies then must work not only to keep up with the work they are performing, but must also work to cool themselves, as well.\n\nFarmworkers are also regularly paid piece rates instead of by the hour, incentivizing workers to work to the point of exhaustion or dehydration.\n\nBut not on Esformes’ farm.\n\nEsformes was the first grower to sign on to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers' Fair Food Program in the 1990s, which requires employers to provide heat breaks for their workers. He says providing shade and water breaks for workers is an important part of farming in Florida and has testified in Tallahassee to that effect.\n\n“Agriculture is a big dark secret in North America in terms of worker relationships,” Esformes said. “Heat stress for agricultural workers has long been a problem.”\n\nEsformes provides his workers with shaded places to sit, electrolyte-infused water, mandatory and voluntary breaks, and even sends workers home for the day when the “feels-like” temperature is too hot. He told the USA TODAY Network-Florida the Fair Food Program was an important part of moving into the future as a grower and honoring his employees’ rights as humans.\n\n“No worker should risk their life in dangerous heat without relief,” Coalition of Immokalee Workers representative and farmworker Gerardo Reyes Chaves said in a statement.\n\nOnce he began offering extra heat protections to his workers, Esformes said he realized this was also a great business decision. His workers’ productivity – and consequently his farming operation’s productivity – increased, and their physical and cognitive function remained higher as their bodies stayed cooler.\n\nEsformes questioned the rationale behind passing HB 433. Temperatures vary so widely across the state that it would behoove the state to allow local municipalities to pass their own requirements to avoid over-legislating across the state, Esformes said.\n\n“I don’t know that it would be wrong for one part of the state to have a different protocol than the other,” Esformes said. “But I do believe that when it comes to worker protections, few states do enough to address … heat illness for outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnited Farm Workers, a labor organization for farmworkers, has branches in California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Texas and Michigan. The organization has pushed for, and seen implemented, heat regulations in several of those states, including California and Oregon, though Texas has rolled back heat protections for workers in recent months.\n\nElizabeth Strater, the UFW director of strategic campaigns, said the heat protections in California and Oregon improved farmworkers' lives and health. After implementing heat rules in California, she said, data showed that despite increasingly intense heat waves, the rate of kidney disease in farm workers declined dramatically.\n\n“It isn’t just about getting up and not dying that day,\" Strater said. \"It’s about how the nature of that work shortens your life.”\n\nGonzález, who spends her working hours doing deep cleans of Delta’s planes on a South Florida tarmac, said she was livid about HB 433. She demanded that lawmakers think more about the people they represent before passing and signing these bills.\n\nGonzález paused and thought over her words for a moment.\n\n\"Estoy indignada,\" she said. I'm indignant. They should take better care of us. Have some respect for us.\n\n“Deberían tomarse más cura de nosotros, más cuidado. Y creo que el respeto, también. El respeto a la persona.\"\n\nContributed: Ana Goñi-Lessan, state watchdog reporter at the Tallahassee Democrat\n\nKate Cimini is the Florida Investigative Reporter for the USA TODAY-Network Florida, based at The News-Press and The Naples Daily News.

Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin. Which party will gain control of the upper chamber?\n\nBut there are other, less high profile but still important races on the Nov. 5 ballot. Voters will get to decide on ranked choice voting in multiple states and in Maine voters will decide whether to change their state flag for the first time in a century.\n\nHere is our guide to some of the most consequential — and interesting — races in all 50 states.\n\n— Melissa Brown and Duane W. Gang, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nLearn more about the races\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming |\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican Caroleene Dobson, Democrat Shomari Figures\n\nWhat's at stake: Alabama’s congressional map was redrawn in 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the proposed Alabama congressional district map was gerrymandered, discriminating against Black voters in the case of Allen v. Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/02/oklahoma-legislature-passes-unconstitutional-laws/7252789002/", "title": "Oklahoma's Legislature has a history of passing unconstitutional laws", "text": "Oklahoma laws on worker's compensation, trains stopped on the tracks, liquor distribution and medication abortions all have something in common.\n\nLocal state and federal courts have found these laws, crafted by Oklahoma's Legislature, are partially or wholly unconstitutional, although some of the rulings are still under appeal.\n\nThe Oklahoma Legislature has a history of passing bills that are later struck down by the courts as unconstitutional.\n\nPassing laws that are later overturned by the courts is not an issue specific to Oklahoma. Nor is the trend limited to the current Republican-led leadership at the state legislature.\n\nBut critics say the legislature sometimes knowingly advances unconstitutional legislation, which they argue is a waste of time and taxpayer money when Oklahoma's attorney general has to defend those laws in court.\n\nOne Capitol observer said the number of unconstitutional bills in the Oklahoma Legislature has grown in recent years, with more constitutionally questionable bills making it to the governor's desk.\n\n“We’ve always had some unconstitutional legislation, but in recent years, and in this session in particular, we’ve seen that grow in volume,” said Nicole McAfee, director of policy and advocacy for the ACLU of Oklahoma. “This year, we're seeing a lot of those sort of blatantly unconstitutional attacks on access to abortion care and attacks on protest rights advanced through the legislative process.”\n\nOthers are reading: Nearly 200 Oklahoma school districts suing state Education Board\n\nRepublican leaders of the Oklahoma House and Senate said their chambers never knowingly advance unconstitutional bills.\n\nConstitutionality is subjective, and the courts reviewing the legality of laws is part of the government’s process of checks and balances, said House Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka.\n\n“The Oklahoma House constantly discusses constitutionality in the legislative process and never knowingly advances anything unconstitutional,” McCall said in a statement. “Constitutionality subjectivity is why coequal legislative, executive and judicial branches have existed for checks and balances in Oklahoma and democracies everywhere since ancient Greece.”\n\nCost of unconstitutional legislation unknown\n\nAttorney General Mike Hunter's office does not track how much it costs for state attorneys to defend Oklahoma laws that wind up embroiled in court battles.\n\nBecause the lawyers defending state laws in court are on staff at the attorney general's office, their time spent on a case can't be tallied as easily as the billable hours of a private-sector attorney.\n\nThe Solicitor General's unit, which is made up of five lawyers, is typically tasked with defending state laws, said Alex Gerszewski, a spokesman for the office. Typically two or three lawyers work on a case defending the constitutionality of a state law.\n\nHunter's office does not keep records on how many state laws its attorneys have defended.\n\n\"I don’t think there’s any question that the legislature has passed unconstitutional legislation,\" said Senate Minority Leader Kay Floyd, a lawyer. Both Republicans and Democrats have done so, she said.\n\nFloyd, D-Oklahoma City, has repeatedly sought information on how much it costs the attorney general's office to defend unconstitutional legislation, only to be told that information doesn't exist.\n\nOklahoma laws struck down in courts\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has struck down at least six Oklahoma state laws, including in 1976, a law that allowed women age 18 or older to buy low-point beer while denying that privilege to men until they were 21, which the nation's high court found violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nBut lower courts have struck down more.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2016, Floyd, doing her own research, found local courts struck down as unconstitutional nearly 30 Oklahoma laws.\n\nCritical race theory: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt to decide on bill to ban teaching of theory\n\nCommon themes included laws to restrict abortions and violations of the state's single-subject rule that stipulates legislation may deal only with one main issue.\n\nOne of the most notable examples was when the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in 2015 a Ten Commandments monument at the state Capitol, which was placed there with approval from the legislature, violated the state's constitution that prohibits using public property to benefit a “church denomination or system of religion.”\n\nFloyd suggested concerns about the constitutionality of legislation should be addressed early on in the legislative process, either with input from the attorney general's office or from a constitutional lawyer.\n\n“It’s bad for the state,\" she said. \"It costs us money. It costs us reputation, and whatever we tried to accomplish with that bill, is not going to be accomplished.\"\n\nOklahoma anti-abortion bills raise questions\n\nThe Oklahoma Legislature this year has advanced a slate of anti-abortion bills that critics say are blatantly unconstitutional.\n\nRepresentatives from Planned Parenthood Great Plains and Trust Women say many of the anti-abortion bills that have advanced through the Legislature are specifically designed to limit access to abortions, which conflicts with U.S. Supreme Court rulings that legalized the practice.\n\n“Again, the Oklahoma Legislature is focused on radical and unconstitutional legislation that will only be thrown out of the courts,” said Julie Burkhart, founder and CEO of Trust Women. “I would rather they spend their time on restoring access to health care to Oklahomans than wasting time on restricting the ability of people to get safe and quality health care.”\n\nTrust Women operates an abortion clinic in Oklahoma City.\n\nOklahoma's GOP-led legislature has always pushed anti-abortion legislation, but some are optimistic that political shifts at the U.S. Supreme Court will prompt the court to re-evaluate its abortion precedents.\n\nAbortion in Oklahoma: Stitt signs bill to ban abortion if SCOTUS rules\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt recently signed bills to revoke the medical license of doctors who perform abortions that are not medically necessary to prevent \"irreversible physical impairment\" or death of the mother and limit which physicians can perform the procedure.\n\nStitt also signed a \"heartbeat\" bill that would prohibit an abortion if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which in some cases, can be detected as early as six weeks into a pregnancy — before many women know they are pregnant.\n\nAny doctor who performs an abortion after a heartbeat is detected could be charged with homicide under the new law.\n\nAsked about the possibility that Oklahoma faces legal challenges over these new laws, Stitt said, \"we'll let the courts work out if any of those get overturned.\"\n\nThe heartbeat bill is one of the many unlawful and unconstitutional bills introduced this year that attempts to end abortion in Oklahoma, said Gloria Pedro, of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.\n\nFormer Gov. Mary Fallin vetoed legislation in 2016 that contained similar restrictions for doctors performing abortions, saying she did not believe it could withstand a constitutional challenge, Pedro said.\n\nCiting the 10th Amendment, which talks about the government powers granted to the states, Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, who supported the \"heartbeat\" bill, suggested the U.S. Supreme Court overstepped its authority by legalizing abortion with its landmark Roe v. Wade decision.\n\n“I do not have the authority to overturn that decision,” she said. “I believe fully that it violates the 10th Amendment, so with the authority I have been given, I will work tirelessly to limit abortion in this state until the day comes that that wrongly decided decision is overturned and the authority for making these decisions about preserving life is returned to the states where it belongs.”\n\nRepublican legislators also introduced bills to further regulate medication abortions, in which women early on in their pregnancies can take a regimen of two pills to induce an abortion.\n\nStitt also signed a so-called \"trigger bill\" that would prohibit abortions in Oklahoma if the U.S. Supreme Court ever overturns Roe v. Wade or Planned Parenthood v. Casey that established the constitutional right for women to seek an abortion.\n\nThere is optimism among those who oppose abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court, with its Trump-appointed conservative majority, will overturn its previous precedents on abortion, said Sen. Nathan Dahm, R-Broken Arrow. Specifically, conservatives want the court to overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to further restrict abortions.\n\nDahm, who opposes abortion, cited the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision as an example of when the high court reviewed its precedent on abortion.\n\n\"It is rare that the courts will change their precedents, but it does happen, especially when there are things that have changed in society,\" Dahm said. \"Even in Roe v. Wade, (the justices) talked about how they would revisit it as technology advanced and as their understanding of life and conception advanced.\"\n\nConstitutional clash over federal overreach\n\nThe discussion over unconstitutional legislation at the Oklahoma Legislature recently came to a head when Senate Pro Tem Greg Treat alleged a top priority for the Oklahoma House was unconstitutional.\n\nTreat refused to hear in its original form a bill that sought to curb federal overreach and push back against the Biden administration by allowing Oklahoma’s attorney general or a majority vote of the legislature to declare presidential executive orders unconstitutional.\n\nTreat, R-Oklahoma City, called House Bill 1236 a clear violation of the separation of powers.\n\n\"Believe me, it would be much easier politically for me to let (HB) 1236 go to the governor’s desk as is, beg him to sign it and know that the courts are going to throw it out, but to give people false hope is not what I’m here for,\" Treat said.\n\nSaying the legislation seeks to assert Oklahoma’s 10th Amendment rights, McCall, the House Speaker and one of the bill's authors, has defended the legislation supported by most House Republicans.\n\nThe 10th Amendment says powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states. However, the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution states the federal constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land and generally take precedence over state laws.\n\n“Exercising constitutional rights is not unconstitutional,” McCall said in a statement. “The bill codifies in state law the 10th Amendment rights granted to states under the U.S. Constitution and creates a method of evaluating certain federal actions at the state level.”\n\nCourt rulings on the constitutionality of legislation can give state lawmakers guidance on what they can and cannot regulate.\n\nFor example, an Oklahoma City federal judge recently said a 2019 state law that prevented trains from blocking streets for longer than 10 minutes ran afoul of federal law. The ruling is under appeal.\n\n\"The bill itself was not ruled unconstitutional; the 10-minute requirement within it was,\" said McCall, who authored the legislation. \"In the ruling, the judge found and affirmed states have the right to regulate train crossings. Should the appeal not succeed, the ruling gives the Legislature guidance to modify the 10-minute requirement to be consistent with the ruling.\"\n\nDerailing unconstitutional legislation\n\nTreat said since he has been the leader of the Oklahoma Senate, he has not allowed blatantly unconstitutional legislation to advance.\n\nThere may be laws that don't stand up in court for nuanced reasons, but Treat said he's unwilling to pass legislation that lawmakers know will not hold up in court.\n\n\"If I believe that something is inherently, on its face, unconstitutional, I have not given it a hearing,\" Treat said. \"Or we have substantially changed it.\"\n\nEven before HB 1236 advanced to the Senate, some legislators cried foul.\n\nHouse Democrats argued the legislation is clearly unconstitutional because challenges to presidential executive orders and other federal actions are reviewed by the courts, not state legislatures.\n\nIt goes back to the fundamentals of government and the duties of the three branches of government, said Rep. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa.\n\n“HB 1236 is a fine example of an unconstitutional bill,” she said. “You didn’t see this last session when President Trump was in office. You didn’t see any of this concern then about the federal government and federal overreach.”\n\nGoodwin is among legislative Democrats that have tried to track how many pieces of Oklahoma legislation have been found to be unconstitutional.\n\nAccording to Goodwin, from 2010 to 2013, 14 laws were found to be unconstitutional — amounting to less than 1% of the bills that became law during that time period.\n\nGoodwin can also rattle off a list of more recent laws that have been overturned by the courts.\n\nShe pointed to legislation from 2019 that would have required the most popular wine and spirits brands be made available to all wholesale distributors, which ran counter to State Question 792 that allowed wine and spirits manufacturers to pick and choose their distributors.\n\nAlso overturned was State Question 755, which banned the use of Sharia law in state courts. The legislature referred the measure to the ballot where it passed with 70% approval.\n\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court also found a 2011 tort reform law that placed a legislative cap on damages for pain and suffering to be unconstitutional. Then-Gov. Fallin signed the measure into law despite concerns from some that the legislation was unconstitutional.\n\n\"It's a way to continue to stir the pot when they know it's unconstitutional,\" Goodwin said of the GOP majority in the legislature. \"They kind of pass these bills with a sneer and a smile.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/bicentennial/2024/03/04/tlh-200-the-200-people-who-shaped-tallahassee-ahead-of-bicentennial/72795474007/", "title": "TLH 200: The 200 people who shaped Tallahassee ahead of ...", "text": "James Call and Greg Tish\n\nTLH 200 writers\n\nThe TLH 200: Gerald Ensley Memorial Bicentennial Project is proud to present our rolling list of 200 people who laid the foundation and contributed to the growth of the civil society we find today in Tallahassee.\n\nAs the city commemorates the 200th anniversary of its founding, the Tallahassee Democrat and Real Talk 93.3 have cast a wide net to find artists, educators, civil rights leaders, politicians, athletes, builders, business titans and neighborhood icons who have earned a spotlight.\n\nBut we need your help.\n\nYou can email your suggestions of candidates to be profiled and other suggestions to history@tallahassee.com. And listen to Greg Tish’s morning show on Real Talk 93.3 where we'll discuss the legacy of these history makers.\n\nThe only condition is that those featured below must be deceased. Ten names will be added periodically, so be sure to check back for updates into 2025.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the first 100 names.\n\nJustice James Diament Westcott, Jr. (1839 - 1887)\n\nTallahassee born James Diament Westcott III, who preferred “Junior” rather than James the Third, had a knack for law and politics.\n\nBy the age of 28, Westcott served as the Assistant Secretary of the Florida Senate, the private secretary of Governor Madison S. Perry, and as a captain in the Confederate States Army.\n\nAfter the war he was elected as a Leon County representative to the Florida House.\n\nThe year he turned 30, he was elected attorney general. It was a remarkable feat because Westcott ran as a Democrat in the year a new Florida Constitution gave voting rights to freed slaves who registered as Republicans and the GOP won in landslides up and down the ballot.\n\nWithin a few weeks of the election Republican Gov. Harrison Reed appointed Westcott to the Florida Supreme Court, making him the youngest justice in Florida history.\n\nHe would serve for 17 years and would write 267 opinions – the most in Florida history.\n\nWestcott received his entire academic education at West Florida Seminary – which would become Florida State University, for which he was eternally grateful.\n\nUpon his death, he left his entire estate to West Florida Seminary. The principal would produce about $69,000 annually.\n\nThat was enough to provide a financial lifeline for the struggling institution – the stability needed for the school to evolve into a state-supported university. Today, a portion of the proceeds goes toward financial assistance for low-income students.\n\nWestcott died in 1887 and is buried in Tallahassee’s Old City Cemetery. In 1936, Florida State University named its administration building in his honor.\n\nGilbert Chandler (1889 - 1978)\n\nIn 1925, a Minnesota asparagus farmer was disappointed when he stopped for a night in Tallahassee – he found no place to stay, not even space to pitch a tent.\n\nThe disappointment would lead Gilbert Chandler to build a Tallahassee landmark, The Cottages of Lake Ella.\n\nChandler had $2,000 in his pocket when he ventured out of the land of lakes to seek his fortune as a “Tin Can Tourist,” the nickname for motorists touring the countryside at the dawn of the auto age.\n\nIn California, he stayed at an “auto camp,” cottages furnished with a bench, table and electric light.\n\nChandler told Susan Poplin for a Florida State University history thesis that the two-room cabins cost $750 to build and produced a 400% annual profit.\n\nChandler considered himself a Horatio Alger up-from-the-bootstrap character and after a quick look around a tiny state capital city that would soon be located at the intersection of two proposed U.S. highways (27 & 90), he decided to stay and pioneer auto camping in Florida.\n\nFirst, he paid $400 for some lots along the railroad tracks on Gaines Street. He built 10 cabins and a communal washroom and charged $1 a night to stay.\n\nTwo years later, he bought five acres north of town and built the Tallahassee Tourist Camp along a dirt road at Lake Ella. Once the road was paved and became U.S. 27, he expanded his camp with the Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of the highway and the Lake Ella Motor Court on the east side.\n\nThe motor court consisted of 15 cottages. They were converted into apartments during a World War II housing shortage and rented for $30 a month.\n\nChandler used the money to upgrade the cottages with carpets, steam heat and the latest innovations. At war’s end and a tourism boom underway, Chandler promoted the Lake Ella Motor Court with hand-made billboards across the southeast.\n\nHe posted 4-by-8 feet red and yellow silkscreen painted signs advertising a motor court on the shore of Tallahassee's “beautiful Lake Ella,” every 10 miles on roads leading into and out of Birmingham, Atlanta, Daytona Beach, Tampa and the panhandle.\n\nOne night while out posting signs, “Dad called home to ask about business and Mom said they were full. People told her they’d been following the signs for hundreds of miles just to stop for the night,” Gilbert Chandler Jr., told the Tallahassee Democrat’s Andy Lindstrom in 1995 for a history of the Lake Ella cottages.\n\nAfter Gilbert Chandler passed, his heirs retired from the hospitality business. What had grown into the 92-room Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of Monroe was torn down in the 1990s to make room for a Golden Corral restaurant.\n\nAcross the street, 11 of the original 15 cottages still stand, converted into specialty shops for the bustling Midtown neighborhood.\n\nTheir once white trim now is blue and grey, the multi-colored shingles replaced with brown ones, but they still sport marble facades. It is said, when a ton of marble was accidentally delivered to Tallahassee, Chandler bought it for a bargain to spruce up his cottages.\n\nChandler was a World War I veteran, Free Mason, and a Shriner who built an iconic Tallahassee destination after a disappointing first night in town.\n\nAquilina Howell (1917 - 2000)\n\nAquilina Howell was born on West Georgia Street and would go on to spend 42 years working in Leon County schools as a teacher and administrator.\n\nWhat's in a name? The historic figures and educators behind Leon County school names\n\nHowell was the first woman to serve as an Assistant Superintendent in Leon County and is credited as the driving force behind the peaceful desegregation of Tallahassee's public schools\n\n“Aquilina had unbelievable processing skills,\" said former school superintendent Charles Couch who appointed her assistant superintendent. “She could take angry people, get them to look at the issues calmly, and solve the problem in win-win fashion for everyone.”\n\nCouch, and others, recall how Howell led Leon schools during desegregation without the discord and violence that plagued other communities.\n\n“She could always make you calm down and see the other person’s point and make you think you did all the solving,” her sister Lucille Alexander told Gerald Ensley at Howell’s passing. “I used to say to her, ‘All right, Mr. Ralph Bunche.’” (Bunche was the first Black to win the Nobel Peace Prize.)\n\nHowell was married for 51 years to Tallahassee insurance agent Sam Howell, who passed in 1994. Howell died in 2000.\n\nThe Taylor House, where she was born, is now a museum celebrating Frenchtown and the Tallahassee Civil Rights movement.\n\nIn recognition of the path, she set a path for educators, civil activists, and community leaders, supporters created the Aquilina C. Howell Education Scholarship at Florida A&M University for first- and second-year students who graduated from a Leon County high school.\n\nAnd Howell’s name can still be spotted around town; including the Leon County schools administrative building on West Pensacola Street, and the Carter-Howell-Strong Park in Frenchtown.\n\nCarrie Meek (1926 - 2021)\n\nCarrie Meek, the grandchild of a slave and a sharecropper’s daughter as a child, was not allowed to enter the Florida State Capitol because she was Black.\n\nAs a 12-year-old Girl Scout, Meek was blocked at the front door when white members of her Girl Scout Troop delivered home-made brownies to Florida lawmakers. As a Lincoln High School and Florida A&M University graduate, she would be the first Black woman to represent Florida in the U.S. Congress since Reconstruction.\n\nWillie and Carrie Pittman’s daughter broke many racial, gender, and educational barriers.\n\nIn a 1992 interview with the Washington Post, she recalled in Jim Crow Tallahassee there weren’t any decent recreational facilities for Black people, and because she was Black, she couldn’t try on shoes in stores or pursue a master’s degree in her hometown.\n\nMeek earned a Master of Science at the University of Michigan after being awarded a B.S. in biology at FAMU in 1948, and after a career as a South Florida educator she would win a 1979 special election to represent Miami in the Florida House.\n\nIn 1982, she became the first Black woman elected to the Florida Senate.\n\nAs a politician, Meek was an unapologetic Democrat firebrand with an agenda rooted in the inequities she lived and witnessed.\n\nShe is remembered as an advocate for minorities, immigrants, and the working poor. And as someone who routinely intensified the debate.\n\nIn Tallahassee when Meek wanted to kill a bill, she would stand on the floor and wave a black flag of death adorned with a skull and crossbones.\n\nIn 1994, Meek provoked a massive argument with new Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. She chided Gingrich for negotiating a multi-million-dollar book deal with a publishing company that had a stake in telecommunications legislation.\n\nMeek said Gingrich stood “to make a whole lot of dust” from the deal.\n\nRepublicans struck Meek’s comments from the Congressional Record. The argument that followed dominated the coverage of the New York Times, Washington Post, and the television news networks.\n\n“The only thing missing up here is my black flag,” Meek told the Miami Herald at the time.\n\nCarrie Meek never lost an election. She retired from politics in 2002.\n\nThe Carrie Meek – James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum in Tallahassee, Florida, on the campus of Florida A&M University, is co-named in Meek's honor.\n\nHenry Livingston Rutgers (1810 - 1861)\n\nIn 1836, Henry Livingston Rutgers, direct kin of the namesake of Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey, married Jane Barnwall and the two moved to Tallahassee.\n\nFlorida Territorial Gov. William P. Duval had appointed Henry the Territorial Administrator and Treasurer.\n\nRutgers would go on to serve the territory and city for more than two decades. And although he was an early and apparently prominent settler, little is written about him.\n\nIn 1845, Rutgers cast a vote as an elector for the first Florida State Governor, William Dunn Moseley.\n\nRutgers also served two terms on the Tallahassee City Council and Circuit Court Judge Jesse J. Finely appointed him as an investigator in the renowned Croom-Smith Case of 1857 – which decided ownership of Goodwood Plantation’s 200 enslaved workers.\n\nIn 1856, the Floridian and Journal newspaper, according to the Tallahassee Heritage Foundation, reported the opening of a new state bank on Monroe Street, to which the paper added, \"We are indebted to Mr. H. L. Rutgers.\"\n\nThe Foundation suggests that druggist B. C. Lewis, who opened his own bank that year had bought the building from Rutgers.\n\nRutgers hired freedman George Proctor to build him two homes in Tallahassee – the Randall-Lewis House at 424 North Calhoun St., and the Rutgers House across Calhoun and now the Tallahassee Garden Center.\n\nIt was in a cabin on Rutgers’ Calhoun St property where Antonio Proctor, the scout and interpreter for the Simmons/Williams expedition that selected the site for Florida’s capital city, would pass in 1855.\n\nFredrich R. Cotten (1819 - 1878)\n\nFredrich R. Cotten had big plans for Florida when he came to Tallahassee in 1845. He got himself elected to the first Florida House of Representatives and then he developed a vast section of land that is today upper-middle class neighborhoods in north, northwest Tallahassee into the second largest cotton plantation in Leon County.\n\nSixty years later his grandson, Fred Cotten Elliot, would have even bigger land use plans.\n\nHe would try to drain the Everglades.\n\nBy 1850, Virginian Fredrich R. Cotten had transformed a wide swath of what is now north Tallahassee and west Leon County into a $12 million – in today's money – cotton growing operation.\n\nThat land today is a collection of upper middle class subdivisions, a country club, and Lake Jackson boat landings.\n\nCotten’s Burgesstown Plantation took in more than 8,000 acres from the Ochlocknee River and Lake Iamonia south to the Luna Pines neighborhood, east through Phipps-Overstreet Park and the eastern shore of Lake Jackson to Miller's Landing, then north to Golden Eagle Plantation, and Killearn Lakes Plantation.\n\nAccounting records indicate that shipments of cotton went regularly from Burgesstown via St. Marks to New York with proceeds credited to Cotten.\n\nThe Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows Cotten was the single largest slaveholder in the county, with 275 enslaved workers.\n\nWhen Cotten passed in 1878, he was buried at Saint John's Episcopal Church Cemetery.\n\nCotten's heirs would sell Burgesstown to Lloyd Griscom of Philadelphia who in 1901 converted the land into a quail hunting plantation. Griscom’s son, Lloyd Carpenter Griscom, would purchase the Tallahassee Democrat in 1929 and the family would own the paper until 1965.\n\nCotten's grandson Fred Cotten Elliot became the state's chief civil engineer at the Internal Improvement Fund, now the Department of Environmental Protection. In 1913, Elliot developed a plan and directed an effort to drain the Everglades to create farmland.\n\nElliot joined a team of eight that hack through sawgrass to clear a path for barges, and he designed the first giant swamp buggies that allowed construction crews and farm workers to operate in the marshes of the Everglades.\n\nWhen he got back home after his Everglades adventure, Elliot laid out the first few holes of the Capital City Country Club golf course.\n\nThe state-owned Elliot Building, on the SE corner of Pensacola and Monroe, across from the Capitol was named for him. It is scheduled to be demolished and the site will become a Memorial Park, whose purpose is to honor Florida history and commemorate victims of slavery and the Holocaust.\n\nJayleen Woods (1934 - 2006)\n\nIn 1972, Jayleen Woods was included in a Tallahassee Democrat story about women who had “invaded” “men only” professions like public relations managers, commonly referred to as \"spokesmen\" by the media.\n\nWoods was a wordsmith. She was a writer and editor for the Florida Flambeau, Tallahassee Democrat and Tampa Tribune. Woods also worked 17 years as the Director of Information Services at Florida State University, where she served as the university’s spokesperson, and later as the editor of the Florida Hotel and Motel Association magazine for 30 years.\n\nWoods said she had “printer’s ink in her veins.”\n\nShe got a big infusion of it after a poem she wrote as a 12-year-old, about a volunteer group called The Red Feathers, appeared on the front page of her hometown newspaper in Bristol, CT.\n\nFive years later, she accepted a writing scholarship to Florida State University, where she would become a member of the Flying High Circus and edit the student newspaper the Florida Flambeau.\n\nAfter graduating from FSU, Woods took a job with the Tampa Tribune and then met Tom Woods of Tallahassee. That would lead to a move back to the Capital City and Woods breaking glass ceilings as she moved into management positions that previously were a male domain.\n\nTom and Jayleen were married for 48 years and had two daughters. He preceded her in death.\n\nIn retirement, Jayleen created fund-raising brochures for the Girl Scout Council and its Apalachee Camp for All Seasons. She also remained active with the League of Women Voters, Springtime Tallahassee, the Women’s Club of Tallahassee, and the Seminole Boosters.\n\nThomas DeSaille Tucker (1844 - 1903)\n\nA native of British Sierra Leon, Thomas DeSaille Tucker was a lawyer and missionary who became the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students, which became Florida A&M University.\n\nHe was a graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio and taught at schools for emancipated slaves in Kentucky and Louisiana, before opening a law office in Pensacola.\n\nTucker devoted his life to combatting slavery, according to a Oberlin College biography.\n\n\"The colored men in this country have no voice in the general government; even in some of the States they have no voice in the State government,\" he wrote to a friend in Africa. \"It would fairly sicken you to be here on a fourth of July and hear guns firing and 'starspangled banner' waving 'over the land of the free and the home of the brave' while there are this day 4,000,000 of slaves in their possession. O what a hypocrisy. God will not always sleep but will yet come in judgment against this country except they speedily repent.\"\n\nIn 1887, Tucker accepted appointment as the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students in DeFuniak Springs. With an infusion of federal money, Tucker moved the school to Tallahassee onto property once owned by Gov. Willliam Duval.\n\nWhen the State Board of Education selected Tucker to be the school’s first president, the editor of a local newspaper wrote:\n\n“We have known Professor Tucker for about 18 years and we have never met a more genial, broadminded and sterling gentleman. He possesses first-class qualities as a friend, gentleman and scholar, and commands the respect of all who know him. He is a strong man, morally and intellectually, and the new Normal has a security of success under his charge.”\n\nTucker served as president until an argument with William N. Sheats over the school’s direction. Sheats wanted Tucker to focus on agricultural and industrial education, Tucker insisted on a liberal arts education.\n\nSheats was appointed Superintendent in 1895 and slowly reduced Tucker’s authority and reduced the school’s budget and questioned spending until Tucker was finally ousted in 1901.\n\nTucker moved to Jacksonville where he practiced law until his death in 1903.\n\nThe Sims; Robert (1924 - 1966), Helen (1932 - 1966), Joy (1954 - 1966)\n\nThree members of the Sims family are the victims in a story that local lore holds as the moment Tallahassee lost its innocence.\n\nOctober 22, 1966, was a football Saturday and that night 30,000 people, more than half of the city’s population, attended the Mississippi State University vs. Florida State University football game at Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\nRobert Sims, the director of data processing for the Department of Education, Helen Sims, a former secretary for First Baptist Church, and their 12-year-old daughter Joy did not.\n\nVicious killers invaded their home in a quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood and the three were found bound, gagged and shot shortly before 11 p.m.\n\nRobert and Joy passed at the scene. Helen was rushed to the hospital and never regained consciousness to provide any clues to the killers. She died nine days later.\n\nSixteen-year-old ambulance attendant Rocky Bevis was among the first responders to the crime scene. He cut the bonds on all three victims at their ankles and wrists.\n\n\"We just woke up one morning in Tallahassee and we were part of an evil world,” he recalled to the Miami Herald for a story marking the 50th anniversary of the crime.\n\nBefore that October night, Tallahassee was a place where people did not lock their doors.\n\nBut as word of the murders spread, homes started to be kept locked at all hours, doors not opened to strangers, shades were drawn at dusk. And when no arrests were made, people bought watchdogs, hardware stores ran out of locks and safety door chains, and there was a rush at gun shops.\n\nFear spread through the city to the extent that Trick or Treat was cancelled that Halloween.\n\nA Tallahassee Democrat editorial stated, “This is no night to send young children in masks and costumes into the street.”\n\nA $16,000 reward was never collected. The murder weapons were never found. A motive never established.\n\nSheriff deputies had two suspects in their sights, and nearly 1,000 fingerprints collected at the scene but never secured enough evidence to bring any charges.\n\nThe late Leon County Sheriff Larry Campbell investigated the murders as a deputy and continued to probe the case through a 53-year law enforcement career.\n\n“I’ve done everything I think I can do,” he told the Miami Herald in 2006. “The big frustration is that I feel very confident that I know who did it.”\n\nThe case remains unsolved. Campbell passed in 2014.\n\nEd Ball (1888 - 1981)\n\nFrom the dark days of the depression and until his death in 1981, Ed Ball was one of the most powerful and feared men in Florida.\n\nBall owned a 7,500-acre farm outside of Tallahassee that today is the Southwood subdivision.\n\nThe brother-in-law of Alfred I. du Pont, Ed Ball managed du Pont’s finances and once Alfred died grew a $56-million du Pont trust into a $2-billion Florida empire, according to the Wall Street firm A.G. Becker.\n\nA du Pont grandson filed suit against Ball for spending too much money to make more money instead of on the charitable organizations the elder du Pont included as the trust’s beneficiaries.\n\nAmong the trust’s holdings were more than 1 million acres of north Florida timberland, the St. Joe Paper Company, Florida East Coast Railway, Apalachicola Northern Railroad Co., Florida National Bank, Talisman Sugar Corp, Florida Sugar Refinery Inc., and St. Joseph Telephone and Telegraph.\n\nThe news wire service UPI remembered Ball as a quick-witted man with “the courtly manners of a Southern gentleman” who loved a good scrap.\n\nHe was the father of the state sales tax, lobbying 20 years for it as a substitute for property taxes.\n\nA political kingmaker, Ball supported financially the so-called “Porkchop Gang,” a group of rural legislators who couldn’t have been elected without him. In the 1960s the group opposed legislative reapportionment because as Ball explained it would mean “the two organized minorities, the NAACP, and the (labor) unions will control the state.”\n\nWhen Florida East Coast Railway workers went on strike in 1963, Ball defied the Justice Department and a presidential emergency board and refused to budge on the wage issue which triggered the strike.\n\nThe strike continued until 1976.\n\nBall founded the St. Joe Paper Company in 1936. The company’s extensive use of water (35 million gallons daily) and clear-cutting of forests (98% of the region’s longleaf pine) led the U.S. Department of Interior in the 1970s to designate parts of North Florida a “Critically Endangered Ecosystem.”\n\nBall purchased 4,000 acres surrounding Wakulla Springs in 1937 and constructed the 27-room Wakulla Springs Lodge as a guest house. He used dynamite to open a channel to the Wakulla River so guests could arrive by boat. And he fenced off the water passage to keep out the “riff raff.”\n\nThe state acquired the land in 1986 and created Ed Ball Wakulla Springs State Park.\n\nRuth Chapman (1918 - 1983)\n\nWhen Ruth Chapman passed away it was big news; “Tallahassee activist Chapman dies at 65.”\n\nChapman studied at Northwestern University School of Journalism and worked at newspapers in Illinois and Florida before arriving in Tallahassee in 1946.\n\n“Ruth was sort of a crusader for the improvement of Tallahassee,” said former AP writer Hendrix Chandler upon Chapman’s death.\n\nRuth and Harold Chapman moved here after the war, Harold had been stationed in Pensacola and Ruth reported for the Pensacola News Journal.\n\nIn Tallahassee, Ruth was the Women’s Editor for the Tallahassee Democrat for seven years and then editor of the Department of Education Florida School Magazine for 14 years.\n\nAway from journalism, Chapman was a member of at least 12 civic groups, including being a charter member of boards for the Tallahassee Junior Museum, Leon County Public Library, and Tallahassee Junior College, along with being president of the League of Women Voters and serving two terms on the Tallahassee-Leon County planning commission.\n\nRuth was respected as a literary craftswoman. Laurence R. Campbell, who was a 1936 Northwestern classmate, wrote at the time of her passing that Chapman was, “an architect of perceptive and penetrating prose.”\n\nChapman wrote lengthy policy letters to former Gov. LeRoy Collins. Collins said he never threw away any of them.\n\n“The one thing I attach more to Ruth than anything else is her beautiful, beautiful letter writing . . . She was a professional person, and she knew English and could express herself very well,” said Collins in 1981.\n\nEventually Collins had Chapman review his speeches and letters. He said since she was so intent on telling him what she thought, he thought he would let her know what he was thinking.\n\n“She was an excellent neighbor,” Collins said.\n\nJack Crow (1939 - 2004)\n\nJack Crow completed the longest of long shots.\n\nIn a scientific competition with the renowned private Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its $23.5 billion endowment, a little-known physicist from a state school (endowment $947 million) won the world’s most powerful magnet and brought it home to Tallahassee.\n\nIt was 1990 and MIT had run the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory for three decades. But Crow and others developed a plan that included a consortium of Florida State University, the University of Florida and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to move the lab to FSU.\n\nThe Maglab, as its called, uses up to 30 megawatts of power – roughly the amount needed to power a community of 50,000 – to create high-level magnetic fields for experiments that further the understanding of matter and living structures.\n\nSmaller labs are in Moscow; Amsterdam; Grenoble, France, and cities in Poland and Japan.\n\nAt Crow's passing, former FSU president T.K. Wetherell recalled being lobbied for millions of dollars by Crow to move the lab to Tallahassee.\n\n“He had the ability to talk molecules and the ability to talk dollars in a way that made sense to an old politician,” said Wetherell.\n\nThe lab draws thousands of scientists to Tallahassee annually to conduct experiments that help develop new technologies and materials.\n\n\"The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory truly is the house that Jack built, \" said Greg Boebinger, who replaced Crow as head of the lab director in 2002.\n\nWhile the public knew Crow as a stellar scientist, a visionary, and a persistent lobbyist, family and friends knew a man with a soft touch.\n\nThey said Crow would return from international trips with fewer clothes than when he left – having given away shirts to struggling scientists elsewhere.\n\nHis sons recalled a dad who regularly ate peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches with them, liked to fish and build sandcastles with his grandchildren, and enjoyed a good story about someone beating the odds.\n\n“He needed a towel to cry in while watching the movie ‘Rudy,’” his son Garth Crow said at his passing.\n\nJoan Heggen (1930 - 2016)\n\nJoan Heggen was a game changer with a quick wit. In 1972 she became the first woman elected to the city commission.\n\nHeggen had taught speech at Utah State University before she moved to Tallahassee when her husband accepted a position at Florida State University in 1969.\n\nShe ran a grass-roots campaign out of an abandoned gas station with volunteers going house-to-house explaining why Tallahassee had to do things differently – at the time the commission was made up of businessmen who often conducted city business from their private offices.\n\nHeggen beat Lee Everhart, who had just finished a term as mayor, 59% to 41%.\n\nIn office, the Eau Claire, Wisc., native did things differently.\n\nHeggen became the first commissioner to have an office at City Hall and her presence forced immediate changes.\n\nAt the time women were not allowed to wear pants or boots to work. But Heggen routinely wore pants suits and boots. And the city clerk was unable to dictate a commissioner's dress, so the prohibition fell for all employees.\n\nAs mayor in 1974, Heggen formed a “kitchen cabinet” of citizens to advise her, initiated the city's first applications for federal grants, and Tallahassee became nationally active in the League of Cities.\n\nHeggen would join with commissioners Russell Bevis and Johnnie Jones to replace longtime city manager Arvah Hopkins with the professionally trained Dan Kleman.\n\nTwenty years later, Bevis would tell Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley, “I don’t know if I ever saw a person better prepared for meetings.”\n\nHeggen read, studied, and asked questions. She credited her dogged determination to the parochial school she attended growing up in Wisconsin.\n\n\"I was taught by Benedictine nuns, so I have G.U.I.L.T. tattooed across my boobs,\" Heggen told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nHeggen did not run for reelection in 1975. She became deputy director and then secretary of the Department of Community Affairs and then the Broward County's Director of Health and Public Safety.\n\nShe returned to Tallahassee in 1987 and joined Leon County as the assistant administrator.\n\nJoan Heggen retired in 1994. Upon her retirement the Leon County Commission issued a proclamation naming Joan Heggin “mother emeritus” of the Leon County Courthouse.\n\nWally \"Famous\" Amos (1936 - 2024)\n\nTallahassee’s most famous maker of chocolate chip cookies was born on Lafayette Street in the raised Smokey Hollow neighborhood where the Department of Transportation building and Cascades Park is today.\n\nWhen he was 12 his parents divorced, and Amos was sent to live with an aunt in New York City. She loved to bake, and aunt and nephew bonded while baking her specialty; the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nAfter a stint in the Air Force, Amos took a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency and began to work his way up.\n\nHe became William Morris’ first African-American talent agent. He would get his foot in the door of potential clients with his home-made chocolate chip cookies.\n\nIt was an effective ploy. Amos’ clients would include Simon & Garfunkel, Marvin Gaye, Helen Reddy.\n\nGaye and Reddy thought so highly of the cookies that they urged Amos to open a store and lent him the money in 1975 to start baking out of a Sunset Blvd storefront in Los Angeles.\n\nIn its first year, Famous Amos Cookies generated $300,000 in revenue. Within six years, there were dozens of Famous Amos stores across the country, boxes of cookies on supermarket shelves and annual revenue of more than $12 million.\n\nWhile the cookies were delicious, the New York Times would report at the time of his passing, the big draw also was Mr. Amos himself.\n\n“An energetic, ever-smiling pitchman, known for his Panama hat and colorful Indian gauze shirts, he loved the hustle of building a brand, going on the road to promote it for weeks at a time. (Today both his hat and one of his shirts are held by the Smithsonian Institution.)”\n\nAmos was relentlessly optimistic and made regular appearances on sitcoms and entertainment shows such as Famous Amos.\n\nAs his fame grew, he made peace with his Tallahassee roots. His childhood memories were of a broken home in a segregated city, but when he returned as Famous Amos, he embraced the city of his birth.\n\n\"For years, I didn't have fond memories of Tallahassee - I grew up during segregation. But when I came back in 1981 to visit, and went back to my old neighborhood, I realized that a big part of who I was came from here. That community. Now I'm proud to be from Tallahassee,\" Amos told the Tallahassee Democrat in 1994.\n\nA fervent advocate for childhood literacy, Amos publicly visited the city to promote reading and other initiatives in 2006, 1995 and 1994.\n\nFinancial troubles forced Wally to sell Famous Amos cookies in 1988, at the time, he didn’t realize he had also sold his name.\n\nStripped of the company he started from scratch and forbidden to use the Famous Amos handle; he moved to Hawaii and became Uncle Noname, the baker of Gourmet Muffins.\n\nAmos also wrote an autobiography, “Man with No Name: Turns Lemons into Lemonade,” detailing how he lost the Famous Amos nickname.\n\nSheriff Phillip Decourcey (1846 - 1875)\n\nPhillip Decourcey, sometimes spelled DeCoursey, was born a slave on a plantation in Jefferson County. After the Civil War, he moved to Tallahassee, where he found work as a blacksmith, teacher and preacher.\n\nHe apparently was well liked, winning election to be the city’s tax assessor in 1873. Two years later DeCourcey was appointed Leon County Sheriff.\n\nAs the county’s leading law man, De Courscey earned praise from white and Black people, but he served only nine months.\n\nHe died in office with his death attributed to pneumonia.\n\nThe Tallahassee Sentinel newspaper wrote: “He was known as one of the most intelligent colored men in this county and during the last term of the circuit court he exhibited convincing evidence of his ability to perform the duties of the sheriff’s office in the most acceptable manner.”\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam ( * - 1967)\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam managed to keep her age out of numerous newspapers stories in which she appeared during her three decades in Tallahassee. Despite the best of our abilities, her streak remains intact.\n\nThe Camden, N. J., native arrived in the city 1941 and 21 years later was the Junior Woman’s Club nominee for Tallahassee Woman of the Year.\n\nGilliam is remembered as a humanitarian, for the work she provided to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital Auxiliary and as a friend for those afflicted with chronic illness.\n\nGilliam organized and trained the city's first class of Candy Stripers, teen age hospital volunteers.\n\nDuring World War II, she was president of the local Chaperone Club, which organized dance nights and raised funds for social clubs for soldiers training at Dale Mabry field.\n\nGilliam was the only lay member of the district board of directors of the American Cancer Society.\n\nShe served as director of volunteers for the Easter Seal Society and ran fundraising campaigns. And she was the region's director of sales for the Christmas Seal campaign to raise money for charitable groups.\n\nAnd, Gilliam organized and was the director of the Tallahassee chapter of Beta Sigma Phil, the international sorority of working woman.\n\nFather James Page (1808 - 1883)\n\nJames Page was born into slavery in Richmond, V.A., brought to a Tallahassee plantation and grew up to become Florida's First African-American Itinerant preacher and the founder of one of Tallahassee’s most influential churches.\n\nPage was raised on the Bel Air plantation, south of town. There he met Elizabeth, a fellow slave. They married and Bel Air would be their permanent home.\n\nPlantation owner John Parkhill owned Bel Air, Page and Elizabeth. Page became Parkhill's chief assistant.\n\nParkhill was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, who provided religious instruction to Page. At the time, the Presbyterian Church did not admit Black congregants. Nonetheless, Page would plant the seeds that would become the missionary Baptist church in Florida.\n\nIn 1850, he started a ministry at Bel Air and led the enslaved community to organize the first known Baptist African-descendent congregation in Florida, and the origin of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nParkhill supported Page’s missionary. He donated land on Belaire Road for the church, raised funds among other slaveowners to build the church. He also provided Page the freedom and documents to travel throughout middle Florida to preach the gospel.\n\nWhen he died in 1859, Page was designated business manager and confidant for Parkhill’s widow.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Page became one of the most influential and respected religious leaders of the day.\n\nHe advocated for Black self-determination and independence through ownership of land and political participation. Page traveled throughout the South, converting hundreds of thousands to the Baptist faith.\n\nIn 1868, he built a school at Bel Air called the Page School Society, which was one of the first schools for African-Americans in Florida.\n\nIn 1879, Page helped African-American Bethlehem Baptist Association #1 establish a African-American Baptist school in Live Oak that was the forerunner of the present Florida Memorial College located in Miami.\n\nPage remained an active preacher into the final week of his life. The Weekly Floridian reported that he died “quietly and peacefully” at his home.\n\nPage is buried in Tallahassee’ Old City Cemetery, across Call Street from the church he founded as a ministry to enslaved workers.\n\nIn 2024, a historical marker honoring Father James Page was erected in front of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. (1884 - 1970)\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. was one of the most influential city fathers at the turn of the 20th century and for some reason a park dedicated to his memory features a giant bronze sculpture of a Komodo dragon.\n\nHe wrote the city charter approved by the Florida Legislature in 1919. He also was the last mayor of the old system (1919), first mayor of the new system (1920-1922), city attorney from 1927 to 1936, and clerk of the Florida Supreme Court from 1938 to 1964.\n\nTallahassee saluted McCord in 1970 and named a park with canopy trails in his honor. It's at the southeast corner of the intersection of Thomasville and Armistead Roads.\n\nWhen a shopping center and gas station was proposed for the six-acre site in 1965, McCord led the opposition and spoke at a hotly contested zoning meeting.\n\n“You ought to put an end to this. This property ought to be bought for a city park,” he told the commission he once led.\n\n“There should not be further business along Thomasville Highway with more filling stations and sandwich stands. We are spending millions to make the Capitol Center beautiful but spending nothing for parks,” said McCord.\n\nThe Guyte P. McCord Park, features green spaces, a flowerly walking path, and a canopied walking path encircling a pond that attracts various bird species. Throughout the park are seven bronze sculptures of children and dogs at play and a giant Komodo dragon by Sandy Proctor. It is unclear why Proctor included the dragon in the McCord collection, but it is regarded today as one of the park's treasures.\n\nFrederick S. Humphries (1935 - 2021)\n\nFred Humphries was born in Apalachicola on Dec. 26, 1935, grew up in the segregated South and was inspired by a high school math teacher “to do better.”\n\nHumphries became a champion of education, especially for disadvantaged young people.\n\nHe graduated with honors from FAMU in 1957, with a degree in chemistry, then earned his master’s and doctorate degrees in physical chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. He was Pitt’s first African-American Ph.D. in chemistry. Humphries taught at Minnesota but returned to FAMU as a chemistry professor in 1968. He left to become president of Tennessee State University in 1974, overseeing that HBCU’s merger with the predominantly white UT-Nashville campus — the nation’s first successful merger of two such institutions, with TSU maintaining its administrative autonomy. Humphries became FAMU’s eighth president in 1985 and set the university on a path of unprecedented growth and national acclaim.\n\nThe Humphries’ years, 1985-2001, saw FAMU enrollment and national standing boosted by Humphries' unorthodox recruitment of scholars and donors and pursuit of academic grants.\n\nHumphries would approach young people on the streets of Europe and Africa touting the FAMU brand.\n\nHumphries was a Rattler from the moment he saw the Marching 100 perform at halftime of a game he saw as a high school student on a field trip.\n\nA student chemistry professor Fred Humphries recruited would later be a FAMU president. Larry Robinson (2017 –2024) eulogized Humphries as “a visionary, whose brilliance was on constant display.”\n\nThe number of National Achievement Scholars President Humphries enticed to enroll at FAMU recruited led the nation, outpacing Harvard, Yale, and Stanford in 1992, 95, 97 and tying Harvard in 2000.\n\nThe school’s enrollment increased from 5,100 when Humphries was hired to nearly 12,000 by the time he retired and included 657 National Achievement Scholars.\n\nThe amount of annual grant money the school secured increased during his tenure from $8 million to $62 million.\n\nAnd in 2000, with Humphries as president, the Florida Board of Regents restored the FAMU law school, closed in 1968, with a campus in Orlando.\n\nRuby Diamond (1886 - 1982) and Smiley Bruce (1919 - 2002)\n\nRuby Diamond was one of 13 members of the Florida State College’s 1905 graduating class and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry.\n\nMiss Ruby, as she preferred to be called, once deadpanned that she \"wasn't taught to do a blessed thing on earth but smile.”\n\nHowever, Diamond had a reputation as a shrewd businesswoman. And it appears her passion was to give away her wealth.\n\nRuby’s father, Julius Diamond, was a wealthy Tallahassee merchant.\n\nWhen Julius died, Ruby inherited a large fortune. She sold the family business and home and moved into the Floridian Hotel, where she assembled a collection of antique snuff bottles shipped in from all over the world.\n\nDiamond is representative of a class of wealthy, single, 19th century progressive women philanthropists. Columbia University philosopher John Dewey, a spokesman for that era of progressives and creator of the Dewey Decimal System, was a friend who visited and corresponded with Diamond.\n\nShe never married. The city became her family. Tallahasseans would often see Ruby Diamond taking drives around the city in a 1963 powder-blue Cadillac, chauffeured by Smiley Bruce, a former custodian for the state, bus driver and ice man.\n\nShe and Bruce were inseparable in his 25 years chaufering Miss Ruby. His recollection of their relationship informs E. Lynne Wright’s novel “It Happened in Florida: Remarkable Events That Shaped History.\" Others drew comparisons of Diamond and Bruce to the 1987 play “Driving Miss Daisy,” a story about another single, elderly, eccentric, Jewish woman.\n\nMiss Ruby fought for lower taxes and racial equality, helped establish Temple Israel, and founded the “Diamond Vegetable Basket,” to provide seeds and fertilizer to any Leon County resident who received welfare assistance.\n\n“At Christmastime she sent me out to get people who didn’t have any place to go and had me collect them up and carry them to different cafes,\" Bruce told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nShe always picked up the bill.\n\nRuby Diamond established scholarships at FSU for disadvantaged students and contributed to at least 37 charitable organizations. She was an active member of the Oleander Garden Circle, Tallahassee Historical Society, LeMoyne Art Foundation, and the Tallahassee Junior Museum.\n\nIn 1970 FSU named its largest auditorium in her honor, housed in the iconic Westcott Building.\n\nA year later, Diamond donated property valued at $100,000 to the university. And in 1981, she donated more property to help fund an endowed chair of national excellence in the College of Education.\n\nDiamond died in 1982, bequeathing to Smiley that blue Cadillac. The church leader at Friendship Primitive Baptist Church and foster grandparent then turned his hand to selling boiled peanuts in his retirement.\n\n\"He always liked to do something,\" said his grandaughter Regina Webster. \"He never could stay still. He liked to be around people. He loved to talk.\n\nRobert Butler (1786 - 1860)\n\nRobert Butler was an American military officer, a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans raised by Andrew Jackson after Butler’s parents died of yellow fever.\n\nWhen Spain ceded Florida to the U.S., Butler represented the U.S. at ceremonies in St. Augustine where Spanish Gov. Jose Maria Coppinger handed over possession of the city and territory and left for Cuba.\n\nIn 1824, when Tallahassee was founded and a crew of Jackson’s former officers were seemingly in charge of affairs, Butler was appointed the Survey General of Florida.\n\nHis first job was to establish the prime meridian, which serves as ground zero for all real estate transactions – the reference point for all surveys of property deeds in the state.\n\nInterim Gov. George Walton selected a spot about 200 yards south and east of the Capitol. Walton drove a cedar stake in the ground, next to the ampitheater at today's Cascades Park, and Butler would approve and certify all land surveys in the state until 1848 using the stake as the prime meridian.\n\nButler was a Jackson man. He organized Tallahassee’s first fraternal organization, the Masonic Jackson Lodge.\n\nHe married Jackson's daughter Rachel Hays, and gave Lake Jackson its name. Butler and Hays had a 900-acre plantation that extended from its shore and included the mounds built by Native Americans.\n\nNearby he built a holding pond to power a mill.\n\nWaist high tombstones for Robert and Rachel are located off Crowder Road near Lake Jackson Mounds State Park. They are off of the right fork of the park’s Butler Mill Trail, where a keen eye can spot remnants of the mill project.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown (1785 - 1867)\n\nThomas Brown the pioneer – not Tom Brown, the namesake of Tallahassee’s premier city park – was among a group of War of 1812 veterans who later settled in Tallahassee once it was named the Florida capital.\n\nBefore he moved to town, Brown, as the chief clerk of the Richmond, Va., post office, invented the post office letter box.\n\nIn 1828 Tallahassee, Brown built a hotel on Adams Street, between Pensacola and Lafayette streets, south of the present-day state Capitol campus. Originally called Brown’s Inn, the hotel underwent many name changes, including being called City Hotel for a couple of years.\n\nThe hotel provided the connections that enabled Brown to remain politically active. He served as president of the legislative council in 1838, was a member of the constitutional convention in 1839, and served in the first session of the Florida House of Representatives in 1845.\n\nIn 1849, Brown became the only Whig Party member elected Florida governor. He promoted agriculture and worked to improve the transportation and education systems.\n\nIntrigued by the rich soil in the Lake Okeechobee watershed, he explored whether to drain the Everglades to create more farmland. The initiative resulted in Fort Myers emerging as a bustling village.\n\nHe persuaded the legislature to endorse building a plank toll road from Jacksonville to Lake City. Under his tenure, a steamship line was initiated on the St. Johns River. And in 1853, the East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala. Closed by the Civil War, the school reopened in 1866 in Gainesville and would become the University of Florida.\n\nAt the end of his term as governor, Brown retired from public life. A Mason for more than 60 years, he served as the long-term secretary for the Tallahassee lodge and compiled a book on Masonry.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee.\n\nRev. Herbert Clarke Alexander (1929 - 1994)\n\nHerbert C. Alexander was a transitional figure who straddled two eras; between those who tried to work through Jim Crow and those who fought it.\n\nAlexander was a high school dropout from Palatka who joined the U.S. Army and then earned a degree in religion from Florida A&M University in 1957.\n\nHe would teach five years at Bond Elementary, and then at the old Lincoln High before leaving Tallahassee for the University of Tennessee where he would earn a Ph.D.\n\nAlexander would return to Tallahassee as FAMU’s Vice President of Student Affairs in 1969.\n\nIt was a turbulent time with the anti-war and Civil Rights movements flourishing and universities and the city struggling to meet student’s demands.\n\n“Herbert was never at the forefront of activism. But he was a man of impeccable character, who certainly always espoused the goals of the Civil Rights movement,” said the late Charles Smith, FAMU’s then Dean of Graduate Studies at Alexander’s passing.\n\nSmith participated in many of the marches and demonstrations students organized.\n\nAlexander was also a preacher, who ministered at Baptist churches in Valdosta, Quitman, and Tallahassee, where he followed his mentor, the Rev. C.K. Steele as pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church..\n\nYet although Steele was a driving force in the 1956 Bus Boycott, Alexander’s conciliatory nature in the VP role did not always mesh well with the demands of 1970s-era students.\n\nHe said he grew weary in the job and stepped down in 1972.\n\n“I have great faith in young people. I see in them the energy, enthusiasm, that I feel I am losing,” Alexander told the Associated Press.\n\n“If the powers that be will not be unduly restrictive on them, they will find solutions to almost all kinds of problems we struggle with,” said Alexander.\n\nAlexander remained on the FAMU campus as the director of the business ethics program. In that role, his relentless positive voice about the nature of man became a magnet for students. They would line up outside his office to talk and seek advice.\n\n“He didn’t have the talent to turn them away,” said then Dean Sybil Mobley.\n\nAlexander was a recipient of the FAMU Distinguished Alumni Award in Religion and the Martin L. King Jr. Leadership Award.\n\nRob Roy Ashmore (1916 - 2010)\n\nRob Roy Ashmore held court for more than 60 years in a store that evolved into Ashmore Antique’s. Once a drug store, the place became a junktique emporium/pecan shop on West Brevard Street in Frenchtown, across from the Old Lincoln High and just down the street from the Governor’s Mansion.\n\nThe eclectic store with an eccentric owner became a landmark for generations of college students and politicians.\n\nWhen he passed, longtime social services lobbyist Jack Levine wrote of Ashmore, “no one knew more Florida governors more personally than Rob Roy.”\n\nThe reason governors made their way to his store, Ashmore told Levine was, “because I’m famous. I can’t say the same for some of them.”\n\nAshmore Antiques came to be after World War II when Rob Roy took over his cousin’s store.\n\nHe stocked it with funky junk, retro furniture, and abstract odds and ends, and bought pecans from teens and the homeless to sell.\n\nCollege students flocked to the store where the proprietor seemed more interested in spinning tall and small tales than he was in selling anything.\n\nCandidates would ask to put their posters in his window and after the election instead of trashing them, Ashmore used them to paper the store’s walls.\n\nThe place became an improv political museum, decorated with more than 200 posters and framed photographs of a who’s who of politicians from former President Harry Truman to former Mayor John Marks.\n\nAfter the store’s popularity attracted England’s Duke of Windsor in 1952, it became a campaign stop for candidates. In 1968 presidential candidates Hubert Humphrey, Shirley Chisholm and George Wallace visited and snacked on pecans with Rob Roy.\n\nAshmore once spent an afternoon drinking Coca-Cola and munching on fresh-shelled pecans with Gov. Claude Kirk. Kirk persuaded Ashmore to help move his daughter out of an FSU dorm room. A laborer Ashmore brought along asked why he kept calling the other man \"governor.\" The worker did not recognize Kirk, which delighted Ashmore.\n\nAshmore's tales also included cruising around town with Gov. LeRoy Collins in the governor’s limousine and supplying Gov. Lawton Chiles with tobacco snuff for hunting.\n\n“I’m not supposed to tell you because he took on big tobaccy – but he liked to pinch it when he was out shooting birds,” Ashmore said.\n\nA Sopchoppy native, Ashmore credited a lesson he learned working for at an uncle’s Jackson County drug store for his store becoming a Tallahassee landmark.\n\n“I learned quick that being nice back was good for business,” Ashmore said.\n\nAshmore closed his store in 2008. The city has purchased the building with the intent of turning it into a local cultural center and African American museum.\n\nThomas Irwin Brown Jr. (1914 - 1973)\n\nThomas Irwin Brown, no relation to the Floirda Gov. Brown, was a coach, athletic director and longtime county commissioner.\n\nA Pulaski County Georgia native, Brown played football at Clemson. In 1944, he was hired to coach the Leon High School football team. Brown also operated a laundry business, service station and built an apartment complex near Florida State University.\n\nGov. LeRoy Collins appointed Brown to the Leon County Board of County Commissioners in 1958 following the death of Commissioner William Kelley.\n\nHe would serve 14 years, being reelected three times.\n\nAs a politician, Brown followed a conservative philosophy that supported consolidation of city and county governments, expansion of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, construction of the truck route that became Capital Circle, a county library, and an addition to the courthouse.\n\nHe served as the Commission’s chair 1963-1964, 1967-1968, and 1972.\n\nBrown also served as president of the Tallahassee Kiwanis Club and director of the Tallahassee Booster and Quarterback clubs. He coached a Babe Ruth League baseball team for 20 years.\n\nIn 1977, the City of Tallahassee dedicated a 255-acre recreation park in Tom Brown’s memory. As a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\n\nBrown died in 1973, and is buried at Roselawn Cemetery.\n\nEdward Bradford (1798 - 1871)\n\nEdward and brothers Thomas, William, Henry, and Richard arrived in Tallahassee from Enfield, North Carolina, in 1829. Direct descendants of William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, and English statesman Oliver Cromwell, the brothers would establish five plantations along what is now Thomasville Road in north Leon County.\n\nTallahassee’s northeast suburbs were once the site of a Bradford agricultural enterprise powered by the labor of enslaved individuals at Edgewood, Horseshoe, Pine Hill, Walnut Hill, and Water Oak plantations.\n\nRecords of transactions with New York cotton brokers between 1840 and 1866 indicate it was a prosperous business worth millions in today's money.\n\nThe Leon County 1860 Agricultural Census found 130 slaves worked Pine Hills and assessed the plantation’s value at $949,510 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nAccording to the Census, the brothers held 585 people as enslaved workers.\n\nA book titled \"Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860\" noted that the Bradfords held a large barbecue for its enslaved workers on July 4th and that Christmas week was a time of no work except for tending livestock. Bradford's wife would commission gifts for the \"black folks\" including shawls, brightly colored printed dresses and bandannas, new hats and Sunday shoes, according to the author. It was a different scene at the nearby Chemonie plantation where there was no celebration.\n\nEdward's nephew Capt. Richard H. Bradford was the first soldier killed in Florida in the Civil War.\n\nEdward also owned the Horseshoe Plantation east of Lake Iamonia. When he died in 1871, Horseshoe became known as Bradfordville, which is today an unincorporated village of 19,000.\n\nDale Mabry (1891 - 1992)\n\nDale Mabry is a Florida name most people associate with a Tampa-area highway but Dale Mabry the man was a Tallahassee native, and his hometown didn’t appreciate when Tampa appropriated his name.\n\nMabry was the son of former Florida Supreme Court Justice Milton H. Mabry and Ella Dale Bramlett.\n\nOn February 21, 1922, Captain Dale Mabry lost his life at age 30 when the rudder system malfunctioned on the 410 foot long airship \"Roma\" that he was piloting over Norfolk, Va.\n\nFrom a height of 1,000 feet, the Roma with 43 people onboard, went into a dive straight to the ground.\n\nJust before the airship impacted the ground, it encountered power lines that caused the vessel to burst into flames.\n\nMabry and 34 airmen died in the accident, which at the time was the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Mabry’s body was removed from the twisted and burnt wreckage he was still holding the wheel to steer the airship.\n\nThe US Army would never use hydrogen in any of its airships again.\n\nIn 1929, Tallahassee named its first airfield in his honor. Dale Mabry Field was dedicated on November 11, Veteran’s Day.\n\nA few years later, Tampa wanted to name its airfield after Mabry, but Tallahassee would not agree to change the name of its airfield. Tampa officials finally decided to just name a new road leading to the airfield after Mabry.\n\nMabry will one day have his Tallahassee moment again with the opening of the Dale Mabry Army Airfield Museum on the campus of Tallahassee State College.\n\nHelen Grissett (1916 - 2016)\n\nHelen Turner Grissett was a long-time educator whose love for animals made her a legendary director of what once was the Tallahassee Junior Museum, and today is the Tallahassee Museum – 52 acres of historical buildings and exhibits of animals and natural Florida.\n\nGrissett received a B.A. from Florida State College for Women in 1940 and a M.A. from the University of Florida in 1950. She taught at Caroline Brevard Elementary for two years, at Leon High for five, and Ruediger Elementary for a decade.\n\nIn 1964, she was appointed director of the fledgling Junior Museum and helped make into reality what psychology professor Howard Baker called at Grissett’s retirement in 1971, “the best idea from Tallahassee in our generation.”\n\nGrissett loved animals. Her idea of a mini zoo of petable animals became the Museum’s most popular feature.\n\nToday, the Museum is home to red wolves, black bears, white-tailed deer, red and grey fox, the Florida panther, bobcats, and cougars, along with many birds, and reptiles.\n\nGrissett was the last director to live on site, which made her view her park responsibilities as a 24-hour job.\n\nWhen a veterinarian had given up on a fox and said it would not survive, Grissett stayed up all night and nursed it. The fox lived.\n\nOne time Grissett took a baby goat, another time, a baby fawn to bed with her when they were sick to keep them warm while they recovered. And she used her bathtub as a hospital bed for alligators.\n\nThe Tallahassee Junior Museum held a Helen Grissett Day, June 13, 1971, when Grissett retired. A plaque on the Museum’s early childhood education building recognizes Grissett’s contribution to the Museum.\n\nMrs. Jessie Moon (1904 - 1982)\n\nMarion County’s Jessie Moon may be Leon County school systems' most successful innovator.\n\nJesse Moon earned a degree from Florida State College for Women in 1934 and taught at Kate Sullivan and Hartsfield elementary schools before being named the first principal of W.T. Moore Elementary School.\n\nThe school opened in the fall of 1968 as the county’s first truly integrated school.\n\nStudents still living in the footprint of old plantations where the families had been for generations and neighborhoods built by a nascent “Sun Belt” economic boom, were blended into one student body.\n\n“This was a relatively new concept at the time, but the school made great advances,” said DJ Wright, who joined the faculty in 1974.\n\nMoon wanted her teachers to know their students and each summer loaded them on a bus and drove through the areas where students lived – providing a visual display of a diverse student population.\n\nAnd she wanted students to understand each other. They would participate in daily discussions of their similarities and differences; even learning how each other's hair felt to the touch.\n\nMoon pioneered the open classroom concept for Leon County. The idea employed team teaching techniques. Classrooms consisted of seven large learning centers and two rooms for specialized instruction.\n\nAnd Moon also developed a hearing-impaired program that initially served seven counties. Students were bused from 50 miles away.\n\n“She was ahead of her times,” said Roberta Trowbridge, a student teacher for the program, who would spend all but one year of her career at Moore.\n\n“Mrs. Moon would come visit in our classroom and interact with the children regularly. She had such compassion for these kids,” said Trowbridge.\n\nAway from school, Mrs. Moon was a gardener who made bouquets of flowers for teachers, students, and parents.\n\nToday they are remembered as floral displays of the warm, inviting, positive school culture Moon created at Moore.\n\n“You felt it when you went through the doors. She knew she was creating an institution of learning for children, and it has lived on as a testament to her,” said Wright, who served as Moore’s principal 1994 - 2003.\n\nIn 1980, an addition previously identified as the Hearing Impairment Program’s Center M, was dedicated in honor of Mrs. Jessie Moon.\n\nRichard A. Shine (1810 -1862)\n\nTwenty-year old Richard A. Shine arrived in Tallahassee in 1830 and left a mark on the capital city that remains visible today. They include some notable tourist attractions .\n\nShine was a builder and supervised construction of the 1845 state Capitol, known today as the Historic Old Capitol. Other projects include the First Presbyterian Church, the Bloxham House at 410 Calhoun St., the Chittenden House at 323 Park Ave, and the main house of Goodwood Museum and Gardens.\n\nAccording to Census information from 1840, Shine was listed as the owner of 30 slaves. Historian Andrew Frank said Shine was known to have used slaves on his projects in Tallahassee and also hired them out as skilled laborers.\n\nThe bricks for the construction projects were made at a 50-acre brickyard located between Mahan Drive and Miccosukee Road that Shine owned. Remnants of the kilns were visible as late as 1934, according to the Tallahassee Historical Society Annual.\n\nBut he was also an engineer who made the deep cut along Mahan and under Magnolia Drive to lay the tracks that brought the Pensacola-Georgia Railroad to east Tallahassee in 1857. That cut, dug by enslaved people, is still in use today.\n\nA Quartermaster General of the Confederate army and Florida Militia, died in 1862, at the height of the Civil War. No written account of his death has been found. The Shine family tomb is in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nSeeking clues: Help solve mystery of two portraits found at Goodwood Museum\n\nMarion Franklin Tinsley (1927 - 1995)\n\nMarion F. Tinsley was so good at checkers that he ran out of human opponents. The Florida A&M and Florida State math professor spent the last five years of his life beating increasingly more powerful computers.\n\nTinsley earned a doctorate at The Ohio State University in 1957 and then taught math at FAMU for 26 years and 10 years at FSU. He also served as a part-time minister at Tallahassee Christian Church.\n\nTinsley won the world checkers championship in 1954 and today is recognized as the greatest checker player ever.\n\nHe was world champion from 1954 – 1958, and again from 1975 – 1991. He also claimed four consecutive Florida Open championships, 1974, 75, 76, 77.\n\nHe claimed he was a mediocre checkers player until at age 14 when he stumbled on a book of checkers while researching a math problem at the library.\n\n“Checkers can get quite a hold on you. Its beauty is just overwhelming, the mathematics, the elegance, the precision. It’s capable of wrapping you all up,” said Tinsley, according to a New York Times obituary.\n\nTwo of the seven games Tinsley lost during a 50-year run were to a Chinook computer program. It had a repertory of 250 billion moves and could make 3 million calculations a minute. It beat Tinsley once when he was intoxicated, and again during an exhibition when Tinsley competed in two matches at once.\n\nBefore cancer forced Tinsley to retire from competition, he fought the computer to six straight draws.\n\n“Tinsley was the Mount Everest we wanted to scale,” said program developer Jonathan Schaeffer after Tinsley withdrew from the 1994 world championship competition.\n\nBurt Norton (1943 - 1995)\n\nIt was 1966, about the time the Beatles released the landmark Revolver album, when Burt Norton drove into Tallahassee. He arrived in a Ford station wagon loaded with a 1960 Fender Jazzmaster, a Fender Pro Amp, a stand alone Fender reverb tank, and a few clothes.\n\nThirty years later when Tallahassee music community gathered for a memorial concert in his honor, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote, “no doubt there would have been a music scene in Tallahassee without Burt Norton. But just as certainly it would have been entirely different.”\n\nBurt Norton was the man behind Norton Audio and Music on Jackson Bluff Road. Tallahassee’s first rock n roll music store. It stocked the name brands that powered the Woodstock Generation. It became known as Norton Music, “The Guitar Store;” a mecca for musicians and fans.\n\nNorton provided services for his products, never charged for guitar string installations or setups.\n\n“It was just a given, Burt was always there,” recalled John Paul Waters before the 1995 tribute concert for Norton. “He didn’t make a big deal about it. Whatever you were looking for in the music world, he was a great resource.”\n\nPeople poured into the store – students, musicians, transients – to share stories and talk music.\n\n“I always found it interesting how I could wait on a farmer early in the morning and a state supreme court justice toward closing time,” recalled Ken Norton, who worked the counter at his brother’s store.\n\nEventually Norton decided Tallahassee needed a recording studio. So, he went off to Nashville and toured the studios where Roy Orbison recorded.\n\nHe opened a 16-track recording studio at the Jackson Bluff location.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Sweet Bay studios recorded dozens of local groups. Among those who cut songs or albums at Sweet Bay were LaBamba/Flipside, Meisburg and Walters, Bill Wharton, Drew Reid, BB Jam, Dixie Drive, Rainbow Band, Tallahassee Band, McKenzie Brothers – and a teenage country singer from Quincy, Billy Dean.\n\nIn 1986, amid growing competition from other music stores, Norton closed the store and took a job with the state. He passed away in January 1995 at age 52.\n\nLaura Mae Thompson Dixie (1925 - 2017)\n\nLaura Mae Thompson hailed from the Chaires neighborhood east of town and became a key organizer in the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee.\n\n“The Mother of the Movement in Tallahassee,” is how Bethel Missionary Baptist Rev. R.B. Holmes eulogized Dixie.\n\nDixie was an activist. Served as vice president of the Leon County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Was a board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and president of AFSCME Local 2847.\n\nVisiting people who were sick, taking in first-generation Florida A&M students, and feeding people were the foundations of Dixie’s approach to community organizing.\n\nDixie didn’t like speaking in front of crowds and avoided the spotlight. She was the person that others depended on when funds needed to be raised, voters needed to be registered, or when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., needed a place to stay during a Tallahassee stop.\n\nDixie was persistent. When the pace of desegregation at W.T. Edward Hospital proved to be slow, she quietly went to work.\n\n\"I had a long fingernail file and they had these signs also where, you know, they had the patients segregated,\" she recalled in a recorded interview.\n\n\"They had a white wing, black wing, white bathroom, colored bathroom, white eating dining room, colored dining room, and so I took my fingernail file and went 'round and unscrewed every one of those segregation signs off the door ... the supervisor said, 'I can't picture nobody doing that but Dixie,' but they still couldn't prove that I did it. I was acting just as innocent as I could be.\"\n\nCharles Saxon Ausley (1907 - 1972)\n\nThere were some impressive shoes Charles Saxon Ausley had to fill. Tallahassee appreciated the work of his dad, the physician Charles, so much they named Ausley Road on the west side in his honor. And his grandfather George Saxon was the founder of the Capital City Bank, the city’s oldest operating business.\n\nCharlie, who carried both men’s names, set out to be, in the words of the Tallahassee Democrat, a “good citizen.”\n\nHe left his mark on the community. In 1930, he teamed with future Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins to create the Ausley McMullen law firm, one of Tallahassee’s oldest law firms.\n\nAusley wrote the first charter of the Florida State Foundation, founded the Tallahassee Jaycees, served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, and as corporate officer of the Tallahassee Democrat and director of the Orange Bowl committee.\n\nCharlie also was a municipal judge, city commissioner, and state senator – filling in for Collins when he resigned to join the Navy during World War II.\n\nWhen he died, a Tallahassee Democrat editorial acknowledged he served as the newspaper’s legal counsel but also extolled him as a “good citizen.”\n\nWrote the editorial board, “In the 42 years since he returned to Tallahassee with his law degree from the University of Florida, there was hardly a worthwhile project or mission on which his help was not sought and given without hesitation. It is such good citizens as Charlie Ausley who have made Tallahassee the place for the good life it is.”\n\nGene Calvin Cox (1935 - 2009)\n\nGene Calvin Cox is the winningest football coach ever to walk a Tallahassee sideline.\n\nIn a 27-year run as head football coach at Leon High School, the Lions were 238 – 67 and won two state championships, 14 district championships, seven regional championships and eight conference championships.\n\nMore than 100 players would sign a college scholarship.\n\nA Lake City native, Cox played at Columbiana High, and was listed behind Lee Corso on the running back depth chart for the 1954 Florida State University team, which won the Sun Bowl.\n\nAfter coaching at high schools in Jefferson and Suwannee counties, Cox became head coach at Leon and a football legend.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions ran off 25 straight wins in 1968, 1969, and 1970. On two other occasions, Leon won sixteen straight games. And in 1984 –1985 the Lions posted a 19-game winning streak.\n\n“He was so serious about and so intense that when you came to college at FSU, that it was really easier than what we were used to at Leon – the intensity of the workout and at practice. And you knew how to win,” said former FSU quarterback Wally Woodham.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions became a feeder program for Bobby Bowden’s teams at FSU.\n\nThe 1979 11 – 0 Seminoles featured seven Lions, including two quarterbacks, Woodham and Jimmy Jordan, along with QB coach Billy Sexton. The Lion-led Noles only loss was to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.\n\nCox retired from Leon in 1990 but would return to the sidelines for Aucilla Christian Academy a year later. When he successfully retired as coach after the 1995 season, his 313 wins were the most ever in Florida.\n\nIn 1997, the Tallahassee Sports Commission, the Leon County School Board and the Leon County Commission renamed Capital Stadium to Gene Cox Stadium.\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam (1926 - 2006)\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam dance students started performing revues at halftime of Leon High School football games in 1947. A New York trained ballet instructor, Gilliam had a studio in the Randall-Lewis House where students from age 2-and-a-half to 16 learned tap and ballet.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, troupes of Gilliam students publicly performed in dance reviews to popular songs. Gilliam outfitted dancers in calico dresses and bonnets for a “Gal in Calico” performance, and in Spanish-theme costumes for \"The Lady in Red.”\n\nBefore Tallahassee desegregated Gilliam opened her studio to Black girls for ballet lessons.\n\nCarla Richardson joined the classes in 1964 and said she and about a half dozen other girls were not fully aware of the controversy Gilliam created by agreeing to enroll them.\n\nIt was a bold stance. Gilliam lost a lot of her white students, and ultimately her downtown studio.\n\nLooking back, Richardson said she and her classmates were unaware of the controversy Gilliam provoked by welcoming them into her studio. They were younger than 10 at the time and would learn more about race relations when the city integrated public schools.\n\n“I just think we didn’t realize at the time this woman was a civil rights activist. She was phenomenal. A single woman who risked her business to teach African American girls,” said Richardson.\n\nOne of those girls was Joyce Warner Tobias, Miss Black America 1971.\n\n“Miss Patsy contributed to her winning. Joyce used dance as her talent in the competition,” said Richardson.\n\nGilliam closed her School of Dance in the early 1970s, and worked as the superintendent at Lewis State Bank.\n\nAlexis Roberts McMillian was among the group of little girls who showed up at Gilliam’s studio in 1964.\n\n“I attribute my agility and movement – that is good for a pretty-plus senior citizen – to my ballet lessons,” said McMillian. “I stuck it out through the 11th grade as one of the last students she had until she stopped teaching. Those classes were finally desegregated ... We raise a glass of cheer to Helen Patsy Gilliam.”\n\nAlvan S. Harper (1847 - 1911)\n\nNorristown, Pennsylvania’s Alvan S. Harper studied photography in Philadelphia. A chance meeting with Tallahassee Judge J.T. Bernard at the 1876 Centennial may have led Alvan and Agnes Harper to move to Tallahassee where they set up a studio to take “artistic photographs.”\n\nHarper posed portraits with backdrops in his studio and photographed residences, buildings, farming, hunting, railway activity and political leaders.\n\nHis portfolio includes hundreds of views of late 19th century Tallahassee street scenes, and about 1,300 portraits of men, women, and children taken between 1884 and 1910.\n\nAlvan had a special interest in Tallahassee’s African American community. While Jim Crow was enforced, he portrayed Black people in a way that defied the legal restrictions they faced. The Museum of Florida selection of his photographs has been made into a traveling exhibition, and his quiet contributions to civil rights were recognized by the University of Florida, the NAACP, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n\nIn 2017, a “Trolley ride through Alvan S. Harper’s Tallahassee” was held at the Pensacola Museum of History.\n\n\"Some of Harper's best negatives were lost when his studio was torn down in the 1920s,\" according to a state archives report. \"The negatives had been given to a Tallahassee historian who, because they were dirty, left them on a porch where they were mistaken for trash and taken to the dump.\"\n\nAbout 2,000 Harper negatives were found, however, in 1946 in the attic of a house the Harpers owned. The negatives were turned over to the State Library.\n\nAlvan and his wife Agnes never had children. Both are buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence (1918 - 2013)\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence was the final principal for segregated Lincoln High School. Lawrence grew up on a farm near Old. St. Augustine Road and Chaires Crossroad. He and his brother would walk the seven miles to attend Lincoln High School as students.\n\nUpon graduation and service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Lawrence would teach in Live Oak and Quincy before returning to Tallahassee. In 1957, he was named principal of his alma mater and would keep his students focused on education during the turbulent 1960s. Lawrence encouraged both academic and vocational students to pursue the highest level of education. He was Lincoln’s principal until the school closed in 1967.\n\nDuring his 25 and more years as a principal at “Black” elementary, junior high and high schools, Lawrence advocated and promoted a higher level of service and financial commitment for the education of Black children.\n\nAdditionally, he assumed responsibility for his teachers, encouraging them to pursue graduate degrees and to this end, made promotions into leadership positions in the Leon County School System possible.\n\nMany attributed Lawrence’s ability to create alliances and negotiate helped make Leon County’s transition to integrated schools look effortless while integration elsewhere came under duress and sometimes violence.\n\nAfter integration, Lawrence became principal of the newly created Lincoln-Griffin High School. He later moved on to Nims Middle School, before retiring in 1978,\n\nIn 1996, he received a Florida A&M University’s Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2012 the Tallahassee Urban League bestowed its Legend Award to Freeman D. Lawrence.\n\nHe was remembered in his obituary as \"one of God's best servants.\"\n\n\"I once bought a three-piece suit just so I could look like Mr. Lawrence,\" then Sen. Bill Montford said at his funeral. \"In education, we as a state are always looking for the answer. I would suggest to you, we had the answer at the original Lincoln.\"\n\nMargaret Leonard (1942 - 2022)\n\nJournalism and justice inspired Margaret Leonard.\n\nRaised in Macon and Atlanta by parents who were reporters, Leonard would report for the Chattanooga Times, Miami Herald, and the St. Petersburg Times before she joined the Tallahassee Democrat as a government reporter in the 1980s.\n\nBefore making Tallahassee home, Leonard made history in 1960 as a Tulane University student when she became the “first unmistakably Southern white student\" to join the Freedom Riders to register Black people to vote in Mississippi.\n\nA teenage Leonard was repeatedly arrested as the Freedom Riders registered voters. She was jailed and spent time in the notorious Parchman Prison.\n\nLeonard told an oral history project in 2001 the experience traumatized her and inspired her journalism.\n\n“I wrote a lot about prisons, power stuff,” she said. “That was the question that I was interested in my whole life: What do people do when they have power, and what do you do about it if you don’t have it?”\n\nLeonard was open and frank in discussions with friends. As an editor, her comments were pointed but softened by a lilting Georgia accent.\n\nLate in life, after suffering a brain aneurysm, Leonard carried a dictionary to help her reprogram her brain with words she needed to keep her job.\n\nLeonard had an aversion to the limelight and praise for her work. Before she died, she asked her obituary not to begin with her role as a Freedom Rider.\n\nWhen she passed her family asked in lieu of flowers for contributions to the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, but we ain’t through,“ Leonard reflected in 2012, in an article recognizing her wor\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadell (1875 - 1963)\n\nThe roots of Tall Timbers, the research station & land conservancy north of Tallahassee, were nourished by a passion for quail hunting.\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadel of Staten Island, New York, first came to Leon County in 1894 with his father to shoot quail, such as the bobwhite, the number one game bird of the South.\n\nHis uncle, Edward, had purchased a 2,200-acre quail hunting plantation known as Hickory Hill that sat on the north shore of Lake Iamonia. Henry would visit every winter and when Edward passed away in 1919, he inherited the property and built a home he named Tall Timbers.\n\nBeadel then devoted much of his time to scientific wildlife research. And in 1926, he began experimenting with controlled burns to study fire's effect on wildlife and plants.\n\nSix years later, he organized the Cooperative Quail Study Association, made up of 21 owners of quail lands in the Tallahassee-Thomasville-Albany area.\n\nAnd in 1958, Beadel founded the Tall Timbers research station with a mission to study game birds, fire and plant ecology, wildlife, and land conservation among other things.\n\nWhen Gov. Farris Bryan presented Beadel with a plague in 1961 to recognize his contributions to wildlife research, the Tallahassee Democrat observed Beadel possessed an “outstanding color motion film libraries on quail and wildlife in the Southeast.”\n\nToday, the Tall Timbers research station holds 158,000 acres in conservation easements.\n\nJames Cullen Lawrence (1932 - 2024)\n\nJames Cullen “J.C.” Lawrence grew up in the Allen subdivision, a neighborhood north of Florida A&M University. The family home was on Canal Street, now part of FAMU Way, where the Anita Favors Lake and Plaza is today.\n\nCherry Lawrence, a younger sister, said the Bronough Street bridge runs right through her childhood bedroom.\n\nJC was known as “Cowboy” while growing up. He starred in basketball at FAMU High, earned a master’s degree in education at FAMU and when he returned after serving in the U.S. Army, he became a role model for the Allen neighborhood kids.\n\nIn 1959, James Cullen Lawrence was named the first Black supervisor over the City of Tallahassee playgrounds and parks. He was put in charge of two recreation centers and the Jake Gaither Golf Course as well.\n\n“It was huge for a Black man to be named manager of a golf course in Tallahassee. That kind of opportunity did not come easy for Black folks,” said Deloris Harpool, who was a teenager and neighbor at the time.\n\n“His appointment was uplifting. It made us feel like we had a chance,” said Harpool.\n\nLawrence was an all-around volunteer. He initiated the first Black Pee Wee Football League of Tallahassee, coordinated the Jake Gaither Alumni Golf Association, and served as treasurer of the Tallahassee branch of the NAACP.\n\nAt the recreational centers, Harpool and Cherry said he “molded the maturity” of a younger generation.\n\nCherry said JC played the role of “a real big brother” for many. He modeled a standard of behavior that demonstrated respect for others. And he expected his young charges to follow his lead when it came to the rules governing playgrounds, rec centers, and golf courses.\n\n“Although he knew us as kids (from Canal St.), he was pretty strict about that. At the dances we attended, skating activities, and basketball games held there, we were all well behaved. He was someone that we really did look up to and we obeyed,” said Cherry.\n\nDelores said JC received the same level of respect given the principal at school.\n\nIn 2002, the previous Dade Street Recreation Center was renamed the Lawrence-Gregory Community Center to honor James C. Lawrence, retired Recreation Superintendent and Beulah Gregory, Supervisor of the Tallahassee Dade Street facility\n\nWilliam May Walker (1905 - 1974)\n\nThe Honorable W. May Walker was a Crawfordville native who practiced law in Tallahassee and became known as the hardest working judge in Florida.\n\nWalker served as a county judge from 1932 to 1940 and then as a Circuit Court judge until his death in 1974.\n\nTallahasseans of his era remember Judge Walker for ending Miami Sen. Lee Weisenborn’s efforts to move the state capital away from Tallahassee.\n\nFor three years, Weisenborn and allies filed challenges to a bond issue to raise the money to build a new state Capitol complex downtown.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs lost an appeal to the Supreme Court in 1968, Walker issued an injunction against any further challenges, telling Weisenborn anymore lawsuits would be “for what purpose I do not know.”\n\nAnother famous case involved a 1959 sexual assault of a FAMU student by four white defendants. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Walker denied defense counsel’s motion for acquittal and sentenced all four defendants to life at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.\n\nAt his passing, former Leon County Judge Charles McClure recalled Walker had a talent to get to the crux of a case. McClure said “it seemed as if he could always come up with the right decision. It was second nature to him, and things would very logically fall into place.”\n\nThe 2nd Judicial Circuit Historical Society records Judge Walker as one of the most distinguished jurists ever to serve the state.\n\nGeorge Langford (1923 - 2019)\n\nGeorge Langford, founder of the Municipal Code Corporation, was the 1989 Florida Entrepreneur of the Year. The visionary publisher is also remembered as the father of the Seminole Boosters.\n\nLangford was a World War II veteran and University of Virginia Law graduate. He came to Tallahassee in 1951 with an idea: Codify the regulations of cities and towns, and publish them in books that are called the city codes.\n\nHaving all a city’s ordinances at one’s fingertips in a book turned out to be a hugely successful idea. Langford’s Municipal Code Corporation became a multi-million-dollar enterprise with a 40,000-square-foot printing press near the airport.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s a financial crisis threatened the Florida State University football team. The athletic department was $600,000 in debt and school president Stanley Marshall said if money was not found cuts would be made.\n\nA call was placed to Langford for help. All people can recall is he was “recruited.” In any event, he is credited with resurrecting the Seminole Boosters, which wiped out the debt.\n\nHe would lead the Boosters for three years – a defining moment for FSU athletics that included the hiring of Bobby Bowden as the head football coach.\n\n“The decision to recruit George Langford ... was one of the most important events that has occurred in our 64-year history,” said then Seminole Boosters President Andy Miller when Langford passed.\n\nLangford held a permanent seat on the FSU Foundation Board of Trustees, chaired FSU’s first Capital Campaign, was a founder of Springtime Tallahassee, and involved in dozens of civic organizations.\n\nHe raised money for MaClay School, Tall Timbers, the Monticello Opera House, Springtime Tallahassee, The Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, the United Way, St. John’s Episcopal Church and St. Peter’s Anglican Church.\n\nThe George and Marian Langford $1 million endowment to FSU’s Department of Classics came about after Langford asked then-president Sandy D'Alemberte which department never had received a financial gift.\n\nLangford was recognized for his unwavering commitment and dedication to FSU in 2000 when the Boosters named a grassy area outside Doak Campbell Stadium where fans and vendors gather The Langford Green.\n\nNic Gavalas (1922 - 2014)\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Nicholas George Gavalas arrived in Tallahassee after World War II and became a founding member of several civic-minded organizations and created the iconic Florida tie.\n\nThe son of a master tailor, Gavalas and his wife Janet opened Nic’s Toggery downtown at Monroe Street and Pensacola Street.\n\nThe store catered to college students and turned into a college hangout. Nic was warm and engaging with customers. He carried the latest fashions. The store quickly joined the ranks of Esquire Magazine’s Top 100 Men’s Store in the United States.\n\n“It was a gathering spot,\" former FSU football player Ron Schomburger, told Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley when Gavalas died.\n\n“We’d go in to look at the clothes but have a good conversation with him and his employees. It was like talking to an old friend,” said Schomburger, about Nic.\n\n“To my generation, Nic was a legend,” said ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso, a former Seminole quarterback. “He was like a father figure to me.”\n\nA founding member of Seminole Boosters, Nic designed a Sammy Seminole tie to promote Florida State University athletics.\n\nBut it was his Florida tie that features an outline of the state that became ubiquitous, especially when the Legislature was in town. Former U.S. Senator and Gov. Bob Graham claimed to have worn one for more than 20 years.\n\nNic Gavalas’ legacy continues with Nic’s Toggery, the Official Clothier of the Florida State Seminoles, and with two stores, one downtown and a second one in north Tallahassee.\n\nWilmoth H. and Kathleen Baker (1928 - 2006 and 1929 - 2007)\n\nWhen Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker opened Baker’s Pharmacy in 1958 only one other pharmacy in town would hire a Black pharmacist and there were only certain stores where Black people could shop.\n\nKathleen had a pharmacy degree from Xavier University, and she convinced her husband Wilmoth to pursue one at Florida A&M University where she taught.\n\nThe couple then decide to open a pharmacy in a duplex where Wilmoth’s father had a practice. Sort of a one-stop medical facility for a segregated community.\n\nMoney was tight. When the couple opened their store in August 1958 on South Adams Street, the shelves were stocked with only one of each item – because that was all the Bakers could afford.\n\nWilmoth and Kathleen worked 12-hours a day, seven-days a week to make the pharmacy what former FAMU interim-President Henry Lewis III would call a “beacon of light for this community.”\n\nIt was eclectic. The Bakers sold medicine and almost everything else – from sewing thread to birthday and Christmas gifts.\n\nThe counter at their soda fountain drew college students, professionals, the elderly and unemployed. There they swapped news, traded gossip, and sold tickets to social events.\n\nBaker’s Pharmacy was also the internship training ground for nearly 200 FAMU pharmacy students, including Lewis, who would go on to become a Leon County Commissioner, Dean of the College of Pharmacy and a FAMU interim president.\n\nThe pharmacy closed in 2002. Here is an excerpt from a letter to the editor Lewis sent to the Tallahassee Democrat at the time.\n\n“Baker’s Pharmacy was a safe and clean place to take your girlfriend. It was a place where health care was a fundamental right, regardless of your ability to pay. Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker were mother and father away from home for hundreds of FAMU students in their quest for a college degree. The Bakers were a shining example of how a married couple should be and how to raise a family.”\n\nPaul Dirac (1902 - 1984)\n\nPaul Dirac may be the most distinguished Tallahassean ever.\n\nThe 1975 Compton Encyclopedia Yearbook declared him an equal to Sir Isacc Newton and Albert Einstein.\n\nEinstein once said about a Dirac paper, “this balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.”\n\nDirac won the 1933 Nobel Prize in physics for his Relativistic Wave Equation. He anticipated the string theory in 1962 with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the Dirac membrane.\n\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said Dirac “changed our picture of the universe.”\n\nIt was a twist of fate, and lakes, that made him a Tallahasseean.\n\nDirac held the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge University in England – Newton was the first to hold the chair. As Dirac was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, FSU offered him a visiting professorship.\n\nIt was 1969. He liked the place. Became a familiar face at seafood restaurants. Would walk to work. Was often spotted swimming at Silver Lake and Lost Lake.\n\nDirac didn’t want to retire so he said goodbye Cambridge, hello Florida. He joined the FSU faculty full time in 1971.\n\n“FSU has a good physics department,” said Dirac when asked why he was here.\n\n“Here I escape the harsh winters of the North. I like swimming in the lakes, rivers, sinkholes and the sea. There are lots of swimming opportunities around Tallahassee. To some extent that is what brought me here.”\n\nDirac received many honors, including the Royal Medal, the Copley Medal, the Max Planck Medal and the inaugural J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize. He once turned down a knighthood because he did not want to be addressed by his first name but later consented and became a member of the Order of Merit in 1973.\n\nPaul Dirac passed away in Tallahassee and was buried at Roselawn Cemetery. His papers are held at the Paul A.M. Dirac Science Library at Florida State University. The street in Innovation Park where the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is located is named Paul Dirac Drive in his honor.\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos (1907 - 1977)\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos is the mother of Vo-Tech education in Leon County.\n\nWhen she was named principal of the Lively Continuation School in 1935, the Vienna, Ga., native was one of just two female vocational school directors in the country.\n\nCsikos would travel throughout Florida to construct a bureaucratic infrastructure for vocational education and became a stalwart lobbyist for job training in the Legislature.\n\nCsikos was born in 1907 and moved to Tallahassee eight years later. She graduated from Leon High School in 1926.\n\nShe was one of two teachers hired by Lewis M. Lively in 1931, one of two for 52 students at his school who trained office skills to students not college bound. She taught shorthand and typing.\n\nEvelyn also worked as a stenographer for the Legislature. When she was named director of what would become Lively, World War II was on the horizon and she would change the focus of vocational education.\n\nNorth Florida became a hub of activity for wartime preparation. Aircraft mechanics would join shorthand and accounting in the Lively curriculum, along with the operation of new technology like mimeographing.\n\nCsikos embraced the change and wangled millions of dollars from the federal and state governments to fund vocational and technical education for students not bound for college but wanting skills to earn a living.\n\nUpon her retirement in 1973, Csikos predicted the future of vocational education would be in middle and high schools because she said many college graduates “are learning a college diploma alone won’t get them a job.”\n\nIn retirement, Csikos developed the curriculum for the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Program.\n\nCsikos died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital while recovering from a heart attack in 1977.\n\nRear Admiral David Betton Macomb (1827 - 1911)\n\nDavid Macomb was the youngest son of David Macomb Sr., and Mary Tiffin Worthington. Mary’s father was the governor of Ohio, and her family opposed the marriage.\n\nThe couple moved to Tallahassee in 1824. They settled along Lake Iamonia, and had five children, David B. the youngest.\n\nThe senior Macomb gained notoriety for a duel with Prince Murat, shooting off Murat’s little finger. He then moved the family to Texas. Tuberculosis claimed Mary and the senior Macomb ended his life by slashing his throat a few months later.\n\nAt age 9, David and his siblings were left orphaned, and raised by family in Ohio.\n\nWhen he was 22, David was appointed a third assistant engineer in the U.S. Navy and explored the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan. When the Civil War broke out, Macomb would be aboard one of the first Union vessels to enter the conflict, and at war’s end he was on the ship that fired the final shots.\n\nHe also distinguished himself as an inventor.\n\nMacomb was the chief engineer of the USS Niagara in April 1861 when it became the first U.S. Navy ship to form up the blockade of Charleston. Niagara would later participate in the bombardment of the Pensacola Naval Yard.\n\nHe returned to Charleston in 1865 aboard the USS Canonicus, which fired the final shot as the rebels retreated to Sullivan’s Island as the South surrendered.\n\nThe Canonicus was then sent in pursuit of a Confederate ironclad, the chase took the Canonicus to Havana where she became the first American ironclad to enter a foreign port.\n\nAmong the inventions Macomb contributed to the U.S. Navy were a hydraulic lift used aboard ironclads, and he made and installed the first fresh-water maker used on a U.S. Navy vessel.\n\nMacomb retired February 27, 1889, with the rank of commodore. He was later promoted to rear admiral.\n\nA street in the Frenchtown neighborhood, and the destroyer the USS Macomb – known as the Mighty Mac by its crew – are named in honor of Rear Admiral Macomb.\n\nDr. Kamal Abdou Yousef, aka King Love (1936 - 1999)\n\nKing Love was someone no one understood but everyone talked about. He reigned in Tallahassee for six years.\n\nKing Love was the creation of Kamal Abdou Youssef. A child prodigy pianist who played for the King of Egypt at the Cairo Opera House in 1949, Yousef graduated from medical school in 1956, moved to New York City in 1969, and then West Palm in 1977.\n\nYoussef, a pathologist, established a successful practice.\n\nPeople say Youssef changed when the first Gulf War started in 1991. He became involved with an anti-war group, was diagnosed with manic depression and then became estranged from his family.\n\nThat’s when King Love came to be, a man with a white beard, a golden crown and a red cape holding a megaphone, and waving signs at intersections around town.\n\nOne would find the King at the corner of Tennessee and Monroe streets during the morning commute and at Apalachee Parkway and Magnolia Street in the afternoon. An electronic megaphone amplified shouts of “Yip, Yip, Yip,\" as he skipped through the crosswalk with signs that promoted love, denounced God, and one adorned with photos of JFK and Princess Diana that encouraged people to “Return to Camelot.”\n\n“I think it was the Gulf War that pushed him over the edge. Before that, he was a normal, very loving person,” his son Anwar told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter who tracked down the family after Yousef’s passing.\n\n“It was like his heart was being torn out. We lost all contact with him after the Gulf War,” said Anwar. “It was all quite sudden.”\n\nKing Love arrived in Tallahassee around 1993 and endeared himself to Tallahasseeans.\n\nTallahassee Police arrested him several times on petty theft, trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. Two college students who took him in briefly said Yousef was knowledgeable, a good conversationalist, but could become agitated and erratic.\n\nYousef’s Florida arrest record dates to 1991. A FDLE report listed eight different spellings of his given name and listed his occupation simply as “King.”\n\nHe used his monthly social security checks to publish “love declarations.” They were a mix of brotherhood tinged with paranoia.\n\n“I realize that people have been cheated of real paradise on Earth,” the King told break magazine in 1995. “They have been cheated of their innocence, falsely convicted as sinners and their wages of sin is hell and everlasting fire and wailing and gnashing of teeth. For some, hell is here and now.”\n\nWhen his health began to decline and in his final year, Youseff gave up the King Love persona.\n\nHe shaved his beard, stopped wearing crowns and robes, and quit ranting about politicians. Kamal Abdu Yousef began attending Baptist Celebration Church, which invited an Egyptian priest when it held services for Yousef after he died alone in his apartment.\n\n“I wish to thank the people of Tallahassee from the depth of my heart. People here tolerated him and didn’t harm him. In other societies they would have clobbered him to death. I know it,\" said his brother Nagaui A. Michael, a retired New York City attorney, before the service.\n\n“If I could say one thing to him right now it would be I’m sorry. Because I did not believe in him. Fortunately, the people of Tallahassee did.”\n\nFred Mahan (1886 - 1960)\n\nOn the east side of town where Hillcrest Avenue meets U.S. 90 there’s a 76-year-old marker that designates the highway from Tallahassee to Monticello as Fred Mahan Drive.\n\nFred Mahan was a horticulturist from Dodge City, Kansas, who had a passion for highway beautification.\n\nHe also created the Mahan Pecan, a pecan with a bigger nut and lighter shell, at his Monticello nursery.\n\nIn the 1920s, he would own the second-largest pecan and ornamental shrubs business in the southeast.\n\nCoronet Magazine described him as a “strange philanthropist who bestows beauty instead of dollars\" while \"spreading scenic bounty across the state he loves.”\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, Mahan donated thousands of plants to the county unemployment relief commissions for beautification projects to employ the jobless.\n\nWhen a road company got a contract to remove tree stubs and make other road improvements along U.S. 90 between Tallahassee and Monticello, he contributed thousands of crepe myrtles, camelli", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/12/fearless-girl-lizard-invasion-superman-building-news-around-states/50062795/", "title": "Fearless Girl, lizard invasion: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Two families with transgender teens and two physicians sued the state Monday to overturn a law that makes it a crime for doctors to treat trans youth under 19 with puberty blockers or hormones to help affirm their gender identity. The lawsuit was filed in federal court three days after Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the measure into law. Ivey is running for reelection this year and faces challengers in next month’s GOP primary. “By signing SB 184 Governor Ivey has told kind, loving, and loyal Alabama families that they cannot stay here without denying their children the basic medical care they need,” Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “She has undermined the health and well-being of Alabama children and put doctors like me in the horrifying position of choosing between ignoring the medical needs of our patients or risking being sent to prison.” The parents of a 13-year-old transgender girl in Jefferson County and a 17-year-old transgender boy in Shelby County are participating in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs are known as Roe and Doe in the court filing to protect the children’s identities. The Southern Poverty Law Center; the Human Rights Campaign, a national advocacy group for the LGBTQ community; and other groups are representing the plaintiffs.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature is not on track to finish its work within a voter-approved session limit. The 90-day mark will be reached Sunday. The voter-approved limit took effect in 2008, but lawmakers face no penalty for failing to meet the deadline and can continue working beyond it. The state constitution permits regular sessions of up to 121 days, with an option to extend another 10 days. Lawmakers last finished within the 90-day limit in 2013, according to statistics from the Legislative Affairs Agency. The state House over the weekend passed its version of a state operating budget, which the Senate still must consider. Senate President Peter Micciche did not have an immediate update on when the operating budget would reach the Senate floor. Differences between the versions that pass the House and Senate usually are worked out by a conference committee. The House version called for a $1,300 “energy relief” payment to Alaskans and a dividend of about $1,250. A long-standing formula for calculating the annual dividend was last used in 2015. While many lawmakers see that formula as unsustainable, agreement has yet to be reached on an alternative. The dividend amount in the meantime generally has been set by lawmakers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state House voted Monday to delay the effective date for legislation signed last month requiring voters to provide evidence of their citizenship, which has already prompted two lawsuits amid fears by voting rights advocates that it could cancel the registrations of thousands of people. If approved by the Senate and Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, the citizenship requirement would take effect after the 2022 election, a concession demanded by a GOP lawmaker who provided the final vote to pass the bill out of the Senate. As it stands now, that requirement and others in a bill signed March 30 will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends, which is likely to fall between the primary and general election. Monday’s update also would make a technical change that appears aimed at addressing concerns the bill could require hundreds of thousands of people who registered before 2005 to provide proof of citizenship. Arizona is the only state that requires documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A 2013 Supreme Court decision on Arizona’s law said anyone who registers using a federal voter registration form, which does not require documentation of citizenship, must be allowed to vote in federal elections. The controversial new law seeks to block those voters from voting for president or by mail.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A medical marijuana producer is opening a retail location in the city’s suburbs. Good Day Farm, which has operations across the South, on Tuesday unveiled Berner’s By Good Day Farm. Occupying 4,034 square feet of prime retail space in the Little Rock suburb of Chenal, the retail collaboration marks the Cookies brand’s entry into the Arkansas medical cannabis market and will provide the state’s patients with an expanded assortment of curated cannabis products and exclusive merchandise. “I never imagined our first store in the South being in Arkansas; I actually never pictured opening a store in the South in general,” said Berner, founder and CEO of Cookies, who goes by one name. “We are extremely excited about our partnership with Good Day Farm and look forward to providing real menus and a curated customer journey for those in Arkansas, especially those who have never experienced cannabis before. The last time I was in Little Rock, I was on a tour with Snoop (Dogg), and we had a blast. I look forward to setting the tone with Good Day Farm and giving Arkansas a taste of California.” A grand opening event will be held Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: A judge has ordered the Southern California city to throw out approval of a long-planned housing project, ruling that developers hadn’t adequately considered how new homes could affect potential wildfire evacuations. The Santee City Council in late 2020 approved the Fanita Ranch project, giving the green light to 3,000 new homes in hills northeast of San Diego. In her decision, Superior Court Judge Katherine Bacal wrote that eight resolutions and ordinances giving approval must be overturned, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The newspaper said the judge expressed concern that the plan didn’t fully address whether thousands of new residents would have time to flee during an emergency like a wildfire. The project, overseen by HomeFed Fanita Rancho, is not dead, and developers said they would revise the environmental impact report to address the judge’s concerns. Messages left by the Union-Tribune with the city’s manager and attorney were not immediately returned. The decision was celebrated by environmental groups that sued to stop the project, arguing that building more homes would only increase the risk of fire.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An advisory board has begun the process of removing the disparaging word “squaw” from 28 of the state’s peaks, valleys, passes and creeks. The Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory Board met for three hours Sunday and considered task force recommendations and suggestions from local communities, The Colorado Sun reports. The board approved new names for nearly two dozen features but deferred a handful of name changes to a federal task force and steered clear of suggestions for naming features after people. The board also said all of its recommendations should take a back seat if Indigenous tribes suggest a better replacement. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, may once have simply meant “woman.” But over generations, it morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in November created a committee to strip the name from federal maps. The Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force in February identified 660 features on federal land with the name, including 28 in Colorado.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A bill that would allow terminally ill adults in the state to request medication to help them die was suddenly derailed Monday by an unusual parliamentary procedure during a committee vote. Advocates had expressed optimism this would finally be the year, after roughly a decade of emotional debate, the legislation would get a vote in the full House of Representatives and Senate and be signed into law by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. However, Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, the top House member on the General Assembly’s Judiciary Committee, made a motion to “divide the committee.” That meant only senators on the panel could vote on the legislation. In Connecticut, both House and Senate members comprise committees. Ultimately, the senators defeated the bill on a 5-4 vote. Democratic Sen. Mae Flexer of Windham voted with the four Republicans in opposing the measure. “It says a lot about support for medical aid in dying, both inside and outside the Capitol, that opponents had to resort to a rarely used parliamentary maneuver to defeat the legislation,” said Tim Appleton, campaign director for the advocacy group Compassion & Choices, arguing there’s strong support among Connecticut residents for the bill. He predicted the vote will mean “immeasurable suffering” for people who are already terminally ill.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A high-ranking state medical official who is also a former legislator has opted for a bench trial instead of a jury trial on charges of official misconduct and falsifying business records. The trial of Rebecca D. Walker began Tuesday afternoon in New Castle County Superior Court. Walker is the director of nursing in the state Division of Public Health and a former state House representative. She is accused of submitting phony records regarding employee alcohol and drug testing over a period of almost five years while she served as deputy director of the state Division of Forensic Science. Walker was placed on paid administrative leave from her nursing post after being indicted in April 2021 but was allowed to return to work less than three weeks later. As Democratic vice-chair of the House Health and Human Development, Walker co-sponsored and helped pass a bill in 2014 that created the forensic science division. Months later, without a public job posting, she was hired as deputy director of the division at a salary of more than $92,000. The indictment alleges that between May 2015 and February 2020, Walker, “with the intent to defraud,” falsified employee substance abuse testing records, indicating that employees had passed tests they never received.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission saying it found evidence the NFL’s Washington Commanders engaged in unlawful financial conduct. In the letter obtained by the Associated Press, the committee said the team withheld ticket revenue from visiting teams and refundable ticket deposits from season ticketholders. The committee said emails, documents and statements made by former employees indicate team executives and owner Dan Snyder engaged in “a troubling, long-running, and potentially unlawful pattern of financial conduct.” The committee is sharing documents with the FTC while requesting the commission take any action necessary to make sure the money is returned to its rightful owners. Congress launched an investigation into the team’s workplace misconduct after the league did not release a report detailing the findings of an independent probe into the matter. After testimony from former employees, that investigation expanded to the organization’s finances. Lawyers Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who represent more than 40 former employees, including some who testified, called the letter “damning.” “It’s clear that the team’s misconduct goes well beyond the sexual harassment and abuse of employees already documented,” they said in a statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state will create new grant programs to help fathers become more engaged with their own children and with children whose fathers aren’t in their homes under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday. The Department of Children and Families will manage the grant program and work with nonprofit organizations to promote the importance of fathers being a part of their children’s lives. It will also create a mentor program to help children who don’t have a father in their lives. “This has huge ramifications for someone’s ability to be able to realize their God-given potential,” DeSantis said. “Any dad who may not be engaged, we want to be able to support. We’ve got programs, we’ve got community groups, we’ve got nonprofits. … You’re not a man by leaving your kids hung out to dry. You need to be there.” DeSantis signed the bill at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice facility and was joined by former coach Tony Dungy.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: The state’s wildlife agency is asking residents to report sightings of an invasive lizard that can pose a threat to native species. The state Department of Natural Resources is trying to locate and remove South American tegus from Georgia before the lizards can thrive in greater numbers. So far, the state’s only known wild population has been found in Toombs and Tattnall counties in southeast Georgia. Wildlife officials hope to stop the black-and-white lizards from spreading further. They can grow up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 10 pounds, and the reptiles have a wide-ranging appetite that favors eggs of turtles, alligators and ground-nesting birds. “They can live almost anywhere and eat almost anything,” Daniel Sollenberger, a DNR wildlife biologist, said in a news release. “We are focusing our efforts to accomplish two goals: document the extent of where tegus occur in the wilds of southeast Georgia and remove those animals as soon as we can after they are detected.” Officials aren’t sure how tegus got introduced into the wild in Georgia, but they are commonly kept as pets. Last year the DNR removed a single tegu that was spotted on a game camera and later captured in a trap. Seven were collected in 2020. Wildlife officials warn if tegus become established in the wild, they will be nearly impossible to eradicate.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor said Monday that he is not currently considering reinstating a mask requirement for public indoor spaces. Hawaii was the last state in the nation to lift its indoor mask mandate at the end of March. “I don’t anticipate reinstating the mask mandate at this point,” said Ige in an email. The state has seen an uptick in new coronavirus cases since the rules were lifted. “We did expect a slight increase in case numbers after spring break, and we have seen that in the last week or so,” Ige said. “However, we are not seeing the kind of surges that are currently happening on the mainland. Hospitalizations continue to be low here, and we are in a good place.” Philadelphia reinstated its mask mandate Monday amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, and other cities across the country are seeing a rise in cases. Ige said if the conditions warranted it, he might consider requiring masks again in the future. “If there is a big spike, we may have to revisit masks,” he said. “However, I noticed over the weekend that many people continue to wear their masks indoors. We know that masks work, and they make a difference in keeping our communities safe.” Public schools in Hawaii still require children to wear masks indoors, a measure the governor said he continues to support.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge ruled Monday that a mother accused of conspiring to kill her children, her estranged husband and a lover’s wife is now mentally competent to stand trial on some of the charges in Idaho. Daybell and her new husband, Chad Daybell, face numerous charges in the complicated case involving allegations of bizarre spiritual beliefs involving “zombies” and doomsday predictions. Prosecutors have said Lori and Chad Daybell espoused the religious beliefs in an effort to encourage or justify the murders. The case against her had been hold for months after Judge Steven Boyce ordered her committed to a mental facility so she could undergo treatment in an effort to make her mentally fit enough to assist in her own defense. Boyce’s new order said Lori Vallow Daybell “is restored to competency and is fit to proceed” in the Idaho murder case. He did not provide other details about her treatment or mental condition. She is scheduled to be formally arraigned in court next week, and both Lori and Chad Daybell are set to stand trial together early next year. They are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Lori Daybell’s children, 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as Chad Daybell’s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A convicted felon who pleaded guilty to charges that he opened fire on police in 2020, wounding three officers, was sentenced Monday to 31 years in prison. The sentence comes two months after Lovelle Jordan, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder and five counts of aggravated battery to a peace officer, the Chicago Tribune reports. The charges stem from a July 2020 shooting that came shortly after Jordan was arrested in connection with a carjacking in downtown Chicago. Police had driven him to a station on the city’s Northwest Side. Officers patted him down, but while they found he was carrying drugs in his pockets, according to authorities, they did not see that he was carrying a small loaded pistol. Jordan was handcuffed behind his back. At the time of the shooting, Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said that officers had searched Jordan before he was transported, but he apparently had the gun “extremely secreted, probably very close to his private area” and was able to retrieve the weapon during the ride to the station. Jordan was somehow able to move his cuffed hands from behind his back, grabbed the gun and opened fire when an officer opened the door for him at the station. Dozens of shots were fired in a shootout between Jordan and three officers were shot. Jordan was also shot and was left paralyzed.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: State officials have chosen the preferred route of a proposed highway that would run from the Ohio River to Interstate 69, linking small southern Indiana communities to I-69. The Indiana Department of Transportation announced its selection of the “Alternative P” route over several other options for the Mid-States Corridor in a public notice published Monday. The route would start in Spencer County and use existing U.S. 231 until it links with Interstate 64. A new, 54-mile portion of the road would then branch off and run parallel to U.S. 231 before linking with I-69 just north of the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center in Martin County. That route would mostly bypass “developed” parts of towns along the path, including Jasper and Loogootee, the notice said. Mid-States Corridor Project spokeswoman Mindy Peterson declined to provide specifics – including why INDOT chose “alternative P” – until an environmental impact statement is released Friday. Public hearings on the preferred route are set for April 26 at WestGate Academy in Odon and April 28 at the Jasper Arts Center on Vincennes University’s Jasper campus. INDOT and the project’s supporters say it will improve southern Indiana’s highway connections. Opponents have argued that building a new highway would damage the region’s forests and caves.\n\nIowa\n\nOxford: Iowa Farm Sanctuary has become the first in the state to be accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries, joining the ranks of more than 150 GFAS-accredited and -verified sanctuaries, rescues and rehabilitation centers worldwide. “It’s a huge accomplishment, and there’s so much buildup to it. We were confident that we are accreditation-worthy, but it was just all the work that we put into it,” said Katie Valentine, assistant director of operations at the Iowa Farm Sanctuary. The Iowa Farm Sanctuary was founded by Shawn and Jered Camp in 2016. The nonprofit focuses on helping animals with special needs like Ellie, a cow who was born blind. Not all residents at the farm sanctuary have special needs. Many come from dangerous situations, like Kathy the goat, rescued from a hoarder. Accreditation from GFAS vouches for organizations with stakeholders such as donors or a foundation. An organization must meet the GFAS Standards of Excellence, which contain guidelines for housing, veterinary care, well-being and handling, financial stability and more. “In Iowa, which is a state known for having a lot of animal agriculture, Iowa Farm Sanctuary really stands out because unlike (in animal agriculture), they are providing individualized care to their residents,” said Jessica Harris, program director of farmed animals at GFAS.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday signed a bill pushed by Republicans to overturn three communities’ policies that could help immigrants stay in the state illegally. The bill was filed after Wyandotte County passed a “sanctuary” ordinance in February that would provide local identification cards for immigrants and other residents and would prevent local law enforcement from helping the federal government enforce immigration laws unless public safety is threatened. Lawrence and Roeland Park have similar ordinances. The Democratic governor said in a statement announcing that she would sign the bill that immigration policy is a federal responsibility and can’t be resolved at the local level. “Both Republicans and Democrats in Washington have failed to address immigration issues for decades,” Kelly said. “We need a national solution, and we need it now.” The Kansas House and Senate passed the bill in recent weeks, and supporters had the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers to override a Kelly veto. The bill nullifies the three existing ordinances and bans future ones that restrict cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill also says a local ID isn’t valid for voting.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A bill allowing lawyers to carry concealed weapons anywhere in the state, including courtrooms, drew a veto Monday from Gov. Andy Beshear, who said it could spark dangerous situations. The Democratic governor said he was contacted by judges, prosecutors and the state Fraternal Order of Police requesting that he veto the measure. The proposal was attached as an amendment to an unrelated bill by the Senate before it cleared the Republican-led Legislature in the final hectic days before lawmakers took their “veto period’” break to allow Beshear to review stacks of passed bills. The gun-carrying allowance would apply to lawyers arguing cases as well as attorneys personally involved in cases, including domestic disputes or divorces, Beshear’s veto message said. The bill is one of a raft of measures vetoed recently by the governor. Lawmakers will be able to take up veto override efforts when they reconvene Wednesday for the final two days of this year’s session. The governor said he supports Second Amendment rights to bear arms, but his veto message raised potentially dangerous scenarios in courtrooms if the measure becomes law. “Courtrooms are venues of often volatile disputes that can be filled with emotion and tension,” wrote Beshear, a former state attorney general.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The group Red Hot Chili Peppers has been added to the lineup of the 2022 New Orleans Jazz Fest. The rock band’s appearance is set for Sunday, May 1, and will be its first at the event since 2016. The group has sold 80 million albums, collected six Grammy Awards and been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Their 12th studio album, “Unlimited Love,” was released April 1. Last month, the festival announced plans to find a replacement for the Foo Fighters, which canceled all upcoming concert dates after the death of the band’s drummer, Taylor Hawkins. Their scheduled time slot has now been filled by the Chili Peppers. The 2022 festival will run April 29-May 1 and May 5-8 at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. The Who, Stevie Nicks, Lionel Richie, Luke Combs, Willie Nelson, Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, Charlie Wilson and Erykah Badu are among the headliners for this year’s festival. Started in 1970, Jazz Fest annually celebrates the unique culture and heritage of New Orleans and Louisiana, alongside performances by nationally and internationally renowned guest artists. It is returning after a two-year hiatus brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lawyer for the former mayor made the case in court Tuesday that his client was served an eviction notice in retaliation for organizing on behalf of tenants. Ethan Strimling, the mayor of Portland from 2015 to 2019, appeared in court after he was served with the eviction notice last year and refused to leave. Strimling’s case has gone to court because his landlord, Geoffrey Rice, started legal proceedings to make him leave. Strimling’s attorney, Scott Dolan, said during opening statements in the case that the eviction was “a clear case of retaliation” for organizing the tenants’ union, the Bangor Daily News reports. Rice’s attorney, David Chamberlain, said during his own opening statement that the eviction was about economics. Rice offered an example that Strimling violated a section of his lease by leaving his window open in April. That presented a potential cost for Rice, who paid the heating bill. Portland voters passed a rent control ordinance in November 2020. That ordinance encouraged residents to organize.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A former police detective was found guilty of several federal crimes Monday, including providing a gun that he knew would be planted on a suspect. A federal jury convicted Robert Hankard of corruption and conspiracy charges, including allegations that he conspired with others to plant a BB gun on a suspect whom another officer had run over and later lied about it to a grand jury, news outlets reports. Hankard was also convicted of falsifying an application for a search warrant and an arrest report in another incident where drugs were planted on a suspect and of falsely testifying to a federal grand jury. The prosecution was part of the fallout from the rogue Gun Trace Task Force, which was supposed to take illegal guns off the streets, but instead members robbed drug dealers, planted drugs and guns on innocent people, and assaulted seemingly random civilians. Hankard didn’t testify and remains out of custody until his sentencing hearing, which has yet to be scheduled.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill passed by the state Senate aims to assist members of communities disproportionately harmed by the enforcement of past marijuana laws in participating in the growing cannabis market. The legislation would create a new fund that supporters say will increase equity in the cannabis industry in part by addressing the lack of access to capital that has kept many would-be entrepreneurs from taking part in the new industry. Opening an average cannabis retail shop can require more than $1 million, backers of the legislation said, with the numbers even higher for manufacturing facilities – as much as $5 million. Another hurdle is federal cannabis law preventing businesses from accessing traditional bank loans, leaving many entrepreneurs vulnerable to predatory financial deals and damaging equity partnerships. The bill would create a social equity fund to facilitate new access to capital by making grants and loans, including forgivable and no-interest loans. The fund would receive 10% of annual revenue collected from the marijuana excise tax, an estimated $18 million for the 2023 fiscal year. If approved, the state would join a handful of other states in pioneering the program. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: PFAS compounds, the emerging contaminant “forever chemicals” raising public health and environmental alarms, are found in greater quantities in the treated water leaving the state’s wastewater treatment plants – the water returning to streams, rivers and lakes – than in the not-yet-treated water entering the plant, a new Western Michigan University study found. The study highlights the complex cycling of PFAS, which have been tied to cancer and other health problems, through the environment and through human attempts to address it. When PFAS are removed from a contaminated site – either physically excavated or through charcoal filtration – the removed contaminants typically end up in a landfill. When that landfill leaches liquids, they are typically captured and either piped or trucked to a wastewater treatment facility. But such facilities aren’t required to treat for PFAS. The increase in PFAS detection in wastewater treatment plant’s outflow doesn’t mean the plants are introducing more chemicals. Rather, it appears that PFAS chemicals that scientists cannot readily detect in the wastewater entering plants are being transformed into detectable PFAS compounds during the treatment process, said Matt Reeves, lead author of the study, hydrogeologist and associate professor at Western Michigan, who specializes in the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Prosecutors revealed in a hearing Monday evening that they offered plea deals to three former police officers charged with aiding and abetting the murder of George Floyd, but the defendants rejected them. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill held the hearing mostly to consider whether he has the authority to allow live video coverage of the upcoming trial set to begin in June for former Officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng. They’re charged with aiding and abetting both manslaughter and murder when former Officer Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd, a Black man, to the pavement for 91/ 2 minutes on May 25, 2020. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back. Lead prosecutor Matthew Frank did not disclose details of the plea offers in open court but said they were identical and were made March 22 after a jury convicted the three in a separate trial in February on federal civil rights charges stemming from Floyd’s death, according to pool reports from inside the courtroom. Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, said it was hard for the defense to negotiate when the three still don’t know what their federal sentences will be. The judge in that case has not set a sentencing date, and all three remain free on bail.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A death row inmate has told a judge under oath that he wants to continue appealing his case, months after saying he wanted to give up his appeals and request an execution date. George County Circuit Court Judge Kathy King Jackson issued an order Monday noting the current wishes of the inmate, Blayde Nathaniel Grayson, who appeared before Jackson on Thursday and said he wants to continue his appeal in federal court. Grayson, 46, was convicted of capital murder in 1997 for the stabbing death the previous year of 78-year-old Minnie Smith during a home burglary in south Mississippi’s George County. He said in a handwritten letter to the state Supreme Court in early December: “I ask to see that my execution should be carried out forthwith.” Grayson also said then that he wanted to end all of his appeals. Grayson’s attorney, David Voisin, submitted a letter days later asking justices to disregard Grayson’s request because Grayson still had an appeal pending in federal court. On Jan. 28, the state Supreme Court ordered that Grayson be put under oath before a circuit judge to say whether he wished to go forward with his request for the state to schedule his lethal injection. That hearing happened Thursday.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner has reached an agreement with the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel in which she acknowledges mistakes in her handling of the prosecution of former Gov. Eric Greitens but won’t face severe penalties for those mistakes. The “joint stipulation” agreement was announced Monday at the outset of a disciplinary hearing before a three-person panel. In the agreement, Gardner concedes she failed to produce documents and mistakenly maintained that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers in the 2018 criminal case. The agreement says Gardner’s conduct “was negligent or perhaps reckless, but not intentional.” It calls for a written reprimand. A more severe punishment – suspension or disbarment – would likely cost Gardner her job because state law requires elected prosecutors to hold active law licenses. The panel would still need to sign off on the agreement and make a recommendation within 30 days to the Missouri Supreme Court, which ultimately decides punishment. It’s unclear when the court might make a final decision. Gardner is St. Louis’ first Black female circuit attorney and one of several progressive prosecutors elected in recent years with a focus on creating more fairness in the criminal justice system. She told the panel Monday that the mistakes were due to the fast-moving nature of the Greitens case.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State environmental officials unlawfully approved a large copper mine in central Montana despite worries that mining waste would pollute a river that’s popular among boaters, a state judge ruled. Officials with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality failed to conduct an adequate review of the proposed Black Butte mine north of White Sulphur Springs, Judge Katherine Bidegaray said in Friday’s ruling. Work began last year on the mine along a tributary of the Smith River, a waterway so popular among boaters that the state holds an annual lottery to decide who can float down it. The underground mine sponsored by Vancouver-based Sandfire Resources is on private land and would extract 15.3 million tons of copper-laden rock and waste over 15 years – roughly 440 tons a day. Environmentalists had sued over potential pollution from the mine and asked Bidegaray to reconsider its permit. Her ruling leaves that permit in place for now. She asked the two sides in the case to submit legal briefs within 45 days to address what should happen next. State officials said the mine permit includes requirements that will protect the Smith River. They plan to appeal the ruling, Department of Environmental Quality Director Chris Dorrington said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bill that would have allowed people in a majority of U.S. states to carry concealed handguns without a permit died Monday when Nebraska lawmakers derailed the proposal after hearing concerns from law enforcement officials. The bill would have made Nebraska the 26th state to adopt so-called constitutional carry legislation. Supporters in Nebraska fell two votes short of the 33-vote supermajority needed to overcome a filibuster led by opponents, which prevents lawmakers from advancing it this year. Permitless concealed carry is already allowed in 25 conservative-leaning states. The Nebraska bill won initial approval last month but stalled Monday on the second of three required votes in the waning days of the legislative session. “To say I’m frustrated is an understatement,” said Sen. Tom Brewer, the bill’s sponsor and a leading gun rights advocate in the Legislature. Nebraska already allows gun owners to carry firearms in public view, as long as they aren’t in a place where it’s prohibited and don’t have a criminal record that bars them from possessing one. To legally conceal the gun, they’re required to submit to a Nebraska State Patrol background check, get fingerprinted and take a gun safety course at their own expense.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More Nevadans today are pessimistic about financial security and rising inflation than in recent years, a new poll of likely voters found, suggesting a negative shift in public opinion on the Silver State’s economy. The poll conducted last week by Suffolk University for the Reno Gazette Journal shows that Nevadans’ outlook on the economy mirrors how they feel about their elected officials both at the state level and in the White House. Just over 40% said their standard of living is worse now than it was four years ago – before Gov. Steve Sisolak and President Joe Biden assumed their respective offices and replaced Republican incumbents. About half said Nevada is headed down the wrong track. Suffolk surveyed 500 voters across the state, all of whom indicated they will likely vote in the midterm elections later this year. About 43% said their annual household income is less than $75,000, with 13% making less than $20,000 annually. Nevada’s median household income in 2020 was about $62,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. More than half of respondents said they disapprove of the job Biden is doing as president, and 47% said they want their vote in November “to change the direction” Biden is leading the nation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A commission to address domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking will meet again following a ten-year absence, according to an executive order signed Monday by Gov. Chris Sununu. A state task force that examined how the judiciary handles domestic violence cases recommended that the commission be brought back. The original commission was created by Gov. Stephen Merrill and was active from 1993 to 2013. Sununu’s executive order said the state “remains committed to fostering a multidisciplinary approach to both better address the needs of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, and promote a consistent response to hold offenders accountable for their actions.” It said that combatting and preventing domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking “remains a priority” for Sununu’s administration, and a commitment to reconvene the commission “is an additional measure to ensure victims remain safe and offenders are held accountable.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNorth Haledon: Hundreds of people are signing petitions to keep a 25-foot star shining at High Mountain Park Preserve as the mayor continues to defy an order to take down the solar-powered decoration. Mayor Randy George said Monday that he is prepared to reinforce the public relations onslaught at a special meeting next month at Eastern Christian High School. The agenda, he said, will be to organize more support against The Nature Conservancy, the Virginia-based nonprofit that asked for the star to be permanently removed. “I’m doing everything I can to harass them,” the mayor said. Meanwhile, the borough has backing from an influential source. The township of Wayne is helping the cause, and its mayor said he “does not object” to the star on the mountain. Wayne owns most of the 1,260-acre park, but according to the conservancy, it does not own any portion of the preserve where the star is placed. That part was given directly to the nonprofit by North Haledon in October 2000. Barbara Brummer, the conservancy’s director for New Jersey, wrote in a letter to George that the star is a safety hazard because hikers are climbing on it and visiting the mountain after dark to see it lit up. “Another very important consideration,” she wrote, “is that the star and its accompanying equipment have a negative ecological impact.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Election regulators are resisting efforts by a conservative-backed foundation to post statewide voter registration information on a public website where it can be searched by names or addresses to view whether people voted in past elections and sometimes their party affiliations. The website does not list details of how people voted regarding candidates or initiatives. The Voter Reference Foundation, created by Republican former U.S. Senate candidate Doug Truax of Illinois, announced in December that it would add registered New Mexico voters to its website database VoteRef.com that was established in the wake of the 2020 election and now includes voter rolls from at least 20 states. That move has prompted calls for a state investigation into possible misuse of election records and a preemptive lawsuit by Voter Reference Foundation to ensure its plans to publish the details about New Mexico voters. The foundation has said its goal is to usher in a “new era of American election transparency.” But New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said in an interview Monday that the foundation’s efforts violate state law that restricts the use of voter registration data to political campaigning or noncommercial government purposes.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The 4-foot bronze Fearless Girl statue that was deposited in front of Lower Manhattan’s Charging Bull in 2017 will remain in its current spot opposite the New York Stock Exchange at least until early next year while city officials wrestle with a permanent disposition for the popular symbol of female empowerment, a city board decided Monday. Members of the Public Design Commission granted an 11-month permit extension and said they would spend the next six months exploring a way for New York City to take ownership of the statue, which is currently the subject of litigation between artist Kristen Visbal and State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based asset-management firm that commissioned it. “We today, the Public Design Commission, cannot make this a permanent piece of art,” commission president Signe Nielsen said. “We can urge that steps be taken to enable this work to be considered for the public collection.” The statue of a spunky young girl was supposed to be a temporary installation when State Street commissioned it in 2017 to urge higher representation of women on corporate boards, but permits to keep it on display were extended several times once it became a major tourist attraction. Fearless Girl was moved to its current location in December 2018 and has continued to draw selfie-taking visitors. Visbal, meanwhile, began selling replicas of the statue around the world. State Street, which had an ownership contract with the artist, sued Visbal, alleging the replica sales violated the agreement, and Visbal countersued, arguing that the company was infringing on her rights. She has urged the city to take ownership of the piece itself.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: City officials have settled a federal discrimination lawsuit with a former firefighter who said she had endured a hostile work environment in which the fire chief and others inflicted emotional distress. John Hunter, the attorney representing former Asheville firefighter Joy Ponder, confirmed Tuesday that his client will get $155,000 in compensatory damages. She also voluntarily dismissed her claim in U.S. District Court, Hunter said. He said it was unusual for a gender discrimination case to survive summary judgment. “The city didn’t come forward with settlement offers until that happened,” he said. A federal judge ruled in March that the discrimination lawsuit filed by Ponder, one of the highest-ranking women in a North Carolina fire department, could proceed based on a claim of “disparate treatment.” Attorneys for the city of Asheville and Fire Chief Scott Burnette had asked U.S. District Court Judge Martin Reidinger for a pretrial summary judgment throwing out all claims by Ponder. Reidinger dismissed claims against Burnette, writing in his order that he could not be held responsible under the 1964 Civil Rights Act’s Title VII against employment discrimination because the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said “supervisors are not liable in their individual capacities for Title VII violations.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group that wants to legalize recreational marijuana in the state submitted paperwork Monday to begin the approval process. If it’s approved by North Dakota’s secretary of state, the group would need to gather 15,582 signatures by July 11 to get the measure on the ballot for the general election in November. The proposed measure would allow any person over the age of 21 to use limited amounts of marijuana and purchase products from registered establishments in North Dakota. The measure would put policies in place to regulate retail stores, cultivators, and other types of marijuana businesses. A similar effort failed in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hampered the group’s signature-gathering. Cannabis was a major topic in the Republican-controlled Legislature last year. State representatives brought bills to legalize and tax the drug, but the Senate killed the bills that were passed by the House.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: From X-ray body scanners to anti-drone technology, the state is ramping up efforts to keep contraband out of prisons as drugs and other illicit goods flood inside – even when visitation was curbed during the pandemic. The anti-contraband measures are aimed at anyone who enters prisons, whether inmates returning from an outside assignment, visitors or staff members, said Annette Chambers-Smith, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. “Every time we solve one thing, we have to build a better mousetrap for the next thing,” Chambers-Smith told the Associated Press. The scope of the problem was underscored last month when federal authorities announced the arrest of a South African woman on suspicion of helping to smuggle hundreds of sheets of drug-soaked paper into at least five Ohio prisons. The woman is accused of soaking papers in legal correspondence, which is exempt from normal inspection routines. The state said it conducted about 1,000 drug seizures a month in state prisons from March through September 2020. Numbers slowly decreased through 2021 and now average just under 500 a month, according to state data.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law Tuesday that makes it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The bill, which takes effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns next month, makes an exception only for an abortion performed to save the life of the mother. Abortion rights advocates say the bill signed by the GOP governor is certain to face a legal challenge. “We want to outlaw abortion in the state of Oklahoma,” Stitt said during a signing ceremony for the bill, flanked by anti-abortion lawmakers, clergy and students. “I promised Oklahomans that I would sign every pro-life bill that hits my desk, and that’s what we’re doing here today.” Under the bill, anyone convicted of performing an abortion would face up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine. The measure does not authorize criminal charges against a woman for receiving an abortion. Sen. Nathan Dahm, a Broken Arrow Republican now running for Congress who wrote the bill, called it the “strongest pro-life legislation in the country right now, which effectively eliminates abortion in Oklahoma.” There is no enforcement mechanism for women who order abortion medication online from out-of-state suppliers. Oklahoma lawmakers passed a bill last year to prevent such online purchases, but that measure was blocked by the state Supreme Court.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A recently released report shows an ice storm in 2021 decimated hundreds of acres of trees in the city. The report from Salem Public Works Department says a citywide analysis found a 17.6% tree canopy loss from August 2020 to May 2021. City staff said about 10 acres of tree canopy was lost to development, but the bulk of the loss – more than 1,000 acres – was because of the Feb. 15, 2021, ice storm. The report to the city says thousands of trees fell, and branches buckled under the weight of ice during the storm. Historic and heritage trees, some hundreds of years old, were downed. “Large Oregon white oaks were particularly hard hit by the ice storm as their large diameter branches accumulated heavy loads of ice, resulting in massive limb breakage and whole trees keeling over,” city staff said in the report. Initial reviews found about 10,000 trees were damaged, and 1,000 trees were removed from city property following the storm. The city spent more than $6.3 million on ice storm-related cleanup. New tree growth and new planting projects have helped offset that loss, the city said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Ex-President Donald Trump slammed GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill McSwain on Tuesday, complaining the former federal prosecutor did “absolutely nothing” to investigate Trump’s false claims of widespread election fraud after Democrat Joe Biden won the state in 2020. McSwain, who spent nearly three years as the top federal prosecutor in Philadelphia under Trump, had been seeking his endorsement, calling the presidential election in Pennsylvania a “partisan disgrace” as he sought to curry favor with the former president. McSwain has often touted his connection to Trump while campaigning for the GOP nod in a crowded primary field. Instead, Trump turned on him. “One person in Pennsylvania who I will not be endorsing is Bill McSwain for Governor. He was the U.S. Attorney who did absolutely nothing on the massive Election Fraud that took place in Philadelphia and throughout the commonwealth,” Trump said in a statement. “Do not vote for Bill McSwain, a coward, who let our Country down. He knew what was happening and let it go.” Trump’s false claims of a stolen election have been debunked by the courts, his own Justice Department and numerous recounts, and no prosecutor, judge or election official in Pennsylvania has raised a concern about widespread fraud.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: After years of neglect, the most recognizable feature on the city’s skyline, the Superman Building, will be rescued. Gov. Dan McKee announced Tuesday that the building’s owner is planning to turn the vacant landmark into an apartment building with offices and shops, with help from state and city funding. Officially known as the Industrial Trust Building, at roughly 430 feet high, it is the tallest building in Rhode Island. It has been vacant for nearly a decade. McKee said the $220 million redevelopment project will reinvigorate downtown Providence and bring the Superman Building “back to life.” Opened in 1928, it resembles the Daily Planet headquarters in the old “Adventures of Superman” TV show. McKee said $26 million will come from state housing and economic development programs, and $15 million will come from the city through a loan and a direct contribution. Massachusetts-based High Rock Development committed to providing more than $42 million and will take advantage of federal tax credits and seek a tax stabilization agreement from the city, McKee said. High Rock Development bought the building in 2008. In 2013, the sole tenant, Bank of America, moved out. The value of the building dropped, and it fell into disrepair.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: A unique gold medal celebrating a battle victory that helped turn the tide in the American Revolution brought a world-record $960,000 at auction. An anonymous buyer of the Daniel Morgan at Cowpens Medal won with a bid of $800,000 on April 4. With the 20% buyer’s premium, the final price was $960,000, according to Stack’s Bowers Galleries in Costa Mesa, California. The medal honors Revolutionary War Gen. Daniel Morgan and his victory at the 1781 Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina. It was struck in 1839 at the Philadelphia Mint. “Everyone’s pretty excited,” said numismatist John Kraljevich of Fort Mill, who specializes in rare, early medals and authenticated the anonymously consigned medal. The front of the medal depicts Morgan leading an infantry charge on horseback against a retreating British cavalry. The back features a Native American woman placing a crown of laurels on Morgan’s head. The original medal was struck in Paris in 1789 and given to Morgan in 1790. After his death in 1802, grandson and heir Morgan Neville owned the medal and stored it in a bank vault in Pittsburgh. It was stolen in 1818 during a robbery. In 1836, Congress authorized the strike of a single replacement, and it remained in the family until about 1885. At one point the medal was acquired by famed financier banker J.P. Morgan, who incorrectly believed he was related to Daniel Morgan, Kraljevich said. The medal then disappeared from view and was thought to have been lost or melted. Only in recent months did it reappear when consigned anonymously to the auction house.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state House on Tuesday impeached Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg over a 2020 car crash in which he killed a pedestrian but initially said he might have struck a deer or another large animal. Ravnsborg, a Republican, is the first official to be impeached in South Dakota history. He will at least temporarily be removed from office pending the historic Senate trial, where it takes a two-thirds majority to convict on impeachment charges. Ravnsborg pleaded no contest last year to a pair of traffic misdemeanors in the crash, including making an illegal lane change. He has cast Joseph Boever’s death as a tragic accident. In voting 36-31 to impeach Ranvsborg, the Republican-controlled House charged him with committing crimes that caused someone’s death, making “numerous misrepresentations” to law enforcement officers after the crash and using his office to navigate the criminal investigation. “When we’re dealing with the life of one of your citizens, I think that weighed heavily on everyone,” said GOP Rep. Will Mortenson, who introduced the articles of impeachment. A spokesman for Ravnsborg did not reply to a request for comment after the vote. Tim Bormann, the attorney general’s chief of staff, said his staff would “professionally dedicate ourselves” to their work while Ranvsborg is forced to take a leave.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will soon decide whether to sign off on adding harsh penalties against public schools in his state that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports. The GOP-controlled Legislature finished advancing the proposal Monday, with Senate Republicans approving the measure 26-5. The House had previously approved the bill last month. Lee, a Republican, hasn’t said publicly whether he supports the legislation. However, he signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, lawmakers decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. “What this bill does is put teeth in that legislation,” said Republican state Sen. Joey Hensley. Under the legislation headed to Lee’s desk, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of a state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Many of the state’s cattle ranchers are culling herds because of rising costs for feed and fuel, along with the looming prospect that ongoing drought conditions could worsen this summer. Consolidation of the meatpacking industry in recent years also has reduced the market power of ranchers, who sit at the very beginning of a lengthy line of processors, packers, wholesalers and retailers in bringing beef to consumers.“I tell (people) the packers are making all the money,” said Shelby Horn, general manager of Abell Livestock. Cattle prices have been climbing along with increased consumer demand for beef as the broad economy continues recovering from its pandemic-induced downturn. But they haven’t yet risen enough to offset the multiple headwinds facing many ranchers, Horn and other experts say. Texas is by far the largest producer of beef cattle in the country, with a herd that totals about 4.5 million animals – 2.3 million more than Oklahoma, the second-largest producer, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sales of beef cattle and calves in Texas generate about $8.5 billion annually and constitute the state’s top agricultural commodity. But the Texas herd shrunk 3.5% last year – or by about 160,000 head – outpacing a 2.3% decline in the U.S. beef cattle herd overall.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The state’s increasingly popular national parks will offer free entrance Saturday to kick off National Park Week. The nationwide celebration, lasting through April 24, aims to “boost awareness of the value and availability of recreational areas, encouraging people across the country to spend time in America’s treasured national parks,” according to a U.S. Senate press release. In celebration, entrance into all national parks will be free April 16. That includes Zion, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands and Capitol Reef.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in the state increased by 33% in 2021 to a record number of 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported. The report released last week found that fentanyl was involved in 93% of last year’s opioid deaths, while the percentage of deaths that involved heroin dropped from 25% in 2020 to 10% last year. Cocaine was involved in 48% of all opioid-related overdose deaths, according to the report. The study also found that use of methamphetamine and the drug xylazine, a veterinary sedative, were increasingly contributing to opioid-related fatal overdoses among Vermont residents. The 2021 figure of 210 was up from 158 in 2020. The report lists opioid fatalities going back to 2010, when there were 37. Chittenden County had the highest number of opioid-related overdose deaths last year at 38, while Rutland County had the highest rate of opioid deaths per 100,000 residents at 48, according to the report.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin has proposed substantial changes to a hemp bill aimed at reining in the retail sales of products containing a psychoactive form of THC, including amendments that would create new misdemeanor penalties for marijuana possession. The bill is among more than 100 pieces of legislation the Republican governor is seeking to amend, his office announced late Monday, just ahead of a deadline Youngkin faced to take action on bills sent to his desk. Lawmakers will meet April 27 to consider the governor’s proposed amendments and will also have the chance to override his vetoes. The hemp measure rewrote the definition of marijuana in state code in a way industry players said would have severely curtailed the sale of CBD products that don’t produce a high, in addition to ending the retail sales of delta-8, a chemical cousin of pot’s main intoxicating ingredient, sales of which have proliferated around the country. Youngkin’s amendments would also create a Class 2 misdemeanor offense for possession of more than 2 and less than 6 ounces of marijuana and a Class 1 misdemeanor for possession of more than 6 ounces and less than 1 pound. A 2021 law passed when Democrats were in full control of state government laid out a years­long pathway toward retail sales and legalized the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana. Anyone possessing an amount between an ounce and a pound is currently subject to a small civil fine.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A new law could reshape the way child dependency cases are handled in the state, potentially leading to more children staying with family members without those relatives being required to adopt them. Under the current practice, Washington state forces relatives to adopt children when neither parent can take care of the child. If family members don’t wish to adopt, the Department of Children, Youth and Families removes children from those placements, even if those relatives still want permanent kinship guardianship, and places the child up for adoption. “We’re removing children out of relatives’ homes, loving relatives’ homes, because they’re unwilling to adopt,” said Shrounda Selivanoff, director of public policy for the Children’s Home Society of Washington and a proponent and writer of the legislation. Children’s Home Society said the state currently “prioritizes termination” of parental rights instead of using other options, the News Tribune reports. Termination of parental rights is not required when a dependency case ends, they said. Under the new law, the state won’t be allowed to move children from their relatives’ care if those relatives don’t want to adopt. Financial assistance also has been expanded for relatives who are eligible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Free tire collection events are scheduled around the state this month. The events are 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. April 23 behind the Go-Mart in the Cabin Creek community in Kanawha County, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 23 at Clay County High School, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 23 at the Old Oak Ridge Trucking Lot in Elkins and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 30 at the HL Wilson Trucking Lot in Moorefield, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection said. Each person may dispose of up to 10 tires. The tires must be off the rims. Only car and light truck tires are accepted, the agency said. Ongoing tire collections are held regularly in Boone, Brooke, Calhoun, Fayette, Hancock, Mason, Mercer, Monroe, Pocahontas, Putnam, Tucker, Wayne and Wyoming counties. Upcoming tire collection events are listed on the department’s website.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: New data shows a sharp increase in Type 2 diabetes among children in the state, and doctors think COVID-19 could be a factor. Figures from UW Health Kids shows a nearly 200% increase in the number of cases over the past several years. Dr. Elizabeth Mann, a pediatric endocrinologist and director of the Type 2 Diabetes Program at UW Health Kids, said it’s a trend medical experts have noticed for years, but it’s taken a worrisome turn recently. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve just seen a sharp increase beyond what we had expected,” Mann said. In 2018, 5.8% of pediatric patients with new onset diabetes at Madison’s American Family Children’s Hospital had Type 2, a disease that primarily affects adults. In 2021, that number grew to 16.4%. And so far in 2022, 1 in 6 pediatric patients at the children’s hospital with new onset diabetes has Type 2, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “In kids, this Type 2 diabetes just acts a little bit more aggressively,” Mann said. “So it’s not only that we’re seeing Type 2 diabetes at younger ages, but it also seems to be a more severe form where kids are needing more medications and have more significant complications from it.” In Type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form overall, the pancreas produces insulin, but the body has developed a resistance to it. Mann said it’s a common misconception that Type 2 diabetes is purely a result of diet and activity levels. She said genetics and epigenetics play a big role in making people more susceptible.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State wildlife officials have detected avian influenza among wild birds in Wyoming, include Canada geese and great horned owls, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/24/paulies-push-sweet-connie-vr-brain-rewiring-news-around-states/118465756/", "title": "Paulie's Push, sweet Connie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPanola: General Store owner Dorothy Oliver has persuaded and helped almost everyone in her community to get their COVID-19 shots. In her decades living in Panola, Oliver has become one of the most influential people in the area. She is the vice president of the local day care center and on the board of the community center, in addition to owning her store. “All of them know me,” she said of her customers. “They come in, and I just start talking to them like I know them. I don’t have to know you to talk to you.” And she isn’t afraid to ask about their vaccination status. “Back in December, whenever vaccination started, I started with it,” she said. “I went to calling all the older people around in the community, trying to make sure how their mind is and make sure they started thinking on going and getting a shot whenever it got ready for them.” By the time doses were readily available in Alabama, there were not any vaccination sites in the immediate area, with the closest facilities about 40 minutes away. So Oliver volunteered to schedule neighbors’ appointments and drive them to and from the sites. According to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community of roughly 350 people are left unvaccinated. “I know all my people that haven’t got it,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Three-time Super Bowl champion Mark Schlereth returned home to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. Anchorage Daily News reports the Service High alumnus made a halftime appearance Friday night at West High, where his alma mater squared off against the West Eagles. “I just want to encourage everybody to do your part, to talk to your doctor, and if it’s the right decision for you, please get vaccinated,” Schlereth said. “Please take care of one another.” He has been advocating for COVID-19 shots on social media, and he said the NFL Players Association reached out to him about spreading the word in his home state. Almost 54% of Alaska residents 12 and older have been inoculated, according to the state dashboard. Schlereth, 55, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 1993 while playing for Washington. He said one of the reasons he got the vaccine was to visit with his mother, who has cancer. “I wanted to spend as much time safely with her as possible … so it was just a no-brainer for us,” Schlereth said. He said one of his high school coaches whom he considered a mentor died Thursday from COVID-19. “I just lost a dear, dear friend who refused to get vaccinated, so that hit home for me,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Private businesses can require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but must allow reasonable religious and medical exemptions under state and federal law, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a legal opinion. And they can impose vaccine requirements on patrons as well, as long as they provide reasonable accommodation for customers who can’t take a vaccine because of a disability and don’t discriminate against those who won’t for religious reasons, the Republican wrote in Friday’s opinion. Public schools and universities and local and state government agencies are different because of laws enacted this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. They are not allowed to require employees or students to get inoculated once the new laws take effect Sept. 29. But private schools can, if they allow exemptions for religious or health reasons. Ducey last week issued an executive order barring state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing law that says health agencies can’t force people to be treated if they comply with sanitary or quarantine rules. A violation carries criminal sanctions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Connie Hamzy, a rock ’n’ roll groupie from the Natural State who was immortalized as “sweet, sweet Connie” in the 1973 Grand Funk Railroad hit “We’re an American Band,” has died. She was 66. “I was determined to become a famous groupie,” Hamzy, who lived in Little Rock, told KTHV in 2019. She told the station she was finishing her senior year of high school when the manager of Grand Funk Railroad called to say her name would be in a song. “I said, ‘Yeah I’ll have to see it to believe it,’ ” she said. But that summer, at the lake with friends, she heard a radio announcer introduce the new song and note that a local girl was in the first few lines, she said. “Out on the road for forty days. Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. Sweet, sweet Connie, doin’ her act. She had the whole show, and that’s a natural fact.” Hamzy told KTHV she first got backstage at age 15 after her mother, who didn’t want to deal with traffic, dropped her off early to see Steppenwolf at Barton Coliseum. “We’d go out there, and then we’d wander around the backstage area, and one thing would lead to another,” she told KTHV. Hamzy, who worked for a time as a substitute teacher, hung out with groups including Queen, the Eagles and Kiss, KTHV reports. She told the station Van Halen was a particular favorite.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMalibu: Powerful surf washed away a section of a beach access road, and swimmers and surfers were urged to use caution as huge waves from a southern swell battered the Southern California coastline. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted photos Saturday that showed the ground under Westward Beach Road completely collapsed. Beach hazard advisories had mostly expired by Sunday morning, but officials warned that dangerous rip currents and localized flooding were still possible. “We cannot emphasize this enough: surf and swim in front of an open lifeguard tower,” the Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted. “Check with the nearest lifeguard before entering the water.” Aerial video by CBS 2 News showed huge waves hitting the patio and second-story balconies of a hotel in the Orange County city of Laguna Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: After taking last season off due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bustang rides to Denver Broncos home games are back with service from Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. The state Department of Transportation said the return of rides on its Bustang coaches will begin with the team’s final preseason game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High against the Los Angeles Rams. Service was suspended last year due to the pandemic and restricted capacity at the stadium. This is the fifth season the service has been offered. The round-trip fare is $30 per person. Coaches are climate-controlled and equipped with Wi-Fi, restrooms, USB and power outlets, comfortable seats and wheelchair access. Face masks are required for drivers and passengers, and hand sanitizer wipes will be offered to passengers when boarding the bus. The buses are cleaned and disinfected upon completion of each route and each day’s routes, according to officials. Amber Blake, CDOT’s director of Transit and Rail, said the service provides an alternative for fans, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides a designated driver and enhances safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Slot machine revenues generated at the state’s two tribal casinos continue to rebound. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino report seeing an influx of visitors over the summer as COVID-19 restrictions have eased. Both destinations closed for more than three months at the height of the pandemic last year. Mohegan Sun, owned by the Mohegan Tribe, generated $49.9 million in slot machine revenues in July after paying out winnings. That’s a 5% increase from July 2020 and the most money the casino has retained since August 2019, according to The Day of New London. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, kept $36.5 million in July, marking a 19.6% increase from the more than $30.5 million in generated in July 2020. It’s the casino’s highest amount since November 2019. Jason Guyot, CEO of Foxwoods, said slot revenues at the site increased by $7.1 million from June to July. To meet increased consumer demand this summer, he said the casino has offered new experiences, including an outdoor pop-up eatery and a “Cocktail Carnival.” Mohegan Sun has also rolled out more promotions and entertainment over the summer, helping to drive traffic, said Jeff Hamilton, the resort casino’s president and CEO.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As housing prices soared over the past year, the dream of homeownership was less achievable in the First State, where buyers need more cash for closing the sale. Delaware has the highest real estate transfer tax in the nation, making the average closing costs the second-highest behind Washington, D.C. On a $250,000 home, the transfer tax due at settlement in Delaware is $10,000, which is usually split between the seller and buyer and must be paid at closing. The buyer can’t roll that amount into the mortgage and pay it off over time. Mia Burch, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors, said she has worked with buyers who were in good financial shape in almost every way but had trouble coming up with all the cash they needed at closing. She calls the transfer tax a “discouragement” tax. In 2017, the Legislature hiked the real estate transfer tax from 3% of the property’s sale price to 4%. It was only supposed to be a temporary increase to help solve the state’s budget deficit, said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek. But four years later, even after a $1 billion budget surplus, the 4% tax is still in place. “Seniors and young people are the ones getting squeezed,” Ramone said. In January, he introduced a bill to reduce the tax to its previous level, but it’s yet to make it to the House floor for a vote.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ten years after an earthquake shook the nation’s capital, repair work is only half done on the National Cathedral, WUSA-TV reports. The Aug. 23, 2011, temblor registered a 5.8 on the Richter scale and dealt extensive damage to buildings across the area. “The quake lasted 58 seconds,” said Joe Alonso, National Cathedral head stonemason. He still can recall every single second of that shake that bent the historic cathedral’s beautiful spires, split its gargoyles and sent chunks of masonry to the ground. “I thought, ‘Wow we’ve got a task ahead of us, that’s for sure,’ ” Alonso said. Repairing the spires and towers is not as simple as slapping some glue on the pieces and putting them back up. “It’s just the nature of the work – everything is handmade, hand-done,” Alonso said. “But that’s how the cathedral was built.” For ten years, the stonemasons have had to reconstruct every single broken piece and reset it hundreds of feet in the air by scaffolding or crane. “What it costs to do this is very expensive, and we are doing (a) sort of a pay-as-you-go,” Alonso said. He believes the 58 seconds were the difference between a slow, tedious repair and complete reconstruction. “If the quake had lasted 2 or 3 more seconds, the stuff that was like a Jenga game would have just come completely down,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The state’s power struggle over wearing masks in school landed Monday before a judge considering a lawsuit that challenges Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order reserving the decision for parents. The three-day hearing before Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper pits pro-mask parents against the Republican governor and state education officials who say parents, not schools, should choose whether their children cover up inside schools. The hearings come as the highly contagious delta variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across Florida, where the school year is already being disrupted. Charles Dodson, a former judge representing the parents challenging the governor’s order, in an opening statement that the delta variant affects children more than the previous virus strain and places them at greater risk in crowded schools. He said the Florida Constitution and state law give local school boards the authority to decide health and safety matters affecting their students. Michael Abel, a lawyer for the defendants, said the state’s experts will testify that requiring students to wear masks causes many harms – speaking difficulty, mood changes, breathing issues and depression – while scientists disagree on their effectiveness against the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has found that part of the state’s sweeping new election law that broadly prohibits the photographing of a completed ballot is likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee on Friday granted a preliminary injunction on that section of the law, meaning it cannot be enforced for now. In the same order, he declined to block a number of other provisions that mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The judge’s order came in a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election integrity group, and others. Boulee wrote that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit “have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the broad ban on photographing a voted ballot in both public and nonpublic places violates their First Amendment rights. The new law, known as SB 202, also adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mail ballot, results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta, and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a surge in tourists is leading to increased harassment of sea turtles on a popular North Shore Oahu beach. Hordes of people are crowding turtles at Laniakea Beach Park, known as Turtle Beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said increased patrols are being dispatched to enforce laws against approaching the turtles. “There are packs of 200 people at a time, throughout the day,” said Debbie Herrera, volunteer and education coordinator for turtle conservation group Malama na Honu. The state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement has assigned officers to Laniakea. “Typically, if there’s a uniformed officer standing on the beach, people are not going to break the law in front of them,” said Jason Redulla, division chief. Harassment of turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals led Gov. David Ige to warn that violators will be prosecuted if caught. Tourists at Laniakea Beach tell Malama na Honu they didn’t know touching turtles was illegal, Herrera said. Most follow the rules once informed, but there have been a “very few who refuse, despite dozens of cautionary signs or warnings from volunteers, to give green sea turtles on the beach or in the ocean wide berth,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: One of two U.S. district judges for Idaho announced seven months ago that he’d take senior status in August, but there’s still no official nominee to replace him. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill planned to continue to hear a full caseload when he took senior status Aug. 16, but expected Idaho to have a new district judge to replace him by then – effectively giving the state the third judge it has needed for decades, the Idaho Press reports. “We desperately need the help,” Winmill said. But there’s been no word from the White House about a nominee for the now-open second federal judgeship, though Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials interviewed candidates last winter and submitted an all-female shortlist of four nominees to the Biden administration in March: Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson, and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Traditionally, state senators are given a big say in federal district judge nominees, but that system was jettisoned under the Trump administration. The Senate – where Democrats hold a thin majority – must confirm any nominee by simple majority. It’s unclear what role Idaho’s Republican senators will play in the nomination.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials have dropped a “do not eat” advisory for sport fish in the Illinois River for the first time since the 1970s. The Illinois Department of Public Health relaxed the warning because concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have declined, the Chicago Tribune reports. The toxic contaminants were banned in 1979 but stick around in the environment, prompting the advisory. IDPH issues advisories annually based on fish samples collected from 40 to 50 streams, rivers and inland lakes, as well as from four stations in Lake Michigan. They are geared toward vulnerable populations including pregnant and nursing women, along with children younger than age 15. The department said there is no known immediate health hazard from eating contaminated fish in Illinois. But there are “concerns about the effects of long-term, low-level exposure” to contaminants including PCBs. Guidance also was relaxed for some Lake Michigan fish, including whitefish and rainbow trout. Recommended consumption is now no more than one meal a week. Previous guidance was to limit consumption to once per month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Hoosier Lottery saw record profits in the past year as its ticket sales soared 26% from the year before. That big jump was fueled by 27% growth in scratch-off ticket sales that accounted for nearly 80% of the lottery’s $1.74 billion in revenue during the year period ending June 30, officials told the State Lottery Commission this past week. Lottery administrators had projected a slight drop in sales because of worries about coronavirus-related shutdowns and the possible economic impact. But the boost in revenue will result in the lottery sending a record $375 million in profits to the state – up about $71 million, or 23%, from the year before. That’s even higher than the $368 million profits that lottery officials had projected in May. “These are really extraordinary numbers,” Lottery Commission Chairman William Zielke said. “It certainly reflects the efforts of a lot of people who tried to keep it going (through the pandemic).” The state directs about $235 million of the lottery profits toward reducing auto excise taxes, with $60 million going to pension funds for teachers, police officers and firefighters. The scratch-off tickets sales growth follows the lottery’s long-term strategy to attract more players enticed by the regular release of new instant games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: When state Sen. Joe Bolkcom asked in June how much it would cost to deploy Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Department of Public Safety said expenses wouldn’t be calculated until the mission was completed. The response ignored that the state agency had run its own internal cost estimate a week before the since-completed deployment had even been made public, according to records reviewed by the Des Moines Register. The department recently released more than 2,200 pages of emails in response to a joint records request from the Register and the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced June 24 that troopers would be deployed to the border after Texas asked for help with an influx of migrants. The announcement led legislators and the media to ask questions of the Department of Public Safety and Iowa State Patrol. At the onset, Iowa officials issued scant details about the operations, citing concerns for officer safety. They did not cite that for costs. On June 17, Iowa State Patrol Maj. Robert Hansen sent top department officials an initial cost estimate: $383,700.24 to cover a 16-day deployment of 28 troopers of various ranks. Initial cost estimates after they returned were shy of $300,000, department Commissioner Stephan Bayens said at a July 28 news conference.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: If the Evel Knievel museum moves to Las Vegas, the owner of the museum dedicated to the daredevil has pledged to repay $117,000 it has received from the city of Topeka since it opened in 2017. It was reported earlier this month that the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, may move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Museum owner Mike Patterson told city officials in a meeting last week that he believes it is appropriate to repay the city even though it might not be required in the incentive contract the museum signed. Patterson said private loans were the main source of funding for the roughly $3.5 million museum. But it was also slated to receive up to $300,000 from the city over 12 years if it continued operating in Topeka. The money it received came from the city’s tax on hotel stays. City Council member Spencer Duncan said Topeka will make sure future incentive contracts with businesses include terms that require businesses to repay the incentives they received if they do leave the city.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear has declared this week Healthcare Heroes Appreciation Week in honor of the doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic staff, and others who have helped the Bluegrass State during the COVID-19 pandemic. “They are heroes. They have earned that title,” Beshear said at a press briefing Thursday, urging local businesses and community members to find ways to show gratitude for health care workers. The most important way, he said, is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Let’s make sure that everywhere these health care heroes go, they see how much we care,” the Democratic governor said. Following a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling impacting his executive authority, Beshear on Monday rescinded his executive order requiring masks in schools. The move came a day before a federal judge is scheduled to decide whether to continue a temporary restraining order preventing the mandate from being enforced. Without an order to block, the legal challenge is likely moot. A separate mask mandate for public schools from the Kentucky Department of Education still stands, as does a similar measure for child care centers from the Department of Public Health. Without a mandate in place, private schools across the state are now able to adopt mask-optional policies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 20 government agencies, universities and electric utilities in the state soon will be getting electric vehicle charging stations worth more than $1.7 million. The Department of Environmental Quality is awarding grants to 26 entities for 82 charging stations, using money from the state’s $19.8 million share from a settlement worth nearly $3 billion between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen over violations of the Clean Air Act, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Volkswagen sold about 590,000 vehicles equipped with devices that worked against their air pollution control features, resulting in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide. Almost $12 million of Louisiana’s share of the 2016 settlement was set aside to replace 351 diesel engine buses owned by 16 school boards. The new engines will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Another $7.3 million was given to the state Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Agriculture to replace old diesel equipment and vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s $1,500 bonus to attract new workers back to the workforce this summer during the pandemic hasn’t been successful. Only about 5% of the 7,500 people whom the $10 million program could cover have been declared provisionally eligible, the Bangor Daily News reports. An extended deadline to file applications closed Friday. The bonus for new employees who work at least eight weeks and meet other criteria equates to about two weeks of unemployment pay. It may not have been enough to entice workers to give up benefits or to get overworked employers to handle the extra paperwork that the program entails, said Steve Hewins, executive director of the industry group HospitalityMaine. Maine’s neighbor to the west has had a bit more success. New Hampshire, which stopped the enhanced unemployment benefits in June, drew 700 applicants to its $1,000 return-to-work program in the first four weeks after it started July 19. In contrast, Maine had attracted only 400 applicants since mid-June.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The woeful record of the Baltimore Orioles is combining with the coronavirus pandemic to cost the state millions of dollars in rent payments. The Baltimore Sun reports the Major League Baseball team’s rent payments to the Maryland Stadium Authority have dropped precipitously in the past year due to low attendance and loss of ballpark-generated revenue. The Orioles paid $1.6 million in rent to the Stadium Authority for the use of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the fiscal year ending June 30. The team’s average annual rent of its 30-year lease has been $6.8 million. The rent payments are based on a percentage of ticket sales, concessions, parking and stadium advertising. The team has the worst record in the majors, and attendance is sparse. During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, fans were not allowed in the stadium at all. The rent money is used specifically for the maintenance of the ballpark. Stadium officials say they have curtailed maintenance expenses accordingly. The rent losses are in addition to the loss of admission taxes on ticket sales. The newspaper based its reporting on data obtained under the state’s Public Information Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNatick: A retired flight attendant pushing an airline beverage cart more than 200 miles from Boston to New York City to honor colleagues who died during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is well on his way. Paul Veneto, 62, resumed his 20th anniversary journey Monday after a night at the Verve Hotel in Natick, two days after starting his trek at Logan International Airport and a day after braving drenching rains from the Henri storm system. He plans on pushing the cart – decorated with photos of all the 9/11 airline crews for inspiration and courage – to ground zero by Sept. 10. “I look on top of this cart, I see these crew members’ faces, every time my legs hurt, it’s cold, rainy, they’re smiling back at me, the pain goes away,” Veneto said Saturday before he departed. The walk called Paulie’s Push will benefit the families of his former colleagues as well as Power Forward 25, a nonprofit that assists people dealing with addiction. Veneto himself is in recovery from an opioid dependency caused in part by the attacks. “I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized,” he said Saturday. United Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center’s south tower, was Veneto’s regular run. But he had the day off Sept. 11, 2001. The Braintree resident spent 30 years as a flight attendant for five different airlines.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Bloomfield Township woman who won the grand $2 million prize in the state’s COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes said Monday that she and her husband will save money for their three kids’ college education, remodel their house and donate a portion to improve mental health services. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Christine Duval left her full-time job as a project manager for a language training company in Troy to help her daughter, now 10, with remote learning after her school closed. She and her husband got their first COVID-19 shots in early April and their second ones weeks later. Their 18- and 15-year-old sons also are vaccinated. Winning $2 million “will help us achieve all of our dreams,” Duval said. “We are really lucky and want to give back to those in need. The pandemic was tough on everyone, and we believe the need for providing services that promote positive mental health care is more important than ever.” The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes program was designed to boost the vaccination rate in July. The weekly number of people getting a first shot across the state rose for four straight weeks between July 11 and Aug. 7 before dropping in the past two weeks. About 65% of residents ages 16 and up have received at least one dose, federal data shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Igor Vovkovinskiy, the tallest man in the United States, has died at age 38. His family said the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. His mother, Svetlana Vovkovinska, an ICU nurse at Mayo, initially posted about his death on Facebook. Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic in 1989 as a child seeking treatment. A tumor pressing against his pituitary gland caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the U.S. at 7 feet, 8.33 inches and ended up staying in Rochester. His older brother, Oleh Ladan of Brooklyn Park, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Vovkovinskiy was a celebrity when he arrived from Ukraine because of his size and the flickering Cold War of the late 1980s. But Ladan said Vovkovinskiy “would have rather lived a normal life than be known.” Vovkovinskiy appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and was called out by President Barack Obama during a campaign rally in 2009, when the president noticed him near the stage wearing a T-shirt that read: “World’s Biggest Obama Supporter.” In 2013, he carried the Ukrainian contestant onto the stage to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi Poison Control Center officials say they are receiving an influx of calls from people trying to treat COVID-19 by using anti-parasite medicine purchased at livestock stores. At least 70% of recent calls to the center have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers, Mississippi Department of Health officials said. Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization, though no hospitalizations have been reported. Most callers – 85% – have had mild symptoms, according to the Department of Health. “Patients should be advised to not take any medications intended to treat animals and should be instructed to only take ivermectin as prescribed by their physician,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a memo Friday. “Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans.” Ivermectin tablets are approved for human use at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical formulations for head lice and skin conditions. Ivermectin is not a drug for treating viruses.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Two groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions argued in a petition filed Monday that a man who has spent more than 20 years in prison for killing his mother did not commit the crime. Michael Politte was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2002. He was 14 when his mother, Rita Politte, was burned to death inside their home in Hopewell, eastern Missouri, in 1998. The Midwest Innocence Project and the MacArthur Justice Center argue in the petition filed with the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District that Politte was convicted because of a biased investigation, faulty science and an incompetent defense at trial. Michael Politte and a friend were sleeping when they awoke to smoke early Dec. 5, 1998. Michael told authorities he found his mother’s burning body in her bedroom as he and his friend tried to escape, according to the petition. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The petition alleges fire investigators quickly decided the fire was started with gasoline, and police immediately zeroed in on her son as a suspect, although no blood or other injuries were found on him. Investigators also said he did not show much emotion or remorse in the following days. Law enforcement did not investigate other viable suspects, the attorneys say.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge has ordered the director of the state’s public defender office to appear before him next month to explain why her office is failing to assign public defenders to Billings-area cases in a timely manner and why she shouldn’t be held in contempt of court. District Judge Donald Harris set a Sept. 13 hearing for Rhonda Lindquist, The Billings Gazette reports. The director of the Office of Public Defender is required to ensure that qualified attorneys are immediately assigned after a judge assigns cases to the public defender’s office, according to Harris’ order, which was signed Tuesday. At times, public defenders have a conflict of interest in representing a defendant. When that happens, their case is assigned to the agency’s Conflict Office to hire an outside attorney. The managing attorney for the Conflict Office told Harris that as of July 31, his office had a backlog of 663 unassigned cases. State law requires the Office of Public Defender to immediately assign a lawyer to any case in which a judge designates the office as counsel. Harris said the office has not been able to meet this obligation for months, causing “significant delays in conducting court proceedings and jeopardizes the administration of justice.” The state’s jobs website lists postings for three public defenders and an appellate defender.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state currently appears relatively safe on some national websites tracking the spread of COVID-19, but state health officials say those maps aren’t accurate. The problem is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using different data for Nebraska since the state retired its website that reported coronavirus figures daily and started reporting updates weekly with fewer details. So two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties shouldn’t be colored blue on the CDC map, indicating low COVID-19 transmission rates, at a time when cases are surging statewide, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “The color blue on the map may not be an accurate representation of transmission rates,” said Olga Dack, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has nearly doubled from 374.14 new cases per day Aug. 6 to 727.57 new cases per day Friday. In its most recent update, the state said Wednesday that 2,676 cases had been reported in the previous week – more than 10 times higher than the 253 cases per week the state reported in late June. Dack said the state continues to report county-level virus data to the CDC, but the agency hasn’t been using that for some technical reasons.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Several organizations led by women of color have banded together to shed light on the ways the state’s low-income and diverse communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution. The advocacy groups are creating a website, breathefreenv.com, that aims to raise awareness about climate change and steps that can be taken to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and lower energy costs for families, especially in low-income communities. Erika Washington, executive director of Make It Work Nevada, one of the groups involved in the effort, told the Las Vegas Sun that Black communities have not received as much outreach about climate change or the environment as white communities. “It’s been very white-led for a very long time,” said Washington, who is Black. “You have to include the people who are closest to the issue in order to actually make any sort of change.” Along with Make It Work Nevada, other groups participating include Battle Born Progress, CHISPA, Make the Road Nevada, Mi Familia Vota Nevada, the Faith Organizing Alliance and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund. All seven groups are led by women of color.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Revenue has completed a three-year project aimed at providing a better online experience for taxpayers. The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, launched the first phase of its online user portal and revenue management system in 2019. The final phase of the Granite Tax Connect portal was completed this month, allowing tax preparers and others to file taxes electronically, schedule automated payments, check on the status of refunds, and complete other tasks. Officials said the system could serve about 148,000 taxpayers. The portal also can be used to anonymously report suspected tax fraud.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state joined a small but growing list of places Monday to require COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers and state workers or for them to undergo regular coronavirus testing. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the new mandate during a news conference, saying pre-K-12 teachers and staff and state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or get tested once or twice a week. New Jersey has about 130,000 public school teachers, 1.3 million public school students and an estimated 70,000 state workers. “Scientific data shows that vaccination and testing requirements, coupled with strong masking policies, are the best tools for keeping our schools and communities safe for in-person activities,” Murphy said. The Democratic governor, who’s running for reelection this year, announced the move just as schools across the state prepare to begin the new academic year. The decision follows an announcement earlier this month to require staff, students and visitors to wear masks on school grounds. The state’s biggest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, supported the order, as did the state’s School Nurses Association and the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The ritual burning of a giant, ghostly marionette in the city will be a hybrid event this year. Organizers of the Zozobra burning said they are planning to limit in-person attendance to 10,000 while also broadcasting the event on television and online. The nighttime spectacle that’s been transformed by modern pyrotechnics is in its 97th year. A team of a dozen puppeteers heaves on cords to flex the groaning marionette’s arms, head and jaw. Will Shuster, a painter from Philadelphia who migrated to the Southwest, created Zozobra, a name derived from a Spanish word for “anguish.” Donations from energy companies ensured the event could move forward Sept. 3. It typically happens around Santa Fe’s weeklong community fiestas that include historic and religious processions. Anyone attending in person must prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the event. Face masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe uses the event to raise money for youth charities. Organizers said they’ll tweak the event as needed to comply with federal and state public health orders.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Andrew Cuomo defended his record over a decade as governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a “media frenzy” Monday as he prepared for a midnight power transfer that will make Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul the state’s first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11:59 p.m., just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations. In a prerecorded farewell address released at noon, Cuomo boasted of making government effective in his years in office, cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic and struck a defiant tone on the harassment allegations. He said the report that triggered his resignation – a scathing account of what Attorney General Letitia James said was sexual harassment or inappropriate touching of 11 women – was “designed to be a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work,” Cuomo said. He also touted his “progressive” record and positioned himself as a bulwark against his party’s left-wing faction that he said wants to “defund the police” and “demonize businesses.” He touted New York’s long-awaited passage of same-sex marriage under his administration, as well as gun control legislation and a law setting an eventual statewide $15 minimum wage.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of state residents who have been convicted of felonies but whose current punishments don’t include prison time can register to vote and cast ballots, a judicial panel declared Monday. Several civil rights groups and ex-offenders who sued legislative leaders and state officials in 2019 argue the current 1973 law is unconstitutional by denying the right to vote to people who have completed their active sentences or received no such sentence, such as people on probation. They said the rules disproportionately affect Black residents. In a brief hearing following a trial last week challenging North Carolina’s voting restrictions upon felons, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell said two judges on the three-judge panel have agreed they will issue a formal order soon allowing more felony offenders to vote. The judges are acting before issuing a final ruling from the trial, as voting in October municipal elections begins next month. The law says felons can register to vote again once they complete all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. With Bell’s ruling, felons who only must complete these punishments that have no element of incarceration can register again.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A petroleum company has reported a saltwater spill in northwestern North Dakota to state regulators. The Bismarck Tribune reports Whiting Oil and Gas says the spill occurred Thursday. The company told regulators that a broken fitting in a pipeline system operated by Goodnight Midstream resulted in the spill at a well site 11 miles south of Stanley in Mountrail County. The company said 1,400 barrels containing 58,800 gallons of saltwater spilled but were contained, and most of the fluid has been recovered. Saltwater, also known as brine, can come up along with oil and gas from a well. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division said a state inspector has visited the site and will monitor cleanup efforts.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: More than 120 activists, scholars, pastors, students and average citizens attended the first hearing Monday of a new panel charged with redrawing state legislative districts for the next 10 years, most advocating new maps that are more fair and representative. Witnesses at the first of nine public hearings of the Ohio Redistricting Commission at Cleveland State University maligned the current gerrymandered maps and called the process disheartening, embarrassing, demoralizing and unfair. “My vote doesn’t count,” Daisie Reish, 77, of Grafton, told the panel. “I call my representatives constantly, and they never vote for me. They always vote the opposite.” Person after person – young, old, Black, Muslim, immigrant, and people whose families have lived in the area for generations – told the panel they feel disadvantaged and unheard by their government as a result of the current district maps. Meanwhile, Tom Hach, executive director of Free Ohio Now, complained that all nine of the commission’s hearings will be held at universities, which he said don’t attract a diversity of political participation. He called the process unfair and said commissioners, the majority of whom are Republicans, were being bullied by Democrats. An Associated Press analysis has found Ohio to have some of the nation’s most gerrymandered maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Blocks from where she initiated one of the nation’s first sit-in movements, civil rights icon Clara Luper is now memorialized in the name of the city’s downtown post office. Luper’s descendants, former students and original “sit-inners” joined local dignitaries Saturday for the dedication of the Clara Luper Post Office Building, formerly called the Center City Station. Luper’s daughter, Chelle Luper Wilson, said her mother would want others to take it as a call to action against inequality. “One of the things I know she would say is she never wanted her name to just be a symbolic gesture,” Wilson said. “She was never about symbolism without any action. She was about structural and systemic change. I know she would want people whenever they see her name not to just think, ‘Oh great, what a great woman,’ but hope it sparks them to become passionate about a cause.” Luper, a longtime public school teacher, died in 2011 at age 88. The renaming coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the Oklahoma City sit-in movement. Luper and a group of Black schoolchildren arrived at the whites-only lunch counter of Katz Drug Store on Aug. 19, 1958, and refused to leave until they were served. It was the beginning of a successful six-year campaign to end racial segregation in Oklahoma City establishments.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Opposing rallies that drew hundreds of people sparked clashes Sunday. The two groups had gathered in different parts of the city after a far-right group changed the location of its event. The right-wing rally drew about 100 people in a parking lot of a former Kmart store, and clashes began as it wound down, KOIN-TV reports. A van tried to drive into the parking lot but crashed, and the driver ran away. Demonstrators then began igniting fireworks and similar devices. It was not immediately clear whether anyone suffered serious injuries. Later, shots were fired near demonstrators downtown. Dustin Brandon Ferreira, 37, a left-wing activist, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was with others Sunday evening when a man used a slur against a Black man in the group and then fired multiple rounds in their direction. Portland police said the man was arrested. No one was injured. Demonstrations associated with anti-fascists had earlier drawn more than 200 people downtown. The plans for the opposing demonstrations had prompted Portland police to call in all available police personnel. Sunday’s event fell on the one-year anniversary of a particularly violent political clash in which opposing groups brawled on the street next to police headquarters for hours.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More drivers have been hitting the road as coronavirus restrictions have loosened, and it’s showing in the number of those who have been caught speeding through photo-enforced construction zones. The state has issued more than 220,000 violations in the first seven months of this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Nearly $2.9 million has been collected in fines so far, higher than the $1.7 million remitted in 2020, said Jennifer Kuntch, a spokeswoman for PennDOT. Drivers receive a warning for the first offense, but second and subsequent violations carry a fine. Traffic volumes were down last year because of the pandemic, and that led to fewer violations than what might have been expected, Kuntch said. Meanwhile, the program remains on track to double its speed camera deployments this year. PennDOT is expecting to see a downward trend in violations through the rest of the year, Kuntch said. Based on evaluating Maryland’s trends and in having consistent deployments to the same work zones in Pennsylvania, drivers begin to comply with the speed limits, which leads to fewer violations, she said. In addition, drivers tend to watch their speed after getting their first warning.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are warning residents about a fake form circulating that purports to give the bearer a medical or religious exemption from coronavirus mask requirements. The certificate even includes a Rhode Island Department of Health logo, the agency said in a tweet Sunday. “It was not developed by RIDOH or any official source, should not be filled out, and should not/will not be accepted by any entity, as the form is not legitimate,” the department wrote in the tweet. The agency did not say where the fake certificate originated. The state has recently been restoring mask mandates for some indoor spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. Last week Gov. Daniel McKee issued an executive order requiring masks in K-12 schools for the upcoming school year regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Before the order, McKee had simply recommended masks for schoolchildren, leaving the final decision up to individual school districts. But state officials said more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s new coronavirus cases are among children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccination against the disease.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Prosecutors are now required to share evidence of innocence they find even after a defendant is convicted of a crime. The changes to the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct were announced last week, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina is joining about two dozen other states with the rules, which were first developed by the American Bar Association in 2008. They require a prosecutor to disclose any information when they become aware of “credible, material” evidence that indicates a defendant was wrongfully convicted to the defendant or defense attorney as well as the chief prosecutor where the person was tried. Prosecutors who have “clear and convincing” evidence that a person was wrongfully convicted in their jurisdiction then have an ethical obligation to remedy the conviction, according to the new rules. Prosecutors will have discretion to determine what exactly crosses the threshold of the new rules, said John Freeman, professor emeritus for the University of South Carolina School of Law. The rules also protect a defendant even after exhausting all normal appeals, Freeman said. “What this says, basically, is that so long as there is a possibility of proof surfacing that shows that the guy is innocent, it ain’t over,” he said. “And, frankly, isn’t that the way it should be?”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state is facing a shortage of nurses at a time when they are needed most, officials say. South Dakota News Watch reports that stress, long hours and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused more nurses than usual to leave the field, move to other states or retire early. From 2015 to 2016, about 1,700 registered nurses left South Dakota. Last year, more than 2,500 nurses dropped out of the state workforce. “The pandemic just kind of burned them out,” said Michelle Bruns, a spokeswoman for the nursing program at Oglala Lakota College. “It’s a tough situation.” The state’s higher education system has not produced enough nursing graduates to keep up with a growing population and rising demand for health care services, and educators are scrambling to find ways to lure more students and produce degrees more quickly. Meanwhile, a shortage of nurses in other states has raised competition to attract new graduates and experienced providers, but South Dakota health care systems are at a competitive disadvantage because median pay for nurses in the state is the lowest in the nation, according to federal labor data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The University of Tennessee announced Monday that it will extend its mask mandate to all indoor public spaces due to the ongoing spike in coronavirus cases and increasing hospitalizations. UT had been under a temporary mask mandate that only applied to classrooms, laboratories and indoor academic student events. Officials say the new requirement will extend to all indoor public spaces, but exceptions will include private offices, residence hall rooms and while engaging in fitness activities. According to a news release, the university will “re-evaluate the need for the expanded face-covering requirement by Sept. 7.” “While we are trying to do our part to keep our campuses healthy, we continue to stress the importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” UT System President Randy Boyd said in a statement. As of Monday, Tennessee has seen 13,135 COVID-19-related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. That death count is the 15th highest in the country overall and the 24th highest per capita at 194 deaths per 100,000 people. The state is averaging 2,508.3 current COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to data through Aug. 20 from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Dell Medical School at the University of Texas is beginning a three-year study using video games and virtual reality to try to rewire the brains of teens with epilepsy. It’s taking the concept of neuroplasticity – that brains can create new pathways after an injury – and seeing if brains also can create the new pathways before the injury ever occurs. In this case, the injury is surgery to the affected area of the brain that is causing the epileptic seizures. The study is funded by a $2.5 million grant from the Coleman Fung Foundation. Fung is the founder of software company Open Link Financials Inc., and his Austin-based business venture, Blue Goji, is a wellness technology company that uses treadmills, virtual reality and video gaming to create a fitness experience. Dell Medical School will receive two Infinity treadmill virtual realty game systems from Blue Goji to use in the study. Dr. David Paydarfar, chair of Dell Medical School’s department of neurology and the study’s lead researcher, said that while people have studied neuroplasticity for decades, this study will actually implement the research. Previously, it was like studying rocket science without trying to go to the moon. The study is targeting 15- to 20-year-olds with epilepsy who need to have surgery to stop their seizures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A ban on school districts requiring masks is forcing parents of vulnerable kids to wrestle with the painful choice of whether to risk coronavirus infections at school or keep them at home yet again, according to a lawsuit filed Monday. Parents like Jessica Pyper say a Utah law that blocks districts from passing mandates wrongly prevents children from getting a safe education. She wants her 10-year-old son, Ryker, to join his fifth grade classmates this year, but his Type 1 diabetes puts him at serious risk. “It just sort of seems like nobody cares,” she said. “Kids with disabilities often get left behind. They don’t get considered when these types of decisions are being made.” The case filed by a group of nine parents is the latest U.S. lawsuit of its kind from families and educators concerned about school without masks as the highly contagious delta variant surges. Officials, mostly Republican, contend that there are downsides to kids being masked all day and that parents should have the power to decide whether to put them on children, who tend to be less vulnerable to the virus than older adults. The lawsuit was filed against Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, whose office didn’t immediately respond to messages requesting comment, and Republican Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who declined comment.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development has launched its latest relocation program to get workers to move to Vermont – especially cooks, servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. The reimbursement grants are for up to $7,500 for “eligible expenses” after moving. The online application for the grants requires proof of residency and documentation of eligible expenses. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018, the Legislature created the remote worker grant program, which offered reimbursement grants of up to $10,000 for workers who could relocate to the state and bring their current job with them. The next year, in 2019, the Legislature created the worker relocation grant program, which offered reimbursement grants to move to the state and take a job. The two programs together have awarded more than 300 grants to “newly settled Vermonters” in towns across the state, according to a news release. The worker relocation program is available to those who relocate to Vermont on or after July 1, 2021, and fill one of the qualifying positions with a Vermont employer. Remote worker grants are for those who relocate on or after Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Monday urged all employers to require COVID-19 vaccines for eligible workers, sharpening a policy debate in the governor’s race over how best to deal with the pandemic. McAuliffe’s call followed a decision by federal regulators to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The former governor now seeking a second term has previously urged Virginia health systems and school divisions to issue mandates and required his own campaign staff to be fully inoculated. McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer, in the November general election. Youngkin has consistently urged Virginians to get COVID-19 shots but said he opposes vaccine or mask mandates. At a campaign event last week, the former co-CEO of the Carlyle Group was asked about his approach to managing the pandemic as the delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “First of all, we pray it’s behind us every day,” he said. “My expectation is, this virus is tough. And so first thing that I would ask everybody to do is get the vaccine.” He said in a statement Monday that McAuliffe was trying to “bully” Virginians and businesses into compliance with a step that will “clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again.”\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Authorities say they have found the first Asian giant hornet nest of 2021 in a rural area of the state, about a quarter-mile from where a resident reported seeing one of the hornets earlier this month. The Washington State Department of Agriculture narrowed the search area last week and located the nest east of Blaine, department officials said. Crews found the nest Thursday after they followed a hornet that was equipped with a tracking device, KOMO reports. Crews were able to net and tag three hornets between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. State entomologists will now develop a plan to eradicate the nest, most likely this week. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: An annual festival that celebrates a local legend about a “Mothman” has been called off for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant announced the festival’s cancellation Thursday. It had been set for next month. The organizers said in a statement that thousands of people pack the town along the Ohio River during the festival and that local health officials predict rising COVID-19 cases could peak around that time. “We are disappointed, but it was not an easy decision to make, we can assure you of that,” the statement said. Mothman is a mysterious creature with glowing red eyes that witnesses described seeing in 1966 and 1967. It was the subject of the 2002 film “The Mothman Prophecies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Residents who get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine between Aug. 20 and Labor Day will receive a $100 gift card, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday. The reward being offered just as students return to school is Wisconsin’s latest incentive designed to entice those who have yet to be inoculated to receive the shots. As of Monday, just over 50% of the state’s entire population and 61% of adult residents were fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Many other states have offered similar programs to get more people vaccinated. Recently in Wisconsin, attendees at the state fair who got vaccinated received a free cream puff. More than 600 fairgoers took advantage of that promotion. The $100 Visa gift card will be available to anyone age 12 and up who gets their first shot during the 18-day eligibility window that closes Sept. 6. To receive the gift card, those being vaccinated will need to fill out an application form, available at 100.wisconsin.gov. The cards will be mailed up to six weeks later. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths caused by the more contagious delta variant have spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: The outdoor gear and clothing company Patagonia has stopped providing its merchandise for sale at a Wyoming ski resort to protest the owners’ sponsorship of a Republican fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other top supporters of former President Donald Trump. Well known for decades for its outspoken support of progressive causes and environmentalism, Patagonia in the past has brought unwanted attention to Facebook and Instagram and the Outdoor Retailer shows in Salt Lake City. Now, the company’s activism could spell trouble – among left-leaning skiers, at least – for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. A major tourism destination in Wyoming, the resort known for its bright red gondola car and logo with a silhouetted bucking horse and rider is among the best-known brands from one of the most Republican states. “We join with the local community that is using its voice in protest. We will continue to use our business to advocate for stronger policies to protect our planet, end hate speech and support voting rights and a strong democracy,” Patagonia spokeswoman Corley Kenna said in a statement. The boycott, first reported by WyoFile, means Patagonia merchandise won’t be available in three shops at the resort that Kenna said were Patagonia’s largest account in Jackson Hole.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}]}
