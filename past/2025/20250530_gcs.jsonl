For the latest updates on the plane crash, please read USA TODAY's coverage of the investigation on Saturday, Feb. 1.\n\nWASHINGTON – Search crews recovered 41 bodies from the Potomac River after the collision of a passenger plane and a U.S. Army helicopter killed 67 people in the deadliest aviation disaster in over two decades, officials said.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said in a news briefing Friday evening that the helicopter’s black box has been recovered and appears to be in good condition. NTSB officials had confirmed Thursday that the two black boxes from the airplane were secured. All of the recorders were at NTSB sites for evaluation.\n\nJohn Donnelly, the chief of Washington’s fire department, said 28 of the victims have been positively identified, and officials have spoken with 18 of their families. He said he expects all of the bodies to be recovered, but said he does not know how long the full recovery operation will take.\n\n\"We're working as fast as we can,\" he said at a news conference, adding that he hopes for the arrival of \"better salvage equipment\" on Saturday so crews can remove the passenger plane and helicopter from the water and retrieve the rest of the bodies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Army has identified two of the soldiers aboard the Black Hawk helicopter as Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. The name of the third soldier is being withheld at the request of the family, the Army said.\n\nIn addition to the soldiers, the victims of Wednesday's collision include a pilot who was planning to be married in the fall, a student heading back to college after a funeral, an attorney returning home on her birthday, a Philippine police colonel, a group of teenage figure skaters as well as their parents and coaches, and two Chinese citizens.\n\nFAA restricts helicopter routes near Reagan National Airport\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration on Friday began restricting helicopter traffic around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in the aftermath of the deadly collision.\n\nThe Department of Transportation said the restriction exempts helicopters that need to enter the airspace for “lifesaving medical support, active law enforcement, active air defense, or presidential transport.”\n\nThe restricted area over the Potomac River stretches roughly from the Memorial Bridge to the Wilson Bridge. The Department of Transportation said officials will reassess the restriction after the National Transportation Safety Board has completed its preliminary investigation of Wednesday’s crash.\n\n“This is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s ongoing commitment to safeguarding our nation’s skies and upholding the highest standards of air travel safety,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \"We will continue to support President Trump’s directive to achieve uncompromised aviation safety. The American people deserve full confidence in our aviation system and today’s action is a significant step towards restoring that trust.”\n\nAir space is typically crowded around the Washington area, home to three commercial airports and multiple military bases. The Potomac corridor in particular is busy with airliners and helicopters.\n\nFAA reveals staffing of tower at Reagan National Airport\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said Reagan National Airport currently employs 25 certified professional controllers and three certified professional controllers in training.\n\nThe tower is authorized to have 28 controllers, the agency said.\n\nThose in training \"were previously fully certified at other facilities,\" according to the FAA.\n\nHegseth says it's unknown if helicopter pilots used night-vision goggles\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said investigators were working to determine who was piloting the Black Hawk helicopter at the time of the crash, whether the crew used their night-vision goggles and what, if any, \"confusion was there at the end.”\n\nThe three-person Army crew was on a \"routine\" training that was part of a continuity of government program, said Hegseth in a Friday morning appearance on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\nHegseth said the military conducts such trainings to prepare for a national emergency in which officials would need to be quickly evacuated. He said while it's important to \"rehearse in ways that would reflect a real world scenario\" it is also important that the Army and Department of Defense mitigate risk, \"especially when it's around civilian aircraft.\"\n\nHe said the black box from the helicopter will give them “a sense of internal communications\" leading up to the collision.\n\nWhen will we know what the black boxes say?\n\nFederal investigators recovered black boxes from American Airlines flight 5342 and the Black Hawk helicopter to help determine what caused the midair collision.\n\nThe recorders were sent for evaluation to NTSB labs, where investigators began the delicate work of retrieving what's inside.\n\nA plane’s \"black boxes ,\" designed to be indestructible and usually stored in the aircraft’s tail section, collect information on communications involving pilots in cockpits and how aircraft systems perform in flight, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) .\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration requires large commercial aircraft and some smaller commercial, corporate and private planes to have two black boxes. The first is the cockpit voice recorder, containing conversations between crew members and air traffic control and even engine noises. The second is the flight data recorder, which monitors operating conditions such as altitude, airspeed and heading.NTSB declined to comment about when information it is finding from the recorders will be shared with the public.– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nScene at Washington airport two days after deadly collision\n\nTravelers are making their way through Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport as usual on Friday after the airport shut down in the wake of a deadly collision between a passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter this week.The airport reopened Thursday, but hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. On Friday, there were few signs of the chaos in the aftermath of the deadly collision except the presence of reporters and a few National Transportation Safety Board workers in both terminals.\n\nVice president and airport manager Terrence “Terry” Liercke said at a news briefing Friday afternoon that two of three runways were closed due to the proximity of the crash site where recovery operations were underway. On a typical day, Liercke said the airport operates about 800 flights on a full schedule.\n\nEarlier Friday, a temporary ground stop was issued at Reagan National Airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA said departures were “grounded due to airport volume\" until 8:45 a.m.\n\n– N'Dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nPlane forced to abort landing at DC airport the day before deadly collision\n\nJust one day before the deadly crash, a passenger jet had to abort its initial landing at Reagan National Airport after another military chopper appeared in its flight path, airline officials and radar data confirmed.\n\nFlightAware, a site that tracks flight paths, shows Republic Airways Flight 4514 − bound for the same airport − departed from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut on Thursday at 6:50 p.m. ET. The town is in Hartford County, just under 15 miles north of the state's capital.\n\nUpon its first approach, about 8 p.m. ET, the airplane can be seen on radar diverting from its scheduled course, then turning west, circling around, and landing in a second attempt. The crew \"initiated a go-around at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in response to an onboard alert that a military helicopter was nearby,\" a Federal Aviation Administration told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\n\"Air traffic controllers issued traffic advisories to both aircraft and the military helicopter crew reported they had the Republic aircraft in sight,\" an FAA spokesperson said. \"There was no loss of required separation between the aircraft.\"\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nPresident Donald Trump says helicopter was ‘flying too high’\n\nPresident Donald Trump continued speculating on the cause of the crash on Friday, writing on Truth Social that the helicopter was flying “too high.”\n\n“The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???” he said. As with his remarks on Thursday, he did not provide evidence to support his claims.\n\nThe NTSB has only recently begun an investigation into the cause of the crash. A preliminary report on the incident is expected within 30 days of the collision, officials said.\n\nFederal mortuary, mental health teams deployed after plane-helicopter crash\n\nIn the wake of the collision near Reagan National Airport, a team of federal forensic specialists and medical examiners has been deployed to help local officials as they pull bodies out the Potomac River and work to identify the remains.\n\nAt the request of the NTSB, the Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT) has begun offering services to the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, including the collection of medical records, DNA samples and fingerprints.\n\nDMORT provides medical examiners, pathologists, forensic odontologists, dental assistants, funeral directors and other experts for “technical assistance and personnel to recover and identify the remains of disaster victims,\" the Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said in a statement.\n\nImmediately after the accident the administration deployed tactical medical providers to support emergency responders, along with experts from ASPR’s Disaster Behavioral Health Team. \"The team conducted a rapid behavioral health needs assessment which (DC) officials will use to put resources in place to support the family member’s behavioral health needs,\" ASPR said.\n\nThe agency “is honored to provide the additional hands and expertise that local, state, and federal authorities request during a tragedy like this,” said John Knox, the principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response.\n\nMourning in the 'air capital' of the world\n\nThe devastating plane and helicopter collision has drawn Wichita − known globally as the \"air capital of the world\" − and its aviation roots into the national spotlight.\n\nFor residents of Wichita, where American Eagle flight 5342 departed from, the ramifications of the crash run deep. Many of the city's half million residents are employed by the aviation industry, and those who aren't still feel connected through Wichita's key role in the history of aviation.\n\nDuring the '20s, the city’s 16 manufacturers built more than 120 planes on a weekly basis, according to the city’s visitor’s bureau. Currently, Textron Aviation, which manufactures Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft, is headquartered in Wichita, as is Spirit AeroSystems – the manufacturing arm of Boeing. Spirit AeroSystems and Textron Aviation are two of the city’s largest employers.\n\n\"This is a terrible tragedy that will unite those in Washington, D.C., and Wichita, Kansas, forever,\" Wichita Mayor Lily Wu said during an emotional news conference.\n\n− Alice Mannette\n\nPhilippine National Police official among victims in collision\n\nA Philippine National Police official was aboard the doomed passenger plane, the agency announced Friday.\n\nA spokesperson said in a news briefing that Col. Pergentino Malabed, who served as the chief of the supply management division, was killed in the midair collision.\n\nMalabed was “on official travel at the time of the incident, fulfilling his duty as a dedicated police officer − committed to the service of protecting and securing both the PNP and the nation,” the agency said in a statement.\n\n“His untimely passing is a profound loss to the PNP, where he served with honor, integrity, and dedication throughout his career,” the Philippine National Police said. “We extend our deepest condolences to his bereaved family, loved ones, and colleagues. The PNP is committed to providing them with all necessary support during this difficult time.”\n\nDonald Trump's comments on deadly plane-helicopter crash\n\nSpeaking from the White House, Trump on Thursday speculated on the cause of the crash, questioning the position of the helicopter and blaming the tragedy on his two Democratic predecessors and their emphasis on diversity in hiring, which he claimed had lowered standards for air traffic controllers.\n\n\"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website,\" he said without proving evidence backing up his claims that Biden- and Obama-era hiring practices and diversity initiatives are to blame for the crash or that race/ethnicity, gender or ability was related or responsible.\n\nThe president also said the helicopter crew \"should have seen where they were going\" and asked, \"What was the helicopter doing in that track?\"\n\n\"You had a pilot problem from the standpoint of the helicopter because it was, it was a very clear night,\" Trump said. An official cause of the crash has not been identified.\n\n− Michael Collins, Bart Jansen, Joey Garrison and Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nAir traffic control staffing under scrutiny\n\nThe staffing at Reagan National Airport at the time of the collision is drawing intense scrutiny after multiple news outlets reported a single air traffic controller was responsible for directing helicopters and commercial airliners. The New York Times and NBC News reported that an FAA report that said those tasks are typically split between two staffers.\n\nReagan National Airport is home to the busiest runway in the country. And in recent years, shortages of air traffic controllers, near collisions and the addition of more direct flights at the airport has fueled safety concerns.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, the FAA referred questions to the NTSB, which is leading the investigation. \"We cannot comment on any aspect of open investigations,\" the FAA said in an email. \"The FAA will quickly take any actions necessary based on evidence from the investigation.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/01/aviation-lawsuit-experts-say-trump-duffy-comments-will-impact-claims/78091407007/", "title": "Aviation lawsuit experts say Trump, Duffy comments will impact claims", "text": "Families of the victims in Wednesday’s catastrophic airline collision are in the early stages of filing claims against the government, and their case could receive a boost from high profile comments made by President Trump and members of his cabinet admitting fault.\n\nLawyers from the nation’s top aviation disaster firm say they’ve already been contacted by some families exploring lawsuits after the disaster near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday that killed 67 people. The firm secured settlements for families of victims in the nation's last major air disaster, the 2009 crash of a Continental Airlines flight in Buffalo that killed 50 people.\n\nPublic comments by Trump, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth could make their cases stronger if families of victims in this week's crash move forward, according to partners with New York-based Kreindler & Kreindler.\n\n“Duffy basically says: We’re not going to run away from it, we’ll own it, and the president has made statements about the Army helicopter pilot who messed up,” said Justin Green a partner at the firm. “It’ll be interesting to see how the government and this administration handles any efforts to resolve this case. It’s within their power to direct claims be paid swiftly.”\n\nThe apparent acceptance of responsibility is a departure from past lawsuits, where government agencies are ultra-cautious about liability and assigning blame, Green said. The transcripts and social media posts are already “part of the fabric of the case,” and could be introduced as evidence, he said.\n\nIt wouldn’t be new territory for Trump, whose tweets in 2017 were notably used by the 9th Circuit of Appeals to block the travel ban imposed on majority Muslim countries. Earlier this week, a federal judge cited tweets made by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when he issued a restraining order against a pause in federal grants and loans.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said the Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Eagle regional passenger jet was to blame for the accident, flying too high. Helicopters flying near Reagan are capped at 200 feet to avoid aircraft.\n\n“It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n\nAt the White House Thursday, Hegseth appeared to say the Defense Department would take responsibility for the crash, “no excuses, we’re going to get to the bottom of this… it never should have happened.”\n\n“Tragically, last night, a mistake was made… and there was some sort of an elevation issue we’re investigating at the DOD and Army level,” Hegseth said.\n\nRepresentatives from the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nLawsuits could target FAA, DOD, American\n\nThe aviation disaster firm Kreindler also represents victims in the Baltimore Key Bridge collapse and Boeing 737 MAX lawsuits from the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which killed 157 people in 2019.\n\nGreen said the families “have full legal rights and almost certainly will make recoveries in settlements or at trial” against the Federal Aviation Administration for alleged negligence by air traffic controllers and the Department of Defense for any negligence by pilots of the helicopter.\n\n“The two areas that are most ripe for potential accidents in our aviation safety system are the training and qualifications of the flight crew, which was the focus in Buffalo, and now, air traffic control similarly being undermanned and overcast,” said Dan Rose, another Kreindler partner. “Everybody knew for two decades a ground incursion or midair collision was the most likely soft spot and nothing was done. I expect changes will be made as a result.”\n\nTo seek damages from the federal government, litigants must file a notice of claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Then they’d have to wait to see if the government declines the claim, or wait six months to file the official lawsuit. It would then be decided by a judge, rather than a jury.\n\n“It’s premature, but we know each family has very substantial claims, the law looks at the economic damages as in the loss for the survivors and their support, the mortgage can’t get paid and kids can’t go to college,” Green said. “Then more importantly, the non-economic side: The emotional harm, and the suffering of their survivors. Each case is litigated individually.”\n\nAttorneys will also examine options to sue American Airlines and its subsidiary PSA Airlines if they identify any suspected negligence by their pilots. And they’ll probe the onboard traffic alerting equipment to ensure they were functional and up to design standards.\n\nD.C. lawsuits won't wait for NTSB conclusions\n\nInvestigators for the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday their preliminary investigation into the crash will take a month and a final report would not be complete for a year or more.\n\nBut that won’t stop civil litigation either against American Airlines and its subsidiaries or the federal government.\n\nAttorneys will instead rely on publicly available flight recorder data, media reports and likely hire their own forensic researchers to build a case.\n\nFinal NTSB \"probable cause\" conclusions generally aren't admissible in court, but the facts the board gathers to come to those conclusions are admissible, said Jason Matzus of Matzus Law in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe’s handling a lawsuit stemming from the collapse of Pittsburgh's Fern Hollow Bridge in 2022, which injured 10. He successfully introduced facts from an NTSB investigation into his lawsuit last year.\n\nAnother vital piece of the lawsuits will be calculating damages, for which Matzus said firms will rely on forensic economists.\n\n“Were they a stay-at-home parent or the primary breadwinner?” Matzus said. “Parents will also be able to make claims for their children and estimate their earnings over their life based on the parents’ educational background and earning history.”\n\nBut the non-economic damages in the plane crash are more important, Matzus said.\n\n“Claims will be significant. It’s premature, but conservatively speaking these will be multimillion dollar claims each,” he said. “And the life cycle of a case in this type of situation is several years.”\n\nNick Penzenstadler is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Then, when a passenger from the ship was diagnosed with coronavirus on her journey home\n\nAs a result, hundreds of passengers and crew members, now docked in Cambodia, are finding themselves in limbo once again.\n\nElly Chybowski, who was traveling aboard the Westerdam with her husband, Timothy, shared positive, if anxious updates from the Sokha Hotel in Phnom Penh, the capitol of Cambodia.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning in Cambodia, guests were updated twice a day by Holland America staff, at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., Chybowski wrote in an email to USA TODAY. She said US Embassy staff were also in the hotel lobby posting updates and assisting with procuring medicine.\n\n\"Today they had posted that several more countries will not let us fly through,\" Chybowski said. When passengers gain flight arrangements, she said, they will be provided with a letter bearing their test results.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nChybowski noted that all passengers at the hotel have been tested for coronavirus, and \"so far all negative.\" With passengers anxious to get home, \"we have been told not to leave the hotel in case we are assigned a flight. At the meeting this morning 15 people were given flights home today,\" she said.\n\nOverall, \"our needs are being met. Very comfortable accommodations. The staff are wonderful,\" said Chybowski, noting that Holland America is providing guests with $50 stipends per person per day (breakfast is included with the hotel stay).\n\nKeeping her afloat? \"Video conferencing (with) our children & grandchildren daily,\" she wrote. \"On the ship we used workout facilities daily. Here in the hotel, we need to be ready to leave at any minute, so will do what I can in my room!\"\n\nBut perspectives varied.\n\n\"Everything is a mess right now,\" Steve Muth, a passenger from Michigan who was traveling on the Westerdam with his family, told USA TODAY Sunday morning. Muth, who is also at the Sokha Hotel, said he and other guests were advised to stay in their rooms and wait for updates.\n\nMore than 24 hours later on Monday, things hadn't changed much. \"(It's) just a lot of confusion, chaos, frustration.\"\n\nMuth is staying with his wife, his daughter and their daughter's boyfriend in Phnom Penh. They have two sons at home in Michigan, as well.\n\nMuth and his family had been in a position to fly home, having heard from Holland America that there were plane tickets ready for them, when news broke that an American passenger tested positive for coronavirus. Then, everything came to a halt.\n\nAccording to Holland America Line, an 83-year-old American woman who departed from Westerdam on Friday later reported feeling ill at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and tested positive for coronavirus. The passenger is in stable condition at a hospital in Malaysia, according to a release from the cruise line shared with USA TODAY by Buck Banks on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, not all of the passengers are so lucky to have been moved to land. Lorraine Oliveira, a passenger traveling from the U.K. on Westerdam with her family, told USA TODAY on Sunday that they were still on board the Westerdam. As of Monday she expected to remain there for maybe two more days. \"I just want to go home now,\" she said in a message.\n\nOliveira said that while they aren't being technically \"quarantined,\" all passengers have been advised to stay on board for \"ease of communication.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, Holland America said that 255 passengers and 747 crew members remain on the MS Westerdam, which docked in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, Friday. The ship was previously turned away from ports in the Philippines, Japan, Guam and Thailand despite no cases of coronavirus cases during the voyage.\n\n\"We are all concerned about the staff & passengers still on the Westerdam,\" said Chybowski.\n\nOn a briefing call Monday afternoon, Dr. William Walters, the director of operational medicine at the U.S. State Department, told reporters that 260 American citizens remain in hotels in Cambodia pending onward travel, and 92 more are on board the MS Westerdam. Around 300 Americans left Cambodia after testing under their ministry of health.\n\nIn a statement provided by spokesman Buck Banks, the cruise line said that Cambodian health officials were on the ship Monday to test those still on board, a process expected to last several more days.\n\n\"Guests at a hotel in Phnom Penh have all completed the COVID-19 screening,\" the cruise line stated Monday morning. \"Results are being returned when completed, with the first batch of 406 all being negative. Cleared guests may travel home, and arrangements are being made for those guests. Guests in both locations are being very well cared for, including assisting with any medications needed.\"\n\nMuth has no complaints about Holland America and how they have handled the situation, but he is concerned with the U.S. government's response – and the veracity of the information that has been shared with those who are stuck overseas.\n\n\"Holland America has been pretty darn good; it’s the State Department that has been the problem,\" he said. \"Their information is not consistent, it’s inaccurate.\"\n\nAs of Monday, there hadn't been an ambassador available at the hotel in three days, Muth said, and when he had the chance to ask questions of representatives, he received what he calls an \"angered defensive response\" without meaningful information.\n\nIt seems some people who were on MS Westerdam have been able to get out, Muth said, while others are being turned away from the airport. \"(There) appears to be a no-fly list for people from the Westerdam,\" he said. \"But they can't explain why.\"\n\nAnd what if they finally make it back to the States and are locked into quarantine for two weeks? \"Holy cow another two weeks of this ... not fun,\" he said. \"We don’t know for sure. No one is saying that is going to happen, but (the idea is) hanging out there.\"\n\nWhen you travel, you want to know that your government has your back in case of a situation like this, Muth said.\n\n\"How our government hasn’t behaved well will stick with me,\" said Muth. \"The State Department doesn’t have its act together at all and nobody seems to care.\"\n\nIn a subsequent interview on Wednesday, Muth said that he met with Michael Newbill, Deputy Chief of Mission, from the U.S. Embassy who had heard about his comments.\n\n\"He was aware of my negative comments.

I believe they are F-18 Hornets. What the heck are they doing in Asheville?\n\nMy answer: I suspect Congressman Madison Cawthorn is now calling in air strikes on libs.\n\nReal answer: As I live not far from AVL, I actually noticed these two jets in the air that day. It's an impressive sight, but it's also more common than you think.\n\n\"AVL often sees military flights occurring, most often as part of military flight training operations,\" Asheville Regional Airport spokeswoman Tina Kinsey said via email. \"Through September of this year, AVL has recorded nearly 3,000 military flight operations – takeoffs and landings – at the airport.\"\n\nKinsey did not have specific information on what unit these jets are attached to or where they fly out of.\n\nAfter Googling photos of F-18s, I'm going to agree with the reader that's what these jets were, although I'm open to correction from you good readers with more expertise.\n\nNavy.mil states, \"F/A-18 Hornet became the nation’s first all-weather fighter and attack aircraft, and was designed for traditional strike applications such as interdiction and close air support without compromising its fighter capabilities. The F/A-18 A-D is employed in Marine Corps fighter attack squadrons, U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Reserve squadrons, the Navy Flight Demonstration Team (Blue Angles), and various other fleet support roles.\"\n\nNavy.mil states the Hornet \"remains the workhorse of Marine Corps tactical aviation, and supports operational deployments around the globe. It will serve as the Marine Corps’ primary bridging platform to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter until its planned sundown in 2030.\"\n\nFrom previous Answer Man columns about military jets, I know the military utilizes AVL and our mountainous environs for training because, well, mountains. It's hard to get mountain flying experience in the flatlands, you know.\n\nQuestion: My wife recently took a flight out of Asheville Regional, and they had to sit on the tarmac for about an hour waiting for a de-icing truck. Someone on the flight said something about a staffing shortage. Is AVL having the same problem most businesses are right now: having trouble finding enough workers? If they are, how many airport positions are open? And how many people work directly for the airport? Are most of the service-type workers out there contract employees with individual companies? If so, how many companies contract to provide services at the airport?\n\nMy answer: This is why I do all my commercial flying on F-18 Hornet fighter jets. Sure, it's uncomfortable being strapped underneath the plane like a bomb and then dropped on your destination, but man you get places fast.\n\nReal answer: I went back to airport spokeswoman Tina Kinsey for this one.\n\n\"There are many reasons that a deicing truck would take some time to arrive at a waiting plane, and we cannot comment about this specific incident without knowing full details,\" Kinsey said via email. \"However, we can generally state that the staffing shortages that are affecting so many businesses in our country are also impacting the airport and aviation industry to varying degrees.\"\n\nThe Greater Asheville Regional Airport Authority, which operates the airport facility, has 70 positions, 12 of which are open, Kinsey said.\n\n\"Typically, we have three to six open positions,\" Kinsey said. \"Recruiting new employees has been challenging during the past year.\"\n\nThe airport does not manage operations or personnel for businesses that operate at the airport, such as airlines or vendors.\n\n\"Businesses that operate at the airport include five airlines, four ground handling companies; a food, beverage and retail concessionaire, three rental car companies (representing eight brands), a parking operator, a Fixed Based Operator, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration – for a total of 17 tenant organizations.\"\n\nThis is the opinion of John Boyle.

Late so often, you can check your watch and count on a late arrival? They’re in Michigan.\n\nAcross the country, Amtrak trains last year were on-time only 60% to 70% of the time in many states, although on-time performance rose to more than 90% in the nation’s northeast corridor, from Washington, D.C., to New York City.\n\nIn Michigan, the on-time rate was only 43%. And on the troubled route from Chicago to Detroit to Pontiac — the state’s busiest Amtrak route — on-time performance was a pitiful 33%.

Officials with the nation’s passenger-rail system say that, if enough Americans contact their Congress members — and Amtrak’s web site explains how to do that — that speedy passenger trains could regain the historic priority they once wielded over creeping freight trains, when both vie to use the same tracks.\n\nBut until lawmakers restore to Amtrak what the railroad industry calls “track preference,” passengers must take their chances with trains that are routinely late, and sometimes very late.\n\nThe Free Press in recent months met six Amtrak trains as they arrived in Troy. Invariably, the service from Chicago was behind schedule — from 30 minutes to more than two hours. Surprisingly, most Amtrak passengers who spoke to the Free Press insisted that, even after enduring long delays, they still liked train travel and still valued Amtrak — in sharp contrast to the stereo-typically irate and sometimes furious airplane passenger who deplanes late at Metro Airport.\n\nStill, late train travelers didn’t hesitate to say they were annoyed and sometimes, well, starving. On New Year’s Eve, for example, when light snow put a cheery shine around the station in Troy, family members awaiting the train weren’t feeling the glow.\n\nParked in her SUV outside Amtrak’s Troy train station, Julie Kelley of Macomb Township took one discouraging cell-phone update after another from her husband as he returned from a weekend in Chicago with their 11-year-old son.\n\n“I’ve got them pizzas in the car because they haven’t eaten in six hours,” Kelley said.\n\nThe train, nicknamed the Wolverine because it passes through the university town of Ann Arbor, had stopped, waited, then resumed speed — again and again, in the miles outside Chicago and in northern Indiana, as it often does. Arriving in the Motor City about 90 minutes late, the passengers for Oakland County were forced to sit at Detroit’s station for yet another half an hour, finally arriving in Troy more than two hours late — just in time for cold pizza in the car.\n\nAmtrak’s popular service from Chicago to Detroit ends in Oakland County. It’s final three stops are Royal Oak, Troy and Pontiac. Day after day, night after night, Amtrak trains on the route fill with college students, business travelers, tourists, and travelers averse to airplanes or Chicago’s choked freeways. They arrive safely but often after long delays.\n\n100 bucks and a kiss\n\nOn another night last year when a reporter stopped by the station even later, the train from Chicago due in Troy at 12:25 a.m. showed up after 2 a.m. That was the end of three long and harried days for Ginni Chapel of Benicia, California.\n\nChapel, a fearful flyer, had arrived late at the station in Chicago and feared missing her connection to the Wolverine, she said, so she collared a baggage handler.\n\n“I said I’ll give you a hundred dollars if you get me on that train, so he ran about 50 m.p.h. and got my luggage, and he did it. I gave him 100 dollars and a kiss because I had to be on that train,” she said.\n\nAmtrak’s “on-time” performance record is even worse than it looks. In air travel, a plane is considered “late” by the U.S. Department of Transportation if it arrives 15 minutes or more after its scheduled time. Amtrak stretches that to 29 minutes. Yet, even with that half-hour grace period, the nation’s passenger-rail system has had trains arrive later and later over the last decade. That trend coincides with the swelling number and length of freight trains.\n\nBecause the freight railroads own 97% of the tracks that cross the U.S., Amtrak must rely on the freight dispatchers to decide when to let passenger trains through. Increasingly, despite a federal rule that gives passenger trains “preference,” Amtrak’s trains are being forced to wait unfairly, according to Amtrak officials.\n\nThe problem of late train arrivals has gotten so bad that Amtrak dramatically changed its public stance, after years of glossing over train tardiness. These days, Amtrak’s website explains in detail the dilemma of seeing freight trains given “preference” over trains with passengers. Amtrak even has a YouTube video highlighting what’s going on, and asking the public to alert their lawmakers in Washington.\n\nThe video, titled “Your Right to be On Time,” says that more than 32 million people a year take Amtrak trains, yet “sometimes that ride is delayed and it’s time you knew why.” It goes on to blame occasional delays on weather, track maintenance, mechanical problems with trains and obstructions on the track, then points a finger at the main culprits.\n\n“Usually, it’s what we call freight train interference. That’s when our trains are delayed by slow freight trains ahead of them.”\n\nAlthough federal law gives passenger trains priority, even when they’re rolling on tracks owned by a freight railroad, “it doesn’t always work out that way,” the video says. It continues: “The law is on the books but the freights often ignore it. Congress can fix that. Tell your member of Congress. . . to support legislation that puts people before freight.”\n\nNow is a timely moment for Amtrak fans to register their wishes, Amtrak officials say. This spring, Congress is scheduled to renew Amtrak’s five-year funding measure, and that’s when the passenger system's executives hope to get the legal leverage to better deal with freight railroads, says Marc Magliari, spokesman for Amtrak in the Midwest.\n\n“It’s a very important issue to us because our reliability is suffering,” Magliari said.\n\nWorse in Michigan\n\nMichigan’s delays are among the worst, with average on-time performance for all Michigan trains dropping from 71% in 2016 and 2017, then sliding to 62% in 2018, and finishing at just 43% in 2019.\n\nThose “on time” percentages are even worse than they appear. In Amtrak's world, any train in the Midwest that's as much as 29 minutes late is still considered “on time.” That means that when passengers from Chicago arrive up to 29 minutes late in Detroit, Royal Oak, or Troy — a common occurrence — Amtrak still logs them as being on time. What Amtrak passengers have grown to accept are trains often an hour or more late.\n\nDespite that, many Amtrak passengers said they enjoy train travel so much and despise traffic congestion, particularly in the Chicago area, that they would continue riding on Amtrak, hoping that delays will diminish. And right now, Amtrak said it needs boosters like that when it approaches Congress.\n\n“You can be certain we’ll tell Congress that the original law setting up Amtrak in 1970 does not allow us to bring litigation over the poor handling of our trains by the freight railroads. Imagine paying for a service from someone who knows you can’t go after them in court,\" Magliari said.\n\nOne reason that delays are swelling is that so are freight trains. Locomotive technology and labor rules have evolved to create colossal, slow-moving freight trains well over a mile long — far too long to be diverted to sidings to allow fast Amtrak trains to pass. Instead, Amtrak’s shorter trains get dispatched to short, antiquated sidings by the freight dispatchers, and then are forced to wait while freight trains crawl past, Magliari said.\n\nA dream of bullets\n\nSuch delays are a far cry from the hopes for speedy service that Amtrak has promoted, as it sought funding from federal and state governments with the goal of catching up to the ever-speedier trains in other countries. So-called bullet trains reach 200 m.p.h. or more in China, Europe and Japan.\n\nIn Michigan, the modest dream is 110 m.p.h. on a stretch of track from just west of Dearborn to Kalamazoo, which the state of Michigan purchased from Norfolk Southern with the aim of upgrading it. That means Amtrak controls its destiny on that stretch and should not suffer big delays. Yet, gaps in its ownership dot the rest of the route between Pontiac and Chicago, with sections owned by Conrail, Canadian National Railway and Norfolk Southern. That gives freight dispatchers more than ample opportunity to make Michiganders late to business appointments in Chicago, and to make college students late when returning to homes in metro Detroit.\n\nShelby Wilson was among those riding the eastbound Wolverine train on the New Year’s Eve. Wilson, a computer science student at the University of Michigan, said she regularly rides the train to and from her home in Birmingham.\n\n“I’m used to it being late — it’s not unusual to be 45 minutes late,” but the two-hour delay was unusual, she said, adding: “As you probably know, freight trains are really slow. They take 10 minutes to pass.”\n\nAccording to Amtrak's online data, through the month of January that same afternoon train from Chicago — the #352 Wolverine — arrived in Troy an average of 42 minutes late. Six times it was more than an hour late, and once in mid-January it was two hours behind schedule.\n\nLike Wilson, many Amtrak riders forgive the delays and mostly rave about riding the rails — from gushing travel writers to car-free college students to Americans averse to flying to tour agencies that specialize in Amtrak travel — like East Lansing-based www.americabyrail.com.\n\nTracks and taxes\n\nThe freight railroads, represented by a large trade group called the AAR — the Association of American Railroads — say one answer would be for the federal government to put money into new tracks and into longer sidings where modern, extended-length freight trains could park as Amtrak passes.\n\n“It would be nice to see the public coming forward” — that is, with federal and state dollars — “where they have an interest in keeping passengers trains operating,” said John Gray, senior vice president for policy and economics for the freight railroad group in Washington.\n\nMost of the support for giving more funding to Amtrak has focused on providing more operating money and more cash for better locomotives and train cars. Last year, with Amtrak boasting of an all-time record volume of 32.5 million passenger trips, the system also logged an operating loss of $30 million, the smallest loss in the system’s 49-year history. There is talk that Amtrak could break even next year, although it would still require large subsidies of taxpayer dollars.\n\nHistorically, however, Uncle Sam has rarely paid for railroad tracks — not after granting the early railroad companies huge amounts of free land as they were getting started, letting them sell off chunks to raise cash for building their tracks. The historic deal in the 1800s was, \"We’ll give you this now but the rest is up to you.\"\n\nPart of that deal was the expectation that railroads would operate passenger trains. Then, as interstate highways helped the trucking industry mushroom in the 1960s, railroads looked like they’d disappear. In 1970, the federal government created Amtrak amid the bankruptcy of giant Penn Central, whose riverfront rail yards once occupied the site that now is Detroit’s Renaissance Center. By then, the remaining railroads petitioned Congress to be relieved of their legal obligation to carry passengers. That’s when the railroads cut a new deal, promising to let Amtrak use their tracks, and promising to give its trains “preference” — a term that, although written into federal law, has for years been debated and litigated.\n\nSince its founding, Amtrak has largely maintained the same routes it had back then, while freight railroads have doubled and tripled their volume of trains and cargoes, Gray said. The volume is particularly heavy, and has been for more than half a century, in and around Chicago — one of the reasons that Michigan’s passengers are so often late, whether going to or from Chicago.\n\nA truism that railroad insiders like to cite is that you can run a train, either freight or passenger, in less time from the West Coast to Chicago than you can get it across Chicago. To ease the Windy City's innumerable choke points, there is “lots of investment going on there in new track,\" but freight volumes keep rising with it, Gray said.\n\nMichigan's rail tale\n\nThe last 40 miles of Amtrak’s route from Michigan into Chicago, nicknamed “south of the lake,” are the chronic but not the only reason that Amtrak’s trains to Michigan are so often delayed, according to the Michigan Department of Transportation. In contrast, 135 miles of the route is owned by MDOT — purchased largely with federal grants — and on that stretch, roughly between Kalamazoo and Dearborn, Amtrak enjoys improved track and unimpeded travel, MDOT spokesman Mike Frezell said.\n\n“We’re hoping within two years to have speeds up to 110 m.p.h. on portions of that, and we’ll be raising all the speeds through that section,” Frezell said. The goal is to make Amtrak’s service between Chicago and Detroit increasingly competitive with driving and flying, he said.\n\nElsewhere, inevitable hang-ups occur on the route from Chicago to Pontiac. Amtrak is at the mercy of dispatchers working for freight systems. On its website, Amtrak grades the freights with its Host Railroad Report Card, showing the frequency that various freight lines “interfere” with Amtrak’s trains.\n\nMeanwhile, the freight systems get busier by the week. They've made a remarkable come-back in the last three decades, becoming darlings of Wall Street, as they took back their old identities as depots of cash, so much so that billionaire Warren Buffet owns one of the biggest — Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\n\nThis spring, Congress will take up the latest five-year renewal of Amtrak’s funding, part of Uncle Sam’s massive Surface Transportation Reauthorization, said Sean Jeans-Gail, spokesman for a nonprofit group that advocates in Washington,, on behalf of rail passengers.\n\n“Most of this will be about highways, but Amtrak is a piece of that puzzle,” said Jeans-Gail, vice president for policy and government affairs with the Rail Passengers Association.\n\n“They’re going to need to do something to address preference,” he said. “We want to tell our members who are missing events, missing connections, can’t use Amtrak to get to business meetings on time, you need to speak up and get heard with your member of Congress.\".\n\n“People can go to www.RailPassengers.org to find out how you can support the Rail Passenger Fairness Act,” he said.\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, said Peters has met recently with Amtrak's CEO about late trains. Peters, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said in a statement to the Free Press: \"It’s clear that the system has not been working for passengers and changes are needed.”\n\nAmtrak’s website says the system’s engineers are ready to unleash faster trains with new locomotives. But for now, Amtrak would be happy simply to reverse its worsening slide in on-time performance. To do that, it needs a mandate from passengers, the general public and Congress, Amtrak’s Magliari said.\n\n\"We don’t have to be going 110 m.p.h. to give you a much better experience than driving,” he said, in a telephone interview he gave while riding from Chicago to St. Louis last month.\n\n“All we have to be is reliable, with attractive fares and schedules that make sense. It’s within reach,” he said.\n\nYes, but only if Amtrak gets a clear signal from Uncle Sam to run its trains on time.\n\nContact: blaitner@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/03/18/coronavirus-timeline-first-case-michigan-first-death/5069676002/", "title": "Coronavirus timeline: From the first case to Michigan's first death", "text": "In just a few weeks, the all-too-familiar coronavirus outbreak, which is causing the deadly COVID-19 illness and wrecking the world's economy, is quickly spreading across America — and now Michigan.\n\nHere's a timeline of how the pandemic has unfolded:\n\nMonday: Harris English tests positive for COVID-19 ahead of Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit.\n\nSunday: Michigan health officials urge caution as the state opens and coronavirus cases rise.

Other ships that have no reported cases are finding some countries closing access to ports out of fear they may harbor undiagnosed cases aboard.\n\nAs of Monday night, 97% of Cruise Line International Association member lines had announced a partial or full suspension of operations worldwide. However, many ships that were at sea at the time of the announcement are still trying to get back to shore.\n\nThose members are now focused on getting passengers home, Bari Golin-Blaugrund, senior director of strategic communications for CLIA, told USA TODAY\n\n\"This is a fluid situation, and restrictions on air travel as well as port closures has created logistical challenges that the industry is working through,\" Golin-Blaugrund said. \"The United States government has provided assurances that U.S. ports will remain open to returning cruise ships and allow for the disembarkation of passengers and crew, regardless of citizenship, so that they may return to their homes both in the U.S. and abroad.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHere's the latest on some of those ships:\n\nBraemar\n\nThe saga of Fred. Olsen Cruises' Braemar, which has been turned away from the Dominican Republic and Bahamas and is now anchored off the coast of Havana, Cuba, appears to be headed toward resolution.\n\nThree chartered British Airways flights will depart Havana's Jose Marti Airport on Wednesday evening and arrive at London's Heathrow Airport the following morning, local time, the company said Wednesday. Most of the 682 passengers aboard the Braemar are British citizens.\n\nPassengers who are in isolation with flu-like symptoms, including two who tested positive for the coronavirus, will be taken back to the United Kingdom on a separate flight, along with their companions, the company said. They will be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon return.\n\nAny passengers who are not well enough to fly will receive medical treatment in Cuba, the company said.\n\n\"We have been working closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to arrange flights and onward travel. All guests who are deemed fit to travel will be flown back to the U.K., with flights to depart from Cuba from Wednesday evening local time,\" the line said in a release provided by spokesperson Ellis Barker.\n\nOnce the evacuation flights arrive, the Braemar will dock at the port of Havana for disembarkation.\n\nAccording to Fred. Olsen, 55 people (28 guests and 27 crew members) are in isolation after showing flu-like symptoms. That count includes an onboard doctor and five people who tested positive for coronavirus at the Braemar's last port of call, Willemstad, Curaçao, on March 10. Anyone not well enough to fly will receive medical attention in Cuba.\n\nPrior to its arrival in Cuban waters, the Bahamian government provided humanitarian assistance over the weekend but wouldn't let passengers set foot in any of the island nation's ports. At that point, one passenger and four crew members had tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nCelebrity Summit\n\nThe Celebrity Summit was sailing toward Port Everglades Tuesday to conclude its itinerary and help passengers arrange travel home.\n\nAlong with other ships, it was turned away following the \"arbitrary\" closing of the port in San Juan, Puerto Rico over the weekend, Celebrity Cruises said in a statement on its site.\n\nThe line says there were \"no issues of medical concern\" for anyone aboard, but the ship was still turned away despite having clearances from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Coast Guard.\n\nCelebrity Eclipse\n\nCelebrity said Sunday it was scrambling to try to bring passengers home from the Celebrity Eclipse after the port in San Antonio, Chile, closed to all cruise ships.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, Chilean authorities gave the ship permission to refuel and restock in Valparaiso, according to an update issued by Celebrity Cruises. After it does, the Eclipse will sail to San Diego, where it is scheduled to arrive later this month.\n\nSilver Shadow\n\nTwo passengers aboard the Silver Shadow were \"medically disembarked\" in Recife, Brazil, said Silversea's parent company, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. One tested positive for COVID-19 while the other tested negative.\n\nSilver Explorer\n\nSeveral passengers aboard the Silver Explorer, another Silversea ship, have been medically disembarked in Tortel and Castro, Chile, and have since tested positive for COVID-19, Royal Caribbean said.\n\nGrand Princess\n\nPrincess Cruises, which is owned by Carnival Cruise Line, confirmed in a release overnight Tuesday that more than half of its 1,113 crew members had left the Grand Princess.\n\nAfter the cruise line completed the disembarkation of all passengers, the ship moved from Oakland, California, across to the bay to San Francisco. The crew members are gradually being allowed to leave the ship as they finish their quarantine periods.\n\nNearly 2,000 American passengers from the Grand Princess have been sent to four military bases around the country, including Travis Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Miramar in California, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, and Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia, according to a release from the Department of Health and Human Services. Several states have since brought their residents home to finish their 14-day quarantines.\n\nThe Grand Princess had 21 coronavirus cases aboard – two passengers and 19 crew – by the time it docked, having idled for days off San Francisco Bay waiting for permission to come in. Another Princess ship, Diamond Princess, had at least 700 cases after the ship was placed under quarantine off the coast of Japan in February.\n\nCosta Luminosa\n\nCosta Cruises' Costa Luminosa was denied permission to disembark its more than 1,400 passengers in Spain after the government locked down that country over the weekend, closing its ports to passenger traffic. Passengers are currently isolated in their rooms.\n\nThe company, owned by Carnival Corp., said that three Costa Luminosa passengers who were removed from the ship in the Cayman Islands and Puerto Rico have tested positive for COVID-19, including a 68-year-old man who died last weekend. On Monday, two passengers who had problems breathing and one who had a fever were taken off the boat and to the hospital when it stopped for provisions in the Canary Islands, off the Spanish coast.\n\nThe cruise ship-tracking site CruiseMapper.com shows the Costa Luminosa en route from southern Spain to its next port in Marseille, France. However, after French president Emmanuel Macron placed his country under lockdown effective Tuesday, it is not clear whether the ship will be allowed in.\n\nOcean Endeavour\n\nPassengers are self-isolating themselves aboard the Ocean Endeavour, an Antarctic cruise ship operated by Quark Expeditions, off the southern tip of Argentina. Quark says no one aboard is showing symptoms of COVID-19, but Argentine officials would not let passengers disembark until they had been at sea for two weeks, which is thought to be the virus' incubation period.\n\nThe Norwegian Jewel\n\nThe Norwegian Jewel has been turned away by Fiji and New Zealand, the cruise line said, and is now trying to to find a south Asian country that will let it dock. The ship, which can accommodate about 2,000 passengers, recently stopped for fuel in American Samoa.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises’ Freedom of the Seas and Carnival Fascination\n\nThe two ships were denied permission to return to their home ports in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Royal Caribbean and Carnival said Monday. .\n\nThe Carnival Fascination arrived in Miami on Tuesday and all passengers disembarked \"with no issues,\" Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen told USA TODAY early Wednesday. The Freedom of the Seas also docked in Miami and disembarked passengers Tuesday, Royal Caribbean spokesman Jonathon Fishman confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nCarnival said the government of Puerto Rico even denied a request to let Puerto Rican residents disembark “despite the fact that no one has any influenza-like illness.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; David Oliver, Curtis Tate, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/01/24/melbourne-orlando-international-airport-unveils-72m-terminal-expansion-to-accommodate-tui-flights/69817603007/", "title": "MLB airport unveils $72 million terminal expansion", "text": "Ascend the new escalator at Melbourne Orlando International Airport, and outbound passengers emerge into a high-ceiling modern retail corridor stretching past a long glass wall and passenger gates large enough to accommodate TUI's Boeing 787 Dreamliners.\n\nJust past Coastal News & Gifts, Core Plus Duty Free specializes in perfumes, candies and liquors preferred by TUI's holiday tourists from the United Kingdom.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/09/07/9-11-fear-sent-scores-jets-canada/643634001/", "title": "9/11 fear sent scores of jets to Gander, Newfoundland", "text": "GANDER, NEWFOUNDLAND – The passengers staggered into the vast terminal, bewildered and bleary-eyed, hours after their planes touched down.\n\nThey hadn't seen the towers fall. They knew little of the attacks – only what they'd gathered from scattered cellphone conversations before their batteries died or from their pilots, who shared radio news reports. It was incomprehensible.\n\nFew had any idea where they were. They stared at a map someone had taped to the wall, showing Canada's easternmost provinces. A hand-drawn arrow pointed to a place called Gander. \"You are here,\" it said.\n\nBut where?\n\nGander looked about 1,000 miles from New York. The terminal looked like something left over from the Cold War.\n\nThey'd seen the tarmac fill with jumbo jets, one after another – Lufthansa, Delta, Continental, Air France, American, on and on. Beyond the runway was the fence, where a few townspeople had gathered to watch the planes land. Beyond that, woods.\n\nA convoy of school buses had ferried them from the planes to the terminal, where they'd been frisked and scanned, their passports checked and customs declarations collected. They'd been allowed to take only their carry-ons.\n\nIn the arrivals area, scores of tables were set up. Smiling people handed out brown paper bags, each containing a sandwich, fruit, a water bottle and juice. The passengers helped themselves to toothbrushes, toothpaste and other toiletries piled in bins.\n\nThe rest of the world had seen the worst humanity could do: airliners hijacked and flown into office towers, people forced to leap 100 stories to their deaths, the World Trade Center destroyed.\n\nNow these travelers, stranded in Newfoundland, would see the best humanity had to offer.\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2001, when the United States abruptly closed its airspace, Gander, Newfoundland, became a safe harbor for 38 international aircraft, 6,700 passengers and crew, 17 dogs and cats, and a pair of great apes.\n\nThe onetime \"crossroads of the world,\" known for its last-chance airport at the edge of the North Atlantic, welcomed passengers from 92 countries. They were refugees from the new age of terrorism.\n\nTo the death and destruction they had witnessed that day on television, the Newfoundlanders offered their own simple, timeless antidote: food, clothing and a place to sleep for thousands of total strangers.\n\nThey expected nothing in return.\n\nThey had no idea whether their guests would stay hours, days or weeks.\n\nThey didn't know if additional terrorists might be lurking among them.\n\nThey just did the right thing.\n\n\"It comes right back to our grandfathers' day,\" says Gander's mayor, Claude Elliott. \"Newfoundland is a harsh country. ... We had to survive by helping each other.\"\n\nA town of 10,000, with only 550 hotel rooms, Gander took in 4,800 people, outlying towns took thousands more. From their closets and kitchens, the Newfoundlanders provided blankets and towels, sandwiches and stews for the shelters. They invited passengers home to wash up or sleep.\n\nThe \"plane people,\" as the Newfoundlanders came to call them, were baffled at first, then grateful and, finally, profoundly moved.\n\nIt \"was life-changing to me,\" says Kevin Tuerff, founder of an Austin, Texas, public relations firm, who was on an Air France flight. On every 9/11 anniversary since, he divides his staff into pairs and gives each twosome $100 and half a day off to do good deeds for total strangers.\n\n\"I was raised in the Catholic Church and knew the importance of compassion and helping one another,\" he says. \"But what happened there in Gander was remarkable.\"\n\nIn their own way, the Newfoundlanders tried to reverse the damages of the horrors at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa.\n\n\"Everyone's kindness and friendliness, not to mention fabulous food, cozy beds, nature walks and rides into town and back, have all been among the best experiences of our lives,\" Barbara and Kevin O'Brien of Ridgewood wrote to the local paper after it was over. \"This entire community seems to be made up of saints and angels.\"\n\n\"What Gander did was restore faith in people,\" says Elliott. \"Seven thousand people went away from here with a different view, a different outlook on life. I think Gander showed that there is still a lot of good left in our world today.\"\n\nTrans-Atlantic hub\n\nDriving into Gander on the Trans-Canada Highway nowadays, the role of aviation in the town's history becomes instantly apparent: wire sculptures of airplanes mark each entrance, and the streets bear names of air heroes like Earhart, Rickenbacker and Yeager. People comment on the makes and models of planes in the sky the way most people appreciate cars on the road.\n\nThree hotels line up along the highway: the Albatross, the Comfort Inn and the Hotel Gander.\n\nNancy Budgell, afternoon desk clerk at the Comfort Inn, wears a 9/11 lapel pin, designed for the 10th anniversary. Many plane people are expected back, and the town plans an entire month of activities and observances.\n\nShe remembers that day as if it was a month ago, not a decade - how the crew of American Airlines Flight 49 arrived exhausted and a crew member wept in the breakfast room for a friend lost on an airliner that hit one of the towers.\n\nThe manager's son, Matt Miller, remembers, too. He was 9 in 2001. Students at his elementary school and every other school in town were dismissed for the week so classrooms could be used to house passengers.\n\nThe inn's 9/11 scrapbook is full of photographs and letters of gratitude from England, France and all over the United States.\n\nEveryone in Gander has a scrapbook of 2001, it seems. Mac Moss, retired administrator of the College of the North Atlantic, shares the college's albums: a photo of a couple sleeping in the cafeteria with a baby nestled between them; a snapshot of backpackers from the plane who pitched their tent on the lawn outside; letters and Christmas cards from Germany, France and the U.S. Beulah Cooper, who took a tray of sandwiches to the Royal Canadian Legion hall and left with lifelong friends, keeps an album of photos of the passengers who stayed at her home.\n\nGander International Airport opened just before World War II as a joint military project of the Americans and British. \"The Rock,\" as Newfoundland was known, had been settled centuries earlier by fishermen from England and Ireland. They fished the world's greatest cod grounds, hunted seal when stores of salt fish ran out, admired the icebergs from Greenland floating by in the spring and remained wary of mainlanders, joining the Canadian federation only in 1949. When times got tough, their sons and daughters migrated to Boston and Brooklyn.\n\nThe isolation, harsh winters and rocky soil instilled a quirky independence, a neighborliness born of patience and need. Even now, the island has only 500,000 people - roughly half the population of Bergen County in nearly 200 times the space.\n\nNewfoundland's coastal towns, tucked into bays and coves, bear names like Heart's Desire (not far from Heart's Content) and South Dildo. With their slow-paced conversations, lilting accents and unstinting hospitality, the Newfoundlanders seem from a different time as well as a different place. Derm Flynn, the mayor of Appleton, calls friends in New Jersey and New York regularly, and they all ask: How are things in heaven on earth?\n\nGander's airport was built inland at a spot chosen for its comparative lack of fog. When the town's residential areas were laid out in 1959, a witty planner drew the main roads in the shape of a goose's head. (Gander – get it?) By 2001, though, the airport seemed a relic of the propeller era rendered obsolete by the jet age, its traffic reduced to a few small turboprops, corporate jets and the stray medical or mechanical emergency.\n\nYet it still boasted one of the longest runways in North America, at 10,500 feet. And the town is still home to Nav Canada's regional air-traffic control center for the North Atlantic. From its bunker-like confines, dozens of air-traffic controllers guide more than 1,000 flights each day as they cross the ocean.\n\nThe aircraft move across their radar screens like the fingers of a hand raking the sand in parallel tracks, their icons lining up in the jet stream for the quickest trip across the North Atlantic.\n\nOn Sept. 11, when the Federal Aviation Administration closed American airspace, the tracks turned sharply north.\n\nFlights stacked up\n\n\"We were about two hours from Newark Airport,\" remembers Maureen Murray of Morris Plains, who was returning from vacation on an Air France flight from Paris with her partner, Sue Riccardelli.\n\n\"We saw the flight attendant turn white as a sheet and start closing curtains. From the looks on their faces, we knew something was wrong.\"\n\nThe pilot came over the loudspeaker.\n\nDue to \"some kind of armed threat at the World Trade Center,\" Murray recalls him saying, the plane would make an emergency landing.\n\nTom McKeon was on a Continental flight from Dublin to Newark when the captain apologized for any sudden maneuvers. He was under orders to land quickly, he explained, because the U.S. appeared to be under attack. \"I've been on thousands of flights,\" says McKeon of West New York, \"and we've never gone from 30,000-plus feet to the ground so quickly.\"\n\nIn the Gander airport tower, traffic controller Bev Mercer heard the news when her supervisor called from Nav Canada's area control center.\n\n\"U.S. airspace is closed,\" he said. \"Be prepared to be busy.\"\n\nIt was noon, local time.\n\n\"We took our radars and opened them to the widest screen,\" Mercer says. \"There are all the 'oceanics,' the westbound planes. We see all these targets [the planes], and then we see everybody doing turns.\"\n\nShe holds her hands in front of her, fingers pointed sideways, and then turns them to point her fingers straight up – north toward Gander.\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" she says. \"We'd never seen it before.\"\n\nSoon, the planes came into view through the tower's tinted windows. \"A line of heavies,\" she says, referring to the jumbo jets that fly the intercontinental routes and need long runways to land.\n\nGary Tuff, acting chief of the airport's emergency response service that day, was opening the airport's emergency operations center when he looked out. \"They were stacked up,\" he says.\n\nAtop the tower, a controller hung an American flag.\n\nThe planes were coming in – to St. John's, Deer Lake and Stephenville, Goose Bay, Halifax and Gander.\n\nThe Maritime Provinces received 122 diverted planes that day. Nav Canada's regional controllers assigned them airports, based on distance and size. Controllers in towers who typically saw a handful of flights a day set up racetrack patterns overhead to space the planes safely.\n\nThen they brought them in, one by one.\n\nLufthansa. Northwest. Sabena. USAir. Air France. Delta. Continental. British Airways. Hungarian Airways. American TransAir. Cargo jets. Private jets.\n\n\"There was just long enough to get one off the runway, then another one was coming in,\" says Tuff.\n\nGander's runway was the longest, but each plane there had to land, make a U-turn and taxi back 5,000 feet before turning and heading toward the aprons or unused runway to park.\n\n\"We had 747s, 767s, 757s and Airbuses,\" says Tuff. The aircraft were packed in like sardines in a can, Mercer says. Post-it notes for each plane are still stuck to the wall in the airport's emergency operations center.\n\nThey parked on the terminal aprons, nose-to-tail down the second runway, nose-to-tail on all but one taxiway, and at the other side of the airport. Controllers kept the long runway clear for additional landings.\n\nThe spectacle overhead drew townspeople to the airport fence to gawk.\n\n\"Our priority was to get them down safely,\" said Tuff. \"Once we started doing head counts of the passengers, we realized that the town's population had almost doubled in an hour.\"\n\nTowns mobilized\n\nMayor Elliott heard about the first plane hitting the World Trade Center when he stopped for a cup of coffee at Tim Horton's. When the second hit, he went home to watch CNN.\n\nThe town's chief administrator called shortly thereafter.\n\nGander was going to get some planes, he told Elliott – as many as 200.\n\nElliott convened representatives of the Fire Department, telephone company, hospital and government agencies, activating the town's emergency plan.\n\nGander had 550 hotel rooms, but many times that number of people were about to arrive.\n\nCalls went out to every school, service club and church to see if they could accommodate passengers. Mayors in Appleton, Glenwood, Gambo and Lewisporte – smaller towns up to 45 minutes away – volunteered their communities to help.\n\nThe hotel rooms were assigned to the airline crews, under emergency powers, because they would have to rest before taking off again.\n\nThe only fleet of vehicles large enough to transport the passengers would be the school buses. But their drivers were on strike.\n\nThe drivers volunteered to come off the picket line, Elliott says. \"For the next couple of days, they drove people where they needed to be, and then when it was over, they went back on strike.\"\n\nLocal security crisis\n\nIn the air approaching Gander, quiet descended aboard Air France 004. Cellphones didn't work. Information was scant.\n\nSue Riccardelli remembers wondering who had ever gone to Gander before. \"I thought it was inhabited by natives,\" says Murray.\n\nThey didn't know that once the plane landed, they would have to wait hours to disembark. As soon as the aircraft were on the ground, what had been an aviation emergency morphed into a security crisis.\n\n\"Every plane that came out of the air was treated as if there could be a terrorist suspect on it,\" says Elliott. \"They didn't know how widespread this terrorist attack might be.\"\n\n\"We locked down,\" says Tuff.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police took charge of security. Access to the tarmac was strictly controlled. Police radioed each plane, checking in with pilots. Doors opened on some planes, but without stairs, nobody got off.\n\nAboard the aircraft, rumors abounded as the hours passed. Some people managed to use their cellphones to call family. Passengers passed phones from hand to hand until the batteries died.\n\nIn the evening, McKeon crowded into the cockpit with a half-dozen other passengers to listen to President George W. Bush's address to the nation on the plane's radio. \"It made me think of Pearl Harbor,\" he says, \"with people squeezed around the radio.\"\n\nSome passengers were kept in planes for 24 hours. Smokers were desperate for a nicotine fix. Emergency workers scoured local pharmacies and brought every available nicotine patch to the airport. Ground crews pumped out lavatories. Flight attendants distributed the last snacks and alcoholic beverages.\n\nIn the terminal, security, immigration and customs officials set up stations, along with the Red Cross and Salvation Army.\n\nOnce through the gauntlet, the passengers were assigned lodging by the Red Cross – each plane's passengers billeted together.\n\nThen they boarded school buses and headed out. It was nearly 9 p.m. when Murray and Riccardelli arrived at the College of the North Atlantic. McKeon reached the Appleton Town Hall at 2 a.m. Shirley Brooks-Jones of Columbus, Ohio, made it to Lewisporte past dawn - after pausing along the way for the bus riders to admire a moose.\n\nNo time to spare\n\nWhile the passengers had been waiting, the people of Gander prepared.\n\nBeulah Cooper got a call at home \"asking me to make a tray of sandwiches to bring to the Legion,\" where she belonged to the Ladies' Auxiliary, she recalls. \"Somebody said there was a planeload of people coming.\"\n\nMac Moss, at the College of the North Atlantic, got a call telling him to expect 275 to 300 passengers from Air France. \"I asked what time we'd get them,\" he says, and realized he had 90 minutes to get ready.\n\nNinety minutes to prepare for 300 guests – to gather staff and move desks, collect food and bedding. Moss called the cooking instructors who prepare students for jobs on oil rigs and cruise ships. \"Raid the store, gather up what you can,\" he said.\n\nNellie, his wife, piled up the household's pillows, blankets and towels. She called friends and neighbors and \"those friends called their friends,\" she said. \"In no time, I had a carload of blankets, towels.\" Over and over, she ferried them to the school.\n\nThe manager of a hotel miles away called to ask if Moss could use old bedspreads and curtains. When Moss said yes, she drove through the night to deliver them.\n\nOthers ran television hookups into the cafeteria and staff lounge so the plane people could finally see the day's events, in English or French.\n\n\"We gathered in the cafeteria and watched,\" Murray recalls. \"What we saw on CNN was our first glimpse of what had happened.\"\n\nThey were among the last Americans to see it; the shock shows on their faces, captured in photographs.\n\nThe same scene played out all over Gander and central Newfoundland.\n\n\"You felt so bad for them,\" says Cooper. \"They didn't know where they were or what was going on back home or who we were.\"\n\nA local teenager offered Kevin Tuerff an air mattress. \"A complete stranger walks up to me and says, 'Do you need a bed?' ... He gave it to me and walked off,\" marvels Tuerff. \"How often do you find yourself in such a vulnerable position?\"\n\nThe plane people had roofs over their heads, bedding (if not beds), food and attentive hosts. Day One had passed safely. They slept while local officials got organized.\n\nTwo apes and karaoke\n\n\"We realized then we were going to have those people for a few days,\" says Elliott. Both Canadian and American airspace were now closed. In fact, the last planes wouldn't leave till Sunday.\n\nHe went on the radio to ask for donations of food to be brought to the community center. The line of cars soon stretched 2 miles. Elliott commandeered the ice hockey rink at the center, lowered the temperature and created the province's largest walk-in refrigerator.\n\nComputers and phones were made freely available at schools, hotels and offices. The telephone company set up a phone bank with 100 phones on the lawn outside its Gander office. If the passengers couldn't figure out the intricacies of long-distance dialing, Melanie Burt, an operator, helped them. Italian fashion models, British military officers – she dealt with them all.\n\nIn Appleton, McKeon and the other plane people woke up to the bustle of breakfast preparation in the municipal building. A few took a walk to a convenience store on the Trans-Canada Highway. Take what you need, the owner told them – no charge.\n\nSome of the airline passengers had special needs:\n\nTwo female bonobos – an endangered species of great ape – were in crates in the belly of a flight from Belgium, bound for American zoos. \"The girls,\" as zookeeper Beth Pohl calls them, were taken to an airport hangar but not let out of their cages for six days. Their Belgian zookeeper stayed with them, along with 17 dogs and cats from the planes. Volunteers from a local animal-welfare group walked and fed the pets. The two 65-pound primates \"ate well, had visitors and dogs and cats to watch and overall remained very calm,\" Pohl recalls, though one was given Valium the last two days.\n\nThe town threw a party for two children with life-threatening illnesses who had been on their way to Disney World, courtesy of the Make-a-Wish Foundation. \"We brought every mascot we had in Gander, birthday cakes, music, clowns,\" said Elliott. \"We're not Disney World, but we tried to make them happy.\"\n\nGander's pharmacists worked around the clock to provide medication to diabetics and others who were unable to get at their checked luggage. Faxes flowed from Newfoundland to medical offices around the world as substitutions were worked out and doses confirmed – all free of charge to the passengers.\n\nIn St. John's, the provincial capital, and at Halifax, Nova Scotia, dozens of planes landed as well. But those cities had plenty of hotel rooms, military barracks and college dorms – and an armada of municipal and provincial employees to help with the emergency. In Gander, the response was personal.\n\nLocals stopped by the schools and halls where people were staying and invited them home to shower.\n\n\"I didn't know what to think,\" says McKeon. \"I didn't believe it. I didn't trust it – I thought they might rob us.\" But after talking with Flynn, the Appleton mayor, McKeon moved up the hill to his house to stay.\n\n\"I had a dozen people come here for showers,\" says Beulah Cooper, who volunteered at the Legion in Gander. Seeing a young woman in tears after a call home, Cooper asked if she'd like to spend the night. Eventually, three women moved in for the duration. Since then, Cooper has entertained the young woman – Monica Burke of Seattle – and her mother on a return visit, and is getting ready to host her again on the 10th anniversary.\n\n\"We were told not to take anybody into our homes,\" says Elliott. \"But you don't tell Newfoundlanders that!\"\n\nThe town had never been so crowded.\n\n\"We went around on skateboards and saw people everywhere, sitting on the grass,\" says Matt Miller, who was 9. \"My friends and I did a lemonade stand.\"\n\nPlane people walked to Walmart in hopes of buying underwear, and locals offered them rides. Seeing a woman carrying a toddler, a resident called to her from her porch, then gave her a stroller. At the college, students led the plane people on a hike around Cobb's Pond. At night, they put on karaoke concerts.\n\nThere was tragedy as well as romance.\n\nHannah and Dennis O'Rourke, Long Islanders on their way home from Ireland, waited for news of their son, a New York City firefighter lost in the collapse of the towers. Two passengers who met while staying in Gambo began a courtship that led to marriage.\n\nThe plane people were a cross section of the world. The chief executive of Hugo Boss had been bound for New York's fashion week, and a group of Moldovan refugees were on their way to reunite with families in America. The mayor of Frankfurt borrowed Elliott's office, while executives from the Rockefeller Foundation set up shop in the Lewisporte Town Hall. Israeli newlyweds spent part of their honeymoon at Appleton's council chambers. A Muslim imam prayed next to an Orthodox Jew.\n\n\"Nobody tried to get ahead of another person because of their station in life,\" says Mac Moss. \"They slept on a hard floor. There were no complaints, no complaints at all.\"\n\n\"It was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life,\" says Shirley Brooks-Jones, who stayed in Lewisporte. She has returned 17 times.\n\nA lesson in caring\n\nOne by one, the planes were cleared to depart starting Friday afternoon – more than three days after they landed. There were false starts and tense moments. Foreign carriers were told to return to their points of origin, rather than finishing their trips to the U.S. Some passengers mutinied and chartered a bus. Others bought used cars and headed for ferry ports, abandoning their checked luggage.\n\nEventually, they all left. In Gander and Gambo, Lewisporte and Appleton, people went back about their business.\n\nBut then word started to seep out about what had happened in Newfoundland.\n\n\"It was the passengers, it wasn't us, that spread the story,\" says Elliott.\n\nA former newspaper columnist wrote a book, \"The Day the World Came to Town.\" Shirley Brooks-Jones made presentations around the Midwest about her experience and a scholarship fund she'd helped start with fellow passengers. Tom Brokaw did a television special during the Vancouver Olympics.\n\nToday, if you know where to look, you can see many signs of what happened a decade ago:\n\nThe name Gander was given to a baby bonobo born in 2003 at the Columbus Zoo and to a Lufthansa Airbus 340 that plies the skies from Europe to North America.\n\nKids at a Lewisporte school who are too young to remember 9/11 use computers donated by the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nThirteen members of the Lewisporte Collegiate Class of 2011 received college scholarships in June from the Delta Flight 15 scholarship fund. Contributions now total almost $1.5 million, and have helped pay the college bills of 134 kids, including a newly minted physician and a geophysicist.\n\nA telephone operator who went back to school to become an aesthetician, Melanie Burt, received an award in June from an Air France Flight 004 passenger fund. The award is given each year to a graduate who exemplifies the kindness and generosity that were showered on the plane people.\n\nAirline mechanics studying at the College of the North Atlantic can train for European airport jobs, thanks to a partnership between the school and Lufthansa.\n\nAppleton has expanded and renamed a park and playground beside the Gander River where the passengers sat on riverside rocks to collect their thoughts; it's now the Appleton Peace Park.\n\nAnd in Morris Plains, framed photos show the highlights of return trips to Newfoundland by Riccardelli and Murray, who visit their friends, the Mosses.\n\nYet almost 10 years since the jets descended on Gander, the town has built no monument.\n\n\"Our culture and our people don't want any recognition,\" says Elliott. A thank-you party the town threw a month or so afterwards for the 9/11 volunteers was attended by only 30 people. \"People don't want to see a whole pile of plaques,\" he explains.\n\nMostly it's the passengers who came to Newfoundland who've changed.\n\n\"I learned that you have to stretch a little, whether it's in trusting one another or reaching out to help,\" says Tom McKeon, now married and a father of a 2-year-old.\n\nBrooks-Jones used to say she had four sisters and four brothers, and now talks about her fifth sister - in Newfoundland.\n\nAnd Murray and Riccardelli feel as if they've become ambassadors for the people of Gander, whom they revisit every other year. \"If you could package up what these people have, it would be a more peaceful world,\" Riccardelli says.\n\n\"It was a little pocket of calm in the middle of the world,\" says Kevin O'Brien. \"We think of that time as a totally wonderful experience,\" adds his wife, Barbara, almost apologetically, \"when for everyone else it was a disaster.\"\n\nE-mail: washburn@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/27/live-coverage-pope-philadelphia-day-2/72923234/", "title": "Recap: The pope in Philadelphia, Day 2", "text": "The News Journal\n\nPope Francis wrapped up his historic visit to Philadelphia on Sunday, Sept. 27.

The Philadelphia portion was the last leg of a 10-day visit to Cuba and the U.S.\n\nThe pontiff Sunday met with survivors of sex abuse and spoke to 300 bishops at Charles Borromeo seminary, where he spent the night Saturday. He later met with 100 inmates at Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, where convicts built a walnut chair for him.\n\n“This time in your life can only have one purpose: to give you a hand in getting back on the right road, to give you a hand to help you rejoin society,\" he said.\n\nHe then delivered a public Mass in front of the Philadelphia Art Museum, attracting thousands of faithful.\n\nHis trip ended at Atlantic Aviation, a private aircraft terminal at Philadelphia International Airport, where he landed Saturday and met with 500 organizers of the World Families conference. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill were in attendance.\n\n“May God bless you all. May God bless America,” the pope said at the end of his remarks, to thunderous applause and cheers from those gathered.\n\nHe departed on a charted Boeing 777 American Airlines jet christened Shepherd One. Earlier on his trip, American took the pope from Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.\n\nAn American Airlines spokesman told the Associated Press this month that the plane was chartered by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He said the pilots and other crew members are American Airlines employees from around the country and represent different religions.\n\nAmerican last carried a pope, John Paul II, in 1993, flying him from Denver to Rome.

After heading back to 30th Street station, Malloy and his family found themselves in another incredibly long line - except, this time they were in the front.\n\n\"I think he's phenomenal and engaging,\" said Malloy. \"He gets people excited to go to church instead of driving them away.\" – Madison Goebel\n\n7:10 p.m.\n\n7:00 p.m.\n\nPeople are leaving the parkway in droves and walking toward 30th Street station.

Hawkers are selling water, soda and papal merchandise.\n\nFrancis said in his homily at the Mass that everyone should be open to miracles of love for the sake of families around the world. – Associated Press\n\n5:52 p.m.\n\nPope Francis has finished his outdoor Mass, which was attended by thousands of pilgrims.\n\nMany were far removed from the altar and watched the event on jumbo televisions. Those who had tickets to the viewing area closest to the stage had to endure long security lines.\n\nThe Mass had no weather problems, despite a slight chance of rain being forecast.\n\nThe pope is scheduled to meet with organizers of the World Meeting of Families at 7 p.m. The meeting is at Atlantic Aviation at Philadelphia International Airport, where Pope Francis landed on Saturday aboard an American Airlines charter plane, dubbed Shepherd One.\n\nThe festival is the original reason the pontiff scheduled his U.S. visit.

Tens of thousands more who weren’t able to make it through security before the Mass began either gave up and turned around or made their way to watch the event on one of several gigantic video screens dotting the city. – Associated Press\n\n5:09 p.m.\n\nPope Francis is preparing for communion during his open-air Mass. The Mass is a vibrant tableau of brilliant gold, green and white in evening sunlight.\n\nFrancis earlier told his listeners that their presence itself was \"a kind of miracle in today's world,\" an affirmation of the family and the power of love. – Associated Press\n\n4:55 p.m.\n\n4:52 p.m.\n\nPope Francis concluded his homily by saying: “Anyone who wants to bring into this world a family which teaches children to be excited by every gesture which is aimed at overcoming evil – a family which shows that the spirit is alive and at work – will encounter and find our gratitude and appreciation.\n\n\"Regardless of what people, region, or religion to which they belong, may God grant all of us to be prophets of the joy of the gospel of the family and of the love of the family, to be prophets as the Lord’s disciples, the grace to be worthy of this purity of heart which is not scandalized by the gospel. May it be so.”\n\nRead the full text of the pope's homily, as prepared for delivery:\n\n4:41 p.m.\n\nPope Francis in his homily is encouraging those gathered to have courage to follow their faith.\n\n“Faith grows when it is practiced and it is shaped by love. That is why our families, our homes, are true domestic churches. These are the right place for faith to become life, and for faith to grow in life,” the pope said.\n\n“Jesus tells us not to hold back these little miracles.

Mike Bellina of Tinton Falls Township, N.J., said he drove about an hour to Wilmington on Saturday night with wife Amy and son Mike to be sure they made the connection. \"I'm hoping to at least get a good picture,\" Mike Bellina said. \"After that it will be all gravy.\" One SEPTA worker helping to guide passengers said Sunday's first train carried more passengers than Saturday's earliest run.

To be No. 1 in the world, to be a champion,” Alcaraz said, adding he thought about some of his family members who couldn’t make it to watch him play.\n\n“I always say it’s not time to be tired in the final round of the grand slam, you have to give everything you have inside,” he said.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz reacts after defeating Casper Ruud during their Men's Singles Final match of the 2022 US Open on September 11, 2022.

He will rise to second in the world from number seven.\n\n“Today was a special day, both Carlos and I knew what we were playing for and both knew what was a stake,” Ruud said. “I’m disappointed of course that I’m not No. 1, but No. 2 isn’t so bad either.”\n\nAlcaraz played three consecutive five-set matches on the way to the final, including the second-longest match in the history of the US Open when he overcame Jannik Sinner at 2:50 a.m. in the quarterfinals on Thursday – the tournament’s latest ever finish.\n\nThroughout the US Open, the Spaniard enthralled crowds with his speed, athleticism and outrageous shot-making.

Is climate change to blame?", "text": "A small village in the Swiss Alps has been engulfed by ice, mud, and rock in a rare natural disaster that points to an uncertain future as unstable mountainous glaciers can break apart in destructive avalanches.\n\nA swirling and volatile combination of climate change effects, fragile natural environments and human development contribute to the danger, leaving experts concerned about what the future may hold.\n\nWhile similar avalanches occasionally happen in the Alps, one hasn't impacted a populated region for over a hundred years.\n\n\"It’s critical to realize that we now have left the space of historical precedence and entered an era where we face new hazards from locations that have never been a problem in the past and where protection may be technically hardly possible or financially unfeasible,\" Christian Huggel, a professor of environment and climate at the University of Zurich, told USA TODAY via email.\n\nStudying this kind of disaster isn't easy, partly because such \"ice-rock-debris\" avalanches often occur in isolated areas so gathering good data is a challenge.\n\n\"Statistics are difficult here but it seems that the past 5-10 years have brought more such critical situations in the Swiss Alps than in the earlier past. We should definitely prepare for more of the kind in the future,\" Huggel said.\n\nWhat happened in Blatten, Switzerland?\n\nAs much as 90% of Blatten, Switzerland, is now engulfed by ice, mud, and rock after what scientists suspect is a dramatic display of the impact of climate change on mountain communities.\n\n\"We've lost our village,\" Matthias Bellwald, the mayor of Blatten told a press conference after the slide. \"The village is under rubble.\"\n\nA video shared widely on social media showed the dramatic moment when the glacier partially collapsed, creating a huge cloud that covered part of the mountain as rock and debris came cascading down towards the village.\n\nAre ice-rock-debris avalanches rare?\n\nWhile recently rare in the Alps, \"events of the dimension of the 'ice-rock-debris avalanche' in Blatten are known from and studied in regions like the Himalayas or Alaska over the past several decades,\" Huggel told USA TODAY via email.\n\nA similar event happened in April 2024, but did not affect population centers, said Huggel. But the destruction of large parts of a village (with 300 inhabitants) \"has in fact no historical precedence in the 21st and 20th century.\"\n\nBefore that, there was a landslide in Goldau in 1806 and one in Elm in 1881, where more than 400 and 100 people lost their lives, respectively, Huggel said.\n\nClimate change makes for an uncertain future\n\n\"Higher average annual temperatures may lead to more glaciers, especially in steep terrain, becoming 'unstuck' from their beds, or mountain permafrost, which can keep mountain slopes frozen together, thawing and making such slopes less stable,\" said Bruce Raup, a senior associate scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nRaup told USA TODAY that globally speaking, such events happen in steeper, younger mountain ranges such as the European Alps and the Himalaya where erosional processes are more active. Risk is higher if there are people or infrastructure near potential mass movements, or downstream where a blocked stream could lead to flooding.\n\nHow the ice-rock-debris avalanche unfolded\n\nABC News reports that an uptick in glacier melt had been observed at Birch Glacier, and emergency managers ordered hundreds of villagers to evacuate.\n\nHuggel called what happened next \"a complex interaction of various processes of rock slope instability.\"\n\nAccording to Raup, \"the event was a massive rock avalanche/landslide falling onto a glacier that then collapsed and went down together with the rock mass.\"\n\nWhile various factors were at play in Blatten, it was known that local permafrost had been affected by warmer temperatures in the Alps. The loss of permafrost can negatively affect the stability of the mountain rock, which is why climate change had likely played a part in the deluge, Huggel said.\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/14/st-marys-glacier-colorado-hiker-death/74101783007/", "title": "Colorado hiker falls 300 feet down steep snow slope to his death", "text": "A hiker who became stranded on a band of cliffs in Colorado fell to his death Thursday, according to the rescue team that recovered his body.\n\nThe fall happened at St. Mary’s Glacier in the Arapaho National Forest, about 40 miles west of Denver, the Alpine Rescue Team wrote in a Facebook post on Friday.\n\n\"He fell approximately 300 feet down a steep snow slope that was intersected by a couple cliff bands,\" Jake Smith, a spokesperson for Alpine Rescue Team, told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nSomeone called the rescue team for help at 2:20 p.m. The agency isn't sure exactly who called but they suspect it was a bystander at St. Mary's Lake below who witnessed the fall, Smith said.\n\nThe caller mistakenly reported that someone was stranded but the man had died instantly.\n\nBecause the call initially came in as a person stranded, the agency sent 25 members out for a non-emergency response, according to the rescue team.

One recent visitor to the area wrote on hiking website AllTrails that \"there is some snow on the trail but nothing you can’t walk around.\"\n\nThe official trail starts just off a road and involves a moderate climb past St. Mary's Lake and up to the glacier. The trail passes by the lake at water level but is surrounded by various slopes and a peak called Fox Mountain.\n\nThe spokesperson from Alpine Rescue Team said the terrain may seem harmless but it can pose a significant risk for hikers without the proper training and equipment.\n\n\"It's important for folks to know there is never any charge for calling for rescue, or for search and rescue operations,\" the group told USA TODAY.\n\nThe agency said those who called for help did the right thing.\n\n“Our sincerest condolences to our subject and their family,” the Alpine Rescue Team posted online.\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

They're ignoring part of the problem — men.\n\nAmerica's birth rate has been on a steady decline since 2007, and pronatalists − both in and outside the White House − are determined to raise it. But when partners struggle to conceive, the burden is rarely distributed evenly between men and women. Fertility experts say we’re missing a key component of the conversation – male infertility. Experts say male and female infertility factors often coexist, yet a high number of men do not undergo testing before their female partner begins IVF.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/watchdog/2017/02/15/fethullah-gulen-charter-schools-islamic-cleric-new-jersey/94574618/", "title": "Investigation: Charter school leaders, founders linked to ...", "text": "Jean Rimbach, Jeff Pillets, and Hannan Adely\n\nNorthJersey\n\nA group of charter schools that arose from North Jersey’s Turkish community is rapidly growing in the state, with seven schools collecting more than $60 million in taxpayer money last year alone to fund their growth.\n\nNow, an investigation by The Record and NorthJersey.com shows that some founders and leaders of the schools have close ties to the movement of Fethullah Gulen, the controversial Islamic cleric accused of working to overthrow the government in his native Turkey last summer. Gulen has denied the charge and is fighting extradition demands as he lives in a secluded compound in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, about 10 miles from the New Jersey border.\n\nThe 75-year-old Gulen, in his writings and public comments, espouses a modern Islamic society that embraces education, interfaith dialogue and tolerance. Sympathy for the movement is strong among key figures who pioneered the North Jersey charter schools.\n\nSome belong to Turkish émigré groups that tout the cleric's teachings. There are also political donors who collectively have furnished hundreds of thousands in donations to U.S. office holders while the North Jersey charter schools in general have been adept at wooing state and local government officials with trips to Turkey and, in some cases, jobs.\n\nRecords show the charter schools also have been a channel for state taxpayer money to private entities that serve the schools as landlords or vendors — in one case, a Wayne boarding school that is openly Gulen inspired.\n\nIn Turkey’s capital of Ankara, President Recep Erdogan (err-doe-wan) — some critics say in an effort to solidify his power and move toward authoritarianism — has purged thousands of suspected \"Gulenists\" from the government. He is also pressing the Trump administration to break with former President Barack Obama and immediately dislodge the cleric and send him home to stand trial as a domestic terrorist who they claim was behind the July 2016 coup attempt.\n\nOfficials in the turbulent Turkish republic have maintained Gulen is leveraging a network of more than 100 charter schools nationwide and U.S. tax dollars to support revolution back home that would put his followers in power.\n\n“It’s clear these schools were being used both to raise funds for Gulen and employ Gulen followers and teachers and basically have them tie a percent of their income back to Gulen,” said Robert Amsterdam, a London-based lawyer hired by the Turkish government who is investigating charter schools in the U.S. that he alleges are linked to Gulen.\n\nThe United States has not classified Gulen or his followers as a terrorist group, and some officials have characterized the cleric as an antidote to Islamic extremism. The Trump administration has not made an official policy statement about Gulen.\n\nGulen disavows any role in the Turkish coup or terror attacks there, and he has long denied a connection to the Turkish-led charter schools in the United States.\n\nLeaders of the New Jersey schools interviewed for this story say their charters, spread across a dozen locations stretching from Hackensack to Somerset County, have no formal link to the reclusive preacher. The schools exist solely to provide good secular education for the large numbers of public school families seeking better outcomes for their children, they say.\n\nAs the international controversy around Gulen swirls, the Turkish-led schools in New Jersey continue to collect tens of millions of dollars in state financing and local tax support, public records show.\n\nThe Record's review raises key questions about state oversight of the schools even as Governor Christie – who visited three of the North Jersey locations last year – pushes to rapidly expand the charter movement across the state:\n\nThe investigation found:\n\nA state-financed property deal involving the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology also benefited its landlord, a private group with close ties to the Gulen movement:\n\nThat group sold the property and used the proceeds to help open a new campus in Wayne for its private boarding school that caters largely to students from Turkey and hews so closely to Gulen's teachings that the Turkish government has closed down access to its web site and halted financial transactions involving the school.\n\nPublic money, in fees and rent that could amount to millions of dollars over time, continues to flow to the charter school's new landlord, a firm with multiple ties to Turkish charter schools in New Jersey and elsewhere.\n\nConnections run deep among people involved with the schools, Gulenist groups and Turkish charter schools elsewhere in the U.S:\n\nTwo of the New Jersey schools, for example, have a founder who has served as a director at the New York-based Alliance for Shared Values, considered the voice of the Gulen movement in this country.\n\nThe CEO of iLearn Schools Inc. – an Elmwood Park-based non-profit that manages four of the local charter schools – comes from a charter network in Texas that the Turkish government claims is linked to the Gulen movement.\n\nThe schools and their vendors have successfully courted prominent public-school educators and political figures.\n\nThe state’s top charter school regulator, Harold Lee, left his post last summer for a job at iLearn.\n\nSecurity consulting contracts at four of the schools worth more than $90,000 a year are held by ex-Bergen County Sheriff Leo McGuire, who took a 10-day trip to Turkey before he left office in 2010 with his family and local Turkish nationals tied to the schools. It was paid for in part by a Gulenist group.\n\nMore than $30 million in long-term, low-interest loans have been granted by the state to benefit the Paterson science and technology charter despite its continuing financial and academic troubles:\n\nIn 2014, a Wall Street ratings agency downgraded the bonds issued for its expansion to junk status because the school’s revenues had fallen. Last year, Wall Street lowered its overall outlook on the bonds to “negative.”\n\nTracking tax dollars spent by the schools can be difficult because of loopholes in state law:\n\nILearn, which is set to add a fifth charter to its chain this year, declined to answer routine requests for information about its payroll, saying that as a private contractor it is not subject to the state Open Public Records law.\n\nState officials said it is unclear if such charter-management organizations fall under the law, even though charters draw their funding directly from the tax-funded budgets of regular public schools.\n\nGulen’s followers maintain the campaign against the American charters by the Turkish government is part of an attempt to smear and harass Gulen supporters wherever they live.\n\nThey dismiss the idea of a political or religious conspiracy operating through them and say Gulen’s movement is about hard work, peace and leading an ethical life. The movement’s Alliance for Shared Values maintains his devotees have simply been inspired to “promote education, particularly in math and science, by starting schools to serve disadvantaged communities.”\n\nIt is also clear, though, that local Turks sympathetic to Gulen have influence well beyond the charter schools and are skilled at building political capital. Civic and cultural organizations linked to Gulen are active in the community at large, holding academic competitions for students and interfaith and outreach events with politicians, law enforcement and the public.\n\nMembers of the organizations are vocal about issues that affect Turkey and have provided U.S. lawmakers and others like McGuire with trips to their homeland, including two Bergen County lawmakers, Sen. Loretta Weinberg and Assemblyman Gordon Johnson, financial disclosure forms show. Census figures show that Bergen and Passaic counties have the nation’s highest percentage of residents with Turkish ancestry among America's 3,000-plus counties. There are 5,200 in Bergen County alone.\n\nJohnson said he visited a Gulen university and met with a group of Gulenist educators. Weinberg recalled learning about the Gulen philosophy when she traveled to the republic with Johnson in 2011. Like the former sheriff, both legislators said they paid for airfare and the Peace Islands Institute, a U.S.-based group that considers Gulen its honorary president, picked up the costs for the 2011 trip. Johnson visited again in 2014 on a trip that was paid for, in part, by the Council of Turkic American Associations, which promotes Turkish culture.\n\nMcGuire said Gulen was not discussed on what he called a “spectacular trip” in 2008. But a brochure by the Turkish Cultural Center of New Jersey about the excursion quotes him as saying: “I now have many, many more Turkish friends. It is clear that those who have read the books of Fethullah Gulen have taken his message throughout Turkey and the world to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding.”\n\nChristie has repeatedly used the Turkish charter schools in New Jersey as a backdrop to his controversial push to expand the charter movement.\n\nIn June, as protesters gathered outside, he visited the high school campus of the Paterson science and technology charter and met with parents. In May, he stopped at the Hackensack location of the Bergen Arts and Science Charter School — an iLearn school — and traveled to the Thomas Edison EnergySmart Charter School in Somerset.\n\nIn a statement for The Record, the governor's office did not address specific issues with the Turkish schools but pointed out the popularity and success of charter schools overall.\n\n\"In general, qualified public charter schools are thriving and growing across New Jersey, because they have proven to be some of the most safe, successful, efficient and accountable educational environments,'' Christie spokesman Brian Murray said.\n\nA number of prominent Turkish nationals connected to the charters or their vendors have emerged as fundraisers and contributors to Hillary Clinton and Obama, among other political leaders. A former head of the Science and Technology charter in Paterson, Furkan Kosar, is the president of the Council of Turkic American Associations. Kosar raised more than $500,000 for Obama’s re-election bid in 2012. He did not return calls made to the council.\n\nCritics say the presence of big-money contributors connected to the schools in New Jersey and other states is evidence the cleric and his followers are advancing the Gulen movement at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.\n\n“They’re engaging in a series of activities that really don’t have anything to do with charter schools, and have much more to do with building political influence in the U.S. for his movement,” said Amsterdam, the lawyer for the Turkish government.\n\nAmong those critics is retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s recently ousted national security adviser who claimed American taxpayers “are helping finance Gulen’s 160 charter schools in the United States” in an op-ed piece written in November for The Hill, the congressional newspaper that assailed the Obama administration for allowing Gulen to remain in the United States.\n\nErcan Tozan, executive director of Peace Islands, dismissed the suggestion of the schools having any purpose beyond education.\n\nTozan said that the practice of hiring from the same pool of candidates – including Turks who worked in similar schools or who follow Gulen’s teachings – isn’t an issue. They may have shared connections, but they’re hired for their qualifications, he said.\n\n“Is it a problem to know each other and to know Mr. Gulen?” said Tozan, also a parent of a student at the Pioneer Academy, the Gulen-inspired private school in Wayne. “The Turkish community has really great connections.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Ercan Tozan as a board member of Pioneer Academy.\n\niLearn, the Elmwood Park-based nonprofit that manages four of the charter schools, hired Harold Lee last year as its chief strategy officer.\n\nThe job has duties that include seeking philanthropic funding and growing the firm in New York, officials said. ILearn Schools collects a steady and growing stream of tax money to manage charter schools in Bergen, Passaic and Hudson counties. The firm is paid from 8 percent to 12 percent of the charters' annual operating budgets, and it plans to open a new school in Union County this year.\n\nWith Lee serving as New Jersey's lead charter school official for two years before iLearn recruited him, submissions from the company would likely have come before him. Both Lee and a spokesman for the state Education Department said he notified his superiors in May that he was in talks with iLearn and recused himself from matters affecting its schools. All charter-school applications are approved solely by the commissioner of education, the spokesman said.\n\nLee, in a written statement, said he decided to leave his state job because of iLearn's \"dynamic\" impact on public education in places that need it most.\n\n\"I came to iLearn Schools because I wanted to work for an organization that is truly making a difference in the lives of students and families each and every day,'' Lee said. \"This is a dynamic, innovative organization that is providing high-quality public education to students in areas that are in need of more quality educational options.\"\n\nNihat Guvercin, the chief executive of iLearn, declined to speak about Lee or release his salary, except to say it is in a range of $93,000 to $151,000. ILearn said it is not bound to release salary data or other detailed financial information about its operations because, as a private firm, it is not subject to the same open record laws that govern traditional public schools.\n\nIn a written response to questions, Guvercin said iLearn strictly adheres to all state laws, which he said are among the toughest in the nation on charter schools.\n\nA maze of connections links a group of charter schools rooted in New Jersey’s Turkish community with the movement of a reclusive Islamic cleric living in self-imposed exile in the Poconos, an investigation by The Record and NorthJersey.com has found.\n\nA review of state records, websites, résumés and tax forms reveals how people involved with the schools are linked to groups that are viewed as sympathetic to Fethullah Gulen, the preacher accused of pushing for a revolution in his native Turkey.\n\nFor example, Nihat Guvercin, chief executive officer of iLearn, an Elmwood Park-based non-profit that manages four of the schools, is a former teacher and administrator at Harmony Science Academy in Dallas, one in an expansive network of charters targeted by the Turkish government as part of Gulen’s movement.\n\nGuvercin declined to be interviewed for this story, but he told The Record in 2013 that he admires Gulen – just as he admires India’s Mahatma Gandhi – but does not talk about his philosophy in class.\n\nMore recently, he emphasized in an email the schools are independent, with no religious or political affiliation. And he said questions about Gulen's philosophy and the backgrounds of school officials and contractors miss the point that schools provide good education to needy students.\n\n\"We have a waiting list in the thousands,'' he said. \"We provide quality, secular, public-school education in some of the most underserved urban communities in the state.\n\n“Rather than spending valuable time discussing global issues of no importance to the education of our students,” Guvercin added, “I commit myself both personally and professionally to the individual and collective success of our students, staff, and families.”\n\nOsman Oztoprak, a Clifton resident who most recent available tax records show has been a paid director at the Alliance for Shared Values – considered the voice of the Gulen movement in the United States – is a founder of the Bergen Arts and Science Charter School. It was the first school in what later became the iLearn chain.\n\nOztoprak, who declined to be interviewed through the Alliance, signed paperwork filed with the state in 2005 as the “charter school applicant representative.” The Record also submitted questions to Gulen through the Alliance, which they answered on his behalf.\n\nYears earlier, Oztoprak was among the founders of the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology, records show.\n\nThe Paterson charter has an additional connection to the Gulen movement. A founding partner of the school is the Milky Way Education Center, the non-profit that runs the private, Gulen-inspired Pioneer Academy in Wayne, documents show. Milky Way acquired a building, became the charter school’s landlord and loaned the school money.\n\nBut to the Turkish government, Pioneer Academy is much more.\n\nIn fact, the Turkish government so closely connects Pioneer to Gulen that since the attempted coup in 2016 – which it blames the cleric for – tuition payments from Turkish residents to Pioneer have been shut down and access to the school's website has been taken away in Turkey.\n\nPioneer’s leaders say they offer a secular curriculum and that the school incorporates Gulen’s view of education as a key to an ethical and service-driven life.\n\nOztoprak also was connected to Pioneer, serving as a principal and science teacher, and records also note he was one of its two founding teachers.\n\nAnother founder and former board president at the Paterson science and technology charter school, Candemir Toklu, went on to help found the Thomas Edison charter in Somerset, records show.\n\nToklu, who was identified as “lead founder” in the state application for Thomas Edison, also has served as Princeton area director of the Interfaith Dialog Center – now known as the Peace Islands Institute. The institute, which has an address in Hasbrouck Heights, on its website lists Gulen as its \"honorary president\" and provides an extensive biography of the cleric and his movement.\n\nToklu could not be reached for comment.\n\nOverlap also can be found between the people involved with the Gulen movement and vendors that serve some of the local charters.\n\nThe non-profit Apple Educational Services in Moonachie, for example, has been used by Pioneer and a number of the Turkish charters in New Jersey and other states. One of its corporate officers was an officer at the Interfaith Dialog Center, and at one point Apple and the center shared an address in Carlstadt, federal non-profit tax records show.\n\nThe name of Apple’s former treasurer also can be found on state paperwork as a vice president for Somerset-based EBRU TV – owned by the movement, according to an article posted on Gulen’s official website.\n\nOztoprak, meanwhile, was an education project manager at Apple.\n\nState documents show the company – whose services include database management, testing, tutoring and robotics training – serves about 30 schools in nine states in various ways; Apple’s executive director said it does not fund or support special-interest groups, Gulenist or otherwise.\n\nA subsidiary of Apple is the current landlord for the Paterson Charter for Science and Technology – the firm also has had stakes in land ownership for Turkish charter schools in Massachusetts and New York.\n\nJoshua Hendrick, a sociologist at Loyola University and an expert on the Gulen movement, said it was common for staff or board members to have worked at other Turkish-run charter schools across the country. They often use the same Turkish-owned firms for consulting, information technology, construction and other work, he said.\n\nAlp Aslandogan, president of the Alliance for Shared Values, said the hires are a result of networking and aren’t a problem.\n\n“People might come to know about other individuals through their social networks,” he said. “The important issue is if someone is hired by an agency, are they qualified to do the job?”\n\nPioneer Academy sits on 6.3 acres in Wayne. The marble-floored lobby and glass-walled rooms of the private, international school have a polished, modern look. Students put a finger on a scanner atop a turnstile to enter the spacious dining room in a building that is eight times the size of its old home in Clifton.\n\nThe $11 million property, a former corporate campus, was remodeled for the pricey boarding school, which caters to students from Turkey, charges more than $30,000 for tuition and boarding, and adheres to the teachings of Gulen.\n\nAn investigation by The Record and NorthJersey.com found a state-financed sale of property rented by the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology helped to establish this sleek, new campus.\n\nThe sale netted millions for the group that runs Pioneer, which for years served as the charter school’s landlord.\n\nIt also put the charter's new landlord, a subsidiary of Apple Educational Services, a non-profit based in Moonachie, in line to collect taxpayer-funded rents and landlord fees indefinitely.\n\nThe bottom line: A private firm and not the public charter school owns the property and can choose to rent or sell it for a profit. And it began with funding from state taxpayers.\n\nIt’s the result of a complicated series of transactions that began in 2005 when, documents show, the non-profit behind Pioneer, the Milky Way Education Center, bought a building on Lehigh Avenue in Paterson for $2.75 million for the charter school’s use. The next year, the state Economic Development Authority stepped in with an aid package: $5.4 million in tax-free bonds to refinance loans Milky Way took out to buy and renovate the dilapidated industrial property on Lehigh Avenue.\n\nMilky Way collected rent serving as landlord to the Paterson charter – ultimately more than $1 million annually, contracts show.\n\nIn 2012, it sold the Paterson property to the Apple subsidiary for $10.5 million – part of a larger deal also financed by the state.\n\nMilky Way reported a net “gain” of $4.37 million on tax forms and the next year it moved Pioneer from Clifton to Wayne. Pioneer said funds acquired through the sale of the charter property in Paterson were used toward the new building for the private boarding school.\n\nPioneer Principal Tufan Aydin said in an email that Milky Way had invested millions of dollars to renovate the charter building and sold it to focus on its new boarding school, which required “a significant infusion of capital.” He said it approached Apple, which provides services to Pioneer, about purchasing the building.\n\nThe taxpayer-funded Paterson charter school, meanwhile, continues to pay rent on the same site – only now it pays the Apple subsidiary, instead of Milky Way.\n\nIn all, the Apple company received state financing of more than $30 million in 2012 to buy the property from Milky Way and an old mattress factory on West Railway Avenue that it renovated for the creation of the charter’s new high school.\n\nThe charter now pays more than $2.4 million annually to rent both properties – an amount that is more than $400,000 above the debt service on the bonds. Lease and state documents show the landlord can make annual fees amounting to at least 10 percent above the debt payments to bondholders. Over the life of the bonds, that would generate about $12 million.\n\nAn Apple official said in an email this is not all profit to his firm, noting the money goes to pay off other mandatory costs associated with the bonds and for other expenses. He did not provide a breakdown, but described the rent paid by the school as “certainly reasonable and within market pricing.”\n\nState law doesn’t allow charter schools to incur long-term debt, so it’s not uncommon for another entity to get involved. But there’s no limit on how long the charter can pay rent – and no provision in the current leases calling for the property to be transferred to the school once the bonds have been paid off.\n\nThe state Economic Development Authority said it’s not “in its purview” to assess the long-term impact on taxpayers of such deals – or to assure a charter school ends up owning its facility.\n\nBut critics say deals like this can end up hurting taxpayers.\n\nRutgers University Professor Bruce Baker, a nationally recognized expert on education financing, said charter-school economics in New Jersey could benefit outsiders at the expense of the public.\n\n\"In many ways, what we’re seeing is absurd and illogical,” Baker said.\n\nLong-term financing of school facilities made possible via state bonding not only stresses taxpayers but puts pressure on schools to meet annual financial goals amid continuing uncertainties about enrollment, state certification and the availability of qualified teachers, Baker said.\n\nSuch financing is also routinely used by third-party landlords to leverage private ventures, he said, effectively turning taxpayers into a bank for something other than public education. State officials say taxpayers are not exposed because bondholders assume the risk if the school fails.\n\nBut Baker said that does not factor in the millions in tax dollars spent on annual debt-service payments.\n\n”That money is basically pissed away,” he said. “When the bond is repaid and after taxpayers spend all that money, the public doesn’t own the facility.”\n\nApple faced scrutiny over a real-estate deal involving a charter school from government overseers in New York.\n\nIn a 2013 report, state auditors said there was evidence that a deal between the school’s board and Apple was not at arm's length and the firm stood to make to make a 200 percent profit on leasing the property to the school.\n\nAuditors estimated the company spent $1.9 million to purchase and renovate an old YWCA building and stood to net a return of $4.4 million over the life of a 15-year-lease with the charter. The audit did not identify the corporation by name, but online property records show Apple as the owner at that time.\n\nSchool officials disagreed with the findings, claiming the charter and landlord acted independently and had no relationship before the purchase. Contacted by The Record, an official with Apple declined to comment on the criticism leveled by New York.\n\nA loosely affiliated group of schools started largely by Turkish Americans is a growing player among publicly funded charter schools in New Jersey, with campuses at a dozen locations in the northern part of the state.\n\nBelow is a snapshot, taken from 2014-15, of the schools, showing who goes there, how much money they spend, and how they perform.\n\nAnother affiliated school is under development in Union County.\n\nSource: New Jersey 2014-15 School Performance Reports and the Taxpayers' Guide to Education Spending, except for Hudson, which comes from the school itself.\n\nNOTE: By way of comparison, the statewide pass rate on the grade 4 test was 52 percent in English and 42 percent in math.

Education officials ordered the school one year ago to develop a plan to improve diversity when he approved a renewal of the school’s charter agreement.\n\nBoth the Thomas Edison school and Central Jersey College Prep Charter School, also in Somerset, are the subject of a federal complaint filed this month. The complaint alleges that they discriminate in their enrollment, and that they educate fewer students who are low-income, who have disabilities and who are learning English.\n\nThe Latino Coalition of New Jersey and Franklin C.A.R.E.S., a parent advocacy group, are calling for a federal and state investigation.\n\nBoth schools have denied allegations of discrimination and said the complaint was part of an effort “to harass” and “to shut down” public charter schools.\n\nState test data show schools in Bergen and Somerset counties have performed better than statewide averages, as did middle school students at a charter in Passaic city. Schools in Paterson fell below – but they outperformed their home district.\n\nOne of the schools, the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology, landed on probation for nearly a year in 2006 and 2007. Its continuing “weak academic performance” was cited by a Standard & Poor’s credit analyst in lowering the overall outlook on debt associated with the school’s facilities.\n\nThe school, which opened in 2003, had previously been investigated by the state and cited for staffing and financial issues, including hiring teachers without proper certification, possible no-show employees, tenure violations and improper payments of immigration fees.\n\nThe ratings agency downgraded the school's bonds in October 2014, citing both financial and academic issues, falling \"far below\" academic standards in some areas.\n\nA second action by the agency, in February 2016, revised the outlook on the bonds from \"stable\" to \"negative.'' A report at the time cited \"weakened\" cash levels that violated the terms of the school's bond agreement with the state and required the hiring of an outside financial consultant.\n\nA school official, responding to questions from The Record, blamed a drop in state aid and one-time expenses associated with opening a new school for the financial weaknesses. The official, Riza Gurcanli, said that the school continues to operate on a \"tight budget,\" and that the overall fund balance for the 2015-16 school year was positive.\n\nCritics claim the schools are part of a nationwide network of at least 100 charter schools that are tied to the Gulen movement.\n\nIn some states, so-called Gulen schools have been investigated for improper bidding practices that steer contracts to Turkish-owned companies, misuse of a visa program to bring teachers from Turkey, and improper use of a federal grant program. Charters in Ohio and Louisiana were raided by the FBI.\n\nThe growing New Jersey network, however, has received kudos from many parents and politicians.\n\nAssemblyman Gordon Johnson, who has visited two of the charter schools at their invitation, said they provide an alternative for families who may seek a small-school environment in a diverse setting.\n\n“It gives kids a chance in a school with different cultures and languages. They learn and respect each other’s customs,” he said.\n\n“If the students coming out of these schools are prepared to go on to the next state in their education, then that is a good service,” he added.\n\nHendrick, the assistant professor of sociology at Loyola University Maryland who wrote a book about the Gulen movement, said some of the schools have been under investigation over their operations and finances. But many of the schools, he said, are thriving.\n\n“For every one under investigation, there are 10 or 20 more that couldn't be more successful,” he said.\n\nTo his supporters, Fethullah Gulen is an enlightened leader – a modern Islamic visionary who champions education, interfaith dialogue and tolerance.\n\nTo the ruling party in his Turkish homeland, Gulen is a dangerous enemy – a traitor they accuse of plotting a failed coup last July and a terrorist whose followers were alleged to have been behind the assassination of a Russian envoy in Turkey late last year.\n\nThe sharply divergent views on the 75-year-old cleric have deeply divided Turkish society. Now they also are stirring tensions with the U.S. as Recep Erdogan, the Turkish president, has pressed for Gulen’s extradition and sharply criticized the Obama administration for failing to honor that request immediately.\n\nAnd the controversy over Gulen’s status could continue to roil American politics with early indications that the Trump administration might be more sympathetic to Erdogan’s plea.\n\nTrump spoke with Erdogan by phone last week, but a release by the White House about the call did not mention Gulen, instead saying the two men discussed their shared commitment to fighting terrorism. Trump's CIA director flew to Ankara on Thursday, but Trump officials offered no comment about the visit.\n\nMeanwhile, Gulen, who first came to the U.S. in 1999, has remained holed up at his Poconos estate, rarely seen or heard from in public. For the most part, he has allowed a team of handlers to issue statements in his name in which he steadfastly denies involvement in the coup and any terror attacks.\n\nStill, he remains the influential leader of a social and religious movement — called Hizmet, a Turkish word meaning service — with millions of followers in Turkey and around the world who have built businesses, media outlets and schools, including charter schools in the U.S.\n\nThe coup attempt and Turkey's calls for the U.S. to extradite him have prompted closer scrutiny of the Islamic cleric and his movement, and deepened questions about his ultimate agenda.\n\nGulen insists he seeks social, not political, change – through a modern Muslim movement that promotes peace and enlightenment. But critics say he wants to topple the Turkish government so his followers can take power and convert secular Turkey into an Islamic republic.\n\nThey claim he is using a massive network of institutions, including the U.S. charter schools, to build up power and money to further his agenda and convert students to his way of thinking.\n\nAn investigation by The Record uncovered no direct evidence of Gulen’s involvement in the operation of charter schools in New Jersey. But it did reveal a web of connections among key people involved with the schools, the contractors they hire and established Gulenist groups, while it also raised questions about their use of taxpayer funds and state oversight.\n\nErdogan pushed hard for the Obama administration to hand over Gulen, saying the U.S. must choose between Turkey and FETO, an acronym for what he also calls the \"Gulen Terror Group.\" The Trump administration has not yet made any policy announcements on the issue.\n\n“This new generation of a terrorist organization is indeed a national security threat, not only for Turkey but also for all the 170 countries around the world where it is present,” Erdogan said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 13.\n\nThe U.S. State Department does not classify the organization as terrorist. In fact, Gulenist groups have courted American politicians, taking them on trips to Turkey, inviting them to their events, and contributing to their campaigns.\n\nAcademics who studied the movement said Gulen seeks social change and power; some say it’s by democratic means while others argue it is by less-open methods. But they are dismissive of the terrorist label, saying there was no evidence Gulen or his movement carried out bombings or assassinations.\n\n“It’s certainly not a terrorist organization in a conventional sense,” said Michael Reynolds, an assistant professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton. “In some ways it’s more dangerous because of ways they’ve been able to get inside the Turkish state.”\n\nGulen was embraced in the West after 9/11 as a sort of an antidote to Islamic extremism – a moderate leader who swiftly condemned the attacks, rebuked violence and promoted interfaith dialogue.\n\n“No terrorist can be a Muslim, and no true Muslim can be a terrorist,\" Gulen wrote in a statement published the day after the terrorist attacks. \"Islam demands peace, and the Qur’an demands that every true Muslim be a symbol of peace and work to support the maintenance of basic human rights.”\n\nAmerican authorities say Turkey’s extradition request is under review by federal officials, but the countries are bound by a treaty that requires a thorough, lengthy review with standards of evidence to be met.\n\n\"Under our laws, extradition requests must be assessed by an independent federal court, along with the evidence backing them up,\" said a State Department official, who according to agency policy declined to allow her name to be used. \"It always takes time to work through an extradition request, but we will continue to work closely with the Turkish government as this process moves forward.\"\n\nAllies, then a falling-out\n\nGulen was once an ally of Erdogan's and helped his rise to power, before a falling-out several years ago set the stage for a bitter rivalry.\n\nThe cleric, the son of an imam – a clergyman who presides over services at a mosque – was born in a small village near Turkey’s Erzurum province in 1941. He is said to have been inspired by the work of Said Nursi, a Turkish religious reformer who combined traditional Islamic learning with modern scientific knowledge.\n\nThe charismatic preacher rose to prominence starting in the late 1960s, when, as an imam himself, he captivated congregations with speeches on faith while also urging Turks to embrace capitalism, education and social activism. As he traveled and preached, his teachings gained a global following.\n\nIn Turkey, his followers opened businesses, charities and newspapers while also filling ranks in the military and in law enforcement. They are best known, though, for establishing hundreds of schools, first in Turkey, then across the world, that promote math, science and ethics.\n\nGulen supported Erdogan and his rise as prime minister in 2003, where he served for 11 years before his election as president. Both were devout Muslims who opposed the government-enforced secularism that had prevailed in Turkey. They wanted more religious freedom and a more religious society, said Reynolds, the Princeton historian.\n\nBut they had a falling-out in 2013 when officials linked to Gulen brought corruption charges against people close to Erdogan. A power struggle ensued. Erdogan struck back, dismissing police officials, prosecutors and judges believed to be aligned with Gulen.\n\nGulen had clashed with Turkish authorities before Erdogan was even elected to national office. In 1999, a leaked recording surfaced that was said to show Gulen suggesting that his followers infiltrate state institutions.\n\n\"You must move in the arteries of the system without anyone noticing your existence until you reach all the centers of power,\" Gulen said in the recording. “You must wait until such time as you have gotten all the state power, until you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institutions in Turkey.”\n\nGulen said the quotations were taken out of context, but critics saw them as proof that he had been seeking to take power in Turkey. The year the recording was leaked, and shortly before he was charged with treason, Gulen came to the U.S for medical treatment and stayed, settling in a secluded compound in the Poconos community of Saylorsburg, about 10 miles from the New Jersey state line.\n\nOn July 15, a faction of the Turkish military attempted to topple the government, but failed. The violence left more than 260 people dead and many injured. Gulen has denied allegations that he was behind the coup.\n\n“I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey. Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force,” Gulen wrote in a July statement distributed by the Alliance for Shared Values, a U.S.-based organization that speaks for the movement.\n\nJoshua Hendrick, a sociology professor at Loyola University Maryland who has written about Gulen and his movement, said a coup would go against the goals that Gulenists claim to stand for, including peace and democracy.\n\n“In every which way, it contradicts their collective identity and their publicly stated aims,” said Hendrick, author of \"Gülen: The Ambiguous Politics of Market Islam in Turkey and the World.\"\n\nHendrick said that Turkey’s labeling of Gulen and his network as terrorists was intended to have a political impact.\n\n“To compare the Gulen community with armed insurrectionist groups has no historical precedent,” he said. “There is no noted history of violence within this organization, which is again what makes the events of July 15 so challenging for people such as myself to believe.”\n\nCrackdown on Gulen movement\n\nErdogan clamped down after the failed coup, shutting hundreds of schools, businesses and media organizations in Turkey. Thousands of police officers, soldiers, educators and judges tied to the movement also were arrested or thrown out of their jobs.\n\nThe clampdown extended even to the Gulen-inspired private school in Wayne, the Pioneer Academy, that had 178 international students in the last school year, mostly from Turkey. This year, there are just 60.\n\nTufan Aydin, Pioneer’s principal, said many families could not pay tuition because banks were ordered to stop payments to Gulen institutions. Others could not afford it because they or their families had their livelihoods cut short during an attempt by Erdogan, the Turkish president, to purge Gulenists from power and shut down their businesses.\n\n“Parents, they don’t want to have the pressure of sending kids to schools targeted by the prime minister or president,” Aydin said, adding that the schools’ website can no longer be accessed in Turkey.\n\nLast year, the Turkish government hired the London-based law firm Amsterdam & Partners LLP to investigate the global activities of the Gulen movement, including operations of alleged Gulen-linked charter schools in the U.S. Attorney Robert Amsterdam has claimed that the tax dollars that go to support the public schools are being used to raise funds for Gulen and the movement and to employ his followers.\n\nLeaders in those charters schools have said they are secular institutions, with no ties to Gulen and his movement, although some have said they themselves are inspired by the Gulenist commitment to modern education.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey in December, Erdogan alleged that the shooter – an off-duty police officer who said he was angry over Russian intervention in Syria – was linked to Gulen.\n\nA statement released by the Pennsylvania-based cleric said the shooting, which took place at an Ankara art gallery and was captured in a series of jarring photographs, had nothing to do with him or his movement. Rather, Gulen's supporters said, Erdogan was trying to divert attention from security lapses caused by his firing and imprisoning police and counter-terrorism officers for alleged connections to Gulen.\n\n\"While the assertion is wrong and irresponsible, it is not unexpected since Mr. Erdogan blames Mr. Gulen for any and all harm that besets Turkey,\" according to the statement released by the Alliance for Shared Values.\n\nWhen former Vice President Joe Biden visited Ankara, the capital of Turkey, in August, Erdogan urged him to take swift action to hand over Gulen.\n\n\"In light of this extradition treaty, those individuals should be taken into pretrial detention, they should be arrested, and throughout the trial they need to remain in custody,\" Erdogan said, speaking about Gulen. \"This person, however, is currently managing and directing the terrorist organization where he lives\" in Pennsylvania.\n\nBiden responded by touting the U.S. democratic system.\n\n\"What possible motive could we have to, in fact, harbor a terrorist? Why would we do that?\" Biden said. \"It makes absolutely no sense. None whatsoever. We are bound by the law. The president is bound by the law. The court will decide.\"\n\nGulen supporters are concerned with what may happen with the change in administrations in Washington. Trump himself has not talked about Gulen, but in an op-ed piece that retired Gen. Michael Flynn wrote for the congressional newspaper The Hill in November, the ousted national security adviser said the U.S. should not offer Gulen \"a safe haven,\" and likened him to Ayatollah Khomeini, the radical cleric who was the leader of Iran’s Islamic revolution a generation ago.\n\nFlynn also called for the U.S. to strengthen its relationship with Turkey, which he described as “our strongest ally against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), as well as a source of stability in the region.”\n\nHendrick, of Loyola University Maryland, said it was too soon to say whether Trump will seek warmer relations with Turkey, because many factors complicate the relationship.\n\nA law firm representing Gulen said in a statement that it hoped Flynn's op-ed was not a policy statement for Trump.\n\n“The extradition process is a serious one, governed by treaty with Turkey that is clear about the steps that need to be taken in such cases. It should not be a political matter,\" lawyers from the Washington, D.C.-based Steptoe & Johnson LLP said in a statement.\n\nFethullah Gulen quotes from his statements and writings:\n\n“Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force. I pray to God for Turkey, for Turkish citizens, and for all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.”\n\n– July 15, 2016 statement about Turkey coup attempt\n\n“At a time when Western democracies are searching for moderate Muslim voices, I and my friends in the Hizmet movement have taken a clear stance against extremist violence, from the Sept. 11 attacks by Al Qaeda to brutal executions by the Islamic State to the kidnappings by Boko Haram.”\n\n— July 25, 2016 op-ed in the New York Times\n\n\"You must move in the arteries of the system without anyone noticing your existence until you reach all the centers of power. You must wait until such time as you have gotten all the state power, until you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institutions in Turkey.”\n\n– Leaked sermon that aired in 1999 on Turkish television\n\n“With the endeavors of valued people, like yourselves, who have come together to establish a happy world built on universal values and to set up ‘peace islands’ of the future, I hope that this movement will spread and will carry us to the horizon where cultures and civilizations meet and reach a consensus.”\n\n– Message to Gulen followers at a conference on Nov. 11, 2005\n\n“All acts of terrorism are major blows dealt to peace and serenity. No matter what the motive behind it is, an act of terror can by no means be accepted or approved of. Major acts of terror in past years have not only impacted the geography where they were carried out, but have also damaged world peace.”\n\n– Jan. 29, 2011 statement after an attack at an airport in Moscow\n\nThis story was born in the wake of dramatic events last summer occurring half a world away from North Jersey. The Turkish government accused a 75-year-old Islamic cleric living in the Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains of fomenting a brief and bloody rebellion in his native land. The same man, Fethullah Gulen, they’ve long alleged was behind a network of taxpayer-funded charters schools in America.\n\nIn the wake of the failed coup, veteran investigative reporters Jean Rimbach, Jeff Pillets and Hannan Adely were asked to look into a group of taxpayer-funded charter schools in North Jersey that arose from the region’s Turkish community.\n\nThe assignment took The Record team into the murky world of global geo-politics, where the Ankara government’s stark accusations were met with firm denials from Gulen and his followers. But it also led the team's members to the more familiar turf of public education in New Jersey, where what they found had more immediate implications for our readers, raising questions about oversight of the schools and how tax dollars are being spent.\n\nOur reporting team interviewed people involved with the charter schools and Gulenist groups, education experts and the legal representative for the Turkish government, among others, for this story. The team reviewed tax forms, property records, and paperwork on file with the state’s Department of Education and Economic Development Authority, in addition to other sources.\n\nRimbach is an award-winning investigative reporter at The Record. She has covered an array of topics during her time, including criminal justice, child welfare and education.\n\nPillets has honed his skills as a keen government watchdog over a 20-year career, reporting on a variety of topics. Among the numerous honors he has won, he was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize about corruption in a failed development in the Meadowlands known as EnCap.\n\nAdely has been a reporter at The Record for six years and currently covers Muslim and Arab communities in New Jersey, as well as state education news.

If public schools were fully funded we would be more effective at getting students to grade level.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion issues\n\nHow will you navigate the challenges regarding national rhetoric spilling into local schools related to critical race theory, social-emotional learning, LGBTQ inclusion, and equity issues?\n\nCathleen O'Neil Frantz: \"Each of these issues are very separate and need to be considered individually. Some of these issues do not apply to K-8 education. It is imperative that our students receive a well-rounded educational experience that is applicable to their maturity level.\"\n\nPublic education funding\n\nHow do you think the state should support public education? Do you believe in expanding school vouchers?\n\nCathleen O'Neil Frantz: \"As an elementary school board member and a public school teacher, I believe the state needs to regard public education as a profession that should be as highly sought as any other profession. Those in public education are in front of students each and every day. These students are at the center of our communities and our future. The state needs to increase the educator and support staff wages to reflect these important positions.\n\n\"The state needs to fund public schools so that public school districts can offer choice public schools within their districts to meet the needs of the wide variety of diverse learners.\n\n\"I support school vouchers to an extent. Not every school meets the needs of every child. This is why parents should have the opportunity for the choice in their child’s education.\"\n\nProfessional shortages\n\nHow do you plan to address teacher, education professionals and school nurse shortages?\n\nCathleen O'Neil Frantz: \"To address staff shortages we need the state to fund the public school system to be highly competitive in the marketplace. Teaming with community resources, like colleges and universities, is one way to help fill some of the gaps from staff shortages, but it does not solve the problem of uncompetitive wages.\"\n\nCapital projects\n\nSeveral schools in the Valley need long-term repairs and updates. What is your plan to fund renovations?\n\nCathleen O'Neil Frantz: \"As a school board member I have to be fiscally responsible to make sure buildings are maintained, repaired, and updated as needed. The state needs to fully fund public education so that school boards can make these necessary repairs and updates. I will continue to support bond overrides for the district.\"\n\nAdditional information\n\nAnything you would like to add?\n\nCathleen O'Neil Frantz: \"I believe it is very important to have public educators on the school board to represent those who are at school sites every day.

Our district continues to face staffing shortages and is losing teachers and staff at an alarming rate. The same things we employ to attract teachers and staff should be what retains them. We must listen to our teachers and staff and provide them with meaningful and intentional development opportunities.\n\n\"COMMITMENT TO EQUITY\n\n\"Creighton is a diverse, Title I, district. There is so much to celebrate within our district however we are not immune to the unique issues our students face. We must work to heal our relationships and develop equitable policies to operate by to ensure all our students and families thrive.\n\n\"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\n\n\"I believe that schools should be the centers of our communities. Our district serves our community and we should know what’s going on. We need to switch up how we engage families and the community at every step of the way. We have to meet folks where they are at, doing so will only strengthen the education and services we can provide.\"\n\nWhat do you believe to be the biggest issue impacting K-12 students in Arizona?\n\nKatie Gipson Mclean: \"Adequate funding of pubic education which I believe should include funds for extensive social and emotional supports as well.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion issues\n\nHow will you navigate the challenges regarding national rhetoric spilling into local schools related to critical race theory, social-emotional learning, LGBTQ inclusion, and equity issues?\n\nKatie Gipson Mclean: \"I believe that the vast majority of people do not know what critical race theory actually is. The term is thrown around to represent nearly anything that does not subscribe to 'traditional' pedagogy and frankly it’s become a dog whistle of sorts. I believe in teaching accurate history, even if it is uncomfortable because it is imperative we learn from our pasts to improve our futures. I believe in age-appropriate, science-based, sex education. I believe that we must foster a district-wide culture for teachers, staff, families, and students, which is based on inclusivity and care. I will not cower to any outside interests who try to influence changes in the district curriculum based on uneducated, prejudicial, fear-mongering.\"\n\nPublic education funding\n\nHow do you think the state should support public education? Do you believe in expanding school vouchers?\n\nKatie Gipson Mclean: \"The State Legislature should return school funding to pre-1990s levels, adjusted for inflation of course. There has been a strategic assault on public school funding in Arizona for nearly 35 years but what do we have to show for it? Arizona ranks either last or nearly last, in almost all national education rankings. If defunding public education was as successful and equitable as privatization champions believe it to be, where are the statistics that show it? They don’t exist and they never will. Our public schools should be the centers of our communities and our communities will only be as successful as our public schools. We must fully invest in our public schools if we want our communities to thrive.\"\n\nProfessional shortages\n\nHow do you plan to address teacher, education professionals and school nurse shortages?\n\nKatie Gipson Mclean: \"Creighton is facing both a teacher and staffing shortage. We must listen and respond to the needs of our teachers and staff. If we make decisions that center on those who are most impacted, we will usually land closest to where we need to be in order to both attract folks and retain them. It seems simple but it’s surprising how many district administrators don’t actually listen to the needs of their teachers and staff.\"\n\nCapital projects\n\nSeveral schools in the Valley need long-term repairs and updates. What is your plan to fund renovations?\n\nKatie Gipson Mclean: \"I wish we did not have to rely on Capital Overrides for the bulk of our infrastructure budget. However, given budget realities, it is one of the best ways we can leverage resources for much-needed improvements. That being said, one way many districts can cut costs is by closely monitoring contracts after bids are approved. The same small group of contractors has ruled the K-12 education market for quite some time. They are able to bid low and win contracts. However, once work begins we see multiple requests for increases in budgets outside of the originally approved contract amounts. While there have been improvements in laws regarding the bid systems we must do more to ensure transparency in our bidding processes and we must ensure that we are not consistently awarding contracts to companies who begin work only to request additional funding.\"\n\nAdditional information\n\nAnything you would like to add?\n\nKatie Gipson Mclean: \"Our cities and counties should do more to help improve K-12 education. These governmental entities can help improve public health initiatives and nutrition programs. Cities can fully fund head start programs and beef up after-school programs and summer school programs. They can also do more to assist with college and/or career preparation. The legislature may not be in a political space to fully fund public schools but other government offices have the ability to help in innovative ways.\"\n\nDeer Valley Unified School District\n\nSix people filed signatures to run for two four-year seats on the Deer Valley Unified School District governing board.\n\nCandidates are Craig Beckman, Paul Carver, Stephanie Simacek and Tony Bouie.

I form opinions and beliefs based on verifiable evidence and facts. Elections are highly regulated and operate with a huge amount of oversight. I believe in a healthy amount of doubt and scrutiny, but all of the verifiable evidence has pointed to a fair and secure election.\"\n\nPaul Carver: \"If you are asking if I believe in the accuracy of the 2020 election results, the answer is no. There are too many irregularities across the Country for the certification to have taken place. There are processes by which these concerns can be remedied and while facts have proven that many states have done less than their level best to maintain voter roll integrity and protect the purity of the right to vote nothing has been done by those in elected and appointed positions of authority to prove the results. In a day and age where the population grows less trusting of our own government would it not be in the Country and the election processes' best interest to be transparent and prove out the results no matter which way they may go?\"\n\nStephanie Simacek: \"I do believe in the 2020 election results.\"\n\nMain ideas\n\nBased on the limitations and powers of a school board member, what’s your platform?\n\nCraig Beckman: \"When elected, I’ll use my position as a governing board member to help improve the relationships between all stakeholder groups through communication. Our students, parents, teachers, and community members deserve a high level of communication regarding policies that will impact them, how their tax dollars are being spent, what issues need to be addressed, and what accomplishments we’re celebrating. With my background and experience in marketing and communications, I’ll work to identify new communication channels, improve communications clarity, and standardize communications processes and expectations.\n\n\"I will continue to fight for the rights of our students, regardless of their religion, race, socioeconomic status, gender, and any other protected class. Our district is very diverse, making it of the utmost importance that we represent the needs and values of our students. We need to ensure that all students in the district have equal access to opportunities and the resources they need for success.\n\n\"I believe in preparing our students for life, and the state-mandated curriculum only puts a small dent in that mission. So, in addition to the constant refinement of our current curriculum, I will advocate for financial literacy training, comprehensive technology programs, teaching communication skills, global studies, critical thinking skills, life skills, and much more. I want to empower teachers with the curriculum they need to give our students a path to success right out of high school.\n\n\"Around the state and country, special education programs have been suffering from a lack of resources and staff. Although we have one of the best programs in the valley, DVUSD is not immune to these challenges. I believe we have a moral obligation as a district, community, and society to provide the resources and educators to help these students succeed. I will advocate for increased pay and support for our special education staff and work on revising our district's IEP/504 processes, making it easier for our students to get the support they need.\n\n\"Parental involvement is very important — studies have shown that it’s key to the success of students. I will work to communicate with parents and guardians, opportunities for them to be involved in all levels of their children's education. Whether it be helping with homework, joining a PTSA/PTSO group, reviewing curriculum adoptions, or having a voice in the district decision-making process, I want to provide opportunities for these stakeholders to be involved in a healthy way.\"\n\nPaul Carver: \"While there are seemingly countless issues to address, I believe the greatest good can come from (1) protecting the Parental Bill of Rights: ensuring that the parent has the primary say in the care and education of their children. We are not a ‘nanny state’. The education system's responsibility is to educate the children, not raise the children. (2) Budget and Curriculum Transparency; the State of Arizona spends over half its annual budget on education and while the Legislature continues to increase K-12 funding these funds are not making it (dollar for dollar) to the classroom and the Teachers. (3) Curriculum continues to evolve at a breakneck speed with little to no regard for the opinions of the community and the parents. It is the School Board's responsibility to be the liaison from the Community to the Administration to address concerns by either correcting the Administration's course or through educating the community on the need for the enacted processes and curriculum.\"\n\nStephanie Simacek: \"Being a member of the school board should not be about politics, it should be about doing what is best for public education which includes meeting the needs of all students and supporting our families, teachers and staff. Success can only be accomplished by someone who has the desire to work closely and effectively with everyone. Someone who believes we must not take for granted the future of our communities.\n\n\"I am running because there are both immediate and long-term issues that need to be addressed and most of them go hand-in-hand. They include but are not limited to reducing class sizes, teacher retention, livable wages, strong support for special education and gifted programs, parent communication and campus improvement plans to make our schools safe for all students and staff. I am running so I can advocate for all of it.\"\n\nTony Bouie: \"I will work within the statutory boundaries of the position to help the Superintendent create scholastic results that meet and/or exceed the expectations of students, parents, teachers and other stakeholders.\"\n\nWhat do you believe to be the biggest issue impacting K-12 students in Arizona?\n\nCraig Beckman: \"Hands down, the biggest issue impacting our K-12 schools is the shortage of qualified educators and staff. We need to ensure that DVUSD utilizes the funding we have to hire and retain qualified educators. I will advocate for DVUSD to find ways to increase wages, improve benefits, and foster an environment that helps us in our mission of retaining and attracting great staff.\"\n\nPaul Carver: \"The most concerning issue for our children in our schools today is the overall underperformance. Math and Reading proficiency scores are hovering slightly under 60%. The concept of social promotion has us to a point where our children are poorly suited to compete in the World Market upon graduation from High School. We must identify the challenges some students have and help them to overcome those challenges so they can enjoy success. This is not accomplished by simply passing the child on when they are unable to perform at grade level in basic reading, writing and arithmetic. We must instill in our children the desire to succeed and provide them tools to do so.\"\n\nStephanie Simacek: \"There are many education-related issues that I am concerned about. On top of my list is advocating for smaller class sizes and teacher retention. Currently, our kindergarten classes need 27 plus one in order to qualify for another teacher. That's one teacher for 28 students. It ranges by grade, for example, fourth grade needs 33 to get a second classroom added. It has been said that high school and middle school numbers range between 28 and 29 students. I've seen firsthand that that's simply not true. There's definitely a high student-to-teacher ratio in the district with no teacher assistants. I believe that not only do our students do better academically in smaller learning environments, but our teachers thrive as well. Teachers actually get to teach and they get to focus on students. They get to learn their learning styles. They get to build a relationship with their students which in turn helps lead to higher teacher retention. Teachers that are more happy and doing what they want to do, which is to teach, are more likely to stay instead of getting burned out. I believe we need to also increase our teacher pay as well as provide lower cost benefits. Teachers can't be spending half of their paycheck to cover their health insurance. They just simply don't get paid enough to do so. We need to provide them with a livable wage. I believe by doing all of this, we are showing respect for our teachers and for their families. This helps retain teachers and it helps our students and our families in the district.\"\n\nTony Bouie: \"The challenges resulting from teacher staffing have a negative impact on students in the system. Teacher staffing, pay, scholastic grading, and indoctrination-oriented curriculum are key areas of concern.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion issues\n\nHow will you navigate the challenges regarding national rhetoric spilling into local schools related to critical race theory, social-emotional learning, LGBTQ inclusion, and equity issues?\n\nCraig Beckman: \"The rhetoric takes our focus away from the real issues our students, parents, and staff face. We have staffing issues, behavioral concerns, academic policy improvements, and a lack of parental involvement to address. We're wasting every minute we spend on issues that aren’t affecting our students. Critical Race Theory doesn’t exist in our district, and if it was presented as a curriculum, it would be voted down.\n\n\"That being said, I believe that we should be offering the best curriculum available to our students. That includes history from a wide variety of perspectives, social-emotional learning programs that benefit our students and staff's mental health and wellness, and learning about and celebrating the differences in what makes each of us unique. We cannot prepare our students for the real world by ignoring that each of us has unique qualities and beliefs that make us who we are.\n\n\"I believe that each student has the right to equal education and treatment no matter who they are, what they believe, or where they come from. I will fight for every student’s right to exist and be who they are without harassment or bullying.\"\n\nPaul Carver: \"National Rhetoric is exactly correct, and the schools are not the battlefield for these ideological wars. There are protections and policies in place that have been in place for many years that protect all children and encourage the equal and fair treatment of them. Schools should not be pawns for social experimentation whether regarding race, gender or religion. Children should attend school to learn the ABC’s and 123’s, not receive their daily dose of right or left leaning moral principles. Morality and the like are a topic for parents to take up. Educators have enough on their plate trying to help children learn at a pace that will allow them to grow without having to deal with the political ‘flavor’ of the day.\"\n\nStephanie Simacek: \"I'll talk first about the legislative attempts to ban certain types of books. I believe that our children must have access to a variety of books for which they can learn from different perspectives. A great way for teachers to teach lessons and lead class discussion is through novel studies. I also support a parent's choice in regards to their child's reading, but I don't believe this should be dictated by our legislation. If a parent chooses to remove their child from a particular book study that they feel uncomfortable about, that is their choice, however, that should not be taken away from the other students' learning experiences.\n\n\"I want to touch on Critical Race Theory (CRT) because it is a big discussion right now. I think that there is a little bit of confusion. The acronym gets thrown around a lot, however not in the correct way. It is often used as a way of thinking that teachers or administration are trying to teach CRT in our schools, which is simply not true. CRT is a collegiate-level course. It is not something that belongs in K-12 and is not being taught in Deer Valley either. There is a difference between teaching history and teaching CRT and CRT is a collegiate-level course.\n\n\"With regards to teaching history, as the saying goes: those who do not learn from history and those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it. I want to address two things. One, I do not support the rewriting of history. Saying that something did not happen or did not exist, doesn't remove it from history. Second, changing the name of something that happened in order to make it appealing to others is changing history. We can't change what happened in the past, but we can learn from the past and that's how we grow. We have to have that for our students.\n\n\"I want to also add that we can't be naive and think that kids won't bring up topics that might be viewed as inappropriate. That's just life. That's how kids are. Currently teachers don't have a responsibility to bring up those topics, but if they are approached by a student and they do arise, an educator needs to be able to foster a discussion that's appropriate for the age level. For example, what might be discussed in high school is not appropriate for a first grader or second grader. Without weighing in, on their personal beliefs and then Title IX protects most of these types of discussions. So, in an effort to argue against it, it could actually result in lawsuits for our district which would then end up costing us millions of dollars. We need to be respectful of that as well. Similar to books, I believe if a parent does not want their child to participate in a particular lesson or discussion or curriculum they might feel is controversial or against their family's values, then they have the right to remove their child from that.\n\n\"With regards to discrimination against our LGBTQ community of students, I truly believe that every child deserves the right to equal access to public education no matter their race, their ethnic background, their religion, their gender, their socioeconomic status or citizen status. I will not tolerate discrimination against our LGBTQ community. This topic also falls under Title IX and the 1964 Civil Rights Act and discrimination based on gender and sexuality has been ruled on by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\nTony Bouie: \"National concerns should not affect local governance. All curricula should be transparent to parents, aligned with district policies and age appropriate. Equality of access should be the focus and not equity of outcome.\"\n\nPublic education funding\n\nHow do you think the state should support public education? Do you believe in expanding school vouchers?\n\nCraig Beckman: \"Our state needs to support our public education system by funding it. We’ve been at the bottom for per-student investment and teacher pay for as long as anyone can remember. We cannot continue to blame our teachers and schools for being understaffed and lacking resources when we don’t fund them.\n\n\"Our state needs to support our public education system by rejecting legislation that puts more work on our already-stressed educator workforce. We cannot continue to add duties and responsibilities to our educators and staff without compensating or supporting them for the additional efforts. Teachers become such because they have a passion for education and teaching our next generation. It’s not for the money, and it’s not for the fame. We need to be introducing legislation that helps our teachers succeed, not drive them away.\n\n\"Arizona voters have made it very clear that they didn’t want the ESA programs expanded universally, and HB2853 does exactly that. Private and charter schools will now have the ability to receive taxpayer dollars taken away from Public Schools with much less accountability. When a school can violate equal rights, ignore Title IX protections, and exclude students based on their special needs, they shouldn’t be taking away from public programs that are required to meet those standards and provide those services. For these reasons, I do not support the expansion of vouchers.\"\n\nPaul Carver: \"It is incumbent upon the Legislature, according to the Arizona State Constitution, to provide education at as nearly zero a cost as possible. Likewise, the Board and Administration are required to be proper stewards of the public monies to meet the educational needs of the students. Vouchers are a form of payment directed to assist those children who receive services through institutions such as the Arizona State Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. As I am sure no one would argue the necessity for specialized care for children falling under this classification, I imagine you are asking more specifically about the Empowerment Scholarship Accounts (ESA). The need for the ESA Program or ‘School Choice’ arose through parental demand to address the increasing failure of some public schools to provide a safe environment for our children and to learn proven principles. Parents must do what is necessary to provide for their children, and to attempt to hold the child and parent hostage by not allowing them to go to the school of their choice is unacceptable. Children are only children for a fraction of their life and the parent is charged with the safety and education of that child. If we want to consider ESA a bad thing, then we should analyze why the parents and children leave and address those issues. For the most part the exodus from public schools boils down to the loss of parental rights and lack of safety for the child. It is not Anti-School to support ESA but rather it is Pro-Freedom.\"\n\nStephanie Simacek: \"I am an advocate for public education. I always have been. The ESA voucher expansion bill that recently passed could have been used for funding public education. In 2018 Arizona voters voted against the expansion of vouchers through a proposition and yet this bill was later pushed through the legislation. This was completely disrespectful to the voters and what people had voted against. The people spoke through their vote yet our state completely disregarded those voices. Vouchers already divert about $350 million from our public schools every year. So, to expand another billion dollars on vouchers is just taking money away from our public education system. Private schools that receive vouchers, don't allow us as taxpayers to see where those dollars are being used. Our public schools have to prove what and how they spend taxpayer dollars. Public schools allow every child to attend as they should. They have to show standardized testing performance, constant student and teacher improvement, school improvement plans, planning groups in order to keep our funding or to ask for more funding.\n\n\"There is no financial or academic accountability for private schools that receive vouchers. As a state, Arizona already spends the least amount per child in the entire nation. We had $5.3 billion sitting on the table for public education and instead legislators put it towards voucher expansion — this is just a slap in the face for public education. It is not the time to divert funding from desperately needed programs that we need in our public schools. Lawmakers need to focus on making investments in our public education, especially special education for the 96 percent of special education students who attend our public schools. We must continue to fight voucher expansion and focus on properly funding our public schools.\"\n\nTony Bouie: \"School voucher expansion is a legislative concern and not the school board. I will work with the administration, parents and teachers to provide the best public education possible, regardless of competition in the educational landscape.\"\n\nProfessional shortages\n\nHow do you plan to address teacher, education professionals and school nurse shortages?\n\nCraig Beckman: \"This really comes down to the budget at the state level. However, I believe that Deer Valley Unified School District needs to do everything we can to maximize our budget to address these issues. But it’s not just about pay. Teachers and staff deserve far more than we can currently pay them, but they need the support of our administrators and appreciation of our community just as much as they need a bigger paycheck. I believe that we can help improve the relationship between our staff and the community through communication, transparency, and parental involvement.\"\n\nPaul Carver: \"As with the reason for parents withdrawing children from schools the same reasons can be applied to why we are so shorthanded regarding Educators and Staff. As previously mentioned, our Educators are busy enough trying to serve all children equally and get them the education they need to succeed in the World. And as if that isn’t enough on their plates Administrations are continually adding nuances to the classroom. With a continually changing job title and still being compensated toward the lower end of the ranking in the 50 states, (#42) it is no wonder why there is a mass exodus of Teachers from our schools. We are allowing for unacceptable workplace practices to exist that create too much stress, too much ambiguity and little compensation.\"\n\nStephanie Simacek: \"Our teachers and staff are what make this district one of the best in Arizona and we have a responsibility as a community to come together and support our professionals. As I previously mentioned we need to continue to increase pay as well as provide lower-cost benefits. We need to provide a livable wage so our professionals are not working multiple jobs. That being said, we need more state support — the school district can only do so much, therefore working with state legislators to support public education is extremely important.\"\n\nTony Bouie: \"A deep dive of school funding is appropriate, possibly through a study session(s). Accepting out-of-state certifications is a potential option as well as revisiting teacher-pay so it is in line with similar-sized districts.\"\n\nCapital projects\n\nSeveral schools in the Valley need long-term repairs and updates. What is your plan to fund renovations?\n\nCraig Beckman: \"We’re very lucky to have schools that are well taken care of in DVUSD. That’s not to say that everything is 100% perfect, but our facilities team does a great job of keeping our campuses in great condition. If an issue required additional funding for repair or renovations, I would advocate using every resource available to ensure that our students can thrive in a safe and conducive learning environment.\"\n\nPaul Carver: \"School Districts as well as many levels of government could do better to manage the taxpayer dollars they are given to address such issues. In the case of infrastructure repairs there is a process that exists that allows schools to apply for funding from the State that does not need to be repaid. This process is already completely funded, and a District only needs to apply to be eligible for the funds. This is the best mechanism by which schools can maintain proper facilities.\"\n\nStephanie Simacek: \"DVUSD actually does a very good job taking care of our schools. Our community has been wonderful in supporting bonds that allow us to keep our campuses in great shape and even provide expansions when necessary. By no means am I saying our district is perfect in this area. There will always be changes that are necessary to keep our schools safe for students and staff and I support it 100%. I will always advocate for campus improvements and community support so that we can make sure our staff and students can flourish in their learning environments.\"\n\nTony Bouie: \"Planning for long-term CAPEX is important and should be planned now. There may be federal funding available for building repairs and upgrades. These options should be considered prior to considering the taxpayers to fund CAPEX projects, especially in a time of significant inflation.\"\n\nAdditional information\n\nAnything you would like to add?\n\nCraig Beckman: \"Whether you’re a parent or not, I encourage everyone to research their school board candidates. These elected positions will have an impact on our communities for years to come — they affect community growth, home values, and will make decisions that concern our community’s youth.\n\n\"Education is no place for politics, religion, or personal agenda. I am running to better serve our kids, parents, staff, and community. I will continue to advocate for students and families, work to provide support for our educators and staff, and lay the groundwork so that students of the future can benefit from what we’ve built together.\"\n\nPaul Carver: \"The contention and animosity that currently resides between so many School Boards and the Community cannot be allowed to continue. It is taking away from all the good work that Administrations, Educators and Students are accomplishing. We are all here for the children and if you do not have the children’s best interest at heart, if you are contributing to this bitterness and division then you do not belong in the process. Transparency and Accountability are sorely missing and there is no time to wait to hope it clears up.

How long have you lived in Maricopa County, what do you do for a living, and any additional information about yourself you think voters would like to know about you.\n\nFrancisca Montoya: \"My name is Francisca Montoya and I have lived in Maricopa County for the past 59 years. I am employed as Director of Community Development & Special Projects with a national Community Development Financial Institution located in Phoenix. I have lived in the Fowler Elementary School District for the past 22 years.\"\n\nLeezah Sun: \"I am State House Elect Leezah Sun. I’ve lived in Maricopa County for 17 years. I am a stay-at-home mother, Founder of Strength in Unity, and a committed community activist. I registered to vote for the very first time in 2018 and ran for public office in 2019 for the State House (previously LD 19). \"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"My name is Dr. Marvene Lobato. I have lived in the Fowler Elementary School District for 17 years. I have served as a public educator for 40 years in Arizona and Colorado. My experience in public education includes the following positions: Elementary Teacher, Elementary Principal, Director of Elementary Education, Business Manager, Executive Director for Business Services, Assistant Superintendent of Instructional Services and Superintendent. I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Northern Colorado in Elementary Education. My Master of Arts degree is in Educational Leadership from Northern Arizona University. I received my Doctorate of Education degree from Argosy University-Phoenix, in Higher Education Teaching and Learning.\n\n\"I am a strong advocate for students to receive optimal learning experiences that will enhance their interest in exploring and learning. I believe that every student should be provided with opportunities that highlight their areas of strength and provide resources to address their areas of challenge. I have been the voice for students and families at the local and state level. I continue to serve on a Maricopa County Foster Care Review Board and serve as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA).\n\n\"I live by the following quotes:\n\n\"'Every student can learn, just not on the same day, or the same way.' — George Evans \"'Never look down on anybody, unless you are helping them up.' — Rev. Jesse Jackson.\"\n\n2020 election results\n\nDo you believe in the 2020 election results?\n\nFrancisca Montoya: \"I believe the results of the 2020 election results and that Joe Biden won.\"\n\nLeezah Sun: \"Yes.\"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"Yes, I believe the results of the 2020 election have been validated.\"\n\nMain ideas\n\nBased on the limitations and powers of a school board member, what’s your platform?\n\nFrancisca Montoya: \"Two of the major issues in my platform are to implement strategies to address the learning loss of the pandemic and close the achievement gap, and to provide much-needed support to our teachers and staff.\"\n\nLeezah Sun: \"My platform is to increase the public school budget and to educate the community about the dangers of voucher expansion and further privatization of school funding. I believe there are many ways we can reduce the school-to-prison pipeline, expand funds for teachers, students, and staff, and make important changes to improve Arizona for the better.\"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"As a Governing Board Member, I will strive to oversee the financial and instructional departments of the school district. Sound finance practices are imperative to ensure teachers and students have what they need in the classroom. I will advocate for increased state funding and develop strategies to increase student enrollment. Continuing to work toward closing the achievement gap by addressing student learning loss is important. I will work toward funding professional development opportunities that align with the needs of employee groups. I will prioritize consistent forms of communication with parents and the community.\"\n\nWhat do you believe to be the biggest issue impacting K-12 students in Arizona?\n\nFrancisca Montoya: \"I believe the biggest issue impacting K-12 students in Arizona is the state legislature's unwillingness to prioritize public education and provide the funding necessary for our students to succeed.\"\n\nLeezah Sun: \"I believe Arizona has been experiencing a crisis of public education funding for quite some time, and it’s ultimately students, working families, and quality teachers who get the short end of the stick. A lot of discourse on public schools tends to revolve around the misinformation surrounding so-called 'CRT' or various other issues, which is ultimately a distraction; and only further turns people towards expanding voucher and charter school programs, lining the pockets of private industry.\"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"The on-set of the pandemic caused chaos for many school districts nationwide. School districts scrambled to provide computers for each student and a learning management system for instruction. Many public educators were not prepared to teach students remotely. Families faced the dilemma of technology and internet accessibility for their children to attend school online. Students had the most burden placed on them when the pandemic interfered with their learning. Students were isolated with limited assistance from an adult as they attended class online. The one-on-one interaction students had with their teacher in the past was sometimes nonexistent. Everyone did their best, but in many cases student achievement growth was stifled.\n\n\"The biggest issue impacting K-12 students in Arizona is addressing the learning that did not take place during the pandemic. Educators need to identify the support needed to identify the needs of each student and initiate reasonable achievement plans by grade levels and grade bands. Student achievement has declined and is visible in classrooms today. Educators value partnerships with parents and will embrace the opportunity to work alongside them to assist students in making up missed learning.\n\n\"The impact the pandemic has had on education will be felt for quite a while.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion issues\n\nHow will you navigate the challenges regarding national rhetoric spilling into local schools related to critical race theory, social-emotional learning, LGBTQ inclusion, and equity issues?\n\nFrancisca Montoya: \"Given the student population we serve, equity has been at the forefront of our decision-making process. We strive to implement policy using an equity lens in teaching, staffing, programs, and school operations.\"\n\nLeezah Sun: \"I think that a lot of these issues are a distraction to disparage public schools and their curriculums. I am certainly concerned about racial and economic equity, especially as it relates to public school funding. I believe there is a lot of misinformation about CRT, which, if you dig into it, is really only something people would be taught in higher education and not K-12 classrooms. I think it’s important for students to learn about American History holistically, and that includes learning about some unsavory parts of our history, such as slavery or the history of racism in America. Of course, I also support LGBTQ students and their inclusion in any aspect of a school environment.\"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"All students have the right to a free public education. Students are protected by federal, state and local laws against discrimination in education. Students and educators deserve to attend and work in schools free from biases and any divisive issues. All students and educators should feel included and treated fairly. School districts are responsible for meeting the needs of its students. Fowler Elementary School District (FESD) has observant educators who are accessible and conscientious. They react quickly and appropriately to social issues that surface on campuses. If the time comes to add any social issues to the curriculum, then curriculum adoption policies should be followed. Parents should be involved and informed of any recommended curriculum changes. FESD educators and parents have worked well together in the past because they are all invested in student success.\"\n\nPublic education funding\n\nHow do you think the state should support public education? Do you believe in expanding school vouchers?\n\nFrancisca Montoya: \"For years the state has passed legislation requiring changes in education without provided funding. Stop unfunded mandates. I do not believe in school vouchers.\"\n\nLeezah Sun: \"I believe we need to restore funding back to public schools. Arizona continually ranks low in academic performance because we are not investing in our public schools, students, teachers, and working families. I do not believe in expanding school vouchers — I think they’re part of the problem. I would like corporate politicians and private interests to stay out of our state’s education funding.\"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"Arizona continually ranks near the bottom of states for per pupil spending. School districts struggle every year because their budgets are dictated by the outcomes of each legislative session. Education has not been a priority during legislative sessions. Providing adequate funding to educate students should be one of the most important items discussed and agreed upon during legislative sessions. The legislature fails to invest appropriately in the state’s future. However, legislation impacting education is passed year after year with minimal to no funding. School districts scramble to find funding somewhere for new mandates. The state legislature passed a budget in June that included more than $600 million to new, permanent funding for K-12 education. The aggregate expenditure limit must be lifted or school districts across the state will not be able to spend approximately $1.3 billion that has already been allocated. Governor Ducey needs to call for a special session of the state legislature to lift the limit. Support for public education could start with the legislature lifting the aggregate expenditure limit. The state needs to provide appropriate funding for education or at a minimum start funding mandates that are passed during legislative sessions.\n\n\"School vouchers should not be expanded. Stricter oversight is needed to ensure compliance with school voucher statute requirements.\"\n\nProfessional shortages\n\nHow do you plan to address teacher, education professionals and school nurse shortages?\n\nFrancisca Montoya: \"In the last year, our district has had to recruit teachers from the Philippines and Mexico to meet the teacher shortages. For years we’ve had a partnership with the University of Wisconsin Lacrosse, they send their education majors to do their student teaching in our district, and some return to teaching upon graduation. Our staff also travel out of state to recruit new teachers.\"\n\nLeezah Sun: \"Again, we need to expand funding, take a look at the budget, and reallocate where applicable. Even when you look at national comparisons, you can see we don’t compensate our teachers, administrators, or staff appropriately. Charter schools are also for-profit businesses, which ultimately absorb state education funding and diminish public staff and teacher pay.\"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"Fowler Elementary School District (FESD) is fortunate to have established a partnership with Cartwright Elementary School District (CESD) and Ottawa University Arizona (OUAZ). In August 2021 the school districts collaborated with OUAZ and created “Ottawa Grow Our Own” teaching program. After months of meetings and planning employees of both school districts who were interested in the teaching profession were able to enroll and commence with classes in March 2022. Instructional assistants, clerical staff and custodians are currently students in the cohort. Students are offered courses in the school districts to alleviate traveling and online learning. OUAZ is dedicated to supporting the cohort and offering individual assistance. Students will be graduating at various times due to their previous college credits.\n\n\"FESD has been partners with International Alliance Group (IAG) for a few years. IAG has worked diligently to secure great teachers from other countries. The district currently has teachers from the Philippines, Costa Rica and Mexico. These teachers have assimilated well and are committed to their students and colleagues.\n\n\"Continuing to research partnerships to address employee shortages is vital.\"\n\nCapital projects\n\nSeveral schools in the Valley need long-term repairs and updates. What is your plan to fund renovations?\n\nFrancisca Montoya: \"Because of the lack of infrastructure support from the state, our school district has had to seek electorate support for school bonds to fund major repairs and renovations of an older building.\"\n\nLeezah Sun: \"We need to expand funding from the state budget and allocate the necessary resources. We have to work to educate people on these issues, as well as bring more awareness to all of the ways in which education has been neglected. We can take a look at prior propositions which would expand funding, and create new legislation which would make special provisions for infrastructure.\"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"Due to a lack of sufficient capital funding by the state, the school district has relied on the community to pass bond elections to ensure capital improvements can be made. Thanks to a caring community, the district has been able to address any building repairs, carpet and laminate replacement through the sale of bonds.\"\n\nAdditional information\n\nAnything you would like to add?\n\nLeezah Sun: \"I want to emphasize that private companies have no place in our school education budgets. A lot of our marginalized communities are left out to dry in school-to-prison pipelines. Especially in Westside Phoenix and South Phoenix, there are high concentrations of charter schools for the rich, but no budget for public education. We need more school counselors and mental health services instead of SROs. Our communities are still segregated racially and economically, and this is very much pronounced in the public education system. It’s time to improve education for everyone in this state, pay our teachers, invest in our students and resources, and stop giving handouts to private industry.\"\n\nMarvene Lobato: \"When I moved to Phoenix 17 years ago, I made the decision to purchase a home in the Fowler Elementary School District. My reason was simple. It was important to me to pay property taxes in the same district where I was employed. It was also important for me to be vested in the community. I desired to know my neighbors and their children, our students. I have enjoyed living in our community. I would appreciate your vote on Tuesday, November 8th.\"\n\nLaveen Elementary School District\n\nFour people are running for two open four-year seats on the Laveen Elementary School District governing board.\n\nCandidates include Linda Abegg, Simir Rand and incumbents Fern Ward and Jill Barragan.\n\nRyan Senters will be appointed to one two-year seat.\n\nBarragan did not submit her answers by the time of publishing. Senters did not respond to The Republic's attempts to reach him.\n\nIntroductions\n\nCan you introduce yourself please? How long have you lived in Maricopa County, what do you do for a living, and any additional information about yourself you think voters would like to know about you.\n\nFern Ward: \"I’m Fern Ward. I am an 'almost' native. I’ve lived in Maricopa County for 61 years and in Laveen for 40. I’m retired from the corporate world but continue as I always have, to volunteer in and support my community. I’ve been married to Richard for 43 years and we have two children and five grandchildren.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"I am a 15 year resident of Laveen. I serve the community as: the community advocate that led successful efforts to get 3 new City parks in our area, Vice Chair of the Laveen Village Planning Committee, member of the Laveen district's self insurance Trust Board, weekly classroom volunteer and frequent PTA board member, church teacher and youth leader. I believe strongly in contributing to the community. My degree and first career were in elementary school teaching. For the last 13 years I have been working from home while raising my 3 sons (teaching preschool and working for a local behavioral health transportation company).\"\n\nSimir Rand: \"My name is Simir Rand. I have been a Maricopa County resident since 1993. I am a school counselor. I moved to Laveen in 2012 and active in the Laveen community in 2013; my involvement includes secretary of the Laveen Community Council and member on the Arizona Hospital community board – Dignity Health – Laveen and Mesa.\"\n\n2020 election results\n\nDo you believe in the 2020 election results?\n\nFern Ward: \"Absolutely YES.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"Yes.\"\n\nSimir Rand: \"I believe that the 2020 election results were valid. President Biden won 81,283,361 votes versus former President Trump 74,222,960. Voter fraud was not a part of the findings. Six states were disputed and there were no substantial evidence showing inappropriateness according to the Associated Press.\"\n\nMain ideas\n\nBased on the limitations and powers of a school board member, what’s your platform?\n\nFern Ward: \"I believe that children should have equitable experiences (i.e. participation in extracurricular activities regardless of ability to pay), that teachers are professionals who deserve the income and prestige that their profession deserves, that public schools are the nucleus of a successful society, that teacher to student ratio must be maintained to a reasonable and logical level, that school buildings are safe and secure, that we maintain the best teachers and staff, and I commit to doing my best to keep our schools and communities physically and mentally healthy.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"I am committed to being a school board member who researches the issues, thinks critically, invites a variety of voices to the table, and considers all points of view so that the diverse needs of our children can be met. I will not make decisions lightly nor based on political rhetoric. I bring to the table the perspective of a Laveen mom, teacher, and involved neighbor. Our children, community, and teachers will be my priority.\"\n\nSimir Rand: \"My platform is to support the needs of students while collaborating with the Laveen community.\"\n\nWhat do you believe to be the biggest issue impacting K-12 students in Arizona?\n\nFern Ward: \"Mental health. Children spent the past 3 years being taught to ‘wash your hands’ and ‘stay 6 feet away’, and ‘wear a mask or you could kill grandma’. Humans crave closeness, friendships and feeling safe. Children can’t learn if they are not having their emotional needs met.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"While each community has its own issues, however, one seemingly universal trend is not having the qualified teachers and staff needed to run all of our programs. No matter what programs are approved and planned, without qualified teachers and support staff, we fall short.\"\n\nSimir Rand: \"Arizona’s lifestyle ranking is overall low. For example, health care 21; education 46; economy 7; opportunity 40. Funding is the source of our failing system. Arizona spends approximately $8888 per student. Only half of that amount is spent on instruction. Prop 208 could potentially address the state's funding issue as it will continue to cause AZ to tax higher income earners to increase funding for education.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion issues\n\nHow will you navigate the challenges regarding national rhetoric spilling into local schools related to critical race theory, social-emotional learning, LGBTQ inclusion, and equity issues?\n\nFern Ward: \"By standing on the truth. Our teachers are professionals, social-emotional learning is a good thing, teachers and staff must be representative of the community they serve including teachers who are LGBTQ+, racially diverse, disabled, etc., utilizing every opportunity to break barriers through knowledge and relationships.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"Each of these is a complex issue and I am firmly committed to the nonpartisan nature of this school board position. Party rhetoric will not be a part of my decision making. I will take the time to study the details of each issue including research supporting different points of view. I will also invite all stakeholders, including parents, to share their input as my role is to represent the interests of my constituents.\"\n\nSimir Rand: \"CRT is a cross-disciplinary examination by social and civil rights scholars and activists to explore how laws, social and political movements and media shapes social conceptions of race and ethnicity. As it relates to education, it is a system that recognizes that racism is not isolated to bias and prejudice. Some school districts are creating framework called diversity equality initiative to address these specific equities.\"\n\nPublic education funding\n\nHow do you think the state should support public education? Do you believe in expanding school vouchers?\n\nFern Ward: \"As an endorsed candidate of Save Our Schools, my platform is clear. The state is obligated to fund public education per Article 11 Section 1 of the Arizona Constitution. We are currently 49th in per pupil funding. Our teachers are doing more with less every year. The State’s support has been a dismal failure. We need sustainable funding for education that meets the needs of our students; funding at a level that supports achievement, safe learning environments, and high-quality wellness for every student.\"\n\n\"No. Arizona already has robust school choice. Sending public taxpayer dollars to unregulated, unaccountable private schools at the expense of local public schools is a dereliction of duty.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"Arizona needs to remove/amend the state spending cap so that the approved budget dollars for schools can be spent. Everyone benefits when our society provides a good education. Arizona should provide competitive teacher and support staff compensation, safe facilities, and the programs necessary to meet the diverse needs of our children. I believe in families being able to choose what is best for their children and would support legislation that supports those choices provided it includes sufficient public school funding.\"\n\nSimir Rand: \"I believe funding increase with itemized ledgers would help support public education. Bring educators to the table to collaborate and strategize. There are perspectives with the idea of expanding school vouchers. Examining the intent of expanding is critical.\"\n\nProfessional shortages\n\nHow do you plan to address teacher, education professionals and school nurse shortages?\n\nFern Ward: \"Laveen is fortunate to have brilliant, dynamic, and caring school leadership. Our teachers are our most precious asset, and we try to treat them accordingly. Our pay scale is attractive enough to have avoided severe shortages. We are fortunate to have one of the highest teacher retention rates in the state. We partner with renowned and accredited universities to get their best and brightest graduates.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"This nationwide problem is a significant struggle. Even so, last year Laveen retained 80% of its teachers. As a Governing Board member I would promote maintaining and expanding policies that create a positive work environment for our staff and competitive compensation so that we can retain and recruit the best teachers and support staff for our district.\"\n\nSimir Rand: \"My suggestion to help address the school nurse shortage is collaborate with a nurse’s pool like the National Black Association. Build a partnership with graduating seniors and provide an employment opportunity. Teacher assistants at the many universities here in the city would be a great start to offer emergency certifications to combat the teacher shortage.\"\n\nCapital projects\n\nSeveral schools in the Valley need long-term repairs and updates. What is your plan to fund renovations?\n\nFern Ward: \"Laveen has an ongoing renovation plan that is funded and current. Arizona’s School Facilities Board is a working partner in funding our upcoming schools.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"Laveen is fortunate to have updated schools and a community that consistently votes in favor of district bond funds. One of our challenges in Laveen is securing land for the new buildings needed during this time of explosive growth. In my role as Vice Chair of the Laveen Village Planning Committee, I already work with District and City staff/officials as well as developers to advocate for and secure the land we need.\"\n\nSimir Rand: \"School bonds will cover construction projects for schools. As a board member, educating the community about the needs of the school and encouraging a yes for to pass the bonds is a big resource to fund renovations.\"\n\nAdditional information\n\nAnything you would like to add?\n\nFern Ward: \"It’s been an honor to be a member of the Laveen School Board for the past four years and I look forward to continued service.\"\n\nLinda Abegg: \"Your concerns are my concerns. My kids go to school with your kids; I live down the street from their school; I've taught in their classrooms. I have 6 years of involvement working for responsible development in Laveen, including schools, and have SUCCESSFULLY led efforts to get 3 new parks added in the area.

Pay schedules for counselors and social workers are a huge discrepancy in some districts. Social emotional support is one of the domains in the Arizona School Counseling Association curriculum, it is a part of a counselor’s job, yet there is no stipend or pay, whereas social workers receive additional funds for social emotional support. There are other dodgy examples between administrators pay schedules. Full transparency and fairness in these areas can impact schools in a positive way.\"\n\nMadison Elementary School District\n\nThree people are running for two four-year seats on the Madison Elementary School District governing board.\n\nCandidates include Christine Thompson, Jon Robinson and incumbent Mitra Khazai.\n\nKhazai did not submit her answers by the time of publishing.\n\nIntroductions\n\nCan you introduce yourself please? How long have you lived in Maricopa County, what do you do for a living, and any additional information about yourself you think voters would like to know about you?\n\nChristine Thompson: \"My name is Christine Thompson. With the exception of college and graduate school, I have lived in Maricopa County since childhood. I have lived in Phoenix since 2001 and in the Madison School District since January 2011. I have two children attending a Madison school. I'm the proud product of Arizona's public schools, having attended K-12 in Mesa Public Schools and earned my BA and JD from the University of Arizona. I am an executive consultant with over 25 years of experience as a leader in the nonprofit and government sectors. I served as President & CEO of a statewide education advocacy nonprofit and as Executive Director of the State Board of Education. I also served as the chief lobbyist for the Arizona Board of Regents and the State Bar of Arizona. For over 2 decades, I have championed investments in Arizona’s education systems as critical for the state’s future success, and I have been a vocal leader for policies that support every student, every step of the way.\"\n\nJon Robinson: \"I grew up near Bethany Home and 5th Avenue after moving here from Pennsylvania in 1975. My father was an actuary and my mother was a stay-at-home mom. I am a product of the Madison School District, and spent my K-8 years at Madison Park, Simis and Meadows. I later attended Brophy College Prep for high school (class of 1988). After graduation, I moved to Tucson where I attended the University of Arizona and obtained my BS in Mathematics. I also attended Arizona State University for my MS in Information Management. With the exception of my time in Tucson, I’ve only lived in the Madison District. I built my career in Information Technology and am employed as a technology and business strategy consultant, helping companies achieve business value through technology solutions.\n\n\"I am also the proud father of a Madison 3rd grader. It’s been a wonderful experience being part of our school’s incredible community. Over these last few years, I’ve watched my child make new friends, create memorable experiences, and learn how to be part of a team with Madison sports. My wife and I have also made some great new friends in other parents we have met along the way. Recently, we welcomed a new family member: Stacey, a kitten who I found and rescued while out knocking on doors gathering signatures in June.\"\n\n2020 election results\n\nDo you believe in the 2020 election results?\n\nChristine Thompson: \"Yes.\"\n\nJon Robinson: \"Yes. I believe the 2020 election was fair and the results were accurate.\"\n\nMain ideas\n\nBased on the limitations and powers of a school board member, what’s your platform?\n\nChristine Thompson: \"I'm committed to reinforcing and further developing the excellent programs that both support our diverse learners and contribute to our community’s strong property values. I am running for the Madison School Board because I care about the community where I have lived and worked for many years. I want to leverage my years of experience building coalitions and advancing education with communities, boards, and policymakers in support of our students and our schools. If elected, I will engage with students, parents, teachers & staff, and community members to better understand their hopes and concerns about our schools, and use that input to improve Madison. I look forward to ensuring every student who chooses Madison has a world-class education every step of the way.\"\n\nJon Robinson: \"If elected to Madison School Board, I see my role as one of service: to my community, our teachers, my fellow parents and, most importantly, our kids.\n\n\"I am committed to supporting our teachers, administrators and support staff to the best of my ability. Many teachers are struggling with the increased demands placed on them; some are even leaving the profession because of this. It’s no secret this is a big problem in our country as teacher shortages have reached their highest levels ever.\n\n\"This summer, school districts across the state reported teacher shortages in the thousands, mostly affecting grades K-6. This has led to larger class sizes, as well as teachers and staff being pulled from other positions to temporarily fill open slots. Even substitute teachers are in short supply. It’s not just teachers, but after-school programs are also struggling to fill positions. These programs are critical for parents that need after-school care for their kids. Some schools have had to limit enrollment due to staffing shortages, leaving parents scrambling to find another form of child care.\n\n\"Also at the top of my list is school safety: I want to ensure our children are able to learn in a safe and secure environment — this world is a wildly different place from when I was a Madison kid. After what happened in Uvalde, it was hard not to think about 'what if.' This means continuing to have conversations with administrators, teachers and experts about what we can do to keep our children safe; it means analyzing and reanalyzing what we are doing now and how we can improve safety protocols at our schools.\n\n\"Something else that I am very interested in is social and emotional learning. While learning the fundamentals — reading, writing, math — is important, children are struggling emotionally, especially after COVID-19. We have the opportunity to help teach our kids how to manage their feelings so they can tackle whatever life might throw their way. Staff need the tools in order to support kids who are struggling with behaviors that distract or interfere with either the learning process, or the safety and well-being of other children at our schools.\n\n\"Lastly, I want our kids to have the skills to succeed in ‘real life’. I was recently talking to an educator about a class taught at Madison Meadows that focuses on budgeting. Skills like this go a long way once these kids are out of school and in the workforce. I would like to look at the possibility of making more of these types of classes available to our students.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do, and I will do everything I can to move my district in the right direction, while navigating the many obstacles placed in front of us, as well as look for sustainable solutions.\"\n\nWhat do you believe to be the biggest issue impacting K-12 students in Arizona?\n\nChristine Thompson: \"Recruitment and retention of educators because an excellent teacher is the best indicator of a student's success in the classroom. We need to allow teachers to focus on teaching, support them professionally to hone their craft and deliver an excellent education to students, and pay them wages & benefits that are competitive with careers that require commensurate education and responsibility.\"\n\nJon Robinson: \"Right now, I think a big issue is the Arizona Legislature, itself. While I deeply respect this body and those who serve in the legislature, it concerns me that certain lawmakers have villainized teachers and public education. I think referring to teachers as 'educational terrorists' as one state senator did earlier this year is not productive. Public education desperately requires bipartisan support and solutions. I’m sure many of us have heard the expression ‘If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem’.\n\n\"We need our lawmakers to come to the table with a collective goal of funding our schools and giving public education what it needs to succeed. As a parent, it’s hard to watch laws being enacted that will ultimately hurt public school children and their ability to have a robust education. Why is it acceptable to be at the bottom when it comes to funding for public schools? Why is it acceptable that teachers and other staff are leaving the profession with no bench of trained educators willing to take their place. I love my state, but why are we OK being at the bottom when it comes to education? Real problems demand real solutions.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion issues\n\nHow will you navigate the challenges regarding national rhetoric spilling into local schools related to critical race theory, social-emotional learning, LGBTQ inclusion, and equity issues?\n\nChristine Thompson: \"Schools should be a place where all students are safe — and where all students feel safe. Our schools help students learn how to interact with different types of people, respectfully debate and find solutions between groups who might at first appear to have nothing in common, and lay the groundwork to become lifelong learners. We need the entire community — administrators, educators, students, parents, and the broader community — to work together to make that happen. I have a proven track record of leading constructive dialogues with diverse communities that found common ground and advanced meaningful change. I'll ensure Madison continues to foster an environment of transparency and encourage engagement with stakeholders on specific content — which is key when dealing with issues that invoke passionate responses from the community.\"\n\nJon Robinson: \"I think it’s unfortunate that these issues have become highly politicized. Partisan agendas have no place on a school board.\n\n\"When it comes to critical race theory, I think it’s important to note that it is not taught in the Madison District. That said, we have students who come from diverse backgrounds and experiences and that should be celebrated. It’s important to me that Madison remains a place that teaches and exemplifies tolerance and acceptance. I will support methods that help our kids to navigate their emotions, and have empathy for those around them who might be struggling. I am committed to supporting diversity, equity and inclusion in all of our schools so our children can learn in an environment that’s free from bullying regardless of their race, sexual orientation or gender identity. I want our children to be well-informed and armed with the knowledge and life skills they need to become productive members of our society.\"\n\nPublic education funding\n\nHow do you think the state should support public education? Do you believe in expanding school vouchers?\n\nChristine Thompson: \"I support public school choice within the framework of public district and public charter schools. I believe more work needs to be done to ensure that every student has access to a high-quality public education, regardless of their background, income, or zip code. I do not support universal voucher expansion.\"\n\nJon Robinson: \"I believe the state needs to provide more than just 'adequate' funding to public education. If we are serious about improving public schools then we have to invest in our schools. Investing in our schools leads to more staff (teachers, aides, counselors/social workers, etc.), smaller class sizes, and increased access to tools and technology, all of which greatly support the education process. If our plan and hope is for our children to receive the best education possible, then we have to walk the walk — we must invest in public education. If we do, our entire state will reap the rewards of a well-educated society. Remember, Arizona is continually at or near the bottom in teacher salaries and per-student funding, yet our state keeps trying to take more away. The math doesn’t add up.\n\n\"No. I believe in the original use and plan for vouchers to help children with disabilities and their families to be able to find the right place that meets the needs of those children. I do not believe in universal voucher expansion that allows any parents to take money from public schools to be used toward private and/or for-profit, schools. Parents already have the option of school choice. Public school funding should not be used to offset the cost of private schools. This is yet another attempt by our state leaders to defund public education. We should be looking for ways to put more funds into public education, not continue to take from it.\n\n\"The other issue I have with vouchers is the lack of accountability. Recently, an article was released by The Republic detailing the almost 6,500 people that have applied for vouchers after the program opened in August. It was reported that 75% of those that applied had no record of having a child that attends a public school. This is a prime example of what is wrong with the universal vouchers that were pushed in order to help people get out of failing public schools. The vast majority of people that will receive these dollars are already attending private schools. This universal program will do nothing but harm by continuing to pull money from public education which is already suffering from lack of adequate funding.\"\n\nProfessional shortages\n\nHow do you plan to address teacher, education professionals and school nurse shortages?\n\nChristine Thompson: \"We need to find creative ways to attract, support, and retain talent. The state needs to fund schools in a manner that will allow salaries & benefits to match private sector opportunities, and to staff up our schools to relieve teachers of the non-teaching work they are tasked with regularly.\"\n\nJon Robinson: \"This is a very important issue that seems to be getting worse over time. Because of lack of funding, teachers have been asked to do more and more each year. We are seeing first year teachers leaving the profession after one year, teachers are taking an early retirement rather than continuing on, and many other critical positions around schools are going unfilled.\n\n\"My district recently approved a pay increase for all school positions, and while this is a step in the right direction, there is a long way to go. We need more dollars in order to bring in more staff to start to alleviate the load we are placing on educators and staff. We cannot continue to burn them out. Funding (or the lack of it) is just one issue: We are seeing teaching positions that normally are easy to fill go unfilled based on teachers being fearful of parent backlash. Social Studies is one such example, as politicized issues like critical race theory have put this class and its curriculum under the microscope. I understand some parents are concerned about what is being taught in the classroom and I encourage them to volunteer in the classroom, reach out to the teacher, and talk to their kids.\n\n\"We’re not just losing our teachers. Districts across the country are experiencing shortages of staff across the board. Everything from school aides, to after school program workers, to key positions like librarians and nurses go left unfilled. We need to ensure our schools are safe, competitive with pay, and supportive of staff in order to attract the people we need.\n\n\"If elected, I will work with my fellow board members to address these issues and come up with solutions, while continuing to provide a top-notch education and ensuring fiscal responsibility.\"\n\nCapital projects\n\nSeveral schools in the Valley need long-term repairs and updates. What is your plan to fund renovations?\n\nChristine Thompson: \"In the Madison District, we have passed bonds that have kept our facilities up to date. We do need to ensure that we continue to have adequate financial reserves to address any immediate unexpected needs.\"\n\nJon Robinson: \"In my own district, I would want to first understand the outstanding issues we face — which schools are in need of repairs, which are due for updates, and what has been done so far to prioritize those needs? We should start by focusing on those issues that are a direct threat to the safety or overall well-being of our children.\n\n\"The State of Arizona is constitutionally bound to maintain our public schools. Unfortunately, the programs in place to support this have been defunded over the years or so process-ridden that it can take years for repairs to be finished. If we’re unable to get the funding from the State to complete the necessary work, we can ask our district community to approve a bond to fund these projects. We’ve been lucky for a while now in the Madison District as all of our asks on bonds or overrides have passed. This mechanism is suited to serve districts in more affluent parts of our state where taxpayers can afford it. Unfortunately, this leaves districts in less affluent areas in a much worse situation.\n\n\"We need to push the Arizona Legislature to release more funding and loosen the restrictions on getting needed repairs done in a timely manner. We need to fight to get our State back to doing their part that is not only needed, but a constitutional requirement.\"\n\nMurphy Elementary School District\n\nThree people are running for two four-year seats on the Murphy Elementary School District governing board.\n\nCandidates include Jennifer Ayala, Rebecca Coffman and incumbent Guadalupe Gonzalez.\n\nGonzalez did not submit her answers by the time of publishing, Ayala did not respond to The Republic's attempts tor reach her.

I am the Chief Financial Officer for the Tempe Elementary School District so I understand school finance issues. I have lived in the Osborn district for the past eight years and served on the Osborn School District Education Foundation board for the past four years. I am currently the treasurer of the campaign to renew the maintenance and operations override for Osborn. I previously served as treasurer for the Carnation Association of Neighbors in central Phoenix.\"\n\nJuan Carlos Flamand: \"I have lived in Osborn district since 2006 and am proud to currently serve as the President of the Osborn Governing Board. I am a lawyer with experience in criminal defense but now practice as an immigration attorney. I am married to Phoenix artist Kristin Wesley and am a strong supporter of the arts. We have five children, three we adopted and two biological children. Our older kid, Margaret is now an adult we fostered and adopted when she was a teenager. The younger kids are currently enrolled in Osborn schools.\"\n\nLeanne Greenberg: \"My name is Leanne Greenberg and I am a first-generation Arab-American, mom, educator, and local activist. I currently work as a Behavior Intervention Specialist in the Phoenix Elementary School District. My previous roles in education have been as a special education teacher, instructional coach, and union organizer with the Arizona Education Association. This is my 9th year working in public education. I served as the President of the Phoenix Elementary Classroom Teachers Association for two years and was also a member of the Maricopa County Superintendent Teacher Advisory Team under Maricopa County Superintendent Steve Watson. I believe that all students deserve access to a high-quality public education. My experience as an educator gives me an inside perspective on the needs of our schools. If elected to the Osborn ESD Governing Board, I plan to elevate the voices of our amazing staff members at all levels, increase the pay of educators, and ensure that our schools are inclusive, safe places to learn and grow. I have a Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree in Special Education from Michigan State University and a Master’s degree in Applied Behavior Analysis from the University of Cincinnati. I am passionate about public education and ensuring that every student is prepared to succeed in school and in life.\"\n\n2020 election results\n\nDo you believe in the 2020 election results?\n\nEric Thompson: \"Yes. It is unfortunate that we have to continue addressing the lies the election deniers are spreading. It is damaging to democracy.\"\n\nJuan Carlos Flamand: \"Yes.\"\n\nLeanne Greenberg: \"Yes.\"\n\nMain ideas\n\nBased on the limitations and powers of a school board member, what’s your platform?\n\nEric Thompson: \"I want to make sure that teachers get the resources they need to provide the best education possible to our kids. As a school district CFO, I understand that districts don't have a lot of control over the funding they receive so they have to make sure they are using every dollar wisely. Having the experience as a school district CFO, I see the whole picture of the district and understand the impact that decisions have district-wide.\n\n\"I will advocate for more school funding. Arizona public schools have received too little funding for too long. Whether from the Legislature, school overrides or bonds, I will push for more funding to support Osborn's schools and students.\n\n\"I will push to expand affordable preschool. We need to offer more preschool opportunities, especially for low-income families in central Phoenix. I will push to make preschool available and affordable for all children.\n\n\"Most school districts don't offer parental leave. I will push to change that so teachers and staff who are new parents don't have to choose between taking the time they need with their families and getting a paycheck.\n\n\"I want to support and promote the benefits of dual-language learning and showcase Osborn’s outstanding Spanish and English programs.\n\n\"We need to trust science and health experts when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health issues and work to ensure that students are learning in a safe environment.\n\n\"We must provide equitable access that meets the needs of all Osborn students and families and supports them in the pursuit of academic and social development.\n\n\"We need to direct resources into social and emotional learning because students of all ages are struggling with mental health and social-emotional issues. We must provide necessary resources for them and the teachers and staff who support them.\"\n\nJuan Carlos Flamand: \"As a Board Member and current President I have focused on five priorities: 1) retention through pay increases for ALL staff (too often the unsung cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and other non-teaching critical employees are excluded from the conversation) and improving working conditions; 2) meeting our students’ social-emotional needs in our classrooms and creating environments for all kids to learn and thrive; 3) implementing science & fact based policies to protect the Osborn community; 4) implementing policies using an equity-lens which led to improved student outcomes and reduced disciplinary issues that disproportionately impacted African-American and Latinx students; 5) building community trust, inclusion and accountability by making our meetings more accessible via online meetings and ensuring Board documents are publicly available online. If honored to serve again I will continue these priorities.\"\n\nLeanne Greenberg: \"I want to elevate the voices of all educators in our schools, including our teachers, bus drivers, instructional assistants, school psychologists, etc. When all educators are part of the decision making, we can make better, more educated decisions that will positively have an impact on our students. I want to create community schools that provide resources for our families and are a place of learning for not just kids, but parents, too. As a special education teacher, I know the value of inclusion, so I want to work to ensure that all of our students with special needs have a high-quality teacher, opportunities for inclusion, and access to any services that they may need to gain the skills that they need to lead fulfilling lives.\"\n\nWhat do you believe to be the biggest issue impacting K-12 students in Arizona?\n\nEric Thompson: \"Arizona students do not have enough qualified teachers in the classroom. That is not because we don't have people who want to teach. It is because we do not pay our teachers enough to stay in the profession. We need to increase teacher pay to keep good teachers in the classroom. It is a hard profession but such an important one.\"\n\nJuan Carlos Flamand: \"At a school level it is staffing the schools. We struggle every year to fill positions and it seems like every year public schools keep getting tasked with more responsibilities and requirements. We need highly qualified employees working with our kids and it is challenging to attract talent when the State devalues public education. At a macro level the biggest issue is the wholesale dismantling of the public education system by the Legislature which seems to view education as a commodity that should be privatized.\"\n\nLeanne Greenberg: \"There are so many issues, but I think the number one issue in Arizona is the lack of funding. Without adequate funding, we can't recruit and retain high-quality educators, we can't provide up-to-date curriculum, make building repairs, provide enrichment activities, and more. Fully funding education would put Arizona ahead of other states and would allow us the resources to provide what our students need. Without adequate funding, it will be difficult to address the wide variety of issues that our public schools are currently facing.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion issues\n\nHow will you navigate the challenges regarding national rhetoric spilling into local schools related to critical race theory, social-emotional learning, LGBTQ inclusion, and equity issues?\n\nEric Thompson: \"We need to move beyond inflammatory language and think about what's best for our students: supporting them regardless of their race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender identity and more. Social-emotional learning is so important right now because a lot of students are struggling in those areas because of the pandemic. We need to give them the supports that they need to learn because if they are struggling with the social-emotional aspects of their life, they are not going to do their best in school.\"\n\nJuan Carlos Flamand: \"I have been navigating this challenge for years now as a current Board Member and think this topic is often misconstrued to score political points. Osborn is fortunate to have a diverse group of students, faculty, and families in a supportive community working to provide every kid with the resources and education they deserve. This means meeting them where they are. For me it is a very real and practical issue because I have had to think about how the rubber meets the road in the classroom. Social emotional learning, equity, inclusion is not about indoctrination, it is about understanding where kids are coming from and how to best reach them to support them so they can be at their best in the classroom.\"\n\nLeanne Greenberg: \"I want every student to feel safe and acknowledged in our schools. As educators, we should create classrooms where kids feel comfortable being themselves and sharing who their true selves are. Kids should learn about these issues and should be taught to make their own decisions on issues. Our job as educators is to teach the next generation of kids how to think for themselves and give them the information that they need to make the world a better place. Knowledge is power and we should not limit our students from learning about these issues.\"\n\nPublic education funding\n\nHow do you think the state should support public education? Do you believe in expanding school vouchers?\n\nEric Thompson: \"I think the state should support public education by actually supporting public education and not giving money to private schools. I don't think tax dollars should be used to pay for private school tuition and am opposed to expanding school vouchers.\"\n\nJuan Carlos Flamand: \"I do not believe in expanding the school voucher program. Public education is an essential aspect of a free society and the State should treat it as its most important function and fund it accordingly.\"\n\nLeanne Greenberg: \"The state has a surplus of funds and that money needs to go to public schools. We need to fully fund public education and put in more accountability measures for charter schools and homeschools. I do not believe in the expansion of school vouchers and know that this further drains money from our public schools. A majority of our students attend public schools and there is accountability measures for how that money is spent in our school districts. By diverting our money into private hands, we eliminate any accountability of taxpayer dollars and lessen the opportunities that our public schools can provide by further draining their budgets.\"\n\nProfessional shortages\n\nHow do you plan to address teacher, education professionals and school nurse shortages?\n\nEric Thompson: \"The first thing we have to do is pass the maintenance and operations override on the ballot for Osborn in November.

Vance for fun at Ohio rally | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump needs you to know that Republican candidates don’t just like him, they love him. And they need him. Badly.\n\nAt a rally on Saturday night for Ohio GOP Senate nominee J.D. Vance, Trump made sure the crowd knew that Vance was subservient to him – big time.\n\n“J.D. is kissing my ass he wants my support so bad,” Trump said.\n\nTrump was reacting to a New York Times story that reported Vance had not actually invited Trump to campaign with him in the state. Instead, Trump’s team had simply told Vance that they would be coming to Ohio for a rally.\n\nTrump’s campaign stops have always been, primarily, about Trump. You can tell that by the amount of time he spends talking about himself (a lot) versus how much time he spends talking about the candidate for whom he is ostensibly campaigning (very little).\n\nBut he has rarely thrown a candidate he endorsed so directly under the bus as he did Vance over the weekend. “He made J.D. Vance look like a mouse, not a man,” former Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock told CNN of the moment. “It was humiliating.”\n\nComstock is right. It’s hard to see Trump’s characterization of Vance as little more than a lackey benefiting him in his surprisingly competitive race against Democrat Tim Ryan this fall. Even for those voters who like Trump, the portrayal of Vance as little more than a lickspittle isn’t terribly appealing.\n\nBut that’s not what Trump cares about. Not really.\n\nSure, he visited Ohio to campaign for Vance – at least on the surface. But what Trump is really doing is burnishing his own brand – and basking in the adulation of his most dogged supporters. To quote Trump from more than three decades ago: “The show is Trump, and it is sold-out performances everywhere.”\n\nThat’s what you always have to remember when you are trying to understand the strategy or motivation behind something Trump does. Trump is all about Trump – first, last and forever.\n\nAnd so, the most important thing Trump wanted to get across to those in attendance in Ohio over the weekend is not why they should vote for Vance. It’s that he remains uber-popular among Republicans and that every GOP candidate – Vance included – is desperate to have his endorsement.\n\nThat such an argument is belittling to Vance and makes him look both small and desperate is of no concern for Trump. The key (and only) concern is how does it make Trump look – strong, powerful and still very much coveted.\n\nThat’s all that matters.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/asia/china-taiwan-invasion-scenarios-analysis-intl-hnk-ml", "title": "China has the power to take Taiwan, but it would cost an extremely ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nOn his first trip to Asia as United States President last week, Joe Biden gave his strongest warning yet to Beijing that Washington was committed to defending Taiwan militarily in the event of an attack from China.\n\nBiden’s comments, which compared a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to deviate from Washington’s decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the issue and seemingly raised the possibility of a military clash between US and Chinese forces.\n\nIt’s the third time Biden has made similar remarks since taking office and, just as on the other two occasions, they were quickly walked back by the White House – which insists its policy has not changed. However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels – bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles, many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017. Liu Chang/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe air war\n\nChina is likely to seek air superiority early into any conflict, analysts say, and may feel it has an advantage in the skies.\n\nFlight Global’s 2022 directory of the world’s air forces shows the PLA with almost 1,600 combat aircraft, compared to Taiwan’s fewer than 300. The directory shows the US with more than 2,700 combat aircraft, but those cover the world while China’s are all in the region.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taiwan holds ceremony for advanced F-16V fighter jets 02:11 - Source: CNN Taiwan holds ceremony for advanced F-16V fighter jets 02:11\n\nIn the air war, China also will have learned from Russia’s failures in Ukraine – where Moscow took months assembling its ground forces yet failed to soften up the terrain for them with a bombing campaign – and is more likely to emulate the “shock and awe” bombardments that preceded the US’ invasions of Iraq.\n\n“I’m sure the PLA is learning from what they’re seeing,” Shugart said. “You can read open-source translations of their strategic documents. They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt.

Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/us/metoo-five-years-later-cec", "title": "In 5 years of #MeToo, here's what's changed – and what hasn't | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFive years ago, a single hashtag sent waves across the world: #MeToo.\n\nNews of sexual harassment and assault allegations against ubiquitous Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein had just broken. In its wake, countless people came forward with stories of sexual abuse – accusing high-profile men from former president George H. W. Bush to actor Kevin Spacey of various kinds of sexual harassment.\n\nThough the actual movement had been started years earlier by activist Tarana Burke, the hashtag’s rapid ascent, spurred by a tweet from actress Alyssa Milano, forced many in the US and around the world to confront deep-rooted cultures and systems of sexual abuse.\n\nThese days discussions of sexual violence, sexism and power are mainstream, said Jennifer M. Gómez, a professor at the Boston University School of Social Work who studies interpersonal trauma. But in decades past, these discussions typically existed primarily in activist or scholarly circles.\n\n“General mainstream awareness, I think, is much higher and just much different than five years ago,” Gómez said. “And I think that can be attributed pretty directly to the Me Too Movement.”\n\nHere’s how #MeToo has changed society – and where it still has to go.\n\nHow has the movement been successful?\n\nJust the fact that people can talk more openly about sexual violence and abuse, Gómez said, is significant – and a far cry from past decades.\n\nShe used the singer R. Kelly as an example. In the 1990s, his sexual abuse of Black teen girls was well known, she said. But it wasn’t until post-#MeToo that he was criminally convicted.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, there was an awareness of domestic violence and child abuse, but it was centered on White women and some boys, Gómez said. So movements against sexual violence only reached those specific segments of the population.\n\nWhat has set the #MeToo movement apart is its coalition across race and genders, she said – it acknowledged the systems of oppression non-White, non-cisgender or non-heterosexual women might have to also deal with, like racism, transphobia, homophobia, ableism or classism.\n\n“Part of what we’re seeing, which is positive, is this increasing awareness of ties to the system,” Gómez said. “It’s more than just sexism against White women.”\n\nHarvey Weinstein arrives at the Manhattan Criminal Court on January 22, 2020 for opening arguments in his rape and sexual assault trial in New York City.

Clary/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe movement has even changed policy – earlier this year, Congress passed a complete overhaul of workplace sexual misconduct law, initially introduced during the rise of #MeToo.\n\nConversations around sexual abuse, power and its ties to other systems of oppression are still happening five years later, said Deborah Tuerkheimer, author of “Credible: Why We Doubt Accusers and Protect Abusers.” Not only are they more widespread than before #MeToo went viral, they’ve stayed on the front burner, she said.\n\n“We’re having these conversations, but it’s also the substances of those conversations,” Tuerkheimer said. “What has been striking is that they reflect greater understandings of the realities of abuse than pre-#MeToo. And so what I mean by that is, because so many survivors have come forward and told their stories … there is, I think, a much better idea of what victims look like, what abusers can look like, what abuse looks like, and what some of these dynamics are.”\n\nTuerkheimer used former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo as an example. Though Cuomo has denied committing any sexual harassment, New York state Attorney General Letitia James found in an investigation that he had sexually harassed 11 women. A week after the findings went public, Cuomo resigned.\n\n“You see powerful men who, for a very long time, were able to take advantage of their positions of power,” Tuerkheimer said. “(Now) you start to see some of that protection dissipate.”\n\nFormer New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned last year after being accused of sexual misconduct. Brendan McDermid/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAnd the allegations against Cuomo were just last year. Many of the men accused of sexual misconduct back in 2017 have remained largely out of the spotlight: Matt Lauer, the former NBC anchor, has not appeared on television since his firing; Mario Batali, the celebrity chef, sold all his restaurant stake in 2019; Charlie Rose, the once legendary television interviewer, only just made a return to interviewing in April, via a video released on his personal website.\n\nOther high-profile men, like Bill Cosby and Weinstein, began to face legal consequences as well.\n\nBut this is not always the case. Actor James Franco, despite multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, has continued to get roles in Hollywood. Louis C.K. is set to perform at Madison Square Garden, one of the most renowned venues in the US, next January.\n\nWho has been left behind?\n\nThis isn’t to say #MeToo hasn’t had flaws.\n\nFrom the very beginning the movement left marginalized folks behind, said Gómez, who noted how it quickly became associated with White celebrities rather than the Black woman activist who actually started it.\n\nThe difference now, though, is that a movement centered around White women experienced pushback from the very beginning, in a very mainstream way. In the White-dominated feminist movement of the 1970s, critiques from feminist scholars of color were pushed to the margins, Gómez said.\n\nBut in 2017, and still today, those conversations have been happening widely and publicly. (Think of, for example, the phrase “intersectional feminism,” a call to include all women in feminist movements. Then think of the critiques against it, claiming that its use became meaningless virtue-signaling.)\n\n“Now, in the mainstream, this battle for equality in the movement is happening,” Gómez said. “And that’s progress.”\n\nStill, change within a movement doesn’t equate to change outside of it. Women of color, transgender women, poor or working-class women, those who work in sex trade or struggle with addiction all have seen the least amount of change as a result of #MeToo, Gómez and Tuerkheimer both said.\n\n“Those who are the most vulnerable in our society are the most least likely to receive care and concern,” said Tuerkheimer. “These are the people whose stories are least likely to be told, and least likely to be responded to.”\n\nExamples are everywhere. For the young Black girls victimized by R. Kelly, for example, justice took decades.\n\nSinger R. Kelly leaves the Leighton Criminal Courts Building following a hearing on June 26, 2019 in Chicago. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nAnd those are just the accusations that we know of. Vulnerable and marginalized workers – like wait staff, or nannies, can be susceptible to harassment and sexual assault, Tuerkheimer said. But knowing the likelihood of change is minimal, many might see silence as the best option.\n\nMore than 70% of female restaurant workers are sexually harassed during their time in the industry, according to a 2021 study by One Fair Wage and the UC Berkeley Food and Labor Research Center. In many cases, tipped workers who reported the harassment were told to “just forget about it.”\n\n“We have this vast array of inequalities that you really have to tackle to begin to get at the problem,” Tuerkheimer said. “As much as I think a high-profile prosecution can make a difference, it’s not enough.”\n\nAnd, in the case of violence perpetrated by Black men against Black girls and women, there can be pressure not to speak up, Gómez said, for fear of damaging the reputations of Black men everywhere by playing into oppressive stereotypes.\n\nMale victims, particularly men and boys of color, can also get left behind in the focus on sexist violence and violence against women specifically, Gómez said.\n\nWhat still needs to change?\n\nDespite the progress made in the last five years, society still has a ways to go, experts said.\n\nEven as individual attitudes toward sexual harassment and assault have changed, institutions have been slower to adapt. Gómez pointed to the US Department of Education, which, in a recent set of proposed changes to Title IX – which protects against sex discrimination – would require faculty and staff to report of alleged sexual misconduct, regardless of the student’s wishes.\n\nOn the surface, this may sound positive: If a school knows abuse is happening, it can do something about it. But sexual abuse already takes away an individual’s choice, Gómez said – why is an institution doing that, too?\n\n“If we understand how sexual violence and abuse works, it’s that it takes away the individual’s agency and autonomy. What they wanted to have happened, didn’t. They didn’t want to have sex, and were forced to,” she said. “Then universal mandated reporting is rapey in that same way, in that if a student doesn’t want to have their information formally reported, you still do it as a professor anyhow.”\n\nSome schools in the past have not handled these cases well. Between 2010 and 2015, officials at Baylor University failed to report sexual assault claims against football players, creating what the NCAA called in a 2021 report a “campus-wide culture of sexual violence.”\n\nIn sports as well, institutional change has been gradual. The NFL has been under scrutiny for its handling of allegations of sexual assault, and even with recent policy changes, some have argued the league is still falling short.\n\nTuerkheimer pointed to a recent investigation in women’s soccer, which found rampant abuse – including sexual misconduct – at varying levels of the sport in the US, including in the National Women’s Soccer League. Multiple NWSL coaches and executives have been fired as a result of the accusations.\n\nPaul Riley, formerly the head coach of the North Carolina Courage, was named in an investigation of abuse in women's soccer. Riley has denied the allegations players have made against him. Andy Mead/ISI Photos/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\n“It’s again this story of so much that gets endured before finally the dam breaks,” Tuerkheimer said. “And in a better world it should not be the case that there’s all that suffering before there’s change.”\n\nOf course, the fact that women’s soccer is being overhauled is a good thing, she continued. But at what cost?\n\n“That’s the moment that we’re at, five years post #MeToo,” Tuerkheimer said, “is recognizing that there’s both the movement in the right direction, but we still haven’t really fixed the problem … We haven’t upended the culture of tolerance for quite a lot of abuse.”\n\nAnd then there’s the legal system, which still requires that harassment must be severe or pervasive. The law doesn’t care about harassment that’s not extreme, Tuerkheimer said, and often puts the victim in a position to prove it was unwelcome.\n\n“We have all of these legal doctrines that reinforce the problem,” she said. “They show us there there’s a problem, they reveal our cultural blind spots, but they also exacerbate those cultural blind spots and they make them worse.”\n\nThe silver lining in all of this comes from individuals, Gomez and Tuerkheimer said.\n\nMore than twice as many Americans support #MeToo than oppose it, according to new data from the Pew Research Center. The gradual change is still change.\n\nOn January 18, 2020, the fourth Women's March brought thousands to Washington, DC to rebuke Donald Trump and advocate for climate action, reproductive justice and immigrants' rights. Michael Nigro/Sipa USA/AP/FILE\n\nAnd the individual impact does matter, Gómez said. When she was a child, these conversations weren’t happening.\n\n“My past little girl is getting healing through all of this. And I matter, I’m a person,” she said. “But every person matters. So the changes happening individuals by individuals, family by family, classroom by classroom, community by community, workplace by workplace, each and every person matters. And so any bit of change, any bit of validation, understanding, prevention, awareness, is change that should be counted.”\n\nThe world won’t be the same as before #MeToo, Tuerkheimer said. It can’t be, she added.\n\n“There was a shift and a sea change. And even though progress isn’t linear, the stories cannot be put back. There’s something that happened that changed the course of our response to abuse and misconduct,” she said. “And that, I think, is hopeful.”", "authors": ["Leah Asmelash"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/15/trump-tariff-elon-tesla-firing-layoffs/82333381007/", "title": "Firings, tariffs and Teslas: Donald Trump shakes up Washington", "text": "WASHINGTON – To some people, President Donald Trump is shaking things up. To others, he is sowing an unusual amount of chaos and confusion in a world that has grown accustomed to confusion.\n\nIn office less than two months, Trump has dismantled government agencies and fired tens of thousands of government workers, then scrambled to hire hundreds of them back because they held crucial jobs like managing the nation’s nuclear weapons.\n\nHis approach to trade – announcing abrupt and dramatic tariffs on certain imports, calling the duties off and later threatening to impose new ones – has thrown financial markets into a tailspin. U.S. stocks rebounded on Friday after a tumultuous week fueled by concerns over Trump's escalating trade war and fears of a recession, but still posted a fourth straight week of losses.\n\nTrump and Republicans are urging patience, insisting that the turbulence in the stock market is temporary and that all his disruptive measures will pay off in the long run. GOP lawmakers say they are willing to give the new president the benefit of the doubt, pointing out that he has been in office just a matter of weeks and that more time is needed to know the full impact of his policies.\n\n“He's been in office for just over, what, 50 days? This is the 51st day in office,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters earlier this week. “Give the president a chance to have these policies play out.”\n\nDemocrats warn the chaos Trump has created could inflict long-term damage to the economy and accuse him of hurting the very people he said during the 2024 presidential campaign that he’d protect.\n\n“Donald Trump is wreaking havoc across the federal government and our economy, gutting federal programs millions of hard-working people rely on, just to give billionaires like Elon Musk a free ride,” said Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois, who leads a coalition of fiscally-moderate Democrats.\n\n“We see the cost of Trump's chaos economy in virtually every facet of life,\" Schneider said.\n\nAngry voters have shown up at GOP town halls to protest the government cuts orchestrated by Trump and Musk, the billionaire owner of the auto manufacturer Tesla and a presidential adviser who is leading the administration’s downsizing effort through the new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nWith Trump’s poll numbers starting to slide and GOP leaders urging their lawmakers to stop holding town halls, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president during last year’s election, have started holding events in Republican states and congressional districts to emphasize the damage they say the Trump cuts would inflict.\n\nDemocrats already are looking for a glimmer of hope in the 2028 presidential election, when they will have a chance to win back the White House. Several prominent Democrats have been mentioned as possible candidates, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost last year’s election to Trump, as well as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, insists that his approach is the correct one and that the United States is on the right track.\n\n“I think this country is going to boom,” he told reporters Tuesday from the White House South Lawn, which he had turned into a car lot in a show of support for Tesla and Musk, who also has come under fire for his role in the government’s downsizing effort.\n\n“I could do it the easy way or the hard way,” Trump said. “The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing. But the results are going to be 20 times greater.”\n\nFears that Trump's moves are 'too erratic'\n\nThe Trump administration’s approach to economic policy is unusual, economist Chris Lafakis said.\n\n“This is not like anything that I've seen as a professional economist,” said Lafakis, a director at Moody’s Analytics.\n\nUnder federal law, changing regulations involves a multi-step process that includes proposing a new rule, eliciting and evaluating feedback and then rolling out a policy.\n\nBut the speed and the scale of what Trump is doing has worked in his favor, said GOP strategist Mike DuHaime, a former political director for the Republican National Committee.\n\n“Trump has come out at a blistering pace, which has been positive for him because his detractors don’t know where to focus,” DuHaime said.\n\nThe president, who returned to office in January, is still in the honeymoon phase and has some leeway with the public to prove his approach will work, DuHaime said.\n\nThe White House argues Trump’s approach is already working.\n\n“President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term,” spokesman Kush Desai said.\n\nBut there are signs that many Americans are growing weary.\n\nFifty-seven percent of those surveyed in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday said Trump is being too erratic in his moves to shake up the economy. Some 70% of respondents – including nine in 10 Democrats and six in 10 Republicans – said they expected higher tariffs will make groceries and other regular purchases more expensive.\n\nTrump's poll numbers also have dipped as a result of the economic concerns. A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday put his approval rating at 42%, down from 45% a month earlier. His disapproval rating was 53%,\n\n“Voters are waiting to see if the tariff strategy works or backfires,\" DuHaime said, \"but they are starting to worry.\"\n\nThe same goes for Trump’s foreign policy approach, DuHaime said.\n\nUkraine, in the third year of its war with Russia, agreed last week to a ceasefire plan negotiated by U.S. officials. The agreement came after weeks of criticism by Trump of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who triggered the conflict by ordering an invasion of his country’s neighbor, said Thursday he supports but won't immediately agree to the ceasefire because he wants to see an \"enduring peace\" that removes the \"underlying cause” of the crisis.\n\nIt’s too soon to know whether Trump’s foreign policy moves will work or be popular, DuHaime said, adding come summer the president “owns the economic and foreign policy successes or failures.”\n\nThe GOP holds small majorities in both the House and the Senate and is pushing hard to enact Trump's agenda before the focus turns to next year's mid-term elections.\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, said nobody should be surprised by what Trump is doing because he’s following through on campaign promises.\n\nWhile many Americans see chaos, Nehls said Trump is executing with precision an agenda he laid out during the 2024 presidential contest.\n\nThe president is able to do more because he has a team around him that he trusts, said Nehls, an ardent Trump backer who wore a T-shirt adorned with Trump’s mug shot last year to Democrat Joe Biden’s final State of the Union address.\n\nGulf of America? No paper straws? Trump makes his mark in ways big and small\n\nMarc Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence during Trump’s first term, said he believes much of Trump’s agenda is popular, pointing to his moves on immigration and shrinking the size of government.\n\n“I think that the big outlier on that is his trade policy,” Short said, adding: “If you're not getting the confidence of the American people on the economy, I think it does undermine a lot of the other agenda.”\n\nAnnouncing tariffs and then pausing them suggests Trump is “not entirely confident that these policies will work,” Short said. Trump’s approach seems “very whimsical,” Short added, but he noted that the president was very “unpredictable” during his first term too.\n\nThe spending cuts identified by the Musk and his team have added to the confusion, with mass layoffs, surprise government-wide emails and the dismantling of agencies. This week, the Department of Education – which Trump has vowed to eliminate – slashed its workforce in half, laying off roughly 1,300 workers and leaving the agency hamstrung to fulfill responsibilities it's required by law to carry out.\n\nA federal judge in California ordered the administration on Thursday to reinstate tens of thousands of probationary workers who had been fired in six departments. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said the manner in which the workers were fired was illegal.\n\nTrump also has choreographed some curious moments since his return to office, most recently his White House event to promote Tesla vehicles alongside Musk, the company’s founder. Musk's efforts have sparked protests at Tesla dealerships. Some dealerships have been vandalized. The company’s stock has dipped.\n\nPushing back, Trump warned at the White House event that violence against Tesla would be labeled as domestic terrorism.\n\nIn a twist, some of Trump's moves are aimed at undoing clean-air rules that were enacted by Biden and were meant to encourage Americans to buy more electric vehicles like those Musk’s company makes.\n\n“I think that one anecdote was very surreal and ironic,” Short said of the Tesla White House event. “Because conservatives have long opposed taxpayer subsidies that prop up electric vehicle business. And yet there couldn't have been a bigger promotion than having events on the White House lawn.\"\n\n'A little bumpy,' but 'have faith'\n\nNehls argued the media has overplayed the confusion caused by Trump's tariffs and firing of federal workers and is “scaring people.” He pointed to Trump’s comments to a joint session of Congress on March 4 that while his tariffs will cause “a little disturbance … it won’t be much.”\n\n“Trump made it very clear … it's going to be a little bumpy, but have faith and confidence he knows what he's doing, and it will be fine,” Nehls said.\n\nNehls predicted the markets will bounce back and said the policy is an important step toward fair trade and reviving American manufacturing.\n\n'We are in mourning': President Trump mixes sympathy and politics as consoler-in-chief\n\nFor many conservatives, the moves Trump is making are the fulfillment of long-held dreams.\n\nTina Descovich, co-founder of the conservative activist group Moms for Liberty, talked about eliminating the Department of Education nearly a decade ago when she ran for school board in Brevard County, Florida. Last week, she was on a call with officials at the department to receive a briefing about the cuts before they were publicly announced.\n\nThe deep cuts have raised questions about how the U.S. government will carry out various education programs, but Descovich argued they were done in a “thoughtful manner” that protected essential functions.\n\nMore broadly, she said, Trump is delivering on an agenda that has been well thought out. She noted that Trump allies spent years creating policy plans to implement when he returned to power and now are rolling them out.\n\n“Change is always hard for people,” said Descovich, who was at the White House recently when Trump signed an executive order banning transgender student athletes from competing in women’s sports.\n\nBut the change Trump is delivering will be beneficial, she said.\n\n“The bureaucratic nightmare, swampland of D.C. is a tough one to slay,” Descovich said, but Trump “is slaying the swamp. And that is what America wants, ultimately. Doesn't mean it's not going to be a little painful sometimes. Doesn't mean it's not going to be a little bumpy. But it is necessary for our strong American future.”\n\nContributing: Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow Zac Anderson on X @zacjanderson and Collins @mcollinsNEWS", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/04/11/small-business-owners-warning-tariff-pause-trump-trade-war/83028994007/", "title": "Austin business owners warn of ramifications as tariff war takes shape", "text": "Just before a test they seemed unprepared for, global markets and economies were thrown into chaos as President Donald Trump abruptly changed course and paused his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs for all countries except China.

He told me that the assassination of his mother, two-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was a turning point for him at 19 that pushed him into public service: “I didn’t choose this life. It chose me. The circumstances of her assassination and the events that followed led me down this path where I am today.”\n\nBhutto Zardari is also the chairman of the left-of-center Pakistan People’s Party, which was founded by his grandfather and is one of the largest political parties in the country.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Pakistan became a key American ally after the Soviet Union invaded Pakistan’s neighbor Afghanistan in 1979. That invasion precipitated a tight alliance between the United States and the military regime of Pakistan’s President, Gen. Zia-ul-Haq. The CIA acted as the quartermaster to the Afghan rebels, funneling billions of dollars of weapons to the Pakistani military intelligence service, which in turn supported several of the Afghan groups fighting the Soviets.\n\nIn 1989, after being defeated in Afghanistan, the Soviets pulled out – a move that hastened the collapse of the Soviet regime. When the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, the United States closed its embassy in Kabul and washed its hands of the country.\n\nThat move would turn out to be a large blunder because Afghanistan then descended into a civil war, out of which emerged a shadowy group, the Taliban, which by 1996 had taken over almost the entire country. The Taliban also gave refuge to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda group, which planned the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn the years before 9/11, Pakistan was one of only three countries that recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan, seeing in them a force on its western border that would not ally with its main enemy, India.\n\nAfter September 11, under intense US pressure, the Pakistanis switched allegiance and, at least initially, supported the US-led war against the Taliban and al Qaeda.\n\nDeeply enmeshed in all this complex history is the Bhutto family, which, even more than the Kennedys in the United States, is a political dynasty that has shaped the history of their country while also enduring considerable personal tragedy.\n\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto, Bhutto Zardari’s grandfather, was the first democratically elected Prime Minister in Pakistan, but he was later deposed and then hanged by the regime of the Pakistani military dictator Zia in 1979.\n\nA little under a decade later, Bhutto’s daughter Benazir Bhutto, then only 35, became the first female Prime Minister in Pakistan’s history and, indeed, the first female Prime Minister of any Muslim-majority country.\n\nShe was a graduate of Harvard and Oxford and orientated to the West, but nonetheless, during her prime ministership, Pakistan’s powerful military began supporting the Taliban as they rose to power in Afghanistan.\n\nIn February 1993, a militant from Pakistan, Ramzi Yousef, masterminded the bombing of the World Trade Center, killing six people. Yousef then went back to Pakistan and began plotting to kill Benazir Bhutto, who was then serving as Prime Minister for the second time. The plan failed when the bomb Yousef was building malfunctioned.\n\nIn 2000, I met with Benazir Bhutto, who explained to me that “the international Islamist movement saw Pakistan as its base. They saw my party as a liberal threat.” She became a fervent public critic of the Taliban and al Qaeda, and the fact that she was the first woman to lead Pakistan made her an even bigger target for Islamist militants.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was assassinated in Pakistan in 2007 when she was campaigning to become Prime Minister for the third time. The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for her murder.\n\nAll this tangled history was going through my mind when I met with her son at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington. Bhutto Zardari was visiting the US capital as his country faces what is arguably the worst crisis since its founding in 1947; by late August, floods of biblical proportions had submerged a third of the country.\n\nBhutto Zardari told me, “One in seven people, 33 million, are affected. The World Health Organization has warned of a second catastrophe in the form of a health crisis with waterborne diseases. There will also be food insecurity because of the millions of acres of crops destroyed.”\n\nThe flooding over the summer has caused an estimated $30 billion in damage.\n\nIn addition to the immediate crisis, Bhutto Zardari said now was the time to implement a longer-term solution – “a Green Marshall Plan” for climate-stressed developing countries such as Pakistan that have only a small impact on global warming but are disproportionately suffering its costs.\n\nBhutto Zardari pointed out that while Pakistan contributes less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming gases, it is one of the countries most affected by climate change. A “Green Marshall Plan” would allow countries such as Pakistan to build infrastructure more resilient to its effects.\n\nAsked about the Taliban, which now control Afghanistan, Bhutto Zardari surprised me when he advocated for greater engagement with them, even though the Afghan Taliban shelters elements of the Pakistani Taliban, the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for his mother’s murder. “They are our neighbors,” he said. “Our neighbors aren’t going away, and we need a peaceful, stable Afghanistan, so we don’t see an exodus of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, and we don’t see an exponential increase in terrorism.”\n\nBhutto Zardari explained that the dire economic situation in Afghanistan made dealing with the Taliban more important since predictions indicate that more than 90% of the Afghan population may soon fall below the poverty line. “History has shown us that theocratic, autocratic regimes, when faced with tough economic times, tend to contract rights rather than expand rights,” said Bhutto Zardari, who studied history at Oxford.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAt the end of our interview, we returned to the subject of his mother, Benazir, whom I had met many times over the years, including the first time that she was Prime Minister during the late 1980s and had only recently given birth to him.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was assassinated almost two decades later at age 54 when she was a politician at the height of her powers. She was very much an ally of the United States, an enemy of Islamist terrorists such as al Qaeda and the Taliban, and also an advocate for liberal democracy in Pakistan.\n\nI asked her son, “Would Pakistan have had a very different trajectory if she had become Prime Minister for the third time”? The foreign minister replied, “Yes. I think that’s pretty safe to say.”", "authors": ["Peter Bergen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/letters/2024/10/25/writers-make-endorsements-in-nh-maine-us-races-letters/75807897007/", "title": "Writers make endorsements in NH, Maine, US races: Letters", "text": "Portsmouth Herald\n\nWe can’t trust Kelly Ayotte with our rights\n\nOct. 10 − To the Editor:\n\nOn November 5th, abortion and LGBTQ+ rights are on the ballot in New Hampshire. In a post-Roe world where our reproductive landscape has been thrown into chaos, we need a Governor that is fully committed to protecting and expanding access to reproductive and gender-affirming care. That’s why I’m urging you to vote for Joyce Craig.\n\nCraig plans to codify abortion rights into law, repeal existing restrictions, enhance access to IVF and fertility treatments, protect health centers from violence, and support funding for family planning providers. As Mayor of Manchester, Craig supported Planned Parenthood’s Health Center.\n\nHer opponent for Governor, Kelly Ayotte, has a long record of undermining sexual and reproductive health care, making it very clear where she stands on these issues and how she would lead as governor. As a US Senator, Ayotte voted for a national abortion ban and voted to defund Planned Parenthood every chance she got. She even voted to allow employers and insurance companies to refuse coverage of IVF!\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAyotte and Craig’s records tell us all we need to know. Vote for Craig on November 5th to strength our abortion rights and access to reproductive health care!\n\nPatty Keck\n\nPortsmouth\n\nKelly Ayotte will keep NH a top state in the nation\n\nOct. 20 -- To the Editor:\n\nThis year US News and World Report ranked New Hampshire number two in the nation in the Best States ranking including first in Crime and Corrections and first in Economic Opportunity. We would like to see Kelly Ayotte as the next Governor, to follow Sununu’s successful path keeping New Hampshire the safest state to live (ranked 1st Public Safety and 2nd Pollution), keeping our low taxes , and growing the economy (ranked 7th Economy).\n\nAs our US Senator, Kelly defended the constitution, was an advocate to secure the southern border, watched out for wasteful spending, and supported strengthening the military. She understands the value of working with both sides of the aisle.\n\nShe was New Hampshire’s first woman Attorney General; as our chief law enforcement officer, Kelly worked daily with law enforcement to protect freedom, rights, and safety for Granite Staters. Kelly’s experience as Attorney General and as a well-respected US Senator, leaves her uniquely qualified to support growing New Hampshire’s economic advantage (ranked 1st Economic Opportunity.) by adding jobs and housing and stopping New Hampshire from becoming Massachusetts (ranked 10th overall).\n\nShe supports our high quality of life with low crime rates (ranked 1st in Public Safety), excellent education (ranked 4th K to 12 Education), and work to strengthen penalties on heroin and fentanyl. New Hampshire has some of the best abortion laws in the country allowing women six months to make this major decision, and nine months for medical reasons. Kelly has the experience, the understanding, is bipartisan, and knows the value of working with all sides to make decisions that are best for the people of New Hampshire.\n\nStella Scamman, Doug Scamman\n\nStratham\n\nVote for Sen. Debra Altschiller to keep focus on solutions\n\nOct. 15 − To the Editor:\n\nThere is no Plan B for our Earth. Serious weather events are happening all around us. More frequent and destructive hurricanes, expanding droughts and flooding, unprecedented heat waves, dying coral reefs due to warming oceans…the list goes on and on. We must address climate change quickly for the health of our planet and generations to come.\n\nNH Senate candidate Pat Abrami doesn’t agree, denying climate change is an urgent concern. In a recent interview, he said in essence it’s not happening tomorrow, don’t sweat it. Despite long established science and environmental evidence, he chooses to tow the Republican line – that climate change is not happening. NH has lost so much time to Gov. Chris Sununu’s heel-dragging on proactive clean energy strategies.\n\nIncumbent Sen. Debra Altschiller is very concerned, and doing something about it. She is working in the Legislature and with communities statewide to address their increased need for safety, protection, and forward-thinking solutions.\n\nNew Hampshire has accessible resources and many excellent, active organizations working hard to create a sustainable environment. We could be a leader in this important area. Your vote for Debra Altschiller and other Democrats who take this issue seriously can help ensure a viable future for our children and grandchildren.\n\nSusan Varn\n\nKensington\n\nVote Emmett Soldati for District 1 Executive Councilor\n\nOct. 20 − To the Editor:\n\nOne of the most important votes for state office on November 5th is that of Executive Councilor. New Hampshire is the only state with an Executive Council. Since the founding of the state in 1784, its five elected representatives act as a check and balance on the Governor making sure he or she has the votes of the majority for state contracts (now over $10,000), commission and board appointments, and judicial nominations. In addition, Councilor assist constituents with concerns related to state agencies or issues.\n\nIt is long overdue for District One to have an Executive Councilor committed to representing all in his district. Joe Kenney has failed us over his six terms. Recently, questioning awarding a DES contract to NH Lakes for their statewide invasive species prevention work. Since 2002, their Lake Host volunteers have inspected some 1.6 million boats and made over 1,500 saves. Clean lakes are a major contributor to our economic vitality.\n\nIn February 2017, on the confirmation of Frank Edlebut as Education Commissioner, Kenney said, “We’re going to hold him accountable, we’re going to make sure he doesn’t get off the track, that he’s there for one purpose, to make the public education system the best it can be and also look at other alternative ways to educate our kids. If he succeeds, we all succeed. If he fails, we all fail.” Edlebut is destroying public education which is extremely vital to NH’s economic prosperity. Kenney is known to turn away when constituents raise such issues with him.\n\nExecutive Councilors should be non-partisan. Emmett Soldati will better represent all of us. Soldati will advocate for our public schools, healthcare access, reproductive rights, and work to safeguard our environment. He is committed to improving the lives of all Granite Staters.\n\nVote Emmett Soldati for Executive Councilor.\n\nEliza Leadbeater\n\nGilford\n\nRe-elect Michele Meyer to Maine House District 150\n\nOct. 20 − To the Editor:\n\nI am writing in support of reelecting Representative Michele Meyer to the Maine House of Representatives District 150.\n\nWhen I met Michele as she was going door to door to visit with her constituents. I was immediately impressed by how she actively listened to my thoughts and concerns and then responded by sharing her thoughts, her record and the reasons for her commitment to public service. She leads from a place of compassion and is a do-er. She has worked hard on improving economic security for Mainers, she has a 100% voting record on gun safety reform and works hard for property tax relief legislation.\n\nShe actively supports our public education system and programs that protect the health and welfare of children. She protects LBGTQ rights and the reproductive rights of women and walks the talk by consistently voting and working at protecting those rights.\n\nMichele Michele was named Legislator of the year by the Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Maine Council on Aging. Voters in District 150 are lucky to have someone so dedicated, hard working and committed to Mainers as Michele is. She shows up, she does the work and she works from a place of compassion for her state and her people.\n\nAndrea Mitter-Burke\n\nEliot, Maine\n\nRe-elect Tiffany Roberts to Maine State House of Representatives\n\nOct. 20 − To the Editor:\n\nAs a resident of Maine, I am proud to support Tiffany Roberts in her bid for re-election to the State House of Representatives. Tiffany has shown time and time again that she is deeply committed to the people of our district and to the values that make Maine such a special place to live. As a first time voter, I value her engagement and understanding of our desires and needs.\n\nDuring her tenure, Tiffany has championed causes that directly impact our community, including expanding access to healthcare, protecting our natural resources, and supporting Maine’s working families. Her work on clean energy initiatives is helping to ensure a sustainable future for us and future generations.\n\nTiffany’s ability to navigate complex issues and her willingness to engage with her constituents sets her apart as a truly effective representative. She doesn’t just talk about change; she delivers results. Her dedication to transparency and accountability has earned her the respect and trust of people across the political spectrum. As we find ourselves within an extremely polarized political landscape, it is refreshing to find leaders like Tiffany who listens to everyone's interests and perspectives.\n\nWith Tiffany Roberts in the State House, I know that our community’s concerns will continue to be a priority. I encourage everyone who cares about the future of Maine to support her re-election. Let’s keep moving forward with a leader who truly understands and represents us.\n\nLuke Nelson\n\nSouth Berwick, Maine\n\nI'm not a fan of Putin or Trump\n\nOct. 20 -- To the Editor:\n\nRecently I spent 7 weeks in the Republic of Georgia. With each restaurant receipt at the bottom it says “20% of Georgia is occupied by Russia.” It is a country that was invaded by Russia in 2008 and even though a peace treaty was eventually signed, Russia is still there. I’ve not been a fan of Putin since back in 2000 when the submarine Kursk with 118 men went down in trouble and Putin would not accept any help from the seven countries who wanted to help.\n\nMy own father and classmates’ fathers often had to go on sea trials at PNSY. Finding out that Trump gave to Dictator Putin life saving COVID testing machine for his personal use when so many Americans were dying, why are people not outraged? Those machines belonged to Americans, not a dictator. Wake up America you can educate yourself! Go back to the history of the 30's 40's and read what was taking place and how similar this all sounds now. If you really want to educate yourself read Project 2025 and the 165 pages Jack Smith filed with the court about Jan 6 and Trump’s involvement. It includes over 70 Republican witnesses including his Vice President Mike Pence. Not sure why Trump supporters are in his camp; is it they like a pathological liar or someone who calls his supporters basement dwellers or who has been with a porn star?\n\nAs a person who went to St Patrick’s School in Portsmouth where honesty and truth were big themes, I will not vote for Trump or any Republican who is a liar.\n\nGail Morse, registered Republican\n\nExeter\n\nTrump looks like a boy scout compared to Harris\n\nOct. 20 – To the Editor:\n\nRegarding character: Trump looks like a boy scout compared to Harris.\n\nHarris \"fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions.\" (NY Times) David Larsen, imprisoned ten years, found innocent; she delayed release 2 more years.\n\nDefended California’s death penalty while refusing to investigate police killings.\n\nAn admitted pot-smoker, she oversaw 1900 convictions for pot offenses, disproportionately imprisoning Blacks.\n\nWhen Black Lives Matters gained momentum, she championed Defund the Police.\n\nAs DA, 29, she was mistress to San Francisco’s married mayor Willie Brown, 59, a powerful, under-FBI-investigation politician.\n\nHarris initiated arresting/fining parents whose kid(s) missed 10% school days. personally prosecuting 20 families, Claimed none jailed; seven were.

My political awareness began with Vietnam. Since then I’ve watched the parties trading words with varying degrees of disrespect or vitriol, but I never thought I’d see a person the calibre of Trump being taken seriously as a possible leader of the USA.\n\nMs. Harris has backbone and smarts and she doesn’t mince words.

So I decided when evaluating the candidates for President of the United States, I wanted to listen to the people who worked with them, who spent time with them, and who knew them the best.\n\nWhen looking at Vice President Kamala Harris the comments were: A tough boss. An empathetic prosecutor. At times, slow to make decisions. A “consummate college student” with a wry sense of humor.\n\nSource: NPR: “We spoke to Five People Who Knew Kamala Harris Before She was VP” August 5, 2024\n\nWhen looking at Former President Trump, I decided to listen to those who had previously served as cabinet officials in his first administration.\n\nSource: NBC News: “Dozens served in Trump’s Cabinet. Four say he should be re-elected.” July 30, 2023\n\nFirst, I listened to former Attorney General Bill Barr, who said “I have made clear that I strongly oppose Trump for the nomination and will not endorse Trump,”\n\nWhen asked how he would choose between Trump and Biden, Barr said: “I’ll jump off that bridge when I get to it.” And honestly, fair, I agree with Barr, both Trump and Biden are far too old to be president again. We cannot trust the future of our nation to someone so old.\n\nMike Pence, the man who loyally served at Trump’s side, his second in command for 4 years, said “I believe anyone that puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States and anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again,”\n\nMeanwhile, both Liz and Dick Cheney, two extreme GOP conservatives, are not planning to support Trump. Liz Cheney said ““He is petty, he is vindictive, and he is cruel, and Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation.””\n\nI don’t know Donald Trump, I have never met the man, so I’m not sure that I am best qualified to judge him. However, I think that the people he chose to surround himself with, the people he chose to work for him, would be the best ones to judge him, and dozens of his former officials have come back with a unanimous verdict that Donald Trump is unfit to be president again.\n\nAfter reading this, my hope is that you will consider voting for Vice President Harris and Governor Walz. If you simply cannot stomach voting for a Democrat, I will accept that, then simply don’t vote for a presidential candidate and move onto the next race.\n\nAmy Borne\n\nRye\n\nDeadline for election letters is Oct. 30\n\nPlease keep letters to 250 words or less.

The opinions in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nFootball watch parties saw unexpected interruptions recently when low flying drones over the gridiron forced NFL and college football games to stop. In both instances, the drones flew away without incident and there was no risk to fans attending, but each demonstrates the potential public safety threat unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or “drones” pose to the public, and the need for tools to address it.\n\nAlejandro Mayorkas Zachary Hupp/DHS\n\nDrones have become ubiquitous and are helping Americans do everything from capturing epic sunsets over the Grand Canyon to fighting wildfires and assessing the damage caused by natural disasters like Hurricane Ian. This technology is helping make our economy more efficient and our communities safer, but even a seemingly harmless drone creates grave danger when flown in the wrong place or when in the hands of a person with nefarious intent.\n\nAs Americans travel at pre-pandemic numbers and return to sporting events, music festivals and other large gatherings, those risks escalate.\n\nThough unmanned aircraft systems can be small in size, the risk is increasing due to their growing sophistication, speed and widespread availability. Experts predict that global shipment of drones will hit 2.91 million in 2023.\n\nTheir increased availability comes with very real consequences for public safety and security. In recent years, we have witnessed bad actors abroad weaponize drones to attempt assassinations of heads of state, attack authorities and attack critical infrastructure. The US Secret Service has encountered hundreds of drones violating temporary flight restrictions that protect high-ranking officials. Air travel domestically has also been affected.\n\nAt least 33 full or partial suspensions of airport operations have occurred since 2019 as a result of drones entering flight paths, causing millions of dollars of economic damage. Drones have collided with helicopters used by the police, the military and first responders.\n\nThe energy and chemical sectors regularly report suspicious activities related to drone flights. In 2020, a crashed drone outside an electrical substation in Pennsylvania was found to have modifications likely designed to disrupt the grid. Last year alone, 235 suspicious drone flights were reported at or near chemical plants in Louisiana. Authorities are also aware of suspicious flights near oil storage facilities in Oklahoma and natural gas facilities in Texas.\n\nTransnational criminals use drones in an attempt to ferry illicit narcotics and contraband over US borders and to conduct hostile surveillance of law enforcement on a near-daily basis. From August 2021 to May 2022, for instance, US Customs and Border Protection detected more than 8,000 attempted illegal cross-border drone flights.\n\nWe know of and mitigate these threats thanks to current authority to counter unmanned aircraft systems. In fact, DHS has safely protected our missions, the President and the public over 300 times, and we have worked with the FAA to minimize impact to the national airspace system – all while protecting individuals’ privacy, civil rights and civil liberties.\n\nBut our current authority is limited and could lapse. TSA spotted nearly 2,000 drones around airports in the last year, of which 63 incidents required pilots take evasive action; however, neither TSA nor state and local law enforcement can stop those drones under current law. During a recent drone incident at a professional football game in Seattle, local authorities did not have the equipment or authority necessary to prevent the drone from entering the restricted airspace above the stadium. Building partnerships with local law enforcement agencies will be necessary to detect and mitigate threats going forward.\n\nWe are grateful that Congress recently passed a temporary measure to maintain our current ability to identify, detect and reduce the risk of drones through December, but a short-term extension of the status quo is not a permanent solution for this growing threat. The ability of the private sector, and federal, state and local governments to mitigate the risk drones create depends on Congress enabling the Biden Administration’s Domestic Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems National Action Plan and passing bipartisan C-UAS legislation.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe law would better reinforce our critical infrastructure, including our nation’s transportation system, from drone threats. It would help us work closely with state and local officials to detect dangerous drones and launch a pilot program to implement counter drone protection activities with close oversight from the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice to ensure they adhere to federal privacy, civil rights and civil liberties protections.\n\nSwift Congressional action is necessary to create a more permanent solution to responding to threats from drones being operated in a reckless or nefarious manner in the ever-changing risk environment we see today. The failure to continue to empower the government to address this clear and present threat to our homeland would be simply unacceptable. Protecting public safety is our top priority, and it is a responsibility we all share. We hope Congress agrees and acts swiftly this year.", "authors": ["Alejandro Mayorkas"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-visual-explainer-maps", "title": "Six maps explaining the Ukraine-Russia conflict | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday began a military operation in Ukraine after weeks of warnings by Western powers that such an attack was imminent.\n\nBut Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was also precipitated by years of rising tensions. Below are six maps that help illustrate the events that led to this moment.\n\nNATO since the Cold War\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, more countries have been joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, pushing the bloc eastward.\n\nIn 2008, NATO declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine – a former cornerstone of the Soviet Union – some day in the distant future. But Russia considered that crossing a red line.\n\nThis map shows NATO’s expansion eastward in Europe. Many countries in western Europe joined prior to 1991 and the end of the Cold War, while those to the east – including the former Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – joined in the years since.\n\nPutin has indicated he sees NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act.” He has emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically, and Russia asked amid recent tensions for guarantees the European and North American defense alliance wouldn’t expand further east.\n\nThe United States and NATO have resisted. The alliance’s “open door policy” states that any European country ready and willing to undertake the commitments and obligations of membership is welcome to apply for membership. And since the end of the Cold War, more than a dozen countries from the former Eastern bloc have joined.\n\nAnnexing part of Ukraine\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the Ukrainian capital forced out a Russian-backed president after he refused to sign a historic political and trade agreement with the European Union.\n\nRussia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, highlighted in red along the Black Sea’s northern coast in the map below, and fomenting a separatist rebellion that seized control of part of the Donbas region along Ukraine’s southeastern border with Russia.\n\nDespite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since.\n\nInflamed tensions\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the US State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nThose efforts have also manifested themselves on the ground, as seen in this map, which illustrates the buildup of Russia’s military presence around Ukraine in the past year. Russia has amassed more than 150,000 troops, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nAs the situation on Ukraine’s border has intensified, NATO has raised the readiness of its rapid response force, while member countries put troops on standby and deployed battalions, planes and ships to defend member states in the region. The buildup of these resources, seen in this map, includes thousands of US troops deployed in Poland.\n\nRussian invasion\n\nOn February 21, Putin said he officially recognized the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), highlighted in the map below in red, in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there on the pretext of protecting the local population.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nHours before dawn on Thursday, February 24, Russia’s assault on Ukraine finally began with a series of missile attacks and the use of long-range artillery. This map shows the locations of reported attacks and explosions as of Thursday night, including in and around major cities such as the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east and Odessa in the south, among others.\n\nHead here for the latest updates on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Henrik Pettersson Eliza Mackintosh Dakin Andone Natalie Croker Sarah-Grace Mankarious", "Henrik Pettersson", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Dakin Andone", "Natalie Croker", "Sarah-Grace Mankarious"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/03/election-2024-live-updates-harris-and-trump-make-final-campaign-push/76009369007/", "title": "Election 2024 live updates: Harris and Trump battle in swing states", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news on the campaign trail for the 2024 election on Sunday, Nov. 3. For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Monday, Nov. 4.\n\nWith just two days left until Election Day, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are pushing to the finish line in must-win states.\n\nThe former president is rallying voters in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia on Sunday, while the vice president has planned multiple stops in Michigan.\n\nHere are some of the key moments from Sunday's campaign trail:\n\nTrump told a crowd in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, that he \"shouldn't have left\" the White House in 2020, going further than he has previously in claiming that he defeated President Joe Biden.\n\nThe former president also escalated his violent rhetoric toward journalists saying he wouldn't \"mind\" if a potential assassin shot \"through the fake news\" to get to him.\n\nHarris took the stage at Michigan State University making a direct appeal to Arab Americans promising to end the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHarris also leaned in making her last appeal to young voters: \"I see you. And I see your power.\"\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage live from the campaign trail.\n\nNBC gives Trump equal time after Harris appears on 'SNL'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was given free airtime during NBC’s NASCAR coverage Sunday to compensate for Vice President Kamala Harris’ appearance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" according to reports.\n\nIn a filing on Sunday, NBC told the Federal Communications Commission that Harris appeared \"without charge\" on \"SNL\" for 1 minute and 30 seconds during the show’s opening sketch.\n\nThe broadcaster gave Trump the chance to directly address viewers during the NASCAR 2024 Cup playoff race, according to CNN and The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe FCC's equal time rule requires American radio and television broadcast stations to provide equal access to competing political candidates.\n\n− Emily DeLetter and Maureen Groppe\n\nIf he returns to the White House, Trump says 'it'll be nasty a little bit’\n\nGreat. Fun. Nasty.\n\nThat’s how former President Donald Trump described the next four years if voters send him back to the White House.\n\n\"We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. You watch. It’s going to be so good. It’s going to be so much fun,\" Trump said as he wrapped up his third Sunday rally. “It’ll be nasty a little bit at times and maybe at the beginning in particular. But it’s going to be something.”\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump hits hard on immigration\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to focus heavily on immigration, repeating at his Georgia rally his claims that the United States \"is now an occupied country.\"\n\n\"The day I take the oath in office the migrant invasion ends,\" Trump said. \"I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered.\"\n\nMany people in the country illegally, he said without evidence, are murderers and terrorists. And he said they were taking away jobs, mostly from Black Americans.\n\nBefore criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris’ record on immigration, Trump said she is \"running on nothing but hate and demonization.\"\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nIowa can challenge ballots of 2,000 voters on flawed noncitizen list\n\nA federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa poll workers could challenge ballots of more than 2,000 state residents who appeared on a flawed list of possible noncitizens.\n\nIowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, told county auditors on Oct. 22 to challenge the ballots of registered voters who’d previously told the state they were not U.S. citizens.\n\nA group of naturalized citizens and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa sued, saying the challenges wrongly forced naturalized citizens — who are eligible to vote — to clear extra hurdles that other voters did not have to undergo.\n\nU.S. District Judge Stephen Locher wrote Sunday that the decision could stand given that both the state and the plaintiffs agree that some of the individuals on the list are not U.S. citizens.\n\nPate, who acknowledged he was under immense pressure to ensure that only citizens were voting in Iowa, has said that challenged voters can submit provisional ballots and their votes will be counted if they prove their citizenship or the county auditor has verified they are a citizen.\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller and Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris calls on Black women organizers\n\nVice President Kamala Harris remained on the tarmac after arriving in Detroit on Sunday night so she could dial into a Win With Black Women organizing call.\n\nHarris dialed into the weekly call to thank her friends and some of the earliest supporters of her campaign.\n\n“This coalition has been in my corner for the last four years, and just four months ago immediately jumped into action with this weekly call to be the first group to organize tens of thousands of Black women in support of our brand new campaign,” Harris said. “You were the catalyst.”\n\nThe day President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, the group held a call that drew 44,000 participants. Other supporters of Harris soon held similar calls.\n\nShe asked them to mobilize their Facebook Groups and family group chats to vote for her.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump in Georgia: `Kamala broke it and I will fix it'\n\nAt a Sunday night rally in Macon, Georgia, former President Donal Trump said the election is a choice between “four more years in gross incompetence and failure” and the “four greatest years in the history of our country.”\n\n“This is really all you need to know,” Trump said. “Kamala broke it, and I will fix it.”\n\nIn 2020, Trump narrowly lost Georgia, one of seven states expected to decide this year’s presidential election.\n\nTrump said the race is “on the 5-yard line, maybe even the 1-yard line.”\n\n“We’re going to close this thing out,” he said, “and it’s going to be party time.”\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nHarris to Gen Z in Michigan: 'I see your power'\n\nDuring a rally at Michigan State University, Vice President Kamala Harris told young voters that she recognizes the power they hold.\n\nYoung voters are leading the charge to shield the environment from the effects of climate change and protect America’s schools from active shooters, she said, bringing up the Supreme Court’s rollback of reproductive rights.\n\n“None of these issues for you are theoretical. This is not political for you all, this is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your power. And I am so proud of you,” she said to loud cheers.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris begins Michigan State rally with an appeal to Arab Americans\n\nVice President Kamala Harris started her final Michigan rally with an appeal to the state’s large Arab American population.\n\nAt the start of her remarks at a Sunday evening rally in East Lansing, Michigan, Harris acknowledged the presence of leaders of the Arab American community, which has “deep and proud roots” in the state.\n\n“And I want to say, this year has been difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating,” Harris said. “And as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza.”\n\nShe was stopped mid-sentence by loud cheering. Continuing, she said she’d work to “bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom and self-determination.”\n\nThe Biden administration is still working on a diplomatic resolution across the Israel-Lebanon border, she said, to “protect civilians and provide lasting stability.\n\n“And as president, I will work tirelessly toward a future with security and dignity for all people,” she pledged, before delivering her regular stump speech.\n\nHarris has been interrupted at her rallies over the past several weeks in Michigan and elsewhere by pro-Palestinian protesters who are unhappy about the Biden administration’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas. She stressed her support from Arab American leaders earlier on Sunday after she was asked about her closing message to the community.\n\nTrump met with Arab American supporters of his campaign on Friday in Dearborn, Michigan, which has a high concentration of Lebanese Americans.\n\n–Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris rally in Georgia a family affair with Doug Emhoff and Maya Harris\n\nA Harris rally in Atlanta on Sunday was a family affair featuring the vice president’s sister, Maya Harris, and her husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nEmhoff, sporting a black Harris-Walz cap, said he was proud to see his wife address tens of thousands of people at the Eclipse in Washington, D.C.\n\n“My wife is such a badass,’’ he told a packed ballroom. “We saw a president on that stage. We saw a leader.’’\n\nEvery speaker that took the microphone Sunday, including Rep. Lucy McBath, a Democrat from Georgia, urged the crowd to vote and take others to the polls on Election Day.\n\n“Georgia you can decide this election,” Maya Harris told the crowd, praising people across the country canvassing for the campaign.\n\nGeorgians need to continue showing up in record numbers “so you leave no doubt where you stand,” she said.\n\nEmhoff said it’s the first campaign rally he and Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, have done together. Walz said that unlike Trump, Harris would not go into the White House with an enemy list but with a to-do list.\n\nGeorgia, Walz said, could help Harris win. “Momentum is on our side, but we’re not taking anything for granted,\" he said.\n\n“If we win by one vote it will be Jimmy Carter’s vote,’’ he said to rousing applause.\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nKevin McCarthy calls on Donald Trump to campaign with Nikki Haley\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told USA TODAY Sunday that he believes Donald Trump has the “advantage” in the presidential race as it nears its conclusion, but said the former president could be doing more to close the deal.\n\n“You could’ve been more uniting, you know, if you put the Nikki Haleys, others, in there,” said the former congressman from California. “You’re running a general election, not a primary.”\n\nTrump’s former United Nations Ambassador, Haley ran against the former president in the GOP primary and drew support from moderate Republicans, a group Kamala Harris has courted with endorsements from Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney. Haley endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention, but hasn’t been on the campaign trail with him.\n\n“To me, it’s all about addition not subtraction,” McCarthy said. “So where am I weak? I bring Nikki Haley in.”\n\nYet McCarthy also believes Trump has “reached out” beyond his base by incorporating Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former Democrat, into his campaign.\n\nKennedy, who Trump has promised to give a big role on health issues in a future administration, has been campaigning heavily for the former president in the closing stretch. Kennedy is an anti-vaccine advocate whose public comments on health care have drawn widespread backlash.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nHarris stops by chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit\n\nAfter attending a Sunday morning church service, Kamala Harris grabbed lunch at a chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit.\n\nThe crowd crammed inside Kuzzo’s Chicken and Waffles erupted into cheers when Harris entered the restaurant, which is owned by former Detroit Lions cornerback Ron Bartell. The vice president worked the room for several minutes, shaking hands with two women who work at the eatery and posing for photos and selfies with other patrons.\n\nSpotted in the crowd: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.\n\nNo word on what the vice president picked up for lunch.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nOprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga to appear at Harris’ final campaign rally Monday night\n\nOprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga will join Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff Monday night in Philadelphia as the Democratic nominee makes her closing arguments to voters, according to her campaign.\n\nWinfrey and Gaga’s appearances will wrap up a star-studded lineup of back-to-back Harris-Walz events across all seven battleground states, all featuring a range of celebrity appearances and musical performances.\n\nHarris will hold two in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, starting in Pittsburgh where D-Nice, Katy Perry, and Andra Day are slated to perform. Later in Philadelphia, Winfrey and Gaga will be joined on stage by DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway, Just Blaze, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan, and Adam Blackstone.\n\nThe Pennsylvania rallies are part of a series of get-out-the-vote events simultaneously taking place in other critical swing states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nHarris addresses death toll in Israel-Hamas war\n\nWith just two days until the election, Kamala Harris on Sunday made a pitch to Arab Americans who are on the fence about supporting her over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAsked by a reporter in Detroit what her closing argument would be to Arab Americans, Harris repeated what she has said previously about the war in the Gaza Strip. The number of “innocent Palestinians” killed is “unconscionable,” she said.\n\n“We need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out, and as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end,” Harris said.\n\nHarris also repeated her call for a two-state solution.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nSupporters gather for Atlanta Harris-Walz rally\n\nThe line snaked down the halls Sunday afternoon for the Harris-Walz rally at a hotel in Atlanta, where Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were slated to speak. Some people wore T-shirts that read, “We’re not going back’’ and “Republicans for Harris.”\n\nRenee Cobbs, 70, of Powder Springs, Georgia, was among the first to enter the ballroom.\n\n“I’m celebrating already,’’ Cobbs said as she pinned a Harris button on her jean jacket. “I’m optimistic not only about Georgia, but also the other battleground states.’’\n\nIt was Cobbs’ second Harris-Walz rally. She went to hear the vice president at a recent rally in Decatur, Georgia. By Friday, the last day for early voting, more than 4 million people had voted in Georgia, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.\n\nCobbs said she worries Trump is too negative and pointed to what she called his ramped-up rhetoric, which she said has only gotten worse since Harris took the top of the ticket. “Kamala is one of the best things for the country and the world at this point,’’ said Cobbs.\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nHarris votes by mail-in ballot\n\nKamala Harris has cast her vote for president – by mail.\n\nHarris, who served as a U.S. Senator from California before becoming vice president, told reporters traveling with her on Sunday that she filled out her ballot and that it is in the mail.\n\n“My ballot is on its way to California, and I'm going to trust the system that it will arrive there,” she said.\n\nHarris declined to say how she voted on a California ballot measure that would increase penalties for some theft- and drug-related crimes.\n\n“I am not going to talk about the vote on that, because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election, and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,” she said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nRFK Jr: Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Saturday that Donald Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources as one of his first presidential actions if he is reelected, falsely suggesting that the compound is dangerous.\n\nThe American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed water fluoridation, citing studies that show fluoride in community water systems can prevent at least 25 percent of tooth decay in children and adults.\n\nWhen reached for comment about Kennedy's remarks, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez did not directly address Kennedy's assertion, saying that Trump has \"received a variety of policy ideas\" but \"is focused on Tuesday’s election.\"\n\nBut in a phone call with Trump on Sunday morning, NBC News reporter Dasha Burns said the former president appeared open to Kennedy's plans. The former president reportedly said \"Well, I haven't talked to him about it yet, but it sounds okay to me. You know it's possible,\" when asked about Kennedy's suggestion to remove fluoride from public water.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump says he 'shouldn't have left' White House\n\nDonald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that he \"shouldn't have left\" the White House as he touted his accomplishments during office.\n\nAs Trump addressed his handling of the southern border and the nation's economy, he told the crowd: \"We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn't have left, I mean honestly.\"\n\nTrump has long falsely said that fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The former president launched a legal battle in states across the country after the election, but his claims of fraud were all rejected by courts.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nAllan Lichtman vs. Nate Silver: Who will accurately predict the 2024 election?\n\nAs voters look to polls and political analysts for insight into who might win the presidency on Tuesday, a feud between two of the nation’s leading election prognosticators, Allan Lichtman and Nate Silver, will soon be put to the test.\n\nLichtman, an American University professor who has correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential elections, has forecasted a win for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSilver, the statistician and pollster who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote recently in the New York Times that the race is a virtual tie, but his \"gut\" tells him former President Donald Trump will likely prevail.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance's final pitch to Arizona voters ties economic woes to illegal immigration\n\nVisiting Arizona just days before Election Day, JD Vance revved up a crowd in Scottsdale, Arizona, by arguing that Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens.\n\nVance, a senator from Ohio and the Republican nominee for vice president, ticked through a list of economic woes facing Americans and, using at times exaggerated or unclear claims, tied each problem to President Joe Biden and Harris' record on illegal immigration.\n\n“Compassion, for the American president, has to start with the American people, and the people who have the legal right to be here,” Vance told hundreds of supporters at Dillon Precision, a guns and ammunition storefront in Scottsdale.\n\n− Laura Gersony\n\nHarris says election offers opportunity for 'freedom, justice and compassion'\n\nKamala Harris followed her guest appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" by stopping by a Sunday morning church service in Detroit.\n\nHarris told congregants of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ that Tuesday’s election will give Americans a chance to decide whether they want to live in a country of “chaos, fear and hate” or “freedom, justice and compassion.”\n\nAmericans should answer that question, she said, “not just with our faith, but with our feet as we walk to the polls.”\n\nThe country will be tested over the next two days and the road won’t be easy, Harris said. But in times of uncertainty, she concluded by citing Psalm 30:5: “We are reminded weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”\n\n“Morning is on its way,” she said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nWhen will election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nElise Stefanik addresses gender gap between Kamala Harris, Donald Trump supporters\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., was asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" about the major gender gap among supporters that has emerged between Harris and Trump.\n\nFor example, a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll of Pennsylvania voters found Trump is up by 20 points among men in the commonwealth, 57% to 37%, while Harris has an 18% hold on women over Trump, 57% to 39%. That’s compared to Trump’s 16-point advantage among men nationally and Harris' 17-point advantage among women.\n\nStefanik denied concerns about Trump’s performance among women, turning the conversation to Harris’ numbers with male voters, telling host Shannon Bream “Trump is doing better among women than Kamala Harris is doing among men.”\n\nShe also said that inflation and concerns about the southern border were reasons that women would vote for Trump, claiming American women were economically better off under Trump. “It was the highest number of women ever in the workforce, the largest wage and salary increase for working women ever, child care was affordable,” Stefanik said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what metric Stefanik was referencing. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that women’s labor force participation peaked in 1999.\n\n– Cy Neff\n\nTrump escalates violent rhetoric toward news media\n\nTalking about the protective glass surrounding him, Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that a potential assassin would need to shoot through the news media to hit him. “I don’t mind that,” he said.\n\n\"I have a piece of glass over here. And I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we really have over here is the fake news, right?\" Trump said to laughs from the crowd.\n\n“And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that,” he said.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump criticizes polls after surprising Iowa survey\n\nThe former president usually loves to talk about polls, but on Sunday he criticized a surprising new poll out of the Midwest.\n\n\"The polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there,\" Donald Trump said during an airport rally near Lancaster, Pennsylvania., the start of a fly-around that will take him to North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday.\n\nTrump specifically cited The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday that shows him now trailing Harris in the Hawkeye State. But he also knocked other surveys released ahead of Election Day.\n\n\"We've got all this crap going on, with the press and with the fake stuff,\" Trump said. \"And fake polls.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump says elections should be 'one day' and on 'paper ballots'\n\nAt a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, on Sunday morning, former President Donald Trump repeated arguments that elections should only last one day and should be conducted on paper ballots, rather than on voting machines. He also aired concerns that election offices were “extending hours and stuff.”\n\n“Whoever heard of this stuff?” Trump said.\n\nA judge in Pennsylvania last week extended the deadline for Bucks County voters to request a mail-in ballot after Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging that long lines prevented some supporters from getting their ballot. The order extended the deadline from Wednesday, Oct. 30 to Friday, Nov. 1.\n\nIn Indiana, election officials in one county have proposed adding additional early morning voting hours to stem long voting lines.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump campaign adviser dismisses Iowa poll as 'outlier'\n\nTop Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is dismissing a poll out of Iowa that shows the former president trailing Kamala Harris in the red state.\n\nThe Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll has 47% of likely voters backing Harris, compared to Trump’s 44%. Lewandowski said the poll is “a complete outlier that has no credibility” and noted that the same poll had Trump and President Joe Biden tied in the state late in the 2020 race.\n\nTrump won Iowa by eight percentage points in 2020. Lewandowski noted that Harris hasn’t been campaigning in Iowa, pushing back against the idea that the state is in play.\n\nIt’s a bad sign for the Trump campaign if Harris is doing well in Iowa, one that raises questions about the former president’s prospects in other states with large numbers of older white voters. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey shows Harris winning female voters by 20 percentage points. She also has a big lead with senior voters and is beating Trump with Iowa independents.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\n'It doesn't make you a man': John Fetterman hits Donald Trump comments on transgender right\n\nSen. John Fetterman strongly condemned Donald Trump and Republicans' rhetoric about transgender rights during an interview on CNN Sunday, saying “it doesn't make you tough. It doesn't make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids.”\n\nFetterman was asked by anchor Dana Bash about whether Trump campaign ads that suggest Kamala Harris is “for they/them” are resonating in the pivotal swing state.\n\n“If your political capital, you know, comes from picking on trans kids or gay kids or anything like that, that you're just bankrupt throughout all of this,” Fetterman said. “My version of being is, it's like, ‘Hey, I like ribeye, I like Motorhead, and I'm never going to pick on trans kids and gay kids.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDoug Burgum addresses Iowa poll showing Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a campaign surrogate for Donald Trump who was once floated as a possible running mate, is brushing off new polling that suggests a Democratic victory in a long-red state.\n\nA Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.\n\nIn an interview with Kristen Welker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum placed little stock with the surprise poll figures, pointing to a competing Saturday poll from Emerson College putting Trump in a 10-point lead over Harris in the state.\n\n“If you take the average of those last two polls, I think Trump's still going to confidently win Iowa,” Burgum said on the NBC talk show Sunday. “I would be surprised, completely shocked, that [Harris win] comes anywhere close to being the fact that Iowa.”\n\nThe Republican governor remained optimistic about his party’s candidate, pointing to his recent campaign trail visits in several key battleground states: \"It’s a very tight race that is going to be decided on Tuesday, but the momentum in the last week that I felt on the ground... is that the energy from all demographics is very, very positive.”\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nDonald Trump reacts to Des Moines Register Iowa poll\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to criticize a new Iowa poll that shows him trailing Kamala Harris in the Midwestern state.\n\n\"No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,\" he said Sunday on his Truth Social account. \"In fact, it’s not even close!\"\n\nEven so, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.\n\nA loss in Iowa would be major for Trump, who campaigned in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia on Sunday.\n\n–David Jackson\n\nHarrison Ford, aka Indiana Jones, endorses Kamala Harris\n\nIndiana Jones is standing with Kamala Harris.\n\nActor Harrison Ford, who in a series of films played the adventurous archaeologist with a phobia of snakes, has released a video in which he endorses the Democratic presidential nominee and expresses a fear of something else: a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nIn the video, a gruff-voiced Ford cites the dozens of former members of the Trump administration who are sounding the alarm about the Republican nominee and telling voters “for God’s sake, don’t do this again.” Harris, he said, will protect Americans’ rights to degree with her on policy or ideas “and then, as we have done for centuries, we'll debate them, we'll work on them together, and we'll move forward.”\n\nFord concludes by saying he has one vote, “same as anyone else,” and that he’s going to use it by moving forward and voting for Harris.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGeorgia Sen. Raphael Warnock pressed on Joe Biden's 'garbage' comment\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock made an appearance Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and was asked about President Joe Biden's comment last week in which Biden appeared to call Trump's supporters \"garbage.\"\n\nThe president has since said he was only referring to the racist rhetoric at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. But Warnock on Sunday called for all Americans to take a closer look at the way they talk politics.\n\n\"As the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served, I think that we all need to elevate the character and the tone of our political discourse,\" Warnock said, adding that he believes \"That's what Kamala Harris is doing.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nCould Iowa be shifting back to a presidential swing state? What new poll shows\n\nCould red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?\n\nThe new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.\n\nYet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs. Neither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.\n\n– Des Moines Register staff\n\nWhere do Trump, Harris stand in the polls?\n\nThe 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.\n\nIt's also razor-close in swing states across the country. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nFCC commissioner criticizes Harris' 'SNL' appearance\n\nBrendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission suggested in a social media post on Sunday that Kamala Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” may have broken the FCC’s Equal Time Rule.\n\nCarr called Harris’ spot on the comedy show a \"clear and blatant effort to evade\" the commission's rules unless NBC offered former President Donald Trump a similar opportunity. The Equal Time Rule stipulates that radio and TV broadcasters give political candidates similar air time.\n\n“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured this appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr said in his post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nCarr, appointed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, is among five commissioners on the FCC.

Awad clarified for the crowd that he was speaking in a personal capacity when he made the electoral threat.\n\n\"No votes for you anywhere if you don’t call for a cease-fire now,\" he said.\n\nAwad's call for an electoral boycott of the Democratic party came one day after progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, released a video making a similar call to action.\n\n“Joe Biden supported the genocide of the Palestinian people,\" Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, says in the video. \"The American people won’t forget. Biden, support a cease-fire now. Or don’t count on us in 2024.”\n\n'Enough is enough'\n\nSome at the protest, such as Joan Nicholson, 89, of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, were drawn by their longstanding sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Others, like Xochitl Aldama, 25, of Tampa, Florida, said they came to the protest due to their newfound horror at the scale of destruction in Gaza.\n\nOthers were driven by personal loss.\n\n“I came with tens of thousands of others to hold my country accountable for its complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity,” Laila El Haddad, 45, a Palestinian American author, told USA TODAY.\n\n“I learned yesterday that five of my close family members – my aunt, three of my adult cousins, and my cousin’s wife – were killed by an Israeli airstrike on their Gaza City home.”\n\n“I’m here to say enough is enough,” she said.\n\nBig crowd spills beyond Freedom Plaza\n\nBy late Saturday afternoon, it was unclear how many people had participated in the rally. The crowd spilled out of Freedom Plaza and across the adjoining streets.\n\nThe U.S. Park Police said in response to a query that it was “prohibited from providing crowd sizes for any event.” The D.C. Metropolitan Police didn’t respond to calls seeking an estimate of the crowd’s size.\n\nAs the speeches wound down shortly before 5 p.m, a stream of demonstrators two city blocks long left the plaza to march to the White House as Arabic pop music played and participants shared snacks of carrot sticks and crackers. Some marchers carried mock coffins representing the victims of Israeli strikes on Gaza.\n\nThe bulk of the marchers stood outside the White House for about 30 minutes chanting slogans before dispersing.\n\nOne man was arrested for destruction of property during the protest in Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Officer Elizabeth Grannis said. The man is accused of spray painting windows of a business in the 700 block of 17th Street, NW, a police social media post said.\n\nIn a social media post Saturday evening, traffic police said people were gradually dispersing from Lafayette Park, and police are planning to reopen planned road closures.\n\nPolice were still monitoring the protests in front of the White House, Grannis said.\n\nJust before 8 p.m., Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service, told USA TODAY demonstrators remained at the White House complex, but an attempt to trespass at a gate was handled without incident. No arrests had been made by Secret Service personnel, he said.\n\nAnti-Defamation League claims rally had 'zero acknowledgment of Israeli suffering'\n\nThe speeches at Freedom Plaza were full of grief over the destruction of Gaza and anger about the war, but no one who took the stage Saturday condemned Hamas or its attack on Israel, Meredith Weisel, capital region director of the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\n\"There was zero acknowledgment of Israeli suffering,\" Weisel said in an interview, \"and a lot of legitimizing and justification for violence against Israelis.\"\n\nOne group of demonstrators carried a banner bearing the hashtag #AlAqsaFlood, the name that Hamas gave to its stunning attack last month.\n\n\"Surely there are people there today who are responding to the humanitarian crisis\" in Gaza, Weisel added. \"But most of the people we have have seen on the stage have been justifying what happened on Oct. 7.\"\n\nProtesters in New York, London and Paris demand an end to the Gaza war\n\nOn Saturday evening, images circulated online showed scores of demonstrators marching through Midtown Manhattan streets toward the United Nations building. The New York City Police Department said there were temporary road closures because of the protest, though no arrests had been made. Mayor Eric Adams was monitoring the protest, a City Hall spokesperson said in a text message.\n\nU.N. press officers didn't immediately respond to emails Saturday evening.\n\nOn Friday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported protesters at the Port of Oakland, in California, scaled a U.S. military vessel believed to be headed to Israel.\n\nIn Europe, at least 11 people were arrested in London on Saturday afternoon as a surge of hundreds of demonstrators shut down the Oxford Circus shopping and tourist district, blocking streets and chanting slogans in support of the Palestinian people.\n\n“This behavior clearly impacts on London’s ability to function normally and we are working quickly to reopen the road,” London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement.\n\nIn Paris, thousands marched to demand a cease-fire in the first mass gathering allowed by officials since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. As he marched, Wahid Barek, a 66-year-old retiree, told Reuters he opposed the killing of both Israelis and Palestinians. \"I deplore civilian deaths on both sides. Civilians have nothing to do with these actions. It really is shameful,\" he said.\n\nProtesters also took to the streets in Berlin, Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey to protest the bombardment of Gaza.\n\nToddlers and grandmothers join the crowd at protest in DC\n\nBy 2:30 p.m., Pennsylvania Avenue and other streets around the rally were thick with demonstrators as speakers began addressing the calm but energized assembly. Organizers said that 40 buses carrying attendees couldn't reach the plaza after streets were closed, organizers said. The passengers walked under cloud-streaked skies attempting to get as close as they could to the rally.\n\nThe crowd included participants using wheelchairs, toddlers and people of all races wearing the keffiya, a traditional scarf worn in Arab regions. Many held signs calling for an end to the war in Gaza, with some linking the Palestinian cause with other world events, including a placard that read: \"From Palestine to Mexico, these border walls have got to go.\"\n\nNavy vet among the swelling numbers at Gaza protest\n\nAs demonstrators filled Freedom Plaza, spilling out onto the surrounding streets, chanting \"cease-fire now\" at a deafening volume, James Colbow, a 69-year-old Navy veteran from Ohio, said he drove to the capital to show solidarity with embattled Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“I felt disappointment in my government that they’ve been complicit in these war crimes,” Colbow said.\n\nColbow said a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side-by-side, would be key to peace in the Middle East. \"I believe in the Jewish people’s right to self-determination but also for the Palestinians,” he said.\n\nWho planned the Gaza protest?\n\nThe D.C. demonstration was organized by the ANSWER Coalition, an umbrella group of anti-war and racial justice organizations, which advocates for ending the Israeli siege of Gaza and for the cessation of U.S. aid to Israel.\n\n\"Today is going to be the largest demonstration ever in the history of the United States in support of Palestinian social and civil rights, and for peace,\" Brian Becker, the coalition's executive director said in an interview before the event.\n\n\"We're sending a message to the Biden administration that we profoundly disagree with its position, which has opposed a ceasefire and has instead embraced Israel's genocidal-type assault against civilians in Gaza,\" Becker said. \"We're expecting, minimally, tens of thousands. I wouldn't be surprised if there are 100,000.\"\n\nNetanyahu rejects calls for a 'humanitarian pause'\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu deflected pleas by Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken for a \"humanitarian pause\" in the fighting that would allow food and medical supplies into Gaza.\n\n“I have made clear that we are continuing forcefully, and that Israel refuses a temporary cease-fire that does not include the release of our hostages,” Netanyahu said following a meeting with Blinken in Tel Aviv. “Israel does not allow the entry of fuel to the Gaza Strip and opposes the transfer of funds to Gaza.”\n\nHamas, the militant Islamist movement that controls Gaza, abducted an estimated 240 people from Israel during its stunning attack last month.\n\nBlinken stresses 'imperative of doing everything possible to protect civilians'\n\nThe U.N., citing figures from the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry, said Friday that 9,257 people had been killed in the coastal enclave by Israeli airstrikes since Oct. 7 including 3,826 children. Fewer than one-third of Gaza's hospitals are operating and the territory has seven days of food stocks remaining, the U.N. said.\n\n“We stand strongly with and behind Israel in its right and obligation to defend itself, defend its people and take the steps necessary to try to ensure that this never happens again,” Blinken told reporters on Friday, while also emphasizing “the imperative of doing everything possible to protect civilians, the imperative of doing everything possible to get assistance to those who need it.”\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/09/israel-hamas-war-live-updates/71116248007/", "title": "Israel Hamas live updates: At least 11 Americans dead; 'siege' of Gaza", "text": "The Israeli military's effort to hunt down militants intensified Monday, and Israel's prime minister promised to \"defeat them forcefully\" as the death toll on both sides from the three-day war rose to about 1,600, including at least 11 Americans.\n\nTuesday's live updates:Israel regains control of Gaza border; Iran warns of 'heavier slap'\n\nNew Tuesday: Is Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks? What it would mean for US and Middle East security\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a “complete siege” on Gaza, pledging to cut electricity and cut off food and fuel into the impoverished home to more than 2 million Palestinians. The Israeli military, which called up 300,000 reservists, pounded Gaza with an aerial assault aimed at halting Hamas rockets toward Israel's border towns. In response, Hamas threatened to kill hostages if attacks targeted civilians without warning.\n\nIn a short evening address to the nation in Hebrew, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the retaliatory strikes in Gaza were merely a starting point.\n\n“What will be done to our enemies in the coming days will resonate with them for generations,'' he said, according to a CNN translation. \"At the end of the campaign, all our enemies will know it was a terrible mistake to attack Israel.’’\n\nNetanyahu also visited towns bordering Gaza, where thousands of Israelis were evacuated, and pledged the government's help to local leaders.\n\nPalestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, in a social media post Monday, said there were \"massacres taking place and entire families wiped out\" in Gaza, and more than 100,000 have been displaced. He again blamed Israel for the war, claiming years of \"occupation and aggression.\"\n\nEmerging reports indicate Iran, a longtime Hamas backer, was behind the attacks, but a White House adviser said the administration has no \"direct information'' about such involvement.\n\nMore than 123K displaced in Gaza: US sending warships, ammunition to Israel\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Israeli Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the military has taken full control of communities bordering Gaza and that only sporadic fighting was ongoing.\n\n∎ The death toll includes about 900 in Israel and more than 680 in Gaza, home to 2.3 million Palestinians. Hamas claimed four hostages it kidnapped were killed by Israeli airstrikes, which the Health Ministry in Gaza said have injured more than 3,700. Israel has reported more than 2,500 injured.\n\n∎ Rescue workers found 100 bodies in the farming village of Beeri – about 10% of its population – after a long hostage standoff with gunmen east of the Gaza Strip.\n\n∎ The White House said President Joe Biden is having his team coordinate with Israel \"on all aspects of the crisis and to continue their work with regional partners to warn anyone who might seek to take advantage in this situation.''\n\n∎ The Biden administration said the White House will be illuminated in the blue and white of the Israeli flag Monday night \"as a symbol of the United States’ 75-year relationship'' with Israel and the American support in the wake of the attacks.\n\n11 Americans killed in Israel, others may be hostages\n\nThe known U.S. death toll has been rising. Biden said in a statement Monday afternoon that the total is up to 11. \"It’s heart-wrenching,'' he said. \"These families have been torn apart by inexcusable hatred and violence.''\n\nThe president also said some U.S. citizens remain unaccounted for, and \"it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held by Hamas,'' adding his administration is working with Israeli officials to free the hostages.\n\nIt's not clear how many Americans may have been kidnapped. Hamas and other militants claim to have more than 130 hostages, and Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas’ armed wing, said a captive Israeli civilian will be killed any time Israel targets civilians in their Gaza homes “without prior warning.”\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was asked if the administration would involve U.S. troops in a war between Israel and Hamas, especially if Iran or the militant group Hezbollah were found responsible for the attacks.\n\n\"There's no intention to put U.S. boots on the ground,'' Kirby said, adding that the president would do whatever is necessary to protect the nation's security.\n\nFBI searching for Americans impacted by attack\n\nThe FBI announced late Monday that it had personnel on the ground in Israel to investigate, locate, and identify Americans impacted by the conflict.\n\nThere is no specific or credible threat to the United States related to the Hamas attack on Israel, the agency said in the statement. The FBI said it is closely monitoring the conflict overseas and will communicate information to local enforcement.\n\n\"Reports of deceased, injured, or missing Americans are being treated with the utmost urgency and aggressively investigated,\" the FBI said in a statement on X. \"The FBI's Victim Services Division is coordinating with the Department of State to assist, necessary, with family engagement.\"\n\nWhite House lacks 'direct information' of Iran involvement\n\nDeputy National Security Adviser Jonathan Finer said Monday that the Biden administration is investigating reports that Iran played a role in the deadly attacks and abductions by Hamas but that it lacks “direct information” linking Tehran to the assault.\n\nFiner was asked on ABC’s Good Morning America about Iran’s potential role and about a Wall Street Journal report regarding Iran's participation in a meeting last week where the decision to attack was made.\n\n“So taking a step back, I think what we can be quite clear about is that Iran is broadly complicit in these attacks, for having supported Hamas going back decades, for having provided financial support, for having provided training, for having provided weapons to Hamas,” Finer said. “What we don't have is direct information that shows Iranian involvement in ordering or planning the attacks that took place over the last couple of days.\n\n“It's something that we're going to keep looking at closely, and by the way, this is what the Israeli government has said as well,” Finer said. “What I can tell you is we have no direct information to confirm that report. We've obviously seen it. We're looking into it, but we do not have the ability to corroborate it at this time.”\n\n− Josh Meyer\n\nMaps and graphics show how Hamas militants' deadly raid unfolded – and how fighting will get worse\n\nIsrael requests weapons from US\n\nIn his speech, Netanyahu thanked the Biden administration for its support, and privately his government has asked the Pentagon for a number of weapons, including missile interceptors for its Iron Dome system and artillery rounds. The White House has already responded by saying that the first installment of weapons is on the way.\n\nIsrael is also requesting precision-guided arms, which typically use satellite or lasers to direct explosives to the target to minimize harm to civilians and infrastructure. The weapons include missiles, multiple-launched rockets and bombs that can be fired form aircraft, ships or on through artillery or rocket launchers.\n\nThe anticipated request from the White House for supplemental funding faces uncertainty in Congress, where the House lacks a permanent speaker after Republican Kevin McCarthy was deposed last week.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUS and European allies back Israel, condemn Hamas\n\nThe U.S. and four of its European allies − the U.K., Germany, France and Italy − issued a statement supporting Israel and denouncing Hamas' \"appalling acts of terrorism.''\n\n\"In recent days, the world has watched in horror as Hamas terrorists massacred families in their homes, slaughtered over 200 young people enjoying a music festival, and kidnapped elderly women, children, and entire families, who are now being held as hostages,'' the statement said.\n\nIt went on to acknowledge the Palestinians' aspirations and the equal right for them and Israelis to pursue freedom and justice, adding, \"Make no mistake: Hamas does not represent those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed.''\n\nThe statement, which also pledged help for Israel in defending itself, did not qualify as coming from the G7 nations because it lacked the signatures of Japan and Canada, though both countries have condemned the attacks.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the White House lit up in blue and white in \"enduring support and solidarity\" with Israel.\n\nIsrael says it is not conducting hostage negotiations\n\nHamas has said militants are holding about 130 hostages but said an update on the number would be released soon. Hamas has demanded that all Palestinians held in Israeli prisons be released. Hossam Badran, a Hamas official, told Agence France-Presse the militants won't negotiate a prisoner exchange while the \"military operation is still continuing.\"\n\nIsrael said it was not involved in negotiations aimed at securing the release of any hostages. The Egyptian news website Al-Ahram, citing \"informed sources,\" said Egyptian authorities were trying to arrange a deal to secure the release of Palestinian women and children prisoners held in Israeli custody in exchange for Hamas releasing Israeli \"civilian women\" who were taken captive since the violence began Saturday.\n\n“The Egyptian government is presently awaiting responses from both parties regarding the proposed prisoners exchange and a temporary cease-fire,” Al-Ahram said.\n\nGaza takes a beating from Israeli retaliation, 187,000 displaced\n\nThe Gaza Ministry of Public Works and Housing estimated hundreds of housing units have been destroyed and more than 1,200 severely damaged. The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, said 137,000 people are being sheltered in over 70 U.N. schools in Gaza after fleeing homes \"mostly due to fear, protection concerns and the destruction.\" UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai said the agency can house 150,000 people, adding that fuel in Gaza could last for up to 10 days.\n\nUN officials said more than 187,000 people in Gaza have been displaced, and that number is expected to increase. It’s estimated that about 3,000 Palestinians are displaced in the region from previous conflicts.\n\nThe United Nations humanitarian affairs office said Israeli strikes have targeted houses and apartment buildings in Gaza, sometimes without warning for residents to evacuate.\n\nFour large residential towers with multiple floors in Gaza city were destroyed. Israeli forces reportedly provided prior warnings in these cases, the agency said, and there were no fatalities reported. Damage to infrastructure from Israeli airstrikes has undermined the provision of water, sanitation and other services to more than 400,000 people, the agency said.\n\nSince the conflict began, four schools and eight healthcare facilities in Gaza have been damaged, according to the UN report. More than 900 Israelis were killed and at least 2,616 were injured in the conflict, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs cited local media in its latest report.\n\nThe UN, citing the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said at least 687 Palestinians were killed and about 3,800 injured.\n\nAt least 50 civilians and military personnel have been taken captive, according to the Ministry of Health in Israel. Palestinian sources reported capturing more than 150 people, according to the UN.\n\nUS airlines suspend flights; State Department issues travel warning\n\nU.S. airlines have suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv amid the ongoing conflict. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have also issued travel waivers allowing passengers scheduled to fly to and from Israel to rebook. United’s waiver also covers flights to and from Amman, Jordan.\n\nThe State Department issued travel advisories for the region, urging increased caution for American citizens headed to Israel and the West Bank, and suggesting not to travel to Gaza.\n\n“Terrorist groups, lone-wolf terrorists and other violent extremists continue plotting possible attacks in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza,\" an advisory says. \"Terrorists and violent extremists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.\" Read more here.\n\n− Zach Wichter\n\nScottish leader has family trapped in Gaza\n\nScotland's head of state, First Minister Humza Yousaf, said his parents in-law are trapped in Gaza. Yousaf, whose wife, Nadia El-Nakla, is Palestinian, told Scottish media they have been unable find safe passage after visiting his father-in-law's 92-year-old mother. He said his in-laws, who live in Scotland, \"have nothing to do – as most Gazans don’t – with Hamas or with any terror attack.\" Yousaf also condemned the attack, The Scotsman reported.\n\n“It’s horrific to see innocent lives lost, whether those innocent lives are Israeli or the innocent lives of Palestinians being lost,\" Yousaf told reporters. \"It is heartbreaking to see.\"\n\nNewest US aircraft carrier sent to scene\n\nThe Pentagon has sent its newest aircraft carrier steaming toward the troubled waters of the Middle East in a show of force that is meant to reassure Israel and other U.S. allies and to deter adversaries such as Iran from seeking to take advantage of the conflict, according to two U.S. government sources who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe U.S.S.

The group’s charter calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel. The militant organization is committed to the destruction of Israel and has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the EU and various nations. The political wing of Hamas has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2007.\n\nThe Israeli military estimated 1,000 Hamas fighters crashed across the Israeli border Saturday, igniting a rampage that included shooting hundreds of civilians and kidnapping people who were transported back to Gaza. Hamas, the largest Palestinian militant group, also has fired rockets from Gaza that have riddled Israeli cities.\n\nTimeline of conflict: Why the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian fighting is among the most brutal in years\n\nClash dates to ancient times\n\nThe dispute is rooted in pre-biblical times. Though its borders have shifted over the years, Palestinian territories used to be what is now Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Both Israeli Jews’ and Palestinian Arabs’ history, culture and identity are linked to the Palestinian territories. Jewish migration from eastern and central Europe surged from 1922 to 1947 as Jews fled persecution and the destruction of their communities, most notably during World War II. As the number of Jewish immigrants increased, many Palestinians were displaced. They began pushing back and violence resulted.\n\nIn 1948, the Jewish People's Council met in Tel Aviv and established the State of Israel. The U.S. officially recognized the new nation later that day; the USSR acknowledges it three days later. Read more here.\n\n− George Petras, Janet Loehrke and Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nSen. Cory Booker was jogging in Israel when war began\n\nSen. Cory Booker was jogging Saturday in Jerusalem when the attacks began. As Hamas militants moved into Israel and thousands of rockets were launched, the New Jersey Democrat was advised by his chief of staff to get back to his hotel, Booker said in a video Saturday evening on X, formerly Twitter. He took cover in a hotel bomb shelter with others, including \"many Americans.\"\n\n\"Frightened faces, there were children and elderly, families, many Americans,\" Booker said in the video. \"There was a sense of fear and worry and a knowledge to many of us that there were horrific things going on around the country at that time.\" Read more here.\n\n− Candy Woodall\n\n'The same evil': Zelenskyy compares Hamas to Russia\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy compared Hamas to Russian leaders, calling their terrorism \"the same evil.\" Zelenskyy, addressing the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, said the only difference was Israel's attacker is a terrorist organization while Ukraine was attacked by a \"terrorist state.\"\n\n\"The intentions declared are different, but the essence is the same,\" he said. \"You see the same blood on the streets. You see the same civilian cars shot up. You see the same bodies of people who have been tortured.\"\n\nZelenskyy also took aim at Iran, saying it can't deny responsibility for bloodshed in Ukraine when it sells armed drones to Russia. And Iran can’t deny responsibility in Israel when its officials support the attacks.\n\nIsrael, Palestinian backers rally in US: 'This is a moment to not be alone'\n\nIsraelis, Palestinians protest across USA\n\nIsrael and Palestinian supporters gathered in cities across the U.S. on Sunday as the world watched in shock and horror at the conflict that has killed hundreds and wounded thousands in the Middle East.\n\nA skirmish broke out between opposing demonstrators near the United Nations compound in New York City after a large group of Palestinian supporters rallied in Times Square. Meanwhile, Palestinian Americans protested outside the Israeli consulates in Atlanta and Chicago. The incursion left many Jewish communities and organizations in disbelief − drawing widespread condemnation − as it coincided with Simchat Torah celebrations, a major Jewish holiday.

Others held signs calling for university President Minouche Shafik to resign. Faculty members said access was heavily restricted, as campus was closed for a second day in the period before finals, open only to students living on campus and essential workers.\n\nThe NYPD announced almost 300 arrests had taken place Tuesday at Columbia and City College − hours before Los Angeles police in riot gear swept onto UCLA's campus to break up a violent melee between dueling protesters as opposition to Israel's war in Gaza continued to roll through universities across the nation.\n\nDozens of the New York arrests involved demonstrators removed from an administration building at Columbia, where officers also took down encampments that had been the epicenter of the protests nationwide.\n\n\"Students and outside activists breaking Hamilton Hall doors, mistreating our Public Safety officers and maintenance staff, and damaging property are acts of destruction, not political speech,\" Shafik said in a statement Wednesday. She added that many students felt unwelcome on campus because of the disruption and antisemitic comments made by some protesters.\n\nAt City College, affiliated with City University of New York, officials requested NYPD assistance after the college said students and \"un-affiliated external individuals\" refused to leave. The school issued a statement saying students have a right to demonstrate peacefully but that police were called in because of \"specific and repeated acts of violence and vandalism, not in response to peaceful protest.\"\n\nAbout 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed and more than 200 taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The Israeli retaliatory assault has killed nearly 35,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and obliterated much of the enclave's infrastructure. The humanitarian crisis has fueled outrage on some U.S. campuses and spurred demands for an end to investment in Israeli companies and amnesty for student protesters.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ New Hampshire State Police said personnel were at the University of New Hampshire and Dartmouth College on Wednesday night \"in response to illegal activity and at the request of local law enforcement.\" At the University of New Hampshire, police arrested 10 to 20 pro-Palestinian protesters who started setting up an encampment after a rally. Officers at Dartmouth College cleared out the final tents at the campus encampment shortly before 11:40 p.m., its student newspaper reported.\n\n∎ Several hundred protesters gathered Wednesday for a peaceful demonstration on Ohio State University. School officials had locked up some buildings in anticipation of the demonstration. Unlike last week's protest, which led to almost 40 arrests, the crowd began dispersing around 9 p.m. and the demonstration ended before 10 p.m.\n\n∎ Columbia Provost Angela Olinto said all academic activities at the school's main campus for the rest of the semester, including final exams, will be held remotely, with some minor exceptions.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he supports the strong law enforcement response unleashed on protesters at the University of Georgia and Emory University in Atlanta. “Send a message,'' he said. \"We are not going to allow Georgia to become the next Columbia University.”\n\n∎ Protesters and police clashed at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when officers broke up an encampment there Wednesday. Video from the scene showed some protesters being pinned to the ground.\n\n∎ Tulane University said at least 14 protesters were arrested from the \"illegal encampment\" the school said was dominated by protesters \"unaffiliated with our community.\"\n\nPolice order dispersal of large pro-Palestinian gathering at UCLA\n\nPolice ordered a large group of Pro-Palestinian demonstrators to leave or face arrest late Wednesday, a night after violence erupted at the encampment by counter-protestors.\n\nVideo posted on social media showed counterdemonstrators battering a makeshift barricade around pro-Palestinian protesters at the Los Angeles campus. The Los Angeles Police Department said it responded to UCLA's request to restore order \"due to multiple acts of violence within the large encampment\" on the campus.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported police did not intervene for more than an hour after arriving as counterdemonstrators wearing black outfits and white masks − some armed with metal pipes and sticks − repeatedly tried to breach the perimeter of the encampment while campers pushed back and several fights broke out.\n\nLos Angeles police said in a statement Wednesday that officers made no arrests and did not use force in its response to the UCLA campus Tuesday night. The department also noted that no officers were injured.\n\nUCLA canceled Wednesday classes and Chancellor Gene Block, who blamed the violence on a \"group of instigators'' who attacked the encampment, said the student conduct process has been initiated and could lead to disciplinary action including suspension or expulsion.\n\nThe Times also reported University of California President Michael Drake told the Board of Regents that 15 people were injured in the overnight fracas, and he's ordering an independent review of the events, including how UCLA handled them.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned the violence, saying in a statement, \"The right to free speech does not extend to inciting violence, vandalism, or lawlessness on campus. Those who engage in illegal behavior must be held accountable for their actions − including through criminal prosecution, suspension, or expulsion.''\n\nThe Jewish Federation Los Angeles issued a statement saying it was \"appalled\" at the violence, which did not \"represent the Jewish community or our values.\" But the statement also said the UCLA administration was at fault for allowing an environment that made students feel unsafe.\n\nUCLA students barricade themselves in courtyard in tense protest\n\nHundreds of students at UCLA barricaded themselves in a courtyard between two campus buildings Wednesday, using sheets of plywood, planks, ropes, and tents to block the doors leading from the buildings into the outside area.\n\nThe mood was anxious. Sporadic announcements over a loudspeaker informed students they were part of an illegal settlement and would face consequences if they remained. In response, the crowd chanted: “We’re not leaving, we’re not leaving.”\n\n“I’m terrified, obviously, I think everybody is,” said 21-year-old student Aidan Doyle. “But we’re going to stay as long as we possibly can, until we’re being physically removed.”\n\nThousands of students were spread out in the areas directly outside the main protest. Organizers shouted over loud speakers that they didn’t need any more supplies as piles of protective equipment, pizza and Gatorade grew at the main entrance to the camp.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the camp was attacked by a group of violent counter-protesters, who fired chemical agents and fireworks into the protestors and assaulted dozens of people.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nColumbia faculty members protest decision to bring in police\n\nSome of faculty and graduate student workers rallying outside Columbia's gates wore orange safety vests that said “faculty,” which they donned days earlier to help protect students in the encampment.\n\n“There is not a single university left in Gaza, and I bet a lot of you feel there is not a university here in Morningside Heights,” Joseph Hawley, an associate professor of classics, told gatherers, referring to the neighborhood around the school. “But I’m here to tell you the university is here on this sidewalk.”\n\nBarricades still lined city streets outside Columbia’s campus as police officers stood watch. Shafik has asked the New York Police Department to remain on campus until May 17, two days after graduation.\n\nMana Kia, an associate professor, read a draft statement from the Columbia chapter of the American Association of University Professors saying members \"unequivocally condemn President Shafik, the Columbia board of trustees and other senior administrators involved in the decision to call in the NYPD and clear the encampment of student protesters.\" The statement said the association has \"no confidence in the administration.\"\n\nOrganizer says 'ordinary people,' not agitators behind protests\n\nLess than three hours before a huge deployment of New York City police officers broke up an encampment and retook a building at Columbia on Tuesday night, Mayor Eric Adams made a forceful case that the pro-Palestinian protest at the school had been hijacked by \"outside agitators'' bent on sowing chaos.\n\nThose involved in pushing for the movement off-campus disagree, saying it belongs to regular folks trying to raise awareness to the Palestinians' plight.\n\nManolo De Los Santos, an organizer with The People’s Forum, said those joining the protests alongside students are just “ordinary New Yorkers.”“The power of this moment is that it’s everyone coming together,” he said. “It’s health care workers, it’s teachers, it’s city workers. It’s ordinary people who feel so strongly.”\n\n‘Never felt this much tension on campus,' UNH student says\n\nPolice arrested pro-Palestinian protesters who started setting up an encampment in front of the University of New Hampshire's Thompson Hall Wednesday night.\n\nUNH Police Chief Paul Dean estimated between 10 to 20 protesters were arrested after a rally led to demonstrators attempting to set up an encampment at the state’s flagship university, drawing local and New Hampshire State Police. Some demonstrators shouted at officers, calling them \"cowards\" and chanting \"free Palestine.\"\n\nThe peaceful rally lasted until around 6:30 p.m. Then, Dean said protesters rushed in to form an encampment and attempted to barricade their tents. Leftover tents and items on Thompson Hall's lawn were removed by police around 9 p.m., loaded onto a truck as dozens of students watched.\n\nShane Tilton, a sophomore who lives in a nearby residence hall, said he walked over to observe after hearing the commotion. He watched from beneath the Thompson Hall arches as the encampment was removed from the most well-known gathering spot on campus.\n\n“I’ve never felt this much tension on campus,” Tilton said. “I feel like there’s a lot of tension. From my perspective, it seems like the cops don’t have much to do here. They seemed like they were here to jump at this opportunity and see some action.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire condemned police’s actions Wednesday night in Durham and at a similar protest at Dartmouth College in Hanover.\n\n“Freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate are foundational principles of democracy and core constitutional rights,\" said Devon Chaffee, executive director of the state ACLU. \"We urge university and government leaders to create environments that safeguard constitutionally protected speech.\"\n\n– Ian Lenahan and Deb Cram, Portsmouth Herald\n\n'Intifada' chants by some protesters are 'horribly upsetting'\n\nDozens of protesters gathered Wednesday in and around Fordham University’s Leon Lowenstein Center in Manhattan and established an encampment. The group is demanding the university divest from all companies “complicit in the Israeli occupation and ongoing siege,” according to a statement from the Fordham for Palestine Coalition.\n\nAs the demonstration grew throughout the afternoon, it also attracted a handful of onlookers and opponents who occasionally shouted pro-Israel remarks as they passed. Asa Kittay and Carly Connors said they were in class down the street when they heard demonstrators chanting “Intifada,” an Arabic word for uprising or rebellion. Kittay, who held up a tablet with an image of the Israeli flag, said it was “horribly upsetting.”“I believe that these two states can co-exist peacefully,” Connors said. “I do not believe in an intifada. That is not very anti-genocide.” John Lefkowitz, who attended the protest with friends who go to Fordham, said he believes the demonstrations are sometimes incorrectly characterized as antisemitic by people who are uninformed about the position of anti-Zionism.“It’s often told that Jews should feel unsafe in pro-Palestine circles. As a Jew, I’ve never felt unsafe in a pro-Palestinian circle,” he said. “These people are great, they’re not anti-semites.”\n\nBack to the future: Columbia a focal point again in protest history\n\nThe descent of police on Hamilton Hall at Columbia University outfitted in full riot gear and enforcing mass arrests Tuesday night fell on the same date and place police cracked down on antiwar protesters in 1968. Some fear the clash heralds a similar outcome at the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where political leaders are emboldened to sic the cops on demonstrators ever more intent on showing up.“I don’t think it’ll keep anyone from Chicago, it might even inspire more people to come,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, a spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC and the national chair of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network.Democrats already feared a repeat of the chaos from 56 years ago where police and demonstrators clashed, drawing all eyes away from the convention.At the crackdown at Columbia April 30, 1968, police arrested over 700 people and over 100 injuries were reported, according to a Columbia University Libraries publication. Police arrested almost 300 people Tuesday between Columbia and City College, according to the city’s top cop.\n\n– Michael Loria\n\nArraignments from first arrests at New York universities begin\n\nLate Wednesday night, the first arrests from the protests at Columbia University and the City College of New York began to be arraigned at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, the same building where former President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is underway.\n\nOutside the court’s arraignment part, dozens of the protesters’ supporters gathered in the halls, many of them wearing keffiyehs. The mood was jubilant, and many were chatting or conferring with each other in small groups.\n\nWhen one protester exited the courtroom after his arraignment, he was quickly swarmed by friends and dropped to the floor in a brief moment of celebration.\n\nThat protester, who was at the City College demonstrations, had been charged with assaulting a police officer, a felony, and resisting arrest. However, the prosecutor handling his case recommended to the judge that he be released from jail, given that police “continue to investigate” the incident.\n\n– Asher Stockler, The Journal News\n\nNYU encampment stays in place after others in city were torn down\n\nThe day after other city schools saw violent clashes with police, the encampment at NYU's lower Manhattan campus stood untouched. Punctuated by faded chalk reading \"End Jewish and Palestinian hate,\" the collection of tents and chairs took up about one city block near 181 Mercer Street, where the university's Paulson Center is located.\n\nFenced-off and guarded by a smattering of campus security, the encampment was bracing for hot weather with some protesters carrying umbrellas to block out the sun and one arriving with large bags of ice. Demonstrators needed to present a school ID to enter the encampment. The barricades held signs reading, \"Fund our education, not the occupation\" and listing the protesters' demands, which include divestment and closing NYU's Tel Aviv campus.\n\nThe shadow of Tuesday's mass arrests and the forced removal of encampments on the other end of the island at Columbia and City College of New York was evident. Just outside the barricades, a group of demonstrators huddled to practice safety tactics.\n\n− Anna Kaufman\n\nNew York students continue protests day after mass arrests\n\nHundreds of demonstrators at Columbia University and City College of New York gathered Wednesday evening a day after administrators from both universities called police in riot gear on the protesters.\n\n“Our encampment is what it could look like to be liberated,” Hadeeqa Arzoo, a City College student, said, as several cars honked in support while she led chants of “Free Palestine.” “So I will continue to cultivate these spaces of liberation within the belly of the beast. That is resistance.”\n\nEven if both schools no longer had encampments, demonstrators promised to continue their activism in support of Palestinians and in opposition to schools’ investments in Israel.\n\n“There is not a single student-led uprising in history met with severe state-sanctioned violence that did not end up being right,” Maryam Alwan, a Columbia student organizer, said. She likened their cause — and police's response — to the civil rights movement and Black Lives Matter protests, including allegations of outside agitators and property damage.\n\nAs the sun fell outside City College’s campus in West Harlem, several dozen police officers surrounded the protesters standing inside barricades. The rally, which included two Islamic prayers, would continue into the night before students returned to Columbia, some walking down the valley and back up the hill to the other campus.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nUT-Dallas confirms 17 arrests hours after encampment set up\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas confirmed law enforcement officers arrested over a dozen people hours after pro-Palestinian student demonstrators constructed an encampment Wednesday.\n\nUT-Dallas spokesperson Brittany Magelssen told USA TODAY that 17 people were arrested on criminal trespassing charges as of 5 p.m. local time Wednesday after university officials gave written notice to remove the tents. Magelssen said UT-Dallas requested outside law enforcement officers to assist.\n\n“Individuals may peacefully assemble in the common outdoor areas of campus to exercise their right to free speech, but they may not construct an encampment or block pathways. In the last six months, there have been several peaceful protests on the UT Dallas campus,” Magelssen said. \"The UT Dallas Police Department and area law enforcement partners are continuing to monitor the situation.\"\n\nThe UT-Dallas chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine said in a social media post students began setting up the \"Gaza Liberation Plaza\" encampment at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n“We reject our university’s complicity in profiting off the genocide. We will continue to escalate and put pressure on our university until UTD/UTIMCO divest from war profiteers and Palestine is free,” the student organization said early Wednesday.\n\nHigh school students joining the protest movement\n\nThe proliferation of antiwar protests in college campuses across the U.S. is filtering down to the younger academic levels, and some of the grown-ups are not happy about it.\n\nA sit-in planned for Wednesday at a Chicago prep school is the latest among high school demonstrations showing support for embattled Palestinians in Gaza. On Monday, about 100 high school students in Austin, Texas, walked out of their classes in protest. Last week, students in western Washington state similarly expressed their objection to the U.S. backing Israel's military efforts in Gaza.\n\n\"I'm protesting against a government that is actively hurting people just because of where they were born and what language they speak,\" Pia Ibsen, a senior at McCallum High School in Austin, told USA TODAY. Ibsen helped organize a walkout and left class for about an hour and a half.\n\nSome school and government officials have tried to stop the protests, arguing they create a hostile environment for Jewish students. That was the case last week when two county commissioners in New Jersey demanded a school district's superintendent cancel a pro-Palestinian walkout at East Regional High in Voorhees Township. The protest was replaced by a rally for human rights.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Kayla Jimenez\n\nUAW members hope presence at protest will 'move the needle'\n\nIn addition to the campus protests, hundreds of people bearing pro-Palestinian signs and t-shirts gathered at New York City’s Foley Square on Wednesday afternoon for a march and rally led by labor organizers on International Worker’s Day.\n\nParticipants included Brian Sullivan, 45, a member of the United Auto Workers whose local chapter represents social workers. Sullivan said seeing labor organizers come out in such large numbers could help “really move the needle.”\n\n“UAW endorsed Joe Biden and hopefully he feels some exposure here, that if he doesn’t do what’s right and what the UAW members are asking for, he risks that endorsement,” Sullivan said.\n\nJeremy Montano, another UAW member who works in the legal field, said the recent “explosion of interest” in the conflict in Gaza, particularly on college campuses, has also given him some hope. “Obviously it’s balanced out with a lot of despair about what’s actually happening in Gaza,” said Montano, 37. “But there’s been a little bit of a source of hope that maybe longer term things might change.”\n\nAlmost 300 protesters arrested in NYC; student group says some were injured\n\nNew York City police made 119 arrests at Columbia University and 173 at City College in Tuesday night's crackdowns on protesters, Commissioner Edward Caban said Wednesday. Charges range from trespassing to criminal mischief to burglary, and the breakdown of students to non-students facing charges was not yet available, he said.\n\nPolice said there were no injuries, although CUNY for Palestine issued a statement saying one student suffered a broken ankle, two had teeth broken and others received burns from pepper spray used by police during the clash.\n\nMayor Eric Adams said drones and encryption radios used at Columbia provided police with the element of surprise when they retook Hamilton Hall, adding that \"professionals at radicalizing\" had influenced the student protesters and co-opted the protest but without providing details.\n\nOfficers climbed into Hamilton Hall, which protesters had occupied earlier Tuesday, through a second-story window. Within three hours Tuesday night, they had retaken the building, NYPD said.\n\n\"It was about external actors hijacking a peaceful protest and influencing students to escalate,\" Adams said. \"We cannot allow what should be a lawful protest turn into a violent spectacle that serves no purpose.\"\n\nFordham, another NYC university, establishes encampment\n\nOutside Fordham University’s Leon Lowenstein Center building on Wednesday, another encampment sprung up. Students, faculty and community members surrounded by law enforcement officers and newly erected barricades chanted “Free, free Palestine” and “Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.” Inside, demonstrators including current and former students milled around their tents, played drums, banged on windows and held up signs reading “Free Palestine” and “Divest genocide funds” for passersby to see.\n\nJulie Norris, a 27-year-old Fordham alumni, said she arrived before 8 a.m. Wednesday to help establish the encampment. Norris, who spoke to USA TODAY on the phone from inside the Lowenstein Center, estimated about 30 people were inside with her and said they plan to stay until their demands are met.\n\n“The students can’t be stopped,” she said. “We saw intense repression against students on other campuses yesterday, and this morning students are ready to stand back up. There’s going to be no business as usual until Palestine is free.”\n\nNorthwestern, Brown reach deal: Make pact with student demonstrators to curb protests\n\nSome campus protesters cut deals, claim victory\n\nSome student activists who pitched tents and camped on university lawns to protest Israel's military attacks in Gaza have begun to declare victory after hammering out agreements with school administrators. Northwestern University just outside Chicago became the first U.S. school to publicly announce a deal on Monday. On Tuesday, Brown University protesters broke camp after President Christina Paxson said the Rhode Island school will bring divestment demands to a vote. Organizers hope the deals set a new precedent for protest encampments around the U.S. and show a way to find common ground without using force.\n\n“What these students have done is truly, truly historical,” Summer Pappachen, a graduate student and organizer of the Northwestern encampment, told USA TODAY on Tuesday amid cleanup of the lawn students held for days. “We have been able to achieve (our goals) while keeping students safe.”\n\n− Michael Loria\n\nColumbia building cleared: Police storm into building held by pro-Palestinian protesters\n\nWhat are college protests across the US about?\n\nThe student protesters opposed to Israel's military attacks in Gaza say they want their schools to stop funneling endowment money to Israeli companies and other businesses, like weapons manufacturers, that profit from the war in Gaza. In addition to divestment, protesters are calling for a cease-fire, and student governments at some colleges have also passed resolutions in recent weeks calling for an end to academic partnerships with Israel. The protesters also want the U.S. to stop supplying funding and weapons to the war effort.\n\nMore recently, amnesty for students and professors involved in the protests has become an issue. Protesters want protections amid threats of disciplinary action and termination for those participating in demonstrations that violate campus policy or local laws.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/21/donald-trump-inauguration-the-excerpt/77848464007/", "title": "Trump to begin second term as Inauguration Day arrives | The Excerpt", "text": "", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/21"}]}

Family members were able to fly to Iowa to visit her in those days.\n\nGrant became Iowa's first women's athletic director in 1973, the year after federal Title IX legislation was passed requiring gender equity in college sports. Grant had testified before Congress several times advocating for the law, which was opposed by the NCAA.\n\nGrant served in the Iowa athletic department until her retirement in 2000, but remained active in the local sports scene. She also continued to teach in Iowa's department of health and sports studies until 2006.\n\nIowa merged its men's and women's athletic departments after Grant retired.\n\nUnder Grant's leadership, Iowa sponsored 12 women's sports that won one NCAA field hockey championship and 27 Big Ten Conference championships. She is a member of the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame.\n\n“I owe Dr. Grant so much. She hired me to coach at this university that I love so dearly. More importantly, she gave the opportunity to thousands upon thousands of girls to enjoy and benefit from participating in athletics,\" Iowa women's basketball coach Lisa Bluder said in a university release. \"Without Dr. Grant’s commitment and efforts to gender equality, girls and women would not be able to experience the benefit of sport the way we know it today. Dr. Grant taught me to think in a different way. I can hear her words of wisdom bouncing around in my mind now and forever. I love Dr. Grant.\n\n\"She has told me to call her Christine numerous times, but out of respect, she will always be Dr. Grant to me — the woman who helped change the landscape of women’s athletics.”\n\nIn an interview with the Des Moines Register on Friday night, former Iowa athletic director Bob Bowlsby recalled Grant's contributions at Iowa and nationally. He said she delivered him the greatest professional compliment of his life. He'll never forget how she came down the hallway and told him that she was retiring and she was recommending Bowlsby be in charge of both the men's and women's departments.\n\n\"More than anything else, Christine had an amazing sense of fairness. It was that sense of fairness that wanted the best for young women athletes,\" Bowlsby said. \"But she also wanted the best for young men athletes. And she was special in that way.\"\n\nGrant was born May 27, 1936, in Scotland, where her love of sport bloomed at age 11 when she took up netball, a game akin to basketball. Soon, field hockey became her sport of choice, and the stadium where the Hawkeyes play is named Grant Field in her honor.\n\nGrant was instrumental in bringing field hockey to Iowa. It was fitting that the Hawkeyes were ranked No. 1 nationally for much of the fall season in the final year of her life. As Grant's health faded at the Bird House, a hospice-care center, she made sure to watch live streams of every Hawkeye field hockey game.\n\nDuring the season, Iowa field hockey coach Lisa Cellucci brought players to visit Grant.\n\n\"She wanted to hear from them and tell them how proud she was,\" Cellucci told the Register on Friday night. \"She was so excited that Iowa field hockey was No. 1.\"\n\nWhen Grant had to go to the hospital for health reasons, she made sure she wore an Iowa field hockey shirt during the ambulance ride. She supported the Hawkeyes until the very end.\n\n\"Of course, our goal was to win a national championship,\" Cellucci said. \"But she was the first person to leave me a voice mail after we lost in the Elite Eight.\"\n\nGrant earned a degree in physical education in Scotland. She then embarked on a career in teaching and coaching, leaving Scotland for Canada in 1961. There, she was instrumental in forming a national organization for field hockey and became the coach of Canada's national team.\n\nA decade later, Grant arrived in Iowa to earn bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in physical education and athletics administration.\n\nAt the same time, Grant threw her considerable energy into a new group forming to advocate for equal sports opportunities, which was called the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. She became its president.\n\nIn 1973, Iowa president Sandy Boyd was looking to become a national leader in athletic opportunities for women, making the university one of only two in the nation to have a separate department for women's sports. The first choice to lead the department, Grant told the Register in 2013, was Nell Jackson, a former Hawkeye track star. Jackson turned it down.\n\nGrant did not, eagerly taking on a new challenge at a salary of $14,000. That cemented her to Iowa City for the remaining 48 years of her life. Her influence was so great that a new elementary school built in North Liberty in 2019 was named in her honor.\n\n\"I never, ever dreamed I'd settle down in Iowa City, because I had every intention of going back to Canada — which I love,\" Grant said in 2013, her thick Scottish accent still present. \"But, things happen.\"\n\nGrant made them happen. Among the coaches she hired was Vivian Stringer, who chose Iowa — and Grant — over places like Texas, Penn State and USC after reaching the women's basketball Final Four at tiny Cheyney State. It was a meeting with Grant at the Philadelphia airport that convinced her, Stringer said.\n\n\"She's a giant among giants,\" Stringer said in 2013, 20 years after she led Iowa to the Final Four. \"I really can't think of any woman who's done more for women (in sports) in this entire country than Dr. Grant. Not one. Not one.\"\n\nGrant and Stringer combined to make sports history in 1985, when they drew 22,157 fans to watch the Hawkeyes take on Ohio State at Carver-Hawkeye Arena. It became the largest crowd to watch a women's basketball game at that time.\n\n\"When our team came out on the floor, Vivian (Stringer) was almost in tears,\" Grant said later. \"That's when I thought, 'Good lord, can you imagine that we've done this.' It was a very, very moving moment.\"\n\nThe fire marshal was less thrilled. Grant got a letter of reprimand for exceeding the arena's capacity by 6,657 people.\n\nGrant framed the letter and hung it in her office.\n\nAt Iowa, Grant worked alongside men's athletic director Bump Elliott, who died in December 2019 — two towering figures in Hawkeye sports history gone two years apart.\n\nGrant won the Billie Jean King award in 1995 for her lifetime contribution to women's athletics.\n\n\"The ripple effect of her life’s work will be felt with every generation from today forward,\" Iowa women's tennis coach Sasha Schmid said in the school's release. \"She is a true giant, and a Hawkeye hero. What an incredible life. Rest in peace, dear Dr. Grant.”\n\nBut she never felt like her work was done, and was saddened to see opportunities erode for women coaches and athletic administrators, even at her alma mater.\n\nGrant told the Register in 2017, after Iowa lost a gender-bias lawsuit brought by former athletic administrator Jane Meyer: \"It’s been honestly heartbreaking to sit and watch this over the decades and to know that nobody’s doing anything about it. That’s the saddest part about it. I mean, where are our athletic directors? Where are our presidents? We cannot continue as a nation to continue discarding the dreams and the talents of half of our population. It’s a topic I’m very passionate about. And I think this is going to be a landmark case, I really believe that.\"\n\nGrant attended that trial in Des Moines. She said she believed the leaders at Iowa would use it as an occasion to make things more equitable for women athletes, coaches and administrators.\n\nOn one of Cellucci's final hospice visits, in November, Grant — even in fading health — was adamant that there was much more work to do to create equal opportunities for women.\n\n“She said to keep fighting,\" Cellucci said. \"I said, 'I will.'\"\n\nKirk Statler was the chaplain at Iowa City Hospice who met with Grant weekly in her final months. Grant sought the spiritual guidance, Statler said in an interview Saturday.\n\n\"You couldn't tell she was sick. She was high-energy, conversant,\" Statler said of his initial meeting with Grant nine months ago.\n\n\"She was always direct, and I loved her accent. I loved to hear her talk. On our first meeting, she got right to the point. She said, 'Talk to me about faith. Why is it important?'\"\n\nStatler, who has been a pastor for 37 years, showed Grant a ball-point pen he had made out of wood and asked her: \"If I gave this to you, when would it become yours?\"\n\nGrant replied: \"When I take it.\"\n\n\"That's absolutely right,\" Statler told Grant. \"It's like the love of God. It really becomes ours when we receive it.\"\n\nStatler said Grant spoke about the pen in every subsequent conversation.\n\nHe last saw Grant on Dec. 27. She was too weak to speak on that occasion, Statler recalled.\n\n\"I just talked to her like normal. I sang a song to her. I knew she liked John Denver, so I sang 'Country Roads' for her, just a capella beside her bed,\" Statler said.\n\nHe also read Psalm 139 and 103 to Grant. They were among her favorites and provided comfort to her, Statler said.\n\nGrant spoke often in their early meetings about becoming \"tougher\" and of outlasting her illness, Statler said, remembering how she would grit her teeth to combat the pain she was feeling. By December, he said, she had begun to accept that her disease was terminal.\n\n\"I never got fear from her, or worry,\" Statler said. \"There was definitely a peace about her, that she came to that last week and a half.\n\n\"She was a consummate lady who just really carried herself with an air of dignity and a healthy sense of pride.

Profiles will continue each day through March, which is National Women's History Month.\n\nThe lives and work of these women span more than two centuries and represent a wide range of achievements and occupations.\n\nSome of them are well known, such as Abigail Scott Duniway, who fought for women's suffrage and published a weekly newspaper in Portland.\n\nOthers are more obscure, such as Fern Hobbs, the personal secretary to Gov. Oswald West who was sent to decree martial law in the rowdy mining town of Copperfield.\n\nTheir contributions have been diverse and historic:\n\nThe first female doctor in the West: Bethenia Owens-Adair.\n\nThe first U.S. congresswoman from Oregon: Nan Wood Honeyman.\n\nThe first female steamboat captain West of the Mississippi: Minnie Hill.\n\nThe first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics: Thelma Payne.\n\nThe first female police officer in the United States: Lola Greene Baldwin.\n\nMany of these women overcame obstacles to make a difference and secure their place in Oregon herstory. They helped make this state what it is today.\n\nTabitha Moffat Brown\n\nBorn: May 1, 1780, in Brimfield, Mass.\n\nDied: May 4, 1858, in Salem. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery.\n\nFacts: Brown was a social reformer and educator who traveled the Oregon Trail and assisted in the founding of Tualatin Academy, which became Pacific University in Forest Grove. She turned to teaching to support four children after her husband, a minister, died. She was 66 when she crossed the plains in 1846 with her son and suffered much hardship. At one point on the journey, she was left alone on the trail in the bitter cold with her ailing 77-year-old brother-in-law. She pulled them through, despite being near starvation. Once in Oregon, she traveled between Oregon City and her daughter's home in Salem, and eventually settled in Forest Grove. Her first job was sewing gloves to sell. She later helped start a home and school for orphan children and became affectionately known as \"Grandma Brown.\" The log church she used for the school was officially established as Tualatin Academy in 1848, and the following year became what is now Pacific University.\n\nNotable: Honored in 1987 by the Oregon Legislature as the \"Mother of Oregon.\"\n\nQuotable: \"I rode through (the Umpqua Mountains) in three days at the risk of my life, on horseback, having lost my wagon and all that I had but the horse I was on.\"\n\nSOURCES: Pacific University, Salem Online History, RootsWeb.com, The Brown Family History II\n\nAbigail Scott Duniway\n\nBorn: Oct. 22, 1834, near Groveland, Ill.\n\nDied: Oct. 11, 1915. She is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: Duniway was a novelist, newspaper publisher, teacher, pioneer, milliner and suffragist. She came to Oregon in 1852 and wrote a novel based on the overland experience. Her mother and brother died during the grueling trek. Her family settled near Lafayette, where she began a career as a schoolteacher. She married Benjamin Duniway, and they had four children spaced less than two years apart. She endured the loss of their Yamhill County farm because of her husband's faulty business decisions. Later, he became an invalid. In order to support the family, she returned to teaching as well as running a hat shop in Albany. Her experiences convinced her that women needed the right to vote. She campaigned for suffrage throughout the Northwest, and in 1871, started a newspaper in Portland called The New Northwest. She masterminded the suffrage campaigns in Idaho and Washington, but her efforts to win the right to vote in her home state proved more demanding. From 1884 to 1910, Oregon's male voters defeated suffrage five times at the polls. Finally, in 1912, the initiative passed. She was the first woman to register to vote in Multnomah County.\n\nNotable: Duniway was the first woman to speak before the Oregon Legislature and the state's first woman publisher.\n\nQuotable: \"The young women of today, free to study, to speak, to write, to choose their occupation, should remember that every inch of this freedom was bought for them at a great price. It is for them to show their gratitude by helping onward the reforms of their own times, by spreading the light of freedom and of truth still wider.

She is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Warrenton.\n\nFacts: A physician, teacher, feminist and social reformer, she was the first woman west of the Mississippi to hold a medical degree. Her family crossed the Oregon Trail in 1843, and she did not begin her formal education until she was 12. She was married at 14 to one of her father's farm hands but divorced her abusive husband by 16. She turned to millinery to earn her living and raise her son, George, who also became a doctor. Her business was successful, but after six years she decided to pursue a career in medicine. She attended an eclectic school in Philadelphia and then University of Michigan Medical School, finishing her degree in 1880, at age 40. She returned to Portland the following year and became the first woman to practice in Oregon. She married Col. John Adair in 1884, and the couple moved to Astoria, where she continued to practice medicine and help with the family farm.\n\nNotable: She thought insanity and criminal action were hereditary and argued for mandatory sterilization of the criminally insane. Her famous work on the subject, \"Human Sterilization: Its Social and Legislative Aspects,\" was published in 1922. Three years later, the sterilization statute was adopted as state law in Oregon.\n\nQuotable: She was not afraid to drive great distances alone in her carriage to reach a patient. \"At no time did I ever refuse a call, day or night, rain or shine.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Findagrave.com, Dameron-Damron family newsletter\n\nLola Greene Baldwin\n\nBorn: 1860\n\nDied: June 22, 1957. Buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: On April 1, 1908, she was sworn in as the first female police officer in the United States. Her primary mission was to protect young women from prostitution. She began this type of work in 1905 as an employee of Portland's branch of the Traveler's Aid organization during the Lewis and Clark Exposition. The goal of the organization was to encourage women who flocked to the city to avoid the pitfalls of prostitution. Her unit with the Portland Police Bureau, the Women's Protection Division, made a priority of protecting women from the effects of vice, rather than punishing them for it. She reportedly maintained an office away from the police department and declined to work in uniform. She also was involved in organizing a juvenile court in Portland. On May 1, 1922, she resigned her commission after influencing local, regional and national women's policing activities for 17 years, 14 of them as a paid municipal officer.\n\nNotable: To learn about Baldwin, read \"A Municipal Mother,\" by Gloria E. Myers. A Portland-based foundation that helps women who are recovering from prostitution is named in her honor.\n\nQuotable: Baldwin's goal was \"to make the path safe for the feet of the girl who desired to lead a clean, honest, useful life.\"\n\nSources: Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation, \"A Municipal Mother\"\n\nMercedes Deiz\n\nBorn: 1917\n\nDied: Oct. 5, 2005, in Portland\n\nFacts: She became the first black female lawyer in Oregon when she was admitted to the bar in 1960. She attended Northwestern School of Law at night while married and raising three children and working as a legal assistant. She finished fourth in her class and years later credited her husband with taking a large part in raising their children. \"I am not a dependent woman,\" she said. \"But I could not have done the things I did without Carl.\" In November 1969, then-Gov. Tom McCall appointed her as a district court judge, making her the first woman of color to become a judge in Oregon. The following May, in the primary, Multnomah County voters elected her to the post outright and she became the first black woman to be elected to the bench in Oregon. Oregon Women Lawyers give an annual award in her name to someone who makes an outstanding contribution to promoting women and minorities in the legal profession and in the community.\n\nNotable: In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of her admission to the bar, she was recognized with the Award of Merit, the Oregon State Bar's highest honor.\n\nQuotable: \"Black has nothing to do with the color of the skin; it's a question of ethnicity. You are your race. A person has roots to whatever he or she comes from in one's ancestry.

Buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Duerksen was one of the founders of Deaconess Hospital, a predecessor of Salem Hospital. A group of Mennonites came to Salem in 1916 and opened a 12-bed hospital in an old hotel on Winter Street. Sister Anna, a graduate of Evangelical Deaconess Hospital School of Nursing in St. Louis, Mo., was one of four Mennonite sisters on the Board of Trustees. The sisters worked 20-hour days and received no salary until Social Security was launched in 1935. To them, it was a calling, not a job. Duerksen served as the hospital's only anesthetist. She lived in the basement and not only cared for patients, but cooked and did housekeeping. She married the hospital's gardener and worked at the hospital into the 1950s. In 1947, the Mennonites turned the hospital over to a board of Salem citizens, and the name was changed to Salem Memorial Hospital. It merged in 1969 with Salem General Hospital to create the hospital that exists today.\n\nNotable: In 1957, Duerksen was recognized by the Oregon Nurses Association with a life membership for her long leadership in providing health care.\n\nQuotable: Her legacy is well-documented in the annals of Salem Hospital. Ted Stang, a longtime local hospital administrator, met Duerksen after he came to Salem in 1968. She was in her 80s. He also heard many stories from the grandson of Deaconess Hospital's first administrator. \"She was diminutive, quiet, unassuming,\" Stang said. \"But boy, was she a powerhouse. People listened to what Sister Anna had to say, even though she was not the administrator. Sister Anna carried a lot of weight at that institution.\"\n\nSources: Salem History Online, Oregon Statesman, Salem Hospital\n\nSarah Winnemucca\n\nBorn: About 1844\n\nDied: Oct. 17, 1891\n\nFacts: Historians have referred to Winnemucca as the most famous Native American woman on the Pacific Coast. She used her language skills to try to be a peacemaker and was the first Native American woman to publish in English. Her book, \"Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims,\" is an autobiographical account of her people and their contact with explorers and settlers. She was born and raised in Nevada but spent much of her life in southeastern Oregon as an interpreter for an agent at Malheur Reservation and as a scout and mediator for the Army during the Bannock War. She learned to read and write when her grandfather placed her in the home of a white family in Nevada. By the time she was 14, she could speak three Indian dialects, English and Spanish. She married at least twice, to an Army lieutenant and then an Indian Department employee. After the Bannock War, she received national attention by campaigning for Native American education programs and reservation reform — making more than 400 speeches. She even pleaded her cause to President Rutherford B. Hayes in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly received promises that were later broken. Winnemucca also opened and ran the first school in the West where Native American children could remain with their families and were not forced to stop speaking their native language.\n\nNotable: On March 9, 2005, a bronze statue of her representing Nevada was unveiled in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. A town in Nevada carries her family name.\n\nQuotable: \"I would place all the Indians of Nevada on ships in our harbor, take them to New York and land them there as immigrants, that they might be received with open arms ...\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Wikipedia, \"Native Peoples\"\n\nChloe Clarke Willson\n\nBorn: April 16, 1818, in Connecticut.\n\nDied: July 2, 1874. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Willson was the first teacher at the Oregon Institute, which was founded by Methodist missionaries and later became Willamette University. She devoted her life to bringing religion and education to Oregon, and particularly to educating the young women of Salem. She traveled with about 50 new missionary recruits to the Oregon Territory in 1839. The following year, at a new mission outpost in the Puget Sound, she met her husband, William H. Willson. In 1844, the couple was asked to move to the settlement called Chemeketa Plains, which would become Salem. Chloe had been chosen to open the Oregon Institute.\n\nShe was both teacher and housemother for five primary-grade students and remained the only teacher the first two years. The board of the institute chartered \"Wallamet University\" in 1853 and began offering higher education. Chloe left Salem for a time after her husband died, but she returned in 1863 to serve as Governess of the Ladies Department at Willamette University, the equivalent of Dean of Women.\n\nNotable: Her husband is remembered as the founder of Salem because he filed the first plat of the city and held the original title to the land that now comprises Willamette University, the state Capitol and downtown Salem. Their name lives on today in Willson Park, directly west of the Capitol.\n\nQuotable: \"I feel the weight of responsibility which rests upon me in giving character to this infant institution,\" she wrote on Aug. 13, 1844, the first day of classes at the Oregon Institute. \"O my Father ... thou seest the desire of my heart for the prosperity of this institution, but without thy blessing it can never prosper.\"\n\nSources: Salem Online History, \"Journals of Brewer and Clarke\"\n\nHallie Parrish Hinges\n\nBorn: Jan. 30, 1868.\n\nDied: Jan. 25, 1950. She is buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Hinges was a vocal performer in Oregon for nearly 60 years, most famous for her performance during President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Salem on May 21, 1903. Roosevelt called her the \"Oregon Nightingale\" when he heard her sing, and the nickname stuck. She studied music at Willamette University, graduating from the Willamette Conservatory when she was 18. She also studied in New York for a year. Music always was a big part of her life. She performed at her first public concert when she was 6, in the basement of First Methodist Church. Her audiences later expanded to political dignitaries. In 1891, she sang for President Benjamin Harrison, and in 1900, she performed for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. But her biggest moment came when Roosevelt visited Salem. Thousands gathered at Willson Park to see the president. Before he spoke, the 35-year-old soprano sang the national anthem. Roosevelt told Gov. George Chamberlain that Hinges had one of the most beautiful voices he had ever heard and asked if she would sing again. Hinges responded with a favorite of the time, \"The Flag Without a Stain,\" and witnesses claimed that the president wiped tears from his eyes.\n\nQuotable: \"Truly, she is the Oregon Nightingale,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nNotable: Hinges' grandfather was Methodist missionary Josiah L. Parrish, whom Parrish Middle School is named after.\n\nSource: The Statesman Journal, Salem Online History, \"Marion County History,\" Volume XV\n\nThelma Payne Sanborn\n\nBorn: July 18, 1896, in Silverton\n\nDied: Sept. 7, 1988, in Los Angeles\n\nFacts: She was the first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics and the first to win a medal. She won the bronze in the 3-meter springboard diving competition at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. swept the medals in that event, with Payne missing silver by seven-tenths of a point. She was the U.S. women's springboard champion in 1918, 1919 and 1920, and trained at Multnomah Athletic Club in Portland. She reportedly incorporated ballet into her training regimen. After competing in the Olympics, she was a longtime swimming and diving coach at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. She taught the children of several famous people to swim, including John Wayne and Bing Crosby. Payne was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of fame in 1983, among one of the early classes that included Bobby Doerr, Mel Renfro and Steve Prefontaine.\n\nNotable: Sanborn said in a 1987 interview that she was one of the models for the red-suited diving girl introduced by Jantzen in 1920 and later plastered on billboards.\n\nQuotable: \"In those days, we had nothing to go by. We had to actually see someone perform a dive and then try to do it ourselves. It was the only way.\"\n\nSources: Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, The Associated Press, Oregon Sports Hall of Fame\n\nCornelia Marvin Pierce\n\nBorn: Dec. 26, 1873, in Monticello, Iowa\n\nDied: Feb. 12, 1957\n\nFacts: Marvin was the leader of the Oregon State Library for 24 years, almost singlehandedly building one of the finest state library systems in the nation. She came to Oregon in 1905 for the position of secretary of the Oregon Library Commission, which later became the State Library. She instituted many innovative programs, including the first books-by-mail service in the country. In a day when many Oregonians lived isolated lives without telephones, newspapers and other regular sources of information, her innovation was a lifeline for thousands of rural Oregonians, particularly women. She resigned as State Librarian in 1928 to marry Gov. Walter M. Pierce. He was elected in 1932 to Congress, and she became his secretary, researcher and speech writer. Their political partnership was one he readily recognized, often reminding his constituents that they had two representatives for the price of one.\n\nQuotable: \"The only thing I have ever done to make the world a better place to live is to promote libraries.\"\n\nNotable: At the end of her life, she bequeathed most of her estate to Reed College, a private Portland liberal-arts school. The $300,000 gift still supports a Cornelia Marvin Pierce chairmanship in American history at Reed.\n\nSources: \"Cornelia Marvin Pierce: Pioneer in Library Extension,\" \"Library Trends,\" Oregon State Library\n\nMaurine Brown Neuberger\n\nBorn: Jan. 9, 1907, in Cloverdale, Tillamook County.\n\nDied: Feb. 22, 2000, in Portland.\n\nFacts: She remains the first and only woman from Oregon to serve in the U.S. Senate. She and her husband, Richard, were known as a political team. They gained notice in 1951 as the first married couple in the nation to serve together in a legislature — he in the Oregon Senate and she in the House. He won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1954, and she served as his aide. When he died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1960, she won a special election to fill the vacancy and then the general election to serve the next term. She focused on environmental and health issues, including sponsorship of one of the first bills to require warning labels on cigarette packaging. Back home, she took on Oregon's then-powerful dairy industry about a law forbidding the sale of yellow margarine. She donned a striped apron, pulled out a mixing bowl and showed her colleagues in the House — all men — just how much work it took to mix food coloring into the lard-white butter substitute. The ban was lifted, and her demonstration became part of the state's political lore.\n\nQuotable: \"Before she puts her name on the ballot, she encounters prejudice and people saying, 'A women's place is in the home.' She has to walk a very tight wire in conducting her campaign. She can't be too pussyfooting or mousy. Also, she can't go to the other extreme — belligerent, coarse, nasty.\"\n\nNotable: After serving in the U.S. Senate, she taught at Boston University and Radcliffe and was part of the social and academic circle surrounding the Kennedy family.\n\nSources: Oregon History Project, Harvard Square Library\n\nMercedes Bates\n\nBorn: 1916\n\nDied: Aug. 16, 1997, in Minneapolis\n\nFacts: Bates is one of the most important women to graduate from Oregon State University. She is credited with helping make Betty Crocker a household name. She was a vice president of the General Mills food company, in charge of the Betty Crocker division. The fictional character was created in 1921 and evolved into an American cultural icon under Bates' direction. After graduating from Oregon State in 1936 with a degree in food and nutrition, Bates began working at the Southern California Gas Co. and became supervisor of home service. She then moved to the Globe Mills food company before opening her own business in Hollywood as an advertising food consultant. She later joined the staff of McCall's magazine as food editor before moving to General Mills in 1964 as director of the Betty Crocker kitchens. Two years later, she rose through the ranks to become vice president and the first female corporate officer of General Mills. She held that title until retiring in 1983.\n\nNotable: She donated $3 million to Oregon State in the early 1990s, helping establish a nationally renowned Bates Family Study Center on campus. At that time, it was the largest one-time donation ever made to OSU. The facility opened in 1992 and was the first of its kind in the United States. It houses programs of research, instruction and outreach designed to benefit individuals and families.\n\nSources: Oregon State University, OSU Alumni Association\n\nNan Wood Honeyman\n\nBorn: July 15, 1881.\n\nDied: Dec. 10, 1970.

She married David Honeyman in 1908, raised three children and was active in civic and humanitarian organizations before becoming involved in politics. She served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933, which ratified the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, repealing prohibition. She was a state representative from 1935 to 1937 before being elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Congress. Her bids for re-election in 1938 and election in 1940 failed. While working in the Pacific Coast office of the U.S. Price Administration, the Multnomah County commissioners appointed Honeyman to the Oregon Senate in 1941 to fill a vacancy, and she served until her resignation in 1942. She was U.S. collector of customs in Portland from 1942 to 1953.\n\nNotable: After graduating in 1898 from St. Helens Hall (later incorporated in the Oregon Episcopal School), she continued her education at the Finch School in New York City, where she began a lifelong friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nCarolyn Shelton\n\nBorn: Around 1877.\n\nDied: Unknown.\n\nFacts: Shelton was governor for a day in 1909, according to the Capital Journal. The newspaper ran a banner headline proclaiming her head of state Feb. 27, 1909, following the resignation of Gov. George E. Chamberlain and the delay in swearing in Secretary of State Frank W. Benson, the next in line. Chamberlain resigned his seat after being elected to the U.S. Senate. In a hurry to get to Washington, D.C., he left his resignation with his private secretary, Shelton, about 9 a.m. that Saturday. The papers weren't to be filed until 4 p.m. Monday, and Benson couldn't be sworn in right away, so there effectively was no governor except Shelton. The Capital Journal pronounced her \"the first woman to govern any state.\" The newspaper reported Sunday that Benson assumed control at 10:10 a.m. Nowhere in state records is Shelton mentioned as governor. Barbara Roberts officially would become the first female governor of Oregon when she was elected and served from 1991 to 1995.\n\nQuotable: \"I want to fill the governor's shoes, and he really has a small foot,\" Shelton was quoted as saying in the Capital Journal. \"I fear the principal trouble will be in trying to fill his hat.\"\n\nNotable: \"Time\" magazine reported July 26, 1926, that Chamberlain, 72, married Carolyn B. Shelton, 49, in Norfolk, Va. Shelton was clerk to the Senate Military Affairs Committee when Chamberlain was chairman during World War I. Chamberlain's first wife had died the previous year.\n\nSource: The Capital Journal\n\nMary Purvine\n\nBorn: Feb. 26, 1881.\n\nDied: June 10, 1965. She is buried at City View Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: She graduated from medical school at Willamette University in 1903 and was one of the first female doctors in Oregon. She left Salem after graduating at age 22, and launched her practice in the small Eastern Oregon town of Condon, where her brother and future governor of Oregon, Jay Bowerman, practiced law. Purvine returned to Salem after four years and began a medical practice specializing in obstetrics. She and her husband, Ellis, had three children. Her son, Ralph, followed in her footsteps and became a doctor. Mary Purvine was a member of the staffs at Salem General and Salem Memorial hospitals. She maintained a practice in Salem for more than half a century, working for many years out of her home on University Street SE. She practiced medicine until she was well into her 70s.\n\nNotable: Her book, \"Pioneer Doctor,\" was published in 1958.\n\nQuotable: \"Woman doctors were few in the early days of my practice.

The Native American woman, who married a white settler named Frank Riddle, was rewarded a government pension of $25 per month for helping save lives during the Modoc War of 1872-73. She and her husband acted as interpreters, messengers and mediators between her people and the U.S. Army. She is perhaps best known for having warned Gen. Edward Canby about the Modoc plot to kill him during peace negotiations. The general ignored the advice and was killed April 11, 1873. On the same day, Winema was credited for saving the life of Alfred Meacham, a Methodist minister and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon. Meacham was wounded and about to be scalped when Winema yelled that the soldiers were coming, sending the Modoc warriors running. Meacham was the one who pressed Congress to give her a pension, which she received until she died.\n\nNotable: The Winema National Forest in Southern Oregon was established in 1961 and named after her.\n\nSources: Trover Studio collection, courtesy of the Oregon State Library\n\nElizabeth Lord and Edith Schryver\n\nElizabeth Lord\n\nBorn: Nov. 12, 1887, in Salem.\n\nDied: Oct. 9, 1976.

She is buried in her family plot in Kingston, N.Y.\n\nFacts: Lord and Schryver became the first female professionals to open a landscape-architecture firm in the Northwest in 1929. They designed more than 250 gardens from Eugene to Seattle. Schryver was considered the design genius and Lord the plant expert and businesswoman with connections. Lord grew up in Salem and was the daughter of a former Oregon governor, William Lord. Schryver grew up in New York and attended the Lowthrope School of Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts, where Lord also studied. A few years after Schryver graduated, she set sail for a garden tour of Europe, where she met Lord. The friends traveled and studied together for several months and then Lord brought Schryver to Salem. Two of their most notable imprints on Salem are the gardens at Historic Deepwood Estate and Bush's Pasture Park.\n\nQuotable: \"We were free-swinging career girls, and nobody ever questioned us,\" Schryver told the Statesman Journal in 1980.\n\nNotable: The Lord & Schryver Conservancy works to preserve and interpret the legacy of the two women.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Lord & Schryver Conservancy\n\nMinnie Hill\n\nBorn: 1863 in Albany.\n\nDied: January 1946 in San Francisco.\n\nFacts: Hill was the first female steamboat captain west of the Mississippi. On Dec. 1, 1886, at age 23, she was granted a master's and pilot's license. She had been working with her husband, Charles O. Hill, on various boats for several years and became \"thoroughly conversant with the steamboat business,\" according to \"Lewis & Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest.\" When Charles and Minnie bought the 112-foot Governor Newell in 1889, Charles went down into the engine room while Minnie took the pilothouse wheel. They specialized in moving scows laden with jetty stone from a quarry east of Vancouver, Wash., downstream to meet a U.S. Army Engineer tow boat, which took the loads to Astoria. The stone was used to build the south jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Minnie was a captain for 14 years. At least two movie producers supposedly tried to get her to consent to filming her life story, but she refused.\n\nNotable: She reportedly was the only woman on the Pacific Coast licensed to command a steamer until 1907, when a second-class master's and pilot's license was granted to a woman in the Puget Sound area.\n\nQuotable: Her son, Herbert W.

She was editor of The Advocate, an African-American newspaper published in Portland between 1903 and 1936, regularly challenging racial discrimination and becoming the unofficial spokeswoman for the city's small black community. She helped found the Portland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, known as the NAACP, and craft the state's first civil-rights legislation, which would have mandated full access to public accommodations without regard to race. Although that piece of legislation failed, in 1925 she worked on the successful campaign to repeal Oregon's notorious exclusion laws, which prohibited African Americans from settling in the state.\n\nQuotable: \"Not even the pulpit has been as effective for the advancement of our group, and for justice, as the press.\"\n\nNotable: She ran for state representative in May 1932 but was not elected.

A former school teacher, radio commentator and lobbyist, she became an important figure in Oregon politics when she was elected to Congress in 1955. She served 10 terms and focused on women's issues, education and social reforms. In her first term, she proposed the Equal Pay Act to ensure that men and women were paid equally for equal work. The bill was signed into law eight years later. She is most noted for her work developing the legislation that was to become Title IX, which prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. She introduced a higher-education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on that bill, together with significant input from Rep. Patsy Mink and Sen. Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of Title IX in 1972.\n\nQuotable: Sen.

Among the 6,000 or so students who sat in her classes were current teachers and politicians, including retired U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield. She was a strong role model for a generation of up-and-coming women including Norma Paulus, who praised Eyre's work for equal rights for women, open government meetings and the preservation of historic buildings. Eyre came to Salem in 1904, when she was 6. She graduated from Willamette University in 1918 and began her teaching career in Salem in 1922. She taught history and government, economics and sociology, retiring in 1962. In addition to her contributions as an educator, she was involved in local government. She was a precinct committee member and president of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for the state Senate in 1962.\n\nQuotable: She said she ran for the legislative office because she \"wanted to try out some of the things I had been teaching over the years.\"\n\nNotable: The Salem-Keizer School District named an elementary school in her honor in 1977.

Oswald West in January 1914 to declare martial law in Copperfield, perhaps Oregon's most notorious \"bad\" town. Copperfield was established in 1908 to house the mining and railroad crews working at Snake River. It had three saloons, including one owned by the mayor and another by a city councilman, and a population of 84 when Hobbs was dispatched. West had vowed personally to clean up the vice-ridden town but was warned that he would be shot if he tried, so he sent his private secretary. Described as a diminutive woman — 5-foot-3 and less than 100 pounds — Hobbs arrived with a small National Guard contingent and read the governor's orders to close the saloons and resign from city council. The orders were refused, Hobbs left town that afternoon and the National Guard placed the town under martial law. More troops eventually arrived and confiscated liquor and gambling devices. The town, about 75 miles northeast of Baker City, later was destroyed by fire and today is known as Oxbow.\n\nSources: Oregon State Archives, The Oregon Journal, The Oregon Statesman\n\nMarie Dorion\n\nBorn: Unknown\n\nDied: Sept. 5, 1850.

The courageous Native American accompanied her husband and two small children on the journey. Like her predecessor on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacagawea, Dorion earned respect from the men. She never complained about the hardships along the journey and kept pace despite caring for two children and giving birth to a third. The epitome of Dorion's courage was noted after the expedition had reached what would later be named Astoria. She and her family returned with a trapping party to the Snake River, where Indians attacked and killed all but her and her two sons. They escaped by hiding in the brush. In the wake of the tragedy, including the death of her husband, she and the boys survived more than 50 days in the bitter cold of the Blue Mountains.\n\nQuotable: Roger Howard, who lives near the church in Gervais, on the legend of Marie Dorion: \"She should be as famous as Sacagawea.\"\n\nSource: Statesman Journal\n\nBetty Roberts\n\nBorn: Feb. 5, 1923.\n\nNow: June 25, 2011.\n\nFacts: Roberts was the first woman appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals (1977) and the first woman appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court (1982). She was married and raising four children in the 1950s, when she signed up for college courses and graduated from Portland State University in 1958. She taught high school and by 1962 had a master's degree in political science from the University of Oregon. She then enrolled in the night program at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College, continued to teach and was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. She graduated from law school in 1966, the same year one daughter graduated from Stanford University and a son from high school. She married a lawyer and legislative colleague two years later, and they established a successful legal practice. She then became the lone woman in the Oregon Senate and in 1974, ran a strong statewide campaign for governor but was narrowly defeated in the primary. The Democratic Party named her to fill a vacancy on the ballot for the general election against U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, and again she was narrowly defeated. The Oregon Women's Political Caucus named her the 1975 \"Woman of the Year\" for setting a precedent for other women to run for statewide office.\n\nNotable: She helped found Women's Investment Network-PAC to recruit and support women to run for the Legislature and Oregon Women Lawyers to promote women and minorities in the profession.

She was active in her neighborhood association and the local transit district board before running for office. She defeated two sitting city councilors (one man and one woman) in the primary and then went on to serve three terms. Being the first female mayor didn't seem like a big deal at the time, perhaps because Norma Paulus had laid the groundwork for women to become political leaders in Salem. Paulus served in the Oregon Legislature before becoming the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. \"If Norma hadn't been so successful,\" Miller said, \"it would have been a lot harder. She had kind of tilled that ground for others to follow, and I've always thanked her for that.\" As mayor, Miller was most noted for her work in helping the city purchase 22 acres of waterfront property on the Willamette River, which today is Riverfront Park.\n\nQuotable: \"It was an amazing privilege to be mayor of Salem.

A native Oregonian, she was among the first women to enlist in the military in 1942, in what was called the Women's Army Corps (WAC). She started as an Army truck driver but soon became an officer. She spent most of World War II training thousands of WACs. She left active duty after the war and went to Lewis & Clark College in her hometown of Portland. She then returned to active duty and joined the Air Force. She was the war plans officer at one of the major bases in Europe during the Berlin Airlift and began her rise through the ranks. She was Director of Women in the Air Force from 1965 to 1973. She was promoted to brigadier general in 1971, the first woman to be appointed to that grade in the Air Force. Two years later, she became the first woman in any branch of service to reach the rank of major general, or two-star general. She retired in 1975 after a 33-year career in the Air Force and went on to serve as Special Assistant on women's issues for President Gerald Ford. She also held positions during the Carter and Reagan administrations and is recognized as a driving force behind women achieving opportunities and equal rights in the military.\n\nNotable: Holm authored three books.\n\nQuotable: \"There was an enormous desire to be part of the war effort.

She sponsored environmental legislation, civil rights and ethical changes. She was the Republican candidate for governor in 1986, but lost in a closely-contested race to Neil Goldschmidt. Four years later, Paulus was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction and led a comprehensive restructuring of the state's public school system. She spearheaded work to set rigorous academic standards for all students and to increase accountability with state testing standards. In 1996, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley named her to the National Assessment Governing Board. A New York Times profile described Paulus' work in Oregon as the most cutting-edge school reform in the country.\n\nQuotable: \"I know I have made government more accountable.

She was part of the first successful women's ascent of Ama Dablam in 1983. From the summit, she could see the rising crest of Everest and set her sights on the world's tallest mountain. Her first attempt was unsuccessful because of a snowstorm that left the climbing party trapped in a snow cave for five days. But the following year, in 1988, she was triumphant. On Sept. 29, at the age of 29, after 29 days on the mountain, she made history by becoming the first American woman to stand on top of the 29,035-foot mountain.

Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, 10 Florida House members including Republican Neal Dunn of Panama City deserted the effort and turned their thumbs down.\n\nPrevious coverage:\n\nLawson said he was extremely disappointed by House Republicans' last minute obstruction, especially after the Rubio measure passed unanimously in the Senate.\n\n\"To witness, on the House floor, Republican vote changes (against) the bill during the final seconds of roll call was abhorrent,\" Lawson said. Rubio was not immediately available for comment Thursday.\n\nAxios reported that Georgia Republican Congressman Andrew Clyde rallied opposition to the Hatchett designation because of a 1999 opinion Hatchett authored that prohibited prayer at public school graduations.\n\n“I let (that) be known,” Clyde said, according to Axios.\n\nLawson lashed out at Clyde for working against the bill: \"Clyde is also one of the three members who opposed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act,\" which now makes lynching a federal hate crime.\n\nThe vote split Tallahassee, with Dunn representing the city's northeast voting with the GOP against Lawson, who was the House sponsor of the naming. Dunn did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWithout GOP support, the bill fell 45 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to designate the building in Hatchett’s honor.\n\nAll but one of the 220 House Democrats who voted on the bill supported it. Just 19 of 205 Republicans, including six Floridians, voted yes.\n\nLed by Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a half dozen Florida Republicans voted to designate the courthouse three blocks north of the state Capitol in honor of Hatchett, a Daytona Beach native.\n\nHatchett died last April. He was 88.\n\nIn 1976, he became the first Black since reconstruction to win a contested statewide race in Florida, defending his seat on the Florida Supreme Court – where he had been the first Black man to sit as a judge.\n\nThree years later, President Jimmy Carter named him as the first African American to serve on a federal appeals court in the South. Hatchett retired from the bench in 1999 and returned to private practice in Tallahassee.\n\n“Judge Hatchett was a true social justice pioneer and public servant ... (he) was dedicated to his home state of Florida, where he served in many positions in the military and the federal and local justice systems.

Neal Dunn, R-Panama City, whose district includes Tallahassee, objected because of a Hatchett ruling on school prayer.\n\nTallahassee’s other Congressman, Democrat Al Lawson, got the proposal back on track Wednesday, when he reintroduced and debated the measure on the House floor.\n\nDunn flipped his vote to a yes and the measure by Florida GOP Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott cleared the House on a 230-191 tally, with nine other Republicans joining Democrats to honor Hatchett.\n\nThe bill now goes back to the Senate, where it's expected to pass.\n\nHatchett was the first Black Florida Supreme Court Justice and first African American to serve as a federal appeals court judge with jurisdiction over states of the former Confederacy.\n\nLawson calls Hatchett, who died April 2021, a social justice champion and a dedicated public servant.\n\nBlocked honor\n\n“Despite experiencing racial discrimination, that never deterred his desire to serve in the justice system,” said Lawson in a prepared statement. “He had a long career of prestigious judgeships, military service, and civil rights advocacy that broke barriers for the Black community.”\n\nDunn said his previous no vote was on a procedural move to consider the Senate bill in place of one co-sponsored by the Florida delegation. Passage, however, required a two-thirds majority.\n\nWhen Dunn and nine other Floridians voted no, Lawson felt betrayed.\n\nHe called the “last minute” change in votes “abhorrent.”\n\nWith a fast-track approach blocked, Lawson moved the proposal along a process where it would require a House majority vote and reconsideration by the Senate.\n\nThen a campaign began.\n\nA letter helped Rep. Dunn changed his mind about naming the courthouse\n\nHouse Republicans had balked at honoring Hatchett after Congressman Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., by highlighting a 1999 opinion by Hatchett that prohibited prayer at public school graduations.\n\nHatchett supporters argued he followed U.S. Supreme Court precedent and that one opinion endorsed by other judges should not block the courthouse designation.\n\n“Your decision was unconscionable, appalling, and wrong... (and) put politics over principle and lies over truth,” wrote the Rev. R.B. Holmes to Congressman Dunn about his no vote.\n\nHolmes is a Tallahassee pastor and civic leader. He leads a historic congregation once led by Civil Rights activist, the Rev. C.K. Steele.\n\nIn a letter to Dunn, he asked him to reconsider his vote.\n\nHolmes pointedly told the Congressman, depending how court challenges over a new congressional map turn out, he and Lawson could face each other in November for a lone Tallahassee seat.\n\n“If the courts uphold the Governor’s map, then you will be the congressman for all citizens of Leon County and Gadsden County, which both have a significant number of black voters,” wrote Holmes.\n\nDunn never publicly responded to the Holmes’ letter but this week when he joined with Democrats to name the courthouse for Hatchett. He said he believed the April vote “was rushed and deserved more study.\"\n\n“I wish we could have had an honest discussion and celebrated Judge Hatchett’s many achievements,” said Dunn, adding he was proud now to cast a yes vote for Hatchett.\n\nAlthough he takes issue with Hatchett’s decision regarding school prayer, Dunn said one decision “must not overshadow all his achievements.”\n\nLawson, in a statement, said his House Republican colleagues who voted against the bill “were misled\" on the prayers ruling and that the judge was “simply followed the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court.”\n\nLike Dunn, U.S. Rep. Bill Posey, R-Brevard, and U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Miami, voted with Democrats. The two had also voted yes in April.\n\nHolmes issued a statement expressing what he called the deepest appreciation for the Dunn vote.\n\n“It is refreshing in a time of so much political partisanship and divisiveness and anger we must commend the congressman for stepping up and being a part of supporting this historic moment,” said Holmes.\n\nTwelve Florida Republicans, however, voted against the proposal for a second time. The group includes U.S. representatives Matt Gaetz, of Fort Walton Beach, Byron Donalds, of Naples, Brian Mast, of Palm City, and Gregg Steube, of Sarasota.\n\nLawson said he remains deeply disappointed they followed Clyde's lead, who Lawson points out was “one of three members to vote against the Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act” in March.\n\nLawson said a federal courthouse dedication to Hatchett will honor \"his influence and commitment to the enrichment of Florida, and communities of color across the country.\"\n\n“Judge Hatchett will be remembered as ‘Florida’s voice of justice,’” he said.\n\nJames Call is a member of the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida Capital Bureau.

He was known as a quiet but effective workhorse in bringing federal resources to Arizona to fund local projects, large and small — among them, the restoration of the old Bullion Plaza School, built in 1923 in Miami, Arizona, as a segregated school for Mexican-American students.\n\nPastor's father, Enrique Pastor, worked at the Inspiration mine.\n\nFred Barcón grew up with Ed Pastor. He has a vivid memory of the former congressman's father, nicknamed Kikes, working at the mine.\n\nPastor's father worked as a furnace tender at the smelter, which emitted huge plumes of sulfur smoke.\n\n\"I remember Kikes, Pastor's dad, standing in the smoke, thick sulfur smoke. All you could see was his silhouette, smoking a cigarette,\" Barcón said.\n\nPastor's father died in 2003. It was a terrible death, Barcón said. \"His lungs were all eaten up from the sulfur smoke.\"\n\nIt was not a life miners wanted for their children.\n\n\"Our parents would come home and tell us, 'You are not going to work in that mine. You are going to do something. You are going to go to college,' \" Barcón said.\n\nFirst to attend college\n\nPastor, the oldest of three, was the first person in his family to attend college. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Arizona State University and taught at North High School. He later earned a law degree from ASU.\n\nPastor was a straight-A student and a star athlete, Barcón recalled.\n\nBack then, the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co., where Pastor's father worked, offered a $1,000 college scholarship to top students, enough to cover the cost of college, Barcon said.\n\nBut Pastor had no chance of receiving the scholarship, despite his academic achievements.\n\n\"Back in our day, minorities were not awarded scholarships,\" Barcón said. The Inspiration mine scholarship \"only went to the white kids, the Anglos.\"\n\nBarcón remembers that as a kid, Pastor delivered newspapers to earn money, which helped him earn a scholarship from The Arizona Republic to pay for college.\n\nAt ASU, Pastor lived at Irish Hall B.\n\nMORE: Phoenix Councilwoman Laura Pastor's statement on death of her father\n\n\"That was probably the lowest-income dorm on campus,\" Barcón said. \"The reason I know that is I had a room right under Ed.\"\n\nBarcón remembers seeing Pastor working at the cafeteria \"washing dishes, cleaning tables, helping the cooks\" to earn extra money despite his scholarship.\n\nPastor's father was an officer in Mine-Mill Local 587, the local branch of the Mine-Mill and Smelters Workers Union that represented Mexican-American miners, said Alfredo Gutierrez, 73.\n\nGutierrez was a lifelong friend of Pastor's and grew up in neighboring Miami, Arizona, which locals pronounce, Me-AM-ah.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there was a lot of discrimination against Mexican-Americans, Gutierrez said.\n\nMexican-American miners were paid less than Anglo miners and their children attended segregated schools, he said.\n\nIt was Mine-Mill Local 587 that advocated not only for employee rights on behalf of Mexican-American miners but also for rights on behalf of the entire Mexican-American community, Gutierrez said.\n\n\"The important thing is that it was an atmosphere where people organized and fought back,\" Gutierrez said. \"The status quo was not acceptable. There was always an effort to make things better. To organize the community, whether it was about integrating the schools or paving the canyons. It was always a constant organization, and that is the atmosphere we were brought up in and that is what I think contributed to Ed and his brother Robert.\"\n\nStill, few people who grew up with Ed Pastor envisioned that one day he would run for Congress and serve 23 years in the House of Representatives, Gutierrez said.\n\nIf anything, it was his younger brother, Robert, who people thought would run for office one day.\n\nRobert \"was the activist,\" Gutierrez said. \"He was the one who was very charismatic.\"\n\nThen Robert Pastor was killed in a car accident in the early 1970s. Robert's death inspired Ed Pastor to run for the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, Gutierrez said. He was elected to the board in 1976.\n\n\"I think Robert’s death had a huge impact on Ed and frankly on all of us,\" Gutierrez recalled.\n\nHe was referring to a group of Arizona Latino leaders who came from Miami-Globe, twin mining communities — among them Gutierrez, who served for 14 years in the Arizona Legislature, powerhouse political consultant Ronnie Lopez, and Pastor.\n\n\"They jokingly called us the Miami Mafia,\" said Barcón, 74, founder and owner of Barcón Corp., a general-contracting company in Globe.\n\nWork for Gov. Castro\n\nAfter earning a law degree, Pastor went to work for then-Arizona Gov. Raul Castro enforcing workers' rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Pastor became deputy director of the Guadalupe Organization Inc. and was inspired by the Chicano movement and its charismatic leader, Cesar Chavez, according to Roll Call.\n\nPastor believed Mexican-Americans needed more decisive political leadership, Roll Call said, and volunteered for the campaigns of Mexican-American candidates in Arizona.\n\nIn the early 1980s, he also was president and CEO of Valle del Sol, a nonprofit agency that provides behavioral health services to Latinos.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 1991, Pastor was sworn into Congress after winning a special election for the seat that had been vacated by longtime Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., who stepped down because of declining health.\n\nMORE: OPINION: Elvia Diaz: The loss of Ed Pastor hits Latinos especially hard\n\nAs the first Hispanic from Arizona to be elected to Congress, Pastor was a role model for Latinos.\n\n“He opened a lot of doors for a lot of aspiring elected officials,” ­Edmundo Hidalgo, former president of the Latino social-services agency Chicanos Por La Causa, told The Arizona Republic in 2014.\n\nPastor helped CPLC grow into the third-largest Latino social-services agency in the nation by helping the organization tap into federal funding, Hidalgo said.\n\nWhen he decided not to run for re-election, Pastor was the most senior member of Arizona’s House delegation and served on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. He was a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and former president of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.\n\nBut he never forgot his roots, Barcón said.\n\nAs congressman, Pastor secured federal funding to help rehab the Bullion Plaza School, which served as a segregated school for Mexican-American students until the 1950s.\n\nThe former school is now a cultural center and museum. Pastor was scheduled to attend a reunion there this Saturday, Barcón said.\n\nBarcón recalled that Pastor threw a giant party in downtown Phoenix every December and invited several thousand supporters and friends.\n\nWhile attending the party one year in the late 1990s, Barcón recalled telling Pastor he could not stay for dinner because he was going deer hunting early the next morning.\n\nPastor wanted him to stay but didn't make a fuss. An aide, however, chastised Barcón on the way out.\n\n\"How can you say no to the congressman?\" Barcón recalled the aide saying.\n\n\"Easy,\" Barcón told him. \"To you, he's Congressman Ed Pastor. To me, he's Ed Pastor, who happens to be a congressman.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2014/09/07/news-quiz-back-school-edition/15184175/", "title": "News quiz: Back to school edition", "text": "Timothy Pass\n\nStatesman Journal\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

She was 95.\n\nMeek died at her home in Miami after a long illness, family spokesperson Adam Sharon said in a statement. The family did not specify a cause of death.\n\nMeek started her congressional career at an age when many people begin retirement. She was 66 when she easily won the 1992 Democratic congressional primary in her Miami-Dade County district. No Republican opposed her in the general election.\n\nAlcee Hastings and Corrine Brown joined Meek in January 1993 as the first Black Floridians to serve in Congress since 1876 as the state’s districts had been redrawn by the federal courts in accordance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nOn her first day in Congress, Meek reflected that while her grandmother, a slave on a Georgia farm, could never have dreamed of such an accomplishment, her parents told her that anything was possible.\n\n“They always said the day would come when we would be recognized for our character,” she told The Associated Press in an interview that day.\n\nIn Congress, Meek championed affirmative action, economic opportunities for the poor and efforts to bolster democracy in and ease immigration restrictions on Haiti, the birthplace of many of her constituents.\n\nShe also was known for her liberal opinions, folksy yet powerful oratory and colorful Republican bashing.\n\n“The last Republican that did something for me was Abraham Lincoln,” she told the state delegation to the 1996 Democratic Convention in Chicago.\n\nMeek joined her son Kendrick, a former state trooper and state senator, in a 2000 sit-in at then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s office to protest an end to affirmative action policies. She had long argued in favor of such policies, since earning her master’s degree from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1948. At the time, Blacks were not admitted to graduate schools in Florida.\n\nMeek decided not to seek a sixth term in 2002. Her son Kendrick succeeded in winning her heavily Democratic district, a seat he held for four terms before an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 2010.\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Carrie Meek returned to Miami and created a foundation to work on education and housing issues. She was also criticized for some of her business dealings.\n\nShe lobbied for a biotech park that was planned for Miami’s impoverished Liberty City neighborhood but never materialized. County authorities eventually started a criminal investigation, and the park’s developer was arrested in October 2009 on charges that he stole nearly $1 million from the project.\n\nCongressional records showed that Meek was paid while her son sought millions of federal dollars for the project. Meek said she was paid as a consultant, and both mother and son denied their efforts were linked.\n\nBefore entering politics, Meek worked as a teacher and administrator at Miami-Dade College.\n\nShe was elected to the Florida House in 1978, succeeding pioneer Black legislator Gwen Cherry, who had been killed in an auto accident. She became one of the first African Americans and the first Black woman to serve in the Florida Senate since the 1800s\n\nCarrie Pittman was born to Willie and Carrie Pittman in Tallahassee on April 29, 1926, and was the youngest of 12 children. Her father worked in nearby fields as a sharecropper and her mother took in laundry from white families.\n\nShe graduated from Florida A&M University in 1946 with a degree in biology and physical education. The university named its building for Black history archives in her honor in 2007. She was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.\n\nShe accepted a position at Bethune Cookman College as an instructor and became the institution’s first female basketball coach. In 1958, she returned to Florida A&M as an instructor in health and physical education. She held that position until 1961.\n\n“I was deeply hurt to learn of the passing today of Florida A&M University alumna and former Congresswoman Carrie Meek,” FAMU President Larry Robinson said in a prepared statement. “We join the Meek family, Rattlers around the world and those she represented in the State Legislature and the halls of Congress in mourning her passing. Her legacy and life’s work will be acknowledged forever at the Meek-Eaton Black Archives and Museum located on our campus.”\n\nMeek continued her teaching career at Miami Dade Community College as the first Black professor, associate dean, and assistant to the Vice President from 1961 to 1979.\n\nThen, she began her trailblazing political career, representing Florida’s 17th Congressional District as a Democratic Florida State House Representative.\n\nIn Congress, Meek was a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee and worked to secure $100 million in aid to rebuild Dade County as the area recovered from Hurricane Andrew.\n\nShe retired in 2002 and shifted her focus to the Carrie Meek Foundation, which she founded in November 2001, to provide the Miami-Dade community with much-needed resources, opportunities, and jobs. Meek spearheaded the Foundation’s daily operations until 2015 when she stepped down due to declining health.\n\nLeon County Commission Chairman Bill Proctor said Meek was “the epitome of class, style, and grace.”\n\n“There will never be another to match her magnetic energy, effervescent personality, and incredible communication skills,” Proctor said in a statement. “Truly, this congresswoman was deeply loved by constituents and all who knew her well. The Congresswoman, FAMU-an, and daughter of the Tallahassee Southside will be missed.”\n\nMeek is survived by her children Lucia Davis-Raiford, Sheila Davis Kinui and Kendrick B.

Yet, according to the whistleblower, the inspectors were involved in hundreds of evaluations, known as \"check rides,\" to certify pilots to fly aircraft ranging from the Gulfstream VII to the 737 Max. The Office of Special Counsel outlined its findings Tuesday in letters to President Donald Trump and to Congress.\n\nThe FAA has denied the finding that its inspectors weren't qualified, at least when it came to evaluating pilots for the 737 Max.\n\nThe 737 Max, the latest version of the famed workhorse airliner, remains at the center of several investigations following two crashes at foreign airlines in the past year. A Lion Air 737 Max jet crashed into the Java Sea late last year, and in March, an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. Combined, 346 passengers and crew died in both crashes.\n\nWhen will it fly? FAA says each country will make ‘its own decision’ on returning Boeing 737 Max to the air\n\nWhile scrutiny of the jet has focused primarily on an automated control system that appears to have factored in the crashes, the inquiries are reaching further, probing in particular how Boeing and FAA went about designing and getting approvals for the 737 Max.\n\nThe FAA's independent Office of Audit and Evaluation found 16 out of 22 safety inspectors had not completed formal training, according to the special counsel's office. Of those 16, 11 lacked the required flight instructor certificate. The inspectors who lacked full qualifications included the evaluation group in Seattle, where Chicago-based Boeing has long based its factory operations, and those assigned to the 737 Max.\n\nBoeing 737 Max overseas: Did foreign pilots have enough training to fly commercial jets?\n\n“The FAA is entrusted with the critically important role of ensuring aircraft safety,\" said Special Counsel Henry Kerner in a statement. “The FAA's failure to ensure safety inspector competency for these aircraft puts the flying public at risk.\"\n\nIn addition, the office said the FAA issued misleading statements when questions were raised by members of Congress about training of FAA inspectors. On April 4, the FAA told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that \"all of the flight inspectors who participated in the Boeing 737 Max Flight Standardization Board certification activities were fully qualified.\"\n\nAsked for comment about the special counsel's findings, the FAA repeated its assertion that its Boeing 737 Max inspectors were qualified.\n\n\"All of the aviation safety inspectors who participated in the evaluation of the Boeing 737 MAX were fully qualified for those activities,\" the FAA said.\n\nThe planes are grounded: How the Boeing 737 Max fallout turned an 8 a.m. nonstop into an evening flight with a stop", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/24"}]}

At least a few times, he went so far as to say bags will remain free as long as he's CEO.\n\nSo Wednesday's announcement that Kelly is stepping down as CEO in February raises a key question for travelers: will bags still fly free?\n\nKelly's replacement, longtime Southwest executive Bob Jordan, had a quick reply in a brief interview with USA TODAY.\n\n\"I will say emphatically that we will not charge for bags,'' Jordan said. \"And there will be no (ticket) change fees.''\n\nNeed a break?

That was more a reference to the airline's next 50 years after its 50th anniversary celebration last week, he said.\n\n\"it's not like we’re changing the DNA of the company or the brand or something like that,'' he said.\n\nMight Southwest (finally) switch to assigned seats?\n\nSouthwest has occasionally studied changing another one of its quirks: open seating. Instead of assigning seats, the airline assigns numbered boarding positions in three groups based on the time of online check-in and other factors, including frequent flyer status, ticket type or the payment of an early boarding fee. Passengers are free to pick any open seat when they board.\n\nOne of the assigned-seating studies, which Jordan led, led to the creation of the current boarding system in 2007. \"You spoke and we listened! Southwest Airlines says open seating is here to stay,'' the airline said in announcing the decision.\n\nJordan said \"every single time'' time the airline has studied changing its seating policy customers \"generally prefer open seating.''\n\nHe didn't rule out testing assigned seat again, putting it in the same camp as other potential changes ahead, including the addition of new international routes. Southwest doesn't serve Europe, for example, focusing its international service in the Caribbean and Mexico.\n\n\"If it was clear that the need (for assigned seating) was there, that this was essential to our product, we would absolutely look at that,'' Jordan said.\n\nKelly, who has previously acknowledged Southwest's open boarding turns off some potential customers and said the airline's new reservations system gives it the capability to assign seats, said at the moment, however: \"There's no work on that.''\n\nIs this seat taken? Southwest seat saving drives some passengers crazy\n\nKelly and Jordan said Southwest is still working on new products or services that will boost revenue, hush-hush efforts they regularly touted before the pandemic without providing any details.\n\n'Very handsome opportunities': Southwest aggressively plotting ways to boost revenue\n\nOn Wednesday, Kelly said the projects are still not ready for \"prime time'' but said two of them fit well with the resurgence of leisure travel.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIt will sell tickets for the first flights with assigned and premium seating in the second half of 2025.\n\nHow will Southwest Airlines assigned seating work?\n\nAssigned seating on Southwest will work similarly to other airlines: Passengers who buy the cheapest tickets can select a seat for a fee, or a seat will be assigned to them the day before their flight.\n\nPassengers can also purchase premium seats with extra legroom. Premium seats will offer up to 5 additional inches of seat pitch, or the distance between seats. About a third of Southwest's seats will be premium, and premium passengers will be among the first to board the plane.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards members can select seats without paying additional fees depending on their rewards status. A-List members can select standard legroom seats at the time of booking at no additional cost; they'll have the opportunity to upgrade to a premium seat within 48 hours of the flight at no extra cost if any are still available. A-List Preferred members can select any available seat, including extra legroom seats, at no additional cost.\n\nSouthwest intends to maintain its current average seat pitch of 31 inches on all its planes. How much legroom is available with extra legroom seats depends on the plane. Southwest estimates the availability of extra legroom seats will look like this:\n\nBoeing 737-8 and 737-800: 68 seats with 3 additional inches of legroom.\n\n68 seats with 3 additional inches of legroom. Boeing 737-7: 48 seats with 3 additional inches of legroom.\n\n48 seats with 3 additional inches of legroom. Boeing 737-700: 40 seats with 5 additional inches of legroom.\n\nWhen Southwest reconfigures its cabins to include new assigned and premium seats, the planes will be outfitted with new seats from RECARO, known for their automotive seating and gaming chairs. The new seats will have six-way headrests, more cushioning and electronic device holders.\n\nWhen is Southwest ending free checked luggage?\n\nSouthwest is not ending free checked luggage − at least for now. Every ticket will continue to include two free checked bags.\n\nWhile customers love the policy − American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines raised their baggage fees in early 2024 − investors think Southwest is leaving money on the table by not charging for checked luggage.\n\nElliott Investment Management, the activist investor pushing for sweeping changes at Southwest, hinted in a presentation called Stronger Southwest that charging fees for checked luggage would improve Southwest's profitability.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards changes and other news\n\nSouthwest Airlines Investor Day also included these announcements:\n\nNew global airline partnerships. Southwest announced a partnership with Icelandair to offer international flights out of Baltimore-Washington International Airport; more partnerships and participating airports will be announced.\n\nNew vacation packages. In 2024, Southwest will launch Getaways by Southwest, offering customizable vacation packages.\n\nChanges to Rapid Rewards program. Southwest will update benefits for its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, giving A-List and A-List Preferred frequent flyers the highest level of benefits. The airline intends to add opportunities for Rapid Rewards members to earn and redeem points for long-haul destinations as it develops international partnerships and Getaways by Southwest.\n\nAll Rapid Rewards members will continue to earn and redeem points at the same rate they do today and the program will continue offering no blackout dates, uncapped reward seat availability and points that don't expire.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nMichael Salerno is an award-winning journalist who’s covered travel and tourism since 2014.

That's up 13 percent from $566 million in 2017.\n\nAirlines have long had to disclose baggage fee and ticket change revenue to the U.S. Department of Transportation, but accounting rules now require them to also provide a total figure for passenger fees in regulatory filings instead of lumping them into a broader category called \"other'' revenue. Southwest is the first to report annual figures, in its 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week.\n\nThe so-called passenger ancillary revenue category includes a range of fees such as in-flight Wi-Fi and alcoholic beverages, pet fees, unaccompanied minor fees and baggage fees of all sorts, but the the biggest source of fee revenue for Southwest is its 10-year-old EarlyBird Check-In option.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFor $15, $20 or $25 one way per person depending on the route, passengers who buy EarlyBird Check-In get a higher position in Southwest's boarding line. Boarding order is critical on Southwest because the airline famously doesn't assign seats. Passengers are free to pick any open seat when they board.\n\nSouthwest didn't break out the total for EarlyBird check-in fees in 2018, but it did in 2017 and that year the fees totaled $358 million, or 63 percent of the total passenger fee revenue.\n\nSouthwest President Tom Nealon said in January that EarlyBird revenue and another priority boarding option called Upgraded Boarding each grew by double-digit percentages in 2018. Using a conservative 10 percent year-over-year gain, that puts EarlyBird revenue approaching $400 million for 2018.\n\nSouthwest used to charge a flat $15 fee each way for EarlyBird Check-In, but switched to variable pricing in August. (The fee started at a flat $10 in 2009.)\n\n\"We’re making this change so we can continue offering a product our customers love,'' Southwest said in a statement at the time. \"Of course, an increase in the price of a product is rarely welcome news, but as EarlyBird increases in popularity, we want to protect the value it offers our customers.''\n\nA USA TODAY spot check of flights found that the EarlyBird fee on many routes went up.\n\nNealon said in January that the airline has been pleased with the results from the switch to variable pricing.\n\nSouthwest also increased its Upgraded Boarding fee in 2018. That option, which guarantees travelers a spot at the front of the line, is available on select flights and is $30, $40 or $50 each way at the gate. Southwest has not publicly disclosed Upgraded Boarding revenue.\n\nSouthwest's EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding fees are essentially seat selection fees, which have become common at other carriers and are an increasing source of frustration for travelers.\n\nWithout charging for the first two checked bags, Southwest still lags its competitors on the fee front, of course. American Airlines, for example, collected $911 million in baggage fees in the first nine months of 2018 alone, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. And United's baggage fee take in that period was roughly equal to Southwest's total passenger fees for the year.\n\nMore: Southwest seat saving drives some passengers crazy\n\nMore: Southwest 101: A user's guide to the nation's largest domestic carrier", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2024/12/19/southwest-airlines-open-seating-implementation/77072663007/", "title": "Southwest new seating policy: Here's when assigned seats start", "text": "AI-assisted summary Southwest Airlines is ending its open seating policy and transitioning to assigned seating.\n\nThe change will take effect in early 2026, with tickets for flights with assigned seating going on sale in the second half of 2025.\n\nPassengers will have the option to pay for a seat assignment or have one assigned to them for free the day before their flight.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is ending its long-standing practice of open seating that began with the airline's founding in 1967 and switching to assigned seating.\n\nSouthwest announced the changes as part of a three-year transformation plan called \"Southwest.

I'm not talking about change fees or some of those basics,'' he said.\n\nRELATED: Phoenix council approves expansion of Sky Harbor's Terminal 4, Sky Train | First look: Sky Harbor Terminal 3 upgrades\n\nSouthwest's current options include the popular EarlyBird Check-In, which costs $15 each way for a better boarding position, and a last-minute priority boarding upgrade available at the gate for a higher fee. Its competitors have been far more aggressive on fees, charging for checked bags, ticket changes, \"preferred\" seats, premium seats, seat assignments, even carry-on bags and boarding-pass printing.\n\nWall Street has long questioned Southwest's strategy of not charging for the first two checked bags, a practice that began in 2008 when fuel costs skyrocketed. The move has turned into a major moneymaker for the industry. In the first half of this year, airlines collected $2.1 billion in baggage fees, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n\nSouthwest, which does charge for more than two checked bags as well as overweight and oversize bags, took in just $22.2 million of the total even though it's the nation's largest domestic carrier, accounting for one in four passengers.

One of its first redeye flights will be from Phoenix.\n\nThe move comes as Southwest, which operates the second-largest flight capacity at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, is working to improve its profitability and the flying experience. In April, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told investors in an earnings call that his staff was looking into whether ending open seating would satisfy customers' preferences.\n\nHere's what to know about the end of open seating on Southwest Airlines and what other changes may be coming.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIs Southwest Airlines doing away with open seating?\n\nYes. Southwest will begin assigned seating on all flights in 2025.\n\nIn addition, Southwest will create a premium cabin section with extended-legroom seats. This premium section will encompass about one-third of the available seats.\n\nThe changes won't occur right away because the new cabin layouts require approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, according to Southwest's announcement.\n\nSouthwest will reveal more details about how assigned and premium seats will work and what the cabin layouts will look like during the airline's Investor Day in late September.\n\nWhen reached for comment by The Arizona Republic, Southwest did not say what the premium-seat legroom will be and whether standard legroom would change from the 32-inch average seat pitch in the current cabins.\n\nWhy is Southwest ending open seating?\n\nIt has to do with both customer preference and the airline's profitability.\n\nSouthwest said it conducted extensive research on passengers' seating preferences and found that 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer seat assignments. Customers cited the airline's open seating policy as the No. 1 reason why they chose to fly with a competing airline.\n\n\"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on customer expectations – and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance,\" Jordan said in the airline's announcement.\n\nSouthwest is working to improve its financial position. The airline reported a net loss of $231 million in the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe airline brought in $7.4 billion in operating revenues from April to June 2024, but the $367 million it took in in profits was more than 46% less than its profit during the same period in 2023, according to its second-quarter 2024 financial report.\n\nAirline staff also expect its non-fuel operating costs, which include employees' salaries and aircraft maintenance, will increase around 11% to 13% in the next three months.\n\nWhat is open seating on Southwest Airlines?\n\nOn a flight with open seating, passengers don't have assigned seats.\n\nWhere they sit largely depends on their place in the boarding queue: Those boarding in Group A get the best choice of seats. After Group B, those who board in Group C usually are limited to middle seats and little to no overhead space for carry-ons.\n\nSouthwest's open seating policy was introduced with the airline's founding in 1971. Back then, the seating was first come, first served. The boarding groups began after a 2006 experiment with assigned seating revealed customers' frustrations with the first come, first served approach.\n\nDoes Southwest do redeyes?\n\nBesides ending open seating, Southwest announced Thursday that it would begin offering redeye flights that leave at night and arrive the next morning.\n\nSouthwest's first redeyes include a nonstop Phoenix-Baltimore flight, which will begin flying on Feb. 13, 2025. The flight leaves Sky Harbor at 11:05 p.m. Arizona time and arrives in Baltimore at 5:10 a.m. Eastern time. We found fares from $236 one way, comparable to or slightly cheaper than other Southwest fares between the two cities.\n\nSouthwest will introduce four other redeye routes in February 2025 — Las Vegas-Baltimore, Las Vegas-Orlando, Los Angeles-Baltimore and Los Angeles-Nashville — with more possible in the future.\n\nWill Southwest change its Bags Fly Free policy?\n\nSome travel industry analysts, such as Steve and Paul Glenn of the Nebraska-based travel management company Executive Travel, speculate that Southwest will eventually change its checked bag policy.\n\nRight now, the airline allows each passenger to check their first two bags for free — a sharp contrast from competitors such as American Airlines, which recently changed its baggage policy to charge $40 for the first checked bag.\n\nThe Glenns forecasted in a June podcast that Southwest would reduce that to one free checked bag if its profitability doesn't improve.\n\nWhen asked by The Republic if Southwest would change its baggage policy, a Southwest spokesperson said, \"No additional changes forthcoming at this time.\"\n\nMichael Salerno is an award-winning journalist who’s covered travel and tourism since 2014.

Stapen Special for USA TODAY\n\nUse a smaller airport and travel on less busy days to avoid stress\n\nBe prepared with proper documentation for children when traveling overseas\n\nConsider hiring a travel companion to accompany solo passengers needing extra help\n\nIf the best thing about the holidays is celebrating with friends and family, then the most difficult tasks may be making your way through the crunch of airport passengers and the maze of carrier fees and regulations. Until we can fly by saying \"Beam me up, Scotty,\" consider these tips for easing air travel.\n\nPLANE SENSE\n\nUse a smaller airport. Regional airports, as opposed to major hubs, come with the conveniences of easier parking, fewer crowds as well as shorter check-in and security lines. These advantages can outweigh any added drive time required to get from the gate to your downtown destination. To visit Boston, for example, consider landing at Manchester Boston Regional, Manchester, N.H., 50 miles north of the city instead of at Logan International.\n\nBook tickets early. To get the best fares and connections plus seats next to your children without paying for prime spots, purchase tickets as far in advance as possible. Flying on non-stop or through flights (no change of plane required after a layover) eliminates missed connections.\n\nTravel on less busy days. While houses may be quiet the night before Christmas and Thanksgiving, airports are packed. Escape the thickest throngs by flying on Thanksgiving and Christmas days, an especially good solution when landings allow you to arrive in time for the turkey dinner.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFactor in luggage fees when comparing fares. More and more airlines tack on charges for checked luggage, typically $25 for the first piece and $35 or more for the second. A family of four who manages to pack their holiday clothing and gifts into one suitcase per person can pay $100+ each way for checked bags. On JetBlue, for example, the first checked bag is free, but the second costs $40. On Southwest, two bags fly free. Sites such as farecompare.com offer handy luggage charts.\n\nLessen bag charges. Loyalty pays off: Use credit cards and take advantage of airline club memberships that cover luggage fees. When flying Delta and charging tickets to a Delta Sky Miles Gold credit card, wave goodbye to the first checked-bag fee for up to nine people traveling together on the cardholder's reservation, a savings of $225. With an AMEX Platinum card, receive a yearly $200 credit on the carrier of your choice for luggage fees and airline incidentals. Research your frequent flyer membership; at some levels, your bags go free.\n\nFAMILY & FRIENDS RULES\n\nReserve wheelchairs. During the busy holidays, be sure to ask ahead of time for a wheelchair (always free) for granny who tires after walking a few steps. Doing so will lessen her wait time for assistance.\n\nConsider extra travel help. According to the Department of Transportation, if someone cannot be counted on to follow safety procedures, then he can no longer fly alone. To get great-uncle Louis to the holiday table, ask a friend or relative to be his flight buddy or engage a travel companion whose services include taking Louis to the airport, checking him in and flying with him. Preferred Travel Helpers, preferredtravelhelpers.com, and Flying Companion, flyingcompanions.com, are among the companies providing such assistance.\n\nEven babies need passports. Don't disappoint your in-laws in Ireland who look forward to meeting their four month-old granddaughter. To go abroad, tots, no matter how young (as well as their older siblings), must have their own passports. Apply for these well in advance at travel.state.gov.\n\nUse approved safety systems for kids. Yes, you can hold a kid younger than two in your lap, but airlines recommend using a child safety restraint system (car seat approved for flying); these may be placed only in window seats. For kids weighing between 22-44 pounds, carriers suggest, but don't require, the CARES Child Safety Device, the only flight-approved harness.To purchase: kidsflysafe.com\n\nKnow the age requirements and fees for children flying alone. For many children, the holidays mean flying solo to visit non-custodial parents and other relatives. Since each airline creates its own unaccompanied minor rules, policies may differ. In general, an unaccompanied child age 5 through 7 may fly on a non-stop or through flight. Children ages 8 through 11 may also board a connecting flight except for the last one of the day. (This helps prevent a kid from being stranded in a non-destination city). For some airlines, such as American and USAir, tweens and teens 12-17 can fly as unaccompanied minors, but don't have to. Delta ups the opt-in or opt-out age to 15-17. Fees vary, but hover around $100 each way in addition to ticket prices.\n\nBring the correct documents. Don't ruin your Mexican beach trip, your Canadian ski vacation or other international holiday by showing up at the airport without the proper documentation, especially when traveling with a minor but without that child's other parent or guardian. Since rules--established to thwart child abduction by non-custodial parents--differ by country, always check with your destination's embassy or consulate. In general, it's wise to bring a copy of the child's birth certificate plus a notarized letter of consent from the stay-at-home parent authorizing the travel. In cases of divorce, you may be asked to show the custody decree as well. If the other parent has died, a copy of the death certificate may be requested.\n\nCandyce H.

Scattered audience members loudly cheered from the balcony of Los Angeles’ Microsoft Theater, where artists including Justin Bieber, Jennifer Lopez, Nelly and Doja Cat took the stage for impressive but barely social distanced performances. It was frequently uncomfortable to watch, given that LA officials just announced the city is suspending indoor and outdoor dining amid surging cases of COVID-19.\n\nStill, Taraji P. Henson was a game and charismatic host, and pop star Dua Lipa won the night with a literally soaring performance of hit “Levitating.” Here are more of the biggest moments from this year's AMAs:\n\nTaylor Swift wins artist of the year, shares update on 'new' music\n\nSwift has been mostly quiet since releasing her stunning surprise album \"Folklore\" this summer, chiming in on social media to encourage voting and speak out about her public battle with Scooter Braun. The music executive sold the master rights to Swift's first six albums without her knowledge, the singer says, and now she is hard at work recording new versions of those old songs.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"Oh, hey guys. Thank you so much for this. This is a fan-voted award, which means so much to me,\" Swift said from a recording booth, as she accepted the artist of the year award virtually. \"You guys have been beyond wonderful, all the years of my career but especially this one, when we've been so far apart and haven't been able to see each other in concert. But I still feel really connected to you through the music. Your reaction to 'Folklore' and all the ways in which your imagination honored that album, I just love you so much. And I'm really, really lucky because of you.\n\n\"The reason I'm not there tonight is I'm actually rerecording all of my old music, in the studio where we originally recorded it,\" Swift continued. \"So it's been amazing. I can't wait for you to hear it.\"\n\nAmerican Music Awards 2020: The winners list\n\nKaty Perry teams up with Darius Rucker for first post-pregnancy performance\n\nPerry returned to the AMAs stage for her first performance since welcoming daughter Daisy with fiancé Orlando Bloom in August. The denim-clad pop star sang a stripped-down version of \"Only Love,\" off her new album, \"Smile,\" which she dedicated to her pastor father. With the help of country singer Rucker, Perry reimagined the somewhat forgettable ballad as a stirring duet that highlighted her raspy, soulful vocals.\n\nThe Weeknd honors Prince, duets with Kenny G in full-face bandage\n\nContinuing with the blood-streaked theme of his critically adored album \"After Hours,\" The Weeknd rocked a red-and-black suit and gauze-wrapped face during his AMAs appearances. The future Super Bowl halftime performer welcomed saxophone icon Kenny G for fireworks-filled performances of \"In Your Eyes\" and \"Save Your Tears\" in downtown LA. The singer (real name: Abel Tesfaye) also paid tribute to the late Prince while accepting the award for favorite soul R&B album.\n\n\"The last time I received this award, it was given to me by the late, great Prince,\" Tesfaye said. \"He's the reason I get to constantly challenge the genre of R&B and I'd like to dedicate this award to him.\"\n\nSocial media users have thoughts: The Weeknd sports bandaged face at AMAs; Twitter has comments for 'Too Late' singer\n\nMegan Thee Stallion brings body empowerment to the AMAs\n\nThere's no star shining brighter than Megan Thee Stallion right now. Fresh off the release of her electrifying debut album \"Good News\" last Friday, the Houston rapper brought her infectious confidence and signature showmanship to the Microsoft Theater with a flawless performance of the new single \"Body.\" \"I love my body: every curve, every inch, every mark, every dimple,\" she said in voiceover. \"My body is mine, and nobody owns it but me. And who I choose to let in is so lucky. You may not think my body is perfect, and it probably never will be. But when I look in the mirror, I love what I see.\"\n\nThe hip-hop hit-maker (real name: Megan Pete) also took home the award for favorite rap/hip-hop song for her delightfully raunchy No. 1 single \"WAP\" with Cardi B. Although Cardi was not in attendance, Pete accepted the honor on their behalf.\n\n\"Thank you to all the people that supported, all the people that showed love. We super appreciate it,\" Pete said. \"Thank you, God, thank you, Mama. I know you're watching over me. And thank you, Grandma, for watching from home.\"\n\nMegan Fox, Machine Gun Kelly make their joint red carpet debut\n\nKelly, 30, and Fox, 34, hit the red carpet for the first time together since making their relationship official in August. The rapper-turned-pop-punk rocker marked the occasion with a red-carpet snap on his Instagram page, captioned, \"Slept next to a shotgun 'til she came into my life.\" The \"Transformers\" star also shared a subtle but sweet message about her new beau, when she introduced Kelly's performances of \"My Bloody Valentine\" and \"My Ex's Best Friend\" with drummer Travis Barker.\n\n\"Once in a lifetime, magic can happen,\" Fox said onstage. \"For this next performer, we've all been under his spell since his debut in 2012.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/05/26/jlo-kisses-dancers-american-music-awards/83869485007/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez kisses dancers onstage during AMAs performance", "text": "The internet can’t quite figure out what to make of her American Music Awards dance number extravaganza from Jennifer Lopez, but it sure has people talking.\n\nJLo, 55, opened the AMAs surrounded by mirrors and dancers in a sci-fi, robo-tech \"multiverse.\" The singer got \"On the Floor\" with a 23-song mashup of the year's biggest hits, including \"Squabble Up,\" \"Good Luck Babe!\" and \"Denial is a River.\" And yes, she made out with three of her dancers.\n\nAhead of the AMAs, Lopez spoke with USA TODAY about how the awards show ceremony \"has been such a big part of my music journey and history.\" Lopez pulled double duty as host and performer of this year’s AMAs, a music industry institution since the late Dick Clark began producing it in 1974.\n\nOf her show opening performance, she teased, \"We're going to celebrate the year in music.\"\n\nAmerican Music Awards winners list: SZA, Gracie Abrams, more take home trophies\n\nNeed a break?

Lo is at 55,\" one wrote.\n\n\"Idc what people have to say. J.Lo gave me what I needed with that opening.

The singer took home three trophies, including one, finally, for album of the year. It was a rough night for Swifties, however, as Taylor Swift lost every category she competed in. So did Billie Eilish.\n\nBut that’s not all. Kendrick Lamar swept, Sabrina Carpenter picked up two wins and Chappell Roan came out on top in arguably the most competitive best new artist race in recent years. Plus there was bold fashion, high-energy performances and plenty of touching tributes to Los Angeles, which hosted the ceremony after being ravaged by wildfires in one of our country's worst natural disasters.\n\nThere was a lot packed into one awards show, but we’ve got you covered. Here are all the highlights from the 67th annual Grammys.\n\nBeyoncé finally wins album of the year; Taylor Swift leaves empty-handed\n\nAt long last: Beyoncé has won album of the year.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAfter about (checks notes) a gazillion nominations and a long, long career, Beyoncé finally won album of the year, for the country-tinged “Cowboy Carter.” Her daughter Blue Ivy led her by the hand to the stage in a sweet moment.\n\nDuring her acceptance speech, Beyoncé took a moment to acknowledge and praise Los Angeles firefighters, some of whom announced the contenders and her win. She said she feels “very full and very honored” and that “it’s been very many years” leading up to her win. No kidding.\n\nSwift, on the other hand, ended the night without a single trophy in a sharp contrast to last year, when she picked up her fourth album of the year award. Still, she didn’t seem to care; she and Jay-Z clinked their glasses in cheers after Beyoncé’s win. Beyhive members around the world are surely raising their glasses in celebration too.\n\nWhat is Drake's reaction to Kendrick Lamar's sweep?\n\nKendrick Lamar swept his categories – record and song of the year − and honestly, what I wish I could have seen more than his acceptance speeches was Drake’s reaction. Lamar dropped the track “Not Like Us” amid a heated public feud with Drake that saw them both trade scathing barbs back-and-forth in songs, including serious allegations of abuse. \"Not Like Us\" is a diss track aimed at Drake, and Drake has sued Lamar's record label over it. Clearly the Recording Academy is team Lamar.\n\nDespite the track’s harsh origin, Lamar gave acceptance speeches that were much more mild. His first paid tribute to his home city of Los Angeles and offered encouragement to those wanting to rebuild the city after the fires. That message might be one of the only things he and Drake could both agree on.\n\nGrammy winners full list: Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Chappell Roan take top awards\n\nTaylor Swift loses again as Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars win best pop duo/group performance\n\nIs Swift – dare we say – going to be the big loser of the night? After sweeping the Grammys last year, she lost two of her categories. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars won best pop duo/group performance for their song “Die with a Smile,” beating Swift and Gracie Abrams, who were nominated for their song “Us.” Stay strong, Swifties – there’s still album of the year, record of the year and song of the year to go.\n\nGaga continued the trend of giving acceptance speeches with political undertones. “I just want to say tonight that trans people are not invisible,” she said. “The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love. Thank you.”\n\nShakira shouts out 'immigrant brothers and sisters'\n\nAfter winning best Latin pop album for \"Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\" Shakira gave a shout-out to fellow immigrants, dedicating her trophy to them. Her speech took on deeper resonance amid ICE raids across the country.\n\n“I want to dedicate this award to all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” she said. “You are loved, you are worth it and I will always fight with you.”\n\nShe added: “To all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for their families, you are the true she-wolves.”\n\nThe Weeknd ends Grammys boycott. OK?\n\nThroughout the entire show, host Trevor Noah had been hyping up something big. Now, it’s finally here. What could it be? Will Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus duet their hit from “Cowboy Carter”? Will a legend like Dolly Parton return to sing Beyoncé’s version of “Jolene” with her? Is Swift finally going to announce “Reputation (Taylor’s Version)”? Sorry, Beyhive and Swifties – none of those things are happening.\n\nInstead, the big announcement was… the return of The Weeknd to the Grammys! That’s right, he was boycotting the ceremony − remember? Because I didn’t.\n\nRecording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. took the stage to announce updates to the organization’s voting body, saying its members are now younger and more diverse. Because of that, The Weeknd has decided to end his Grammys boycott. And that’s not all! He’s performing too.\n\nListen, if the Recording Academy wants to publicly pat itself on the back, they have every right to do that – it’s their show after all. But can they at least not lead viewers on by making us think a music legend was actually taking the stage? The Weeknd's performance was fine, but it was certainly not worth all that hype.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that The Weeknd’s big Grammys return is coming just as he has an album and tour to promote. How big of him. You can practically feel the forgiveness, healing and reconciliation through the television screen.\n\nChappell Roan wins best new artist, advocates for healthcare\n\nPink Pony Club, rise! Chappell Roan is this year’s Grammys best new artist.\n\nVictoria Monét, last year’s winner, announced the category, arguably the most competitive of this year’s ceremony. “That’s a tough category,” she remarked after reading out the stacked nominees list, which included Carpenter, Shaboozey, Doechii, Teddy Swims, Benson Boone and RAYE. You can say that again, Monét.\n\n'Do you got us?' Chappell Roan urges music labels to support developing artists at Grammys\n\nRoan, always one to speak up about things she believes in (for better or worse), took the opportunity to press record labels to provide a “livable wage” as well as adequate healthcare to their up-and-coming artists. It’s a struggle she said she knows personally: Roan, who’s been dropped by a label before, said she knows what it’s like to not have healthcare.\n\n“Labels, we got you, but do you got us?” she asked.\n\nTaylor Swift announces Beyoncé’s big country win\n\nIf any artist knows about bending and breaking genres, it’s Swift, who started off in country and eventually became an all-around pop music sensation.\n\nAt the Grammys, she announced the winner for best country album: Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter”!\n\nBeyoncé looked shocked at the announcement, with her eyes wide as she stood. “Wow, I really was not expecting this,” she said from the stage. “I think sometimes 'genre' is a code word to keep us in our place as artists, and I just want to encourage people to do what they’re passionate about and to stay consistent.”\n\nIt was a sweet moment to watch the two biggest stars in music onstage together and, dare we say, \"holding space\" for each other. Here’s to more grace and genre-breaking for everyone in 2025.\n\nSabrina Carpenter beats Taylor Swift for best pop vocal album\n\nIs the era of Swift sweeping every Grammys category officially over? Has the coven of the Recording Academy declared a new supreme?\n\nCarpenter took home the trophy for best pop vocal album, beating industry veterans Ariana Grande, newcomer Roan and, arguably the biggest artist in the world right now, Ms. Swift, whom Carpenter opened for on the record-breaking Eras tour.\n\nSwift seemed overjoyed at Carpenter’s win, jumping up from her seat and cheering like a proud mom. And speaking of moms, even though Carpenter was visibly flustered, she still remembered to shout hers out in her acceptance speech: “I want to thank my mom for driving me to every voice lesson.\n\nDoechii becomes third woman to win best rap album\n\nWe’re only one category in, and history has already been made at this year's Grammys.\n\nDoechii became the third woman ever to win best rap album, taking home the trophy for her mixtape “Alligator Bites Never Heal.” She gave an emotional speech that also shouted out Lauryn Hill and Cardi B, the two women winners who came before her. Carbi B announced the category.\n\nDoechii ended her speech with a direct message to Black women watching: “You can do it. Anything is possible. … Don’t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you.” Gayle King clearly resonated, appearing to shout \"preach\" from her seat in the audience.\n\nGrammys kick off with touching LA tribute after wildfire disaster\n\nThe Grammys had a somber start and for good reason – as host Noah noted, the awards show comes on the heels of major wildfires that ravaged Los Angles, one of the worst natural disasters in the country’s history. Dawes, a band that Noah says lost their childhood home and instruments in the fires, performed Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.,” with revised lyrics referencing the fires. The star-studded backing band included John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Swift seemed to vibe with it, bobbing her head from her seat in the background. It was a more subdued intro than most Grammys watchers are probably used to, but it was necessary. The wildfires were an elephant in the room that needed addressing, lest the awards show come off tone deaf, which is the last thing fans want tonight. Before the first break, the show also gave some ad time to a local LA business, Orla Floral Studio. They also encouraged people watching from home to donate to fire relief.\n\nKanye West's wife Bianca Censori shocks on red carpet with see-through clothing\n\nAh, the Grammys. Music’s biggest night. The epitome of class, grace, elegance and – oh my, what is Kanye West’s wife doing?\n\nThat was basically our reaction when West – er, excuse me, “Ye,” – walked onto the Grammys red carpet with his wife Bianca Censori. As if their mere presence wasn’t enough of a shock, in videos circulating on social media, Censori dropped her black coat in front of photographers to pose in… literally nothing. Yep, she was in some kind of tight, see-through ensemble that basically exposed, well, everything. I can only imagine the irate conversations happening among Recording Academy producers right now.\n\nIf the shocking moment bodes anything for the main show tonight, we better buckle up for whatever the rest of the evening might hold.\n\nGrammys 2025 red carpet live updates: Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Ye and more\n\nThe Beatles are still winning Grammys in 2025\n\nThe Beatles can't stop and won't be stopped. The 2023 \"new\" song from one of the most popular bands of all time, \"Now and Then,\" managed a win for best rock performance. The late John Lennon's son Sean happened to be in the crowd (he won for another category), and was beyond excited to accept for his dad's band. \"Play The Beatles for your kids,\" he implored the audience. He doesn't have much to worry about: kids love the Beatles, \"yeah yeah yeah.\" A few categories later the Beatles' contemporaries, The Rolling Stones, won best rock album for \"Hackney Diamonds.\" A good day for classic rock.\n\nJimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy for audiobook narration\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter, who died December 29, won a Grammy award for his audiobook \"Last Sundays In Plains: A Centennial Celebration.\" His grandson Jason accepted the award: \"I believe it means so much at this moment in our country and in our history,\" he said, thanking the world for the outpouring of support his family has received since the former president died at age 100. It's Carter's fourth Grammy win.\n\nKendrick Lamar and 'Not Like Us' win three Grammys a week before Super Bowl halftime performance\n\nIs Drake following along at home? Because what may be the next entry in the long-running feud between rappers Drake and Lamar occurred at the Grammys' early awards when Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" won best rap performance, best rap song and best music video. The two artists have traded allegations and insults in diss tracks, part of a very public escalation in hostility between two high-profile hip hop artists that culminated with Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" becoming a hit last May and a federal lawsuit about the song filed this month by Drake. The song includes Lamar calling Drake a \"certified pedophile\" and the accompanying artwork for the track contained an aerial view of Drake's mansion outside of Toronto, with red sex offender symbols placed on the home. More escalation could follow at Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 when Lamar performs, presumably including \"Not Like Us\" on his set list, in front of tens of millions watching the halftime performance.\n\nBeyoncé and 'Cowboy Carter' nab a country Grammy\n\nThat’s Grammy-award winning country artist Beyoncé to you! The mega superstar won her first Grammy of the night for best country duo/group performance with Cyrus for their duet \"II MOST WANTED.\" But Bey lost out on best country solo performance to Chris Stapleton and best country song to Kacey Musgraves. Musgraves was the rare A-lister to show up to the pre-show to accept her trophy in person. “There’s so much darkness in the world right now, and it feels so good to be able to fight that darkness through song,\" she said.\n\nCharli XCX gets first ever Grammy by going 'BRAT'\n\n'BRAT' summer may be over, but that doesn't mean Charli XCX is slowing down. The electronica artist and lime-green fashion influencer won her first Grammy for best pop dance recording for her song \"Von Dutch,\" and then won her second Grammy soon after for best dance/electronic music album for her viral 2025 album 'BRAT.' The album also won later in the ceremony for best recording package. Very cool, very brat.\n\nSabrina Carpenter wins first Grammy of the night with 'Espresso'\n\nA sign of things to come? Carpenter won the first Grammy award of 2025 for best pop solo performance for her smash summer anthem \"Espresso,\" but the \"Short N' Sweet\" performer wasn't there to grab her trophy. She also won best remixed recording alongside Mark Ronson and FNZ for “Espresso (Mark Ronson x FNZ Working Late Remix).” We'll see her later at the televised ceremony, and maybe with a few more wins? She is also nominated for the big four categories: song of the year, record of the year, album of the year and best new artist.\n\nDEI may be out with Trump, but it's very much in at the Grammys\n\n\"This is going to get political, but I promise you I will bring you nothing but joy,\" said Grammy nominee Justin Tranter, a songwriter nominated for song of the year for his work on Roan's \"Good Luck, Babe!\" The musician, who has penned tunes for Britney Spears and Grande among many others, helped kick off the ceremony with opening remarks that directly referred to President Trump's policies and executive orders that have affected people of color and members of the LGTBTQ community. His mention of the Recording Academy's \"diversity equity and inclusion team\" (which provided ASL interpreters for the ceremony) got a big round of applause from the audience. His passionate speech came after Tammy Hurt, chair of the Recording Academy's board of trustees, similarly celebrated Grammy diversity, calling out her own queer identity to great applause.\n\nEarly Grammy Awards kick off with touching tribute to LA amid wildfire crisis\n\nA bevy of talented Grammy nominees including Wayne Brady (here for his nominated musical theater album, \"The Wiz\"), sang a heartfelt arrangement of Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" while images of the devastated city of Los Angeles flashed on the screen behind them. The powerful performance also included Angélique Kidjo (nominated for global music performance), Scott Hoying (nominated for arrangement, instrumental or classic), Deborah Cox (nominated for musical theater album), Taj Mahal (nominated for American roots performance and blues album) and Yolanda Adams (nominated for gospel performance/song). Getting the also-talented audience involved, there was plenty to dance about even before a single award had been given out.\n\nContributing: Mark Giannotto, Anika Reed, KiMi Robinson, Jay Stahl", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/05/26/rod-stewart-lifetime-achievement-award-amas/83870547007/", "title": "Rod Stewart wins Lifetime Achievement Award at AMAs, performs", "text": "Rod Stewart is taking home some serious hardware from this year's American Music Awards.\n\nStewart's adult children presented the \"Da Ya Think I’m Sexy\" singer with the Lifetime Achievement Award, calling him by their affectionate nickname \"Papa Stew.\" The singer said he was \"flabbergasted\" to see five of his eight children together onstage.\n\nStewart then took to the stage to perform \"Forever Young\" accompanied by tapping backup dancers and Irish-step-dancing violinists.

But over the past few years, the number of movies and television shows with a strong Indigenous presence both in front of and behind the camera has been rapidly growing. And Native creatives based in or hailing from Oklahoma are playing key roles in many of the hot new titles.\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed shows out now follows four Native teenagers in rural Oklahoma, while the most popular title ever on one major streaming service is a long-running film franchise's latest installment, which features an Indigenous heroine.\n\nHere are four current or recent TV series and four recent films that you can stream now that are made largely by and about Indigenous people — and three more you can look for coming soon:\n\nTelevision shows\n\n'Reservation Dogs'\n\nWhere to see it:Hulu.\n\nFilmed primarily in Oklahoma, the FX Networks hit debuted in 2021 to almost universal acclaim and premiered its sophomore season last year to more high praise. It has blazed trails as the first mainstream TV show on which every writer, director and series regular performer is Indigenous.\n\nCo-created and executive produced by Oscar-winning New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi (\"Thor: Love and Thunder\"), who is of Maori ancestry, and Tulsa-based moviemaker Sterlin Harjo (\"Barking Water\"), who is Seminole and Muscogee, the bawdy and uproarious coming-of-age comedy focuses on four present-day Native teenagers who set out to escape their rural Oklahoma home for sunny California.\n\nIn June, Harjo announced that the third and current season will be the last for the Peabody Award-winning show.\n\n\"As we continued to break stories and write scripts this season, it became clear to the producers, Taika and me that the season three finale is the perfect SERIES finale,” Harjo posted June 29 on Instagram.\n\nSeason 3 of \"Reservation Dogs\" ran 10 episodes, and the series finale bowed Sept. 27.\n\n'Dark Winds'\n\nWhere to see it:AMC+.\n\nThe long-awaited big-budget series based on Oklahoma-born and bred novelist Tony Hillerman's best-selling mystery novels about fictional Navajo detectives Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee debuted in summer 2022. The series was created by Chickasaw Nation citizen and Ardmore native Graham Roland.\n\nWith Cheyenne-Arapaho filmmaker Chris Eyre (best known for the groundbreaking 1998 indie film \"Smoke Signals\") directing many of its episodes, the series counts film icon Robert Redford and \"Game of Thrones\" mastermind George R.R. Martin among its executive producers, along with Roland.\n\nSet in the 1970s, the series stars Lakota actor Zahn McClarnon (\"Reservation Dogs\") as Leaphorn and Hualapai actor Kiowa Gordon (\"The Twilight Saga\") as Chee. The six-episode first season made a powerful enough impression that the show was quickly renewed for a second.\n\n\"Dark Winds\" Season 2, which also includes six episodes, premiered July 30 on AMC, with the finale airing on Sept. 3.\n\nVariety reports that the series more than doubled its Season 1 viewership on AMC+ with the first two episodes of its sophomore season, and the show recently gained a celebrity fan in Oscar-winning filmmaker and Duncan native Ron Howard, who took to the social media site formerly known as Twitter to praise \"Dark Winds\" as \"Powerful, suspenseful. So well made I’m hooked.\"\n\nIn mid-September, AMC and AMC+ announced that \"Dark Winds\" has been renewed for a third season, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n'Rutherford Falls'\n\nWhere to see it:Peacock.\n\nWith a Navajo co-creator and executive producer in Sierra Teller Ornelas and several Native writers, this sitcom rolled out its second season in summer 2022.\n\nSadly, Variety reported in September 2022 that the groundbreaking comedy has been canceled, but it can still be streamed on Peacock.\n\nThe show centers on the lifelong friendship between Nathan Rutherford (Ed Helms, \"The Office\"), a descendant of the titular town's white founding family, and Reagan Wells (Jana Schmieding, who is Cheyenne River Lakota Sioux and now has a hilarious recurring role on \"Reservation Dogs\"), the head of the cultural center for the fictional Minishonka Nation.\n\n'Mohawk Girls'\n\nWhere to see it:Peacock.\n\nIn fall 2021, Peacock started streaming Canadian Mohawk filmmaker Tracey Deer's acclaimed comedy series — which the show's creator has described as \"'Sex and the City' for the Native set\" — bringing the title to U.S. audiences for the first time.\n\nFilms\n\n'Prey'\n\nWhere to see it:Hulu.\n\nThe latest installment in the long-running \"Predator\" sci-fi film franchise is set in the Northern Great Plains of the Comanche Nation in 1719. Filmed in the Stoney Nakoda Nation near Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with a largely Indigenous cast, the prequel pits one of the now-iconic alien trophy hunters against Naru (Amber Midthunder, \"The Ice Road\"), a Comanche woman determined to prove herself as a warrior.\n\nDirector Dan Trachtenberg (“10 Cloverfield Lane”) worked closely on the creature feature with producer Jhane Myers, a Comanche and Blackfeet artist, dancer and filmmaker who hails from Oklahoma. There's even a version of the film fully dubbed in Comanche — a first for a new movie release in a Native language — available on Hulu.\n\nSoon after the movie premiered in July 2022, 20th Century Studios revealed that the action-thriller, which earned strong reviews, scored the biggest premiere on the Disney-owned streamer to date, topping all film and TV series debuts. Based on hours watched in the first three days of its release, \"Prey\" also marked the most-watched film premiere on Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ under the Star Banner in all other territories, according to a news release.\n\nDisney and Trachtenberg recently confirmed that \"Prey\" is the rare streaming-only movie to get a physical media release.

When Yellow Bird learned three years later that a young, white oil worker had disappeared from his reservation worksite, she became concerned.\n\nThe book (and presumably the intended series) chronicles her obsessive search for clues, which takes her on two divergent paths: to her own tribe, altered by oil-boom wealth, and to the non-Native, down-on-their-luck oilmen, including many who traveled hundreds of miles to find work toward the end of the Great Recession.\n\nYellow Bird will be among the executive producers of the show, according to Deadline.

Now she's got the lead role as a fearless judge in a new CBS drama, \"All Rise,\" that premieres at 9 p.m. Monday (right after the new Detroit-set sitcom \"Bob Hearts Abishola\").\n\nHere are five things you need to know about Missick, who may not have saved the world in real life, but who's giving strong performances that just might inspire someone who will.\n\n1. She's an activist judge in 'All Rise'\n\nMissick plays Judge Lola Carmichael in the hour-long drama costarring Marg Helgenberger (CBS's \"CSI\") and Wilson Bethel (HBO's \"Generation Kill\"). A former deputy district attorney, Lola is new to her job — and willing to stretch the envelope of what judges are supposed to do. The story lines will draw inspiration from real-life cases, much like NBC's \"Law & Order\" franchise. We're betting her character will be a lower-court version of women judicial heroes like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Notorious LC, anyone?\n\n2. She surprised her family by choosing acting\n\nThe 1999 Renaissance High School graduate told the Free Press three years ago that she always wanted to act, but didn't really pursue it as a young person. Said Missick, \"I did a little bit of theater when I was in high school outside of my high school. I was focused more on sports and playing the violin. It was not really clear to me how I was going to follow this dream and goal I had that I hadn’t shared with anyone in my family. They all thought I was going to (Howard University) to be the next Cokie Roberts.\"\n\n3. She rocked as Misty Knight\n\nMissick made a big impression as Misty while co-starring with Mike Colter on \"Luke Cage.\" She appeared as the same character on \"Iron Fist\" and \"The Defenders,\" two other shows that were part of Netflix's Marvel-verse. She was set to return for a third season of \"Luke Cage\" and thought to be moving toward a spin-off show, \"Daughters of the Dragon,\" starring her and Jessica Henwick, who played Colleen Wing on \"Iron Fist.\" But then Netflix canceled the Marvel franchise, leaving fans to contemplate what might have been.\n\n4. The critics seem to like 'All Rise'\n\nVariety said the show \"indulges the basics of the genre and finds some refreshing ways to twist them into slightly new, more intriguing shapes. Between its cast, subject matter, and many charming friendships, it almost feels like 'All Rise' accidentally wandered onto CBS’ schedule on its way to ABC’s Shonda Rhimes-driven TGIT lineup.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also came away with a favorable impression. \"What the show turns out to be, judging by the first installment anyway, is a better-than-average light drama, sans stridency, with a strong cast and considerable potential for exploring themes of substance ...,\" noted its review.\n\n5. Missick has something in common with Lola\n\nApparently, Missick takes on the role of adjudicator in her own family. \"I am the level-headed person in my family and with my husband, I am the first one to say 'sorry' in order to get the ball rolling and the conversation can get to the heart of the matter,\" Missick told the Chicago Tribune. \"This is the perfect role for me because Lola is the kind of person I aspire to be.\"\n\nWatch All Rise: First Look At All Rise On CBS - Full show on CBS All Access\n\n'All Rise'\n\n9 p.m. Mondays\n\nCBS\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/04/16/last-of-us-season-2-episodes/83130996007/", "title": "'The Last of Us': See the full Season 2 episode schedule", "text": "\"The Last of Us\" returned with a killer Season 2 premiere that proved that future episodes will not be pulling back any punches.\n\nHBO's Emmy-winning zombie sci-fi drama, which debuted in 2023, depicts a world where the mind-controlling parasitic fungi Cordyceps have taken over the human race and reshaped society at large.\n\nThe first episode of Season 2 threw fans five years ahead of the events of the first season. The episode shows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie's (Bella Ramsey) somewhat normal lives while living in the safe haven of Jackson, Wyoming.

HBO Max combines films and original TV shows, including Emmy-nominated \"Hacks,\" with the entire library of HBO and many series from its corporate siblings such as TNT, TBS and CNN. So you'll find \"Friends\" and also series like \"Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,\" \"The Sopranos,\" \"Sex and the City\" and new \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons. This summer HBO and HBO Max's biggest and most anticipated new show debuted: \"House of the Dragon,\" a prequel series spun-off from \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nAlthough its archive of TV is deep and exciting, there are plenty of duds mixed in with critically acclaimed and Emmy-winning series. We've picked the 50 best series to watch in December 2022, from reality to documentary, to children's shows to dark dramas (listed in alphabetical order).\n\n1. “Angels in America”\n\nHBO’s 2003 adaptation of Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, an allegorical examination of the AIDS crisis and LGBTQ life in the 1980s, is absolutely mesmerizing. Its outstanding cast, including Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson, Mary-Louise Parker, Emma Thompson and Jeffrey Wright, makes it an absolute classic.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n2. “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown”\n\nThe travel and food show was always a thoughtful exploration of culture and cuisine, and its 12 seasons, which originally ran on CNN, became even more poignant and touching after the death of chef Bourdain in 2018.\n\n3. “The Bachelor” franchise\n\nIf the bachelors and bachelorettes of ABC's long-running reality dating franchise can find love in a hopeless place (like in front of millions of TV viewers), then there's hope for the rest of us, too.\n\n4. “Band of Brothers” and ”The Pacific”\n\nCreated by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, these two World War II-set miniseries are exquisite. Like Spielberg’s lauded “Saving Private Ryan,” the HBO series capture the epic scale of war but are measured and realistic in the costs and sacrifices of soldiers and bystanders.\n\n5. “Barry”\n\nIn HBO’s black comedy as dark as Batman’s cape, Bill Hader plays a depressed hitman who finds new purpose taking acting classes in LA. A concept that sounds too out there to work is pulled off thanks to Hader; Henry Winkler; and Anthony Carrigan, whose dumb mobster NoHo Hank is a breath of lightness the show needs.\n\n6. “The Big Bang Theory”\n\nCBS’ hangout sitcom starring Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco was often TV's most popular show for a reason – its big, broad humor and nerdy characters are comforting and familiar.\n\n7. “A Black Lady Sketch Show”\n\nCreated by Robin Thede and produced by Issa Rae, HBO’s tiny-but-mighty sketch comedy series is knee-slappingly hilarious. Its talented Black lady comedians excel in sketches that are unique to their experiences and universal in their humor.\n\n8. “The Boondocks”\n\nWith a stunning voice cast (Regina King! John Witherspoon!) and provocative material, this Adult Swim animated series was woefully underrated when it aired from 2005-2014. But hopefully its new home on HBO Max, which streams the original seasons and has commissioned two new installments, will bring the adaptation of Aaron McGruder’s comic strip the acclaim it deserves.\n\n9. “Chernobyl”\n\nThe brilliance of HBO’s historical miniseries, which chronicles the 1986 nuclear disaster at a power plant in Soviet Ukraine, creeps up on you. “Chernobyl” is never crass or exploitative, but rather it simply, and anger-inducingly, explains the failures and hubris that led to the disaster and introduces the people who tried to mitigate its consequences.\n\n10. “Curb Your Enthusiasm”\n\nLarry David’s dry, meta comedy, in which he plays a fictionalized version of himself, is a reliable source of humor for his fans. Whenever he returns to HBO for a new season, David is ready to poke fun at his peculiarities and neurosis.\n\n11. “Deadwood”\n\nCreator David Milch’s masterpiece of a Western, which originally aired on HBO for for a criminally short three-season run in the 2000s, is one of TV’s all-time best series, and a 2019 revival movie didn't disappoint.\n\n12. “Doctor Who”\n\nWith a time machine, a screwdriver and a plucky spirit, there is no limit to where (or when) the Doctor (currently embodied by Jodie Whittaker, for a little while longer before Ncuti Gatwa takes over the role) can take you in this British sci-fi institution.\n\n13. “Doom Patrol”\n\nThe best superhero show on TV right now is this irreverent team-up show that originally streamed on DC Universe. Starring Alan Tudyk, Brendan Fraser, Timothy Dalton, Matt Bomer and more, the series steers clear of tired tropes and fake optimism for a gritty-but-not-exhausting version of superheroics.\n\n14. “Enlightened”\n\nIf you liked Laura Dern in “Big Little Lies,” you’ll love her razor-sharp, nearly unhinged role as Amy Jellicoe in this two-season HBO series from creator Mike White. A cringe dramedy that never goes too far (but gets very, very close), the smart series sees Dern turn in one of her best performances.\n\n15. \"The Flight Attendant\"\n\nPenny no more, Kaley Cuoco shows off her comedic and dramatic chops in \"Flight Attendant,\" a juicy melodrama that mixes dark comedy, murder mystery and an emotional story about addiction. Cuoco plays a flight attendant and barely functioning alcoholic who gets wrapped up in a murder case after a wild night in Thailand with a dashing passenger. Cuoco's sharp performance makes the series coalesce into something pulpy, compelling and fun.\n\n16. “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”\n\nWhile a dramatic reboot of Will Smith’s seminal NBC comedy has arrived on streaming service Peacock, HBO Max has the original six seasons of the sitcom about a teen (Smith) from West Philadelphia (born and raised) who moves in with his rich relatives in California.\n\n17. “Friends”\n\nMore than two decades after it premiered, \"Friends\" remains a cultural institution and reliable source of delight and laughs. Its long afterlife in cable reruns and streaming (it was on Netflix for years before it moved to its new HBO Max home) has introduced it to new generations. It may be a cliché, but it is nice to spend some time with our \"Friends.\"\n\n18. “Game of Thrones”\n\nAt any moment during its eight seasons and 73 episodes, “Game of Thrones” could be the best or worst series on TV, but when it was at its peak, there was nothing else like it. A full exploration of this complex series reveals impeccable acting, gorgeous costuming and an expansion of our collective ideas about what TV can achieve. A prequel series, \"House of the Dragon,\" about the Targaryen family hundreds of years before the events of \"Thrones,\" premieres August 21.\n\n19. \"The Gilded Age\"\n\nCo-created by Julian Fellowes (\"Downton Abbey\"), this period drama follows a young woman as she navigates the aristocratic world of her wealthy aunts in the wake of her father's death. The clashes between tradition and coming-of-age revelations both electrify and enthrall. The series features riveting performances from Emmy winner Christine Baranski and \"Sex and the City\" alum Cynthia Nixon.\n\n20.\"Hacks\"\n\nIn this darkly funny comedy, Jean Smart gets the star turn she’s long deserved (and she won an Emmy for it). As Deb Vance, a Joan Rivers-type comedian with a Las Vegas residency and a QVC empire, Smart is in her element and at her best, a prickly diva with hidden depths. When Deb’s gig is threatened, she is forced to take on Ava (Hannah Einbinder, a revelation), a young, self-centered comedy writer who is forced to work with Deb after a dumb tweet leaves her jobless.\n\n21. “Harley Quinn”\n\nKaley Cuoco gives voice to this animated version of the DC Comics villain (and sometimes anti-hero) that Margot Robbie brought to life on the big screen. As wonderful as Robbie’s performance is, the DC Universe series is a smarter, slicker more dynamic portrait of wicked Harley, with superb scripts and an excellent supporting voice cast, including Alan Tudyk and Christopher Meloni. Season 3 of the deliciously dark comedy premieres July 28.\n\n22. \"Happy Endings\"\n\nOneOf the many \"Friends\"-like hangout sitcoms to emerge over the past two decades, ABC's \"Endings\" is on the quirkier (but far funnier) side, following five thirtysomethings in Chicago.\n\n23. “I May Destroy You”\n\nBritish actor and writer Michaela Coel broke out in the U.S. with her beloved Netflix comedy “Chewing Gum,” but “I May Destroy You” is where she truly triumphs. A vital examination of sexual assault and consent in the modern world, Cole’s performance is heartbreaking and vivid.\n\n24. “Insecure”\n\nIssa Rae crafts a distinctly millennial and hilarious series in this HBO comedy about a Black woman in Los Angeles who, as she approaches 30, begins to question her life decisions, including her long-term boyfriend.\n\n25. \"It's A Sin\"\n\nHBO Max's British import miniseries, about a group of young gay friends at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, is a masterpiece. Beautiful, funny, profound and heartbreaking, the series tells the stories of found families, lives cut short and the deadly consequences of homophobia.\n\n26. “Leaving Neverland”\n\nAmong the many true-crime documentaries of late about sexual assault allegations, this one – about two men who accused Michael Jackson of sexual abuse when they were children – stood out. Wade Robson and James Safechuck were given a platform on HBO to tell their harrowing stories, and director Dan Reed is unflinching as he captures the pain and suffering of the men and their families. Tough to watch, it's also an eye-opening look at the lasting effects of abuse and the way the media handles allegations against powerful men.\n\n27. “The Leftovers”\n\nEven if the tone of HBO’s overwhelmingly somber series isn’t your style, it’s hard to ignore the level of artistry delivered over three seasons from co-creators Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta. Two percent of the earth’s population disappears without an explanation, but the story is not in the mystery but in the aftermath, the broken people forced to keep living in a world that doesn’t make any sense.\n\n28. \"Mare of Easttown\"\n\nKate Winslet could pass for a suburban Philly native in this crime miniseries from HBO. The Oscar winner plays a small-town detective trying to solve the murder of one young girl and the disappearance of another, while battling her own personal trauma and family problems. The series is surprisingly compelling, a character drama piece in cop-show clothing.\n\n29. \"The Middle\"\n\nDuring its 2009-2018 run, this ABC comedy starring Patricia Heaton, Neil Flynn and national treasure Eden Sher was woefully underrated, outshined by its buzzier and flashier family sitcom cousins on the network. But now you can stream all nine seasons and revel in the hilarious averageness (they're very middle of the road, you might say) of Indiana's Heck family.\n\n30. “Mr. Show with Bob and David”\n\nBob Odenkirk and David Cross are delightful, hilarious and unhinged in their 1995-1998 HBO sketch comedy series, considered to be one of the best sketch comedies of all time.\n\n31. \"The Nanny\"\n\nOne of the few great 1990s sitcoms that hasn't streamed in the past few years, CBS' \"The Nanny\" is finally available to be binge-watched in all its glory. Fran Drescher's inimitable performance as the eponymous childcare provider – the voice! the clothes! the hair! – and the slow burn of her relationship with boss Max Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy) added up to a sweet, boisterous comedy.\n\n32. “The Office (UK)”\n\nBefore Steve Carell made us cringe as Michael Scott, Ricky Gervais played the somehow-even-more-cringeworthy David Brent, king of his own little office, in the U.K. version of the series he co-created.\n\n33. \"Our Flag Means Death\"\n\nJocular, joyous and jolly (roger), this pirate romcom from Taika Waititi and David Jenkins is an absolutely lovely surprise. The series follows the hapless “gentleman pirate” Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) as he fumbles his way through third-rate swashbuckling and eventually catches the eye of the legendary Blackbeard (Waititi). Full of guest roles from great comedians, including Leslie Jones, Fred Armisen and Will Arnett, “Our Flag” mixes romance and farce with ease.\n\n34. “The Plot Against America”\n\nAn alternate history drama with dire warnings about modern culture, “Plot,” based on Philip Roth’s 2004 novel, tracks what would have happened in the U.S. if Franklin Roosevelt had lost the 1940 presidential election to Charles Lindbergh. Adapted by “The Wire” creator David Simon, “Plot” evocatively brings a scary could-have-been to life.\n\n35. “Pride and Prejudice”\n\nThere’s no Mr. Darcy quite like Colin Firth. This miniseries adaptation of Jane Austen’s celebrated novel, which originally aired on PBS in the U.S., is the definitive take on “Pride and Prejudice,” thanks to Firth’s performance and its faithful, but not restricted, translation of the story from page to screen.\n\n36. “Robot Chicken”\n\nStop-motion and distinctly adult humor make this Adult Swim series, created by Seth Green, one of the network’s biggest successes, gaining the show celebrity guest stars, six Emmys and counting in Cartoon Network’s mature programming block.\n\n37. “Samurai Jack”\n\nAnother Cartoon Network series with plenty for adults to enjoy, “Samurai” is fun, gripping, visually daring and has a loyal cult fan base.\n\n38. “Sesame Street”\n\nA 52-year institution for a reason, there is no children’s show quite like “Sesame Street,” which has both old PBS episodes and new HBO installments available to stream.\n\n39. “Search Party”\n\nThis surreal comedy (which originally aired on TBS but jumped to HBO Max) is both relatable and infinitely absurd. A group of twenty20-somethings, led by Alia Shawkat (“Arrested Development”), gets over involved in the disappearance of a former classmate, leading to hilarious, horrifying and morbid discoveries.\n\n40. “Sex and the City”\n\nAlthough it may be a bit dated, “Sex and the City” remains a classic sitcom, both for the magnetism and performances of its four leads: Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Samantha (Kim Cattrall) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis). Dating in New York now means more apps and fewer cosmopolitans, but “Sex” still captures the uncertainty of putting yourself out there, looking for love and affection. Recent revival \"And Just Like That,\" which reunites Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte, but not Cattrall's Samantha, is not tops on our list.\n\n41. “The Sopranos”\n\nHBO’s New Jersey mobster drama that launched a thousand antihero knockoffs still has punch (pun intended) two decades after its debut.\n\n42. “South Park”\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone’s adult animated series may not, in current episodes on Comedy Central, have quite the same bite it did in its heyday during the mid-2000s, but it is still a generational touchstone and one-of-a-kind satire of American life.\n\n43. \"Starstruck\"\n\nThis delightful romantic comedy from New Zealand comedian Rose Matafeo follows 29-year-old Jessie (Matafeo), who's working dead-end jobs and flitting through life when she gets involved with a movie star (Nikesh Patel). Matafeo is a comedic delight, a master of both physical high jinks and witty repartee.\n\n44. \"Station Eleven\"\n\nThis post-apocalyptic drama follows the harrowing journey of the survivors of a flu pandemic, as they attempt to move forward and restore the world they knew, despite the devastation. The show's lean toward sci-fi takes it beyond your run-of-the-mill medical drama, and its earnest optimism offers a poignant allegory for our modern times.\n\n45. “True Detective”\n\nIf you ignore the subpar second season, HBO’s crime anthology series has two compelling mysteries and two superb casts for your viewing pleasure. In particular, Mahershala Ali shines in Season 3 as a Black detective working in the 1980s.\n\n46. “Veep”\n\nSome of the political satire's bite faded in later seasons, as our world has become more absurd and shocking, but that doesn't dull the sharpness of star Julia Louis-Dreyfus' performance.\n\n47. “Watchmen”\n\nHBO’s very loose adaptation of the graphic novel has blossomed into one of creator Damon Lindelof’s best series, and from the man behind “Lost” and “The Leftovers,” that’s some achievement. The series has a superb cast – including Emmy-winner Regina King – that elevates smart scripts that get better as the season progresses. Lindelof and his writers find surprising ways to bring the superhero story from the 1980s into today’s culture, helping “Watchmen” upend the comic book formula once again.\n\n48. \"The West Wing\"\n\nThe simplicity of politics in Aaron Sorkin's White House drama feels almost quaint in 2022, but the rousing speeches of President Jed Bartlett (Martin Sheen) still inspire and captivate. HBO Max is also home to a \"West Wing\" special, which featured the original cast reuniting for a staged reading of a Season 3 episode to benefit get-out-the-vote efforts leading up to the 2020 presidential election.\n\n49. \"The White Lotus\"\n\n\"Enlightened\" creator Mike White won Emmys for the first season of this scathing satire of the very wealthy at an exclusive resort, and now he's back with a mostly new group of the uber-rich at an Italian White Lotus resort. This season, starring Aubrey Plaza, Theo James, Michael Imperioli, F. Murray Abraham and Jennifer Coolidge (one of two returning characters from Season 1) is set in Sicily and brings gender dynamics and sex to the forefront of the lives of its unhappy vacationers.\n\n50. “The Wire”\n\nTouted by many as the best TV show of all time, writer David Simon's meticulous crime drama is gorgeously wrought and acted by the likes of Dominic West, Idris Elba and Michael B. Jordan.\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra\n\nHave a different streaming service?

But the actor's life off-screen proved far more sinister.\n\nInvestigation Discovery's “Stephen Collins, America’s Dad,” (Monday, 9 EDT/PDT and streaming on Max) revisits the bombshell revelations, first aired in 2014, that Collins, now 77, had exposed himself to three young girls. The episode is the first of a six-part ID docuseries, “Hollywood Demons,” which also delves into celebrity stalkers and the difficulties plaguing child stars and cast members of Bravo’s “Real Housewives” franchise.\n\nThe Collins installment includes interviews with “7th Heaven” actors Jeremy London and Kyle Searles; April Price, a survivor of Collins’ abuse; and Dr. Drew Pinsky, who provides analysis. Producers say they contacted more than 100 associates of Collins, but nearly all declined to participate or didn’t respond.\n\nHere are the most shocking moments from the documentary:\n\nApril Price: ‘This is bad. This is really bad’\n\nPrice, then 13, spent the summer of 1983 in Los Angeles with her aunt, a neighbor of Collins’. Price says Collins exposed himself to her twice, including once when he helped her set up her gaming console.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“All I know is I was supremely shocked,” Price says in the episode, “very uncomfortable and still didn’t want to insult him because he was kind to me and nice and doing me a favor.”\n\nAt the end of that summer, Collins lured Price into his apartment with memorabilia from the short-lived drama “Tales of the Gold Monkey” (Price was a fan). Once inside his apartment, Collins asked Price if it would be OK if he changed into something more comfortable. He returned completely naked, she says.\n\n“And my stomach just fell, and now I’m actually scared,” she recalls. “I’m in this man’s apartment. I’m in a bathing suit, and he’s naked. This is bad. This is really bad. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”\n\nWhen Price saw through a window that her aunt had returned home, she used it as an excuse to flee.\n\nIn 1997, Price and Collins crossed paths on a set. She says Collins apologized when the two were alone, saying, “ ’I want you to know what I did was extremely wrong. I feel terrible about it. Please forgive me,’” Price remembers. At the time she viewed it as an earnest atonement, but today she sees it as damage control.\n\nStephen Collins’ therapy tapes leaked\n\nCollins and his then-wife, Faye Grant, discussed his pattern of abusing young girls in a 2012 therapy session, which Grant recorded without Collins’ knowledge. In the tapes, which TMZ obtained in 2014, Collins spoke about exposing himself repeatedly to one girl, beginning in 1973 when she was 10. He also admitted to forcing the young girl to touch him. Collins also mentioned Price and a third girl, whom he abused in 1994, who was a babysitter for his children.\n\nJeremy London's reaction: ‘Stephen Collins would be a dead man if that was my child’\n\nLondon, who portrayed minister Chandler Hampton from 2002-04, initially calls Collins “not only one of the finest actors but one of the finest human beings in Hollywood.” But once he learns that Collins admitted on tape to inappropriate encounters with three girls, his stance changes.\n\n“I’m a dad, first and foremost, above everything else,” London, 52, says. “And so my first thoughts always go to the children. Stephen Collins would be a dead man if that was my child.”\n\nCollins has faced no criminal or civil charges stemming from these events. Statutes of limitations have passed for Price and the girl abused in 1973. The girl Collins exposed himself to in 1994 has not identified herself publicly.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/20"}]}

How much does one cost to make?", "text": "President Donald Trump said Sunday that he would order the Treasury Department to stop minting pennies as a budget-cutting measure.

This is so wasteful!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media service. “I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.”\n\nThe familiar Abraham Lincoln penny cost about 3.7 cents to produce in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's annual report. A nickel cost about 13.8 cents to make.\n\nHow much does it cost to make pennies and nickels?\n\nPennies were among the first coins introduced by the U.S. Mint, a bureau of the Treasury Department, more than 230 years ago.\n\nThe cost of making both coins has increased over the past two decades. Some of that is attributed to the rise in raw material prices of copper, nickel and zinc.\n\nHigher metal prices result in higher production costs. If production costs get too high, the seigniorage – the difference between a coin’s face value and the cost of putting it into circulation – make the coin worth less than what it costs to make it.\n\nHow many pennies are made every year?\n\nAbout 3.2 billion pennies were manufactured in fiscal year 2024, a decrease from fiscal year 2023. The cost to produce and distribute a single penny, however, rose 20% from the same period.\n\nAbout 114 billion pennies are in in circulation, or $1.14 billion, according to the Federal Reserve, which buys coins from the Mint and rations them to banks and other institutions.\n\nThough coins remain in circulation unless damaged, many are accidentally lost or discarded. Inventories dropped significantly in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Fed asked the Mint to increase supply, according to the Cato Institute.\n\nCan Trump halt penny production?\n\nIt is unclear whether the president alone has the authority to stop minting the penny, USA TODAY reported.\n\nThough Trump appointed Scott Bessent to head the Treasury Department, the U.S. Mint receives congressional approval for every coin it manufactures, according to its website.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post followed a similar one by the newly established Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in a post on X on Jan. 21, USA TODAY said. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who heads DOGE, has criticized the government for its spending on pennies.\n\nSome politicians and economists have advocated discontinuing the penny. President Barack Obama said in an interview in 2013 that the penny is a “good metaphor” for problems facing lawmakers, ABC News reported.\n\nCanada, Great Britain, Australia, Israel, Brazil, Norway, Finland and New Zealand are among nations that have either ceased to produce or have removed low-denomination coins, Reuters reported. Canada discontinued its penny in 2012, and financial transactions were rounded up or down to the nearest five cents.\n\nCONTRIBUTING Minnah Arshad, Kinsey Crowley and Fernando Cervantes Jr.\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Reuters; U.S. Mint; Department of the Treasury; coinnews.net", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/09/trump-announces-plan-stop-producing-pennies/78378996007/", "title": "Trump announces plan to stop producing pennies", "text": "President Trump announced Sunday that he is telling the Treasury Department to stop minting pennies, ending a 233-year run of the 1-cent coin.\n\nThe penny, one of the first coins made by the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more than two cents to produce, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social site shortly after departing the Super Bowl game in New Orleans.\n\n“For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!” Trump wrote. “I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.”\n\nThe penny has been in the crosshairs of Trump officials since he took office. Last month, DOGE, the department run by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, said that producing 4.5 billion pennies in Fiscal Year 2023 cost taxpayers more than $179 million.\n\nThat works out to over 3 cents per penny. Trump's latest 2-cent cost estimate gives the penny a break, but not enough to keep it from being axed from the mint's production.\n\n“Let’s rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it’s a penny at a time,” Trump wrote.\n\nFor the 2024 fiscal year, the annual U.S. Mint report said that it takes about 3.7 cents to produce and distribute one penny, a 20% increase from the previous year. The increase has been partly driven by the rising costs of metals like zinc and copper, according to the report.\n\nRising production costs have spurred other countries to eliminate small denomination coins.

That followed an assertion by Elon Musk of the Department of Government Efficiency that halting production might save the government around $180 million annually.\n\nHere’s a bit more on what might transpire:\n\nWhat did Trump say about pennies?\n\nTrump called the coins “wasteful” in that they cost more to produce than they’re worth, in terms of their face values. He ordered the Treasury Department and the U.S. Mint to stop producing the coins. Trump said pennies “cost us more than 2 cents” to produce. Actually, each penny or Lincoln one-cent piece cost roughly 3.7 cents including overhead costs to make in fiscal 2024, the Mint reported.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHow many pennies does the US produce?\n\nLast year, the Mint churned out 5.61 billion general-circulation coins, of which 3.23 billion were pennies. But coin production has been dropping sharply anyway, from around 15 billion coins produced annually as recent as four or five years ago. That reflects the rise of other forms of payment ‒ credit and debit cards along with PayPal, Zelle, Venmo and other such services, with the use of paper checks also waning. Pennies were the most common coins produced by the Mint last year, followed, in order, by quarters, dimes, nickels and then half dollars.\n\nDo other US coins cost more to make than they're worth?\n\nNickels do, as each one costs almost 13.8 cents, according to the Mint. The other coins are worth more than their production expenses. Dimes cost about 5.8 cents, quarters cost 14.7 cents and half dollars cost about 34 cents, according to the Mint.\n\nPennies and nickels have incurred production costs that exceed their face values for 19 straight years.\n\nWill pennies disappear from circulation?\n\nProbably not, at least not anytime soon. There are billions already in circulation, and Trump’s order pertains to new production, not use. But it’s likely that consumers gradually will stop carrying them and merchants could stop accepting them.\n\nIf the penny is uneconomical, why do we keep producing it?\n\nThe penny debate has arisen before, and skeptics have worried that businesses would tend to “round up” their prices to the closest nickel if the penny was eliminated, worsening inflation. That remains a possibility, and lower-income consumers could be hurt a bit more if that happens. However, the research is inconclusive, with rounding down also a possibility. Besides, there’s also a benefit for consumers of not having to carry around so much spare change.\n\nHave other nations stopped making their lowest-denomination coins?\n\nYes. Several countries have stopped minting these coins including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, Hungary and New Zealand.\n\nIs copper the primary metal used in pennies?\n\nActually, no. The typical penny is around 97.5% zinc and only 2.5% copper. Since 1982, copper-plated pennies have been made primarily from zinc.\n\nIronically, the other mainstream coins are primarily made from copper, with roughly 75% content for nickels and more than 90% for dimes, quarters and half dollars.\n\nWould major copper-producing areas be hurt by an end to penny production?\n\nNot by much. The metal has a bright future with rising demand, especially reflecting how well it conducts electricity, said Freeport-McMoran, the nation’s largest producer of the metal. Copper increasingly is used in electric vehicles, power generation and other areas. The typical car contains more than 50 pounds of copper and the average home, about 400 pounds, according to a Freeport-McMoRan publication.\n\n“Copper’s role in the global economy is increasingly important,” said company Chairman Richard Adkerson and CEO Kathleen Quirk in a recent statement.\n\nThe Phoenix-based corporation produced 4.2 billion pounds of copper in 2024, along with gold and other metals. Freeport earned a profit of $6.9 billion last year on $25.5 billion in revenue. Along with mining activity in Arizona and other states, it has major operations in Indonesia, Chile and Peru.\n\nReach the writer at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/05/25/what-to-do-with-the-penny-now-that-its-no-longer-made-check-your-change/83851961007/", "title": "What to do with the penny now that it's no longer made. Check your ...", "text": "Learn to love your coins.\n\nThat’s the message from Kevin McColly, CEO of Coinstar, the company behind those coin-cashing machines you see in supermarkets.\n\nAmerican consumers made only 16% of their payments in cash in 2023, according to the Federal Reserve. A 2022 Pew survey found that two-fifths of consumers never use cash at all.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered the Treasury to stop minting pennies because their production cost exceeds their value. (Intriguingly, the same is true of nickels.)\n\nMany Americans regard both nickels and pennies as more nuisance than currency. The typical household is sitting on $60 to $90 in neglected coins, enough to fill one or two pint-size beer mugs, according to the Federal Reserve. Americans throw away millions of dollars in coins every year, literally treating them like trash.\n\nWhy do we treat coins like trash? McColly thinks we should change the way we think about coins.\n\nTo state the obvious, coins are worth money. Coinstar converts $3 billion in coins into spendable cash every year, one coin jar at a time. The average jar yields $58 in buying power.\n\nMost of us don’t realize how much our coins are worth. Thus, a trip to a coin-exchange kiosk (or a bank, or credit union) can yield a pleasant surprise.\n\n“People underestimate the value of their jar by about half,” McColly said. “It’s a wonderfully pleasurable experience. People have this sensation of found money.”\n\nCertain groups of Americans – lower-income households, and those over 55 – still use plenty of cash, the Fed found, along with people who prefer to shop in person.\n\nCoins aren't clutter, they're currency\n\nAs for the rest of us, McColly thinks it is time for a paradigm shift. Don’t think of your coins as clutter. Think of them as recyclables.\n\n“They’re metal,” he said, in case we needed a reminder. “And they have a long and useful life.”\n\nThe Treasury still mints more than 5 billion coins a year, although the figure is dropping, according to the journal CoinNews.\n\n“Those are just natural resources coming out of the Earth,” McColly said: Copper-plated zinc for pennies, copper-nickel alloys for nickels, dimes and quarters.\n\nHis point: If Americans got serious about gathering up their idle coins and “recycling” them into the monetary system, the Mint wouldn’t have to make so many new ones.\n\nGranted, McColly has a vested interest. His company collects a small cut of the coins that consumers deposit.\n\n“You can go to your own bank or credit union and not pay any fee,” said Kimberly Palmer, personal finance expert at NerdWallet. Both NerdWallet and Bankrate offer tip sheets on exchanging coins for cash. Most banks will take an account holder's coins for free, Bankrate reports, but not all, and you may need to roll the coins yourself.\n\n“I think that a lot of people probably do have hidden coins stashed around their home, and it can be worth their time to go and collect them,” Palmer said.\n\nMcColly notes that Coinstar generally waives its fee if the depositor chooses to trade in coins for a retail gift card, rather than cash.\n\nHe is not alone in forecasting a future for the penny, the nickel, and their more profitable kin.\n\n“We’ve been much slower than parts of Europe and Asia to adopt mobile payments and contactless credit cards,” said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate.\n\nThe pandemic delivered a timely reminder of how much we still rely on cash: Consumers and business owners sat on their coins amid a global shutdown, seeding an actual coin shortage.\n\n“It kind of froze the whole system,” Rossman said.\n\nRetiring coins: Where does it end?\n\nWhile Trump has only instructed the Mint to stop making pennies, some voices have urged America to stop using them.\n\nThe Common Cents Act, introduced on April 30 by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, would round cash transactions to the nearest five cents.\n\n“The penny is outdated and inefficient and no longer serves the needs of our economy,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat.\n\nBut the bill could push the nation down a slippery slope.\n\n“So, You Want to Get Rid of the Penny,” the New York Times mused in a recent headline. “Do You Have a Plan for the Nickel?”\n\nAs it turns out, nixing the penny creates new problems. If America rids itself of pennies, the Times reported, the nation will soon find itself flooded with nickels.\n\nThe government loses nearly three cents on every penny it mints. On a nickel, it loses nearly nine cents. More nickels would mean steeper losses.\n\nAmerica could kill both the penny and the nickel, the two money-losers on its roster of coins.\n\nBut without pennies or nickels, how would a consumer pay a 15-cent tab?\n\nYou could round every price to the nearest 10 cents, taking the Common Cents Act a step further. But then, what becomes of the quarter?\n\nAnd so on.\n\nDo you own an old penny worth as much as a million dollars?\n\nExperts say it's highly unlikely.\n\nYou may have seen one of many headlines blasted online lately about valuable pennies in circulation, \"Lincoln Wheat Penny Worth $124M You Could Have at Home\" reads one, but the reality is most pennies are worth one cent or possibly a bit more.\n\nReality does not meet the hype, according to one expert.\n\n\"There are million-dollar pennies, but there are no $100 million pennies,\" said Donn Pearlman, spokesman for the Professional Numismatists Guild (PNG), a nonprofit organization composed of many of the nation's rare coin experts. \"Only a few Lincoln cents dated 1909 to 1958 with the wheat stalks design on the back (\"wheat pennies\") have sold for $1 million or more.\"\n\nThe most valuable U.S. coin ever, a $20 gold piece, a 1933 \"Double Eagle\" coin, sold for $18.9 million at auction in 2021. The most valuable pennies, which are rare but possibly still in circulation, are 1943 copper Lincoln wheat pennies, a few of which were produced accidentally as the U.S. mints were supposed to use zinc to save copper for the World War II effort, said John Feigenbaum, publisher of rare coin price guide Greysheet.\n\nIn rare cases, some 1943 pennies have sold for $1 million, while one went for more than $200,000 at an auction in 2019.\n\nDepending on their condition, those 1943 Lincoln wheat pennies would be worth at most between $100,000 and $250,000, Feigenbaum told USA TODAY.\n\nBut the likelihood of having a near-priceless penny is similar to \"saying your lottery ticket might be worth $100,000. Of course, anything is possible, right? But not likely,\" said Feigenbaum, who is also the PNG's executive director.\n\nWhat are wheat pennies worth?\n\nSo-called \"wheat pennies\" get their name from the back of the coin having stalks of wheat encircling the \"One Cent\" text. They were produced from 1909 to 1958. After that, the wheat stalks were shorn and pennies began displaying an engraving of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nMost Lincoln wheat pennies are not super-valuable and are worth just a few cents more than one cent. However, some may escalate into the hundreds of dollars, depending on the condition and when minted. Certain vintages, especially with minting errors, may be worth thousands. You can see the NGC price guide here.\n\nBut headlines about super-valuable \"Lincoln wheat pennies\" stretch the imagination. Most likely, the headlines are created by artificial intelligence to drive traffic to a website, Feigenbaum said.\n\n\"These coins are improbably in people's change,\" he said.\n\nStill, all the online-stirred interest has resulted in \"coin shops being inundated with these folks who believe they have something rare, but they don't,\" according to Feigenbaum.\n\nIncreased interest in coins has led to overvalued coins being sold on eBay and Etsy, plus there are counterfeit Lincoln wheat pennies made in China being hawked.\n\n\"If I've seen these coins ... somebody is every now and again being taken advantage of,\" Feigenbaum said.\n\nWhat should I do if I have some pennies or other coins I think are valuable?\n\nEven though the most valuable coins are usually in collections and have very publicly been \"sold and resold,\" Feigenbaum said, sometimes people may inherit a cache of well-preserved coins or purchase some at an estate sale.\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced,\" the DOGE post said. \"Penny (or 3 cents!) for your thoughts.\"\n\nRising production costs have spurred other countries to eliminate small-denomination coins. Canada stopped making pennies in 2012, and Australia stopped circulating one- and two-cent coins back in 1992.\n\nHow much does it cost to make a penny?\n\nThe penny cost 3.69 cents to make in fiscal year 2024, according to a U.S. Mint report. It is the 19th consecutive year the unit cost of the penny and the nickel have been higher than their worth, the report said.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, the penny's unit cost increased 20.2% from the year before, the report said, and the increase has been partially driven by the rising costs of metals like zinc and copper. The costs to produce and distribute coins rose across all circulating denominations; the quarter's increase was the greatest at 26.2%.\n\nCan Trump stop minting the penny?\n\nIt is unclear whether the president alone has the authority to stop minting the penny.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nCongress, not the White House, has the power to authorize the manufacture of new coins, The New York Times reports.\n\nThe discrepancy between the face value of a penny and its real cost of manufacturing matters. The value loss to the country is about $85.3 million annually, The Times reports.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on social media, “For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful! ... Let’s rip the waste out of our great nation’s budget, even if it’s a penny at a time.”\n\nKolbe and McCain pushed the idea decades ago\n\nArizona U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe had the same idea some 35 years ago when he introduced the Price Rounding Act of 1989 that would have — among other things — eliminated the penny in cash transactions and required rounding of prices to the nearest five cents.\n\nThat bill did not pass, and a number a bills were unsuccessfully introduced over the years to try to do the same.\n\nOne of those efforts was led by then U.S. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., who reintroduced the Currency Optimization Innovation and National Savings (COINS) Act in 2017.\n\nIt would have ended the production of pennies for 10 years, at which time the Government Accountability Office would have studied the effect and decided whether to end or maintain the suspension. The bill never made it into law.\n\nTrump now asserts that he has the authority to remove the penny from circulation.\n\nIronically, they were once Trump adversaries\n\nThat’s a surprising turn in history, given that Jim Kolbe left the Republican Party because of Trump and the spell he held over the GOP.\n\nIn September 2018, Kolbe quietly changed his party registration to independent, The Arizona Republic reported.\n\n“I feel very strongly about the breaking of norms that is happening,” he said in 2020. “It isn’t just the political environment. We have a social environment — in part because of social media — where we are much more polarized and where civil discourse is poor.\n\n“Trump certainly contributes to it. He runs his presidency by tweets. My view is you can’t have a serious policy discussion in 140 characters.”\n\nJohn McCain had powerful disagreements with Trump, who once berated his military service in Vietnam. In one of his final political acts, McCain blew up Trump’s Obamacare reform with a famous thumbs down on the floor of the Senate.\n\nJust before his death, McCain’s friends said he did not want Trump attending his funeral, NBC News reported at the time.\n\nWill ending the penny actually save money?\n\nNow, a disc of copper-plated zinc has made the three strange bedfellows by virtue of the fact that the penny is almost obsolete.\n\nMany Americans have stopped using the coin, and some throw them away when they find them in their pockets.\n\nAmazingly, more than half of all coins produced annually by the U.S. Mint are pennies, The Times reports, amounting to three billion new one-cent pieces annually.\n\nPennies used to be all copper, but as the demand for copper rose, so did the price. Now, pennies are made of copper-plated zinc.\n\nAnother question that abolishing the penny poses is whether it will actually save money. Without the penny, the nickel becomes the smallest U.S. denomination and means of making change. That means it will be in greater demand, and we’ll have to produce more.\n\nThe unit cost per nickel is 13.7 cents, the U.S. Mint reports.\n\nMcCain and Kolbe can no longer tell us what they make of all this and the fact that Trump is championing their issue.\n\nBut wouldn’t you give a penny for their thoughts?\n\nPhil Boas is an editorial columnist.

This is so wasteful!” Trump wrote. “I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.” (It actually costs the US Mint 3.69 cents to make a penny, according to its 2024 Annual Report.)\n\nWhat could happen if the penny were eliminated?\n\nExpect prices to be rounded. A 1989 bill, HR 3761, \"to provide for removing one-cent pieces from cash transactions,\" called for cash transactions, including sales tax, that ended in 1, 2, 6 or 7 to be rounded down to the nearest five cents, those ending in 3, 4, 8 or 9 to be rounded up.\n\nWhile payments by debit and credit cards are increasing, cash still is a viable means of payment, according to the Federal Reserve's 2024 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice: \"More than 90% of consumers intend to use cash as either a means of payment or store of value in the future.\"\n\nLow-income consumers would be most affected by the rounding of prices \"because they are more likely to be unbanked and reliant on cash for transactions,\" writes Tim Sablik in the fourth quarter 2020 Econ Focus, the economics magazine of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.\n\nOn the other hand, Sablik cites research which notes that merchants that often deal in cash choose convenient prices — say charging $3.25 instead of $3.27 — which not only require fewer coins, but reduce the time it takes to complete a purchase.\n\nA penny for their thoughts: Americans say ‘time to move on’ from the coin\n\nThe next coin up from the penny is the nickel. It costs 13.78 cents to make a nickel, also according to the Mint's 2024 Annual Report. Could the nickel be next on the chopping block? Could we see 2 and 3 cent pieces be reissued? Or more likely, could the nickel see a change in composition, as the penny did in 1982, when it went from mostly copper to mostly zinc? When that happened, the price of the former rose so high that the melt value was greater than the face value.\n\nAccording to Sablik, \"both the House and Senate introduced bipartisan bills in 2020 to authorize the U.S. Mint to alter the composition of circulating coins to reduce the cost of manufacturing them, though neither bill has passed yet.\"\n\nWhat can you do with a penny, anyway?\n\nGather 15 of them and at one point, you could be mayor of New York City.\n\nMore correctly, since 1898 the New York City charter requires anyone who has been elected, appointed or hired by the City of New York, including the mayor-elect, to pay to the City Clerk an oath of office form filing fee.\n\nRequired by law since 1898, that fee for over a century had been 15 cents. When Rudy Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2001 took the oath of office, they each paid the 15 cent fee in pennies. (The fee has since gone up to $9.)\n\nWhile you can't use a penny as an emergency fuse, you can use it to check how good your tires are. Goodyear Auto Service says to insert a penny, Lincoln's head upside down and facing you, into the tire's tread groove. \"If you can see all of Lincoln's head, your tread depth is less than 2/32 inch and it's time to replace your tires,\" Goodyear states on its website.\n\nThe Farmers Bank also has these uses for a penny:\n\nTurning screws: \"It only works on slot-headed screws but it can get you out of a jam.\"\n\nKeeping cut flowers fresh longer: A pre-1982 (copper) penny acts as a natural fungicide. Add the coin and a cube of sugar to a vase of flowers.\n\nStraightening curtains: If they're lightweight, make an opening in the hem and slide pennies in, which act as weights.\n\nSimilarly, stabilizing wobbly chairs and tables: Glue pennies to the bottom of the leg as necessary instead of using a piece of paper (and add some felt to the coin if worried about scratching up the floor).\n\nSpacing tiles: Instead of buying tile spacers, pennies \"give you the width you are looking for and you can clean them off to reuse for other things later.\"\n\nMaking a cold pack: An old sock, filled with pennies and placed in the freezer will form around the area needing a cold pack, the bank says, adding that the coins stay cold for a long time and can be reused.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/stark-county/2025/02/10/trump-stop-minting-pennies-penny-production-cost-treasury/78387242007/", "title": "Trump wants to stop penny production, could they soon be obsolete?", "text": "Better count your pennies.

In Canada, the problem was solved by adjusting a price to the nearest five-cent interval when pennies were not available for cash transactions.\n\n\"In Canada, if there's any pennies involved, what the merchants (would) do (is) they just round it,\" he said, \"which isn't the best way of doing it, but they've been doing it for 12, 13 years now.\"\n\nPetros said stopping penny production could be done, but issues could arise for consumers without proper legislation, as pennies are often required for cash payments due to the current tax structure.\n\n\"Once they stop the production, somebody's got to go further and initiate a bill so we can fix the problem for the sales tax,\" he said. \"Otherwise, you're going to end up having a shortage real quick of pennies.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how the penny's possible removal would change sales tax regulations, but Petros said without a plan to restructure taxes to avoid the need for a penny, consumers could run into issues with paying in cash.\n\n\"I think by (trying) to eliminate the penny without a game plan, it's going to create some difficulties in keeping the tax rolling properly,\" he said. \"If I had a merchant right now, and they pay cash, and it's $1.07, and there's no pennies available, where are they going to get the other pennies?\"\n\nCould the U.S. penny become obsolete?\n\nPetros said if pennies were removed from circulation, there may not be much change to the value of the coins from a collector's perspective.\n\n\"You're always going to have a numismatic value of the more rare items, whether that's pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, halves, dollars, gold pieces, whatever,\" he said. \"There's always going to be more value for the rare items.\"\n\nIf proper adjustments are made to sales tax to supplement the removal of pennies, Petros said, the same would be possible on a larger scale.\n\n\"They're pushing to get rid of the currency, the dollar and everything else, but they're getting a lot of pushbacks on that,\" he said. \"If everything is adjusted to accommodate the proper sales tax, then most of your items, your pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters wouldn't be needed.\"\n\nIncludes reporting by USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/02/10/super-bowl-eages-chiefs-taylor-swift-trump-kendrick-lamar-tariff-winter-weather-plane-crash/78381110007/", "title": "Daily Briefing: Eagles soar, Chiefs choke", "text": "The Philadelphia Eagles demolished the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 59.

The fashion show made a quasi-return last year with Victoria's Secret's \"The Tour '23,\" a \"reimagined\" event that streamed on Prime Video.\n\nVictoria's Secret received backlash in 2018 after its chief marketing officer, Ed Razek, said the fashion show should not feature transgender models because \"the show is a fantasy.\"\n\n\"If you're asking if we've considered putting a transgender model in the show or looked at putting a plus-size model in the show, we have,\" Razek told Vogue. \"We attempted to do a television special for plus-sizes (in 2000). No one had any interest in it, still don't.\"\n\nRazek subsequently apologized for the \"insensitive\" remarks. \"To be clear, we absolutely would cast a transgender model for the show,\" he said. \"We've had transgender models come to casting ... And like many others, they didn't make it ... But it was never about gender.\"\n\nKate Upton was also among those to slam the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for not being inclusive of women of all different body types.\n\n\"You know what, we're sick of seeing the same body type,\" the model said on \"Watch What Happens Live\" in 2019. \"You have to be body inclusive now. Every woman needs to be represented. Otherwise it's a snoozefest.\"\n\nIn an FAQ page shared on its website Wednesday, Victoria's Secret promised \"updates to reflect our values and brand mission of today\" and said that the new format of the fashion show will be inclusive.\n\n\"Victoria's Secret is focused on celebrating and supporting all women, and that won't change anytime soon,\" the page said. The FAQ also cited \"massive\" demand as the reason the show is returning with a \"new and modern take reflective of who we are today.\"\n\nNo precise date for the 2024 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was announced, but Wednesday's teaser video said it will take place in the fall.\n\nContributing: Morgan Hines, Anika Reed and Sara M Moniuszko, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/life/2025/03/13/30-companies-that-removed-dei-programs-trump/82268705007/", "title": "These 30 companies removed DEI programs.

Several of the companies, such as Target, Amazon and Walmart, have faced boycotts from customers protesting the changes.\n\nWhat is DEI?\n\nDEI policies are organizational frameworks that seek to promote fair treatment of all people, particularly groups that have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination because of their identity or disability. They typically include a mix of training programs, resource networks and recruiting practices.\n\nDEI policies have been around since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed employment discrimination based on race, religion, sex, color or national origin.\n\nDEI program supporters say they help correct past injustices, while opponents argue that hiring should be based entirely on merit.

It’s a type of business called a special servicer of Eastland’s commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS.\n\n“A special servicer deals with defaulted mortgage loans,” said LNR spokeswoman Hayley Cook in an email. “If a loan goes into default, the administration of that loan is transferred to a special servicer.”\n\nA CMBS is a security owned by multiple investors, often through retirement-plan funds.\n\nThe mall will be managed by Texas-based Woodmont Co.\n\n“A lender is a lender first and foremost, not a property owner,” said Woodmont CEO Frederick Meno. “Our goal is to add value to the property, and if that happens, we provide the lender with options they may or may not have at the moment.”\n\nEastland is anchored by Sears, Macy’s and JCPenney. Other tenants include Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works, RadioShack and Champs Sports.\n\nMeno said his team will look for new tenants and evaluate the need for renovations.\n\n“In my opinion, finding an occupant for the fourth big box (retail space) is the key,” Meno said, adding that the mall’s occupancy rate is 95 percent excluding this large empty space. “That empty box fronts Hamilton Road and gives the mall the appearance it’s not doing well, when from an occupancy standpoint it is.”\n\nThis is another sign that while Class A malls such as Polaris Fashion Place and Easton Town Center flourish, Class B and C malls struggle, say the experts.\n\n“The macro picture of the demise of Westland and Northland malls is these B and C malls are feeling the crunch of online shopping,” said Lee Peterson, executive vice president of creative services at WD Partners, a Dublin-based retail consulting company.\n\nGlimcher put Eastland up for sale earlier this year. It said that if a buyer wasn’t found, the mortgage holder would take title to the property and release it from its mortgage instead of foreclosing.\n\nGlimcher officials declined to discuss why they wanted to divest themselves of the mall, but so-so sales could be the reason.\n\nThe company has about 28 malls nationwide, and they averaged $468 in sales per square foot in 2013, according to Glimcher reports. Sales per square foot is a key factor in determining the lease rate a mall’s owner charges.\n\nEastland’s sales rate was $331 per square foot. By comparison, Glimcher’s Polaris Fashion Place averaged $515 in sales per square foot.\n\n“If you have something that is not attractive to customers and you have things in your portfolio working better, you’re better off taking a hit on the things that don’t work and investing in the things that do,” Peterson said.\n\nGlimcher took an $18.5 million impairment loss for Eastland in 2012.\n\nThe mall, which covers nearly a million square feet, was built in 1968 and purchased by Glimcher for $29.7 million in 2003.\n\n“Easton and Polaris are the thousand-pound gorillas in the market,” Meno said. “But Eastland is still here and that speaks to the location. We have a captive audience in the immediate area, and we’re going to sprinkle some magic dust and get it stabilized.”\n\nswartenberg@dispatch.com\n\n@stevewartenberg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/16/federal-workers-trump-musk-firings/78728081007/", "title": "Ex-federal workers say Trump, DOGE firings upended their lives", "text": "The termination notice came just before Valentine's Day, and Elena Moseyko's heart was shattered as she broke down crying in front of her two young children.\n\nShe has bills to pay – a mortgage, preschool tuition, a car payment – and a scared family.\n\n“I feel so angry now at the administration because I traumatized my kids,” she said. \"I wish I would’ve never joined the federal government.”\n\nMoseyko joined the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs last year as a data scientist. She’d been “happily employed” in the private sector for a consulting firm but thought a government job seemed more stable.\n\nInstead, her life was turned upside down last week after President Donald Trump’s administration began instituting mass layoffs as part of an aggressive effort to trim the federal workforce.\n\nHarrison Fields, a special assistant to the president, said in a statement to USA TODAY that Trump \"returned to Washington with a mandate from the American people to bring about unprecedented change in our federal government to uproot waste, fraud, and abuse.\"\n\n\"This isn’t easy to do in a broken system entrenched in bureaucracy and bloat, but it’s a task long overdue,\" he said.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke to federal workers fired from the departments of Education, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and Transportation who said they were shocked, angry and emotionally distraught by the terminations. They were scrambling over the weekend to figure out how to file for unemployment benefits and reviewing their budgets to adjust to a new financial reality.\n\nThey worried about everything from making rent to paying student loans. Many talked about going into government work because they value public service and feeling like those values are being trampled.\n\n\"I'm much more angry than devastated,\" said Chelsea Milburn, a 34-year-old Navy reservist, who lost her job as a public affairs specialist for the Department of Education. \"It took away my hope that I would continue to be respected and valued for my service. And especially in the way the termination happened.\"\n\nFirings target probationary employees\n\nThe ex-employees USA TODAY spoke to said they never received bad performance reviews at work, but their walking papers all included similar language:\n\n\"The agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest,\" multiple federal workers told USA TODAY their termination letter read.\n\nWhich agencies are being impacted? Education Department, USAID, NIH and more\n\n\"It read like a copy-and-paste letter that did not provide any specifics,\" Milburn said. \"It was just very cold and cruel.\"\n\nShe said her teleworking job was a near-perfect situation after her life dramatically changed two years ago, first with a bout with COVID-19 and then being diagnosed with POTS, a disability that makes it hard for her to sit at a desk full-time.\n\nMilburn was one of the nearly 70 employees in the Education Department still within their probationary periods who were let go Wednesday night. Federal employees in probationary status have typically been hired within the past year.\n\nThey are easier to fire because they lack the bargaining rights that career employees have to appeal their terminations. But some who had been in their departments longer than that got caught up, too.\n\nDoug Berry, who worked for U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development, left his former career in real estate for his job at the USDA for more stability, was hired as a loan technician last January. But in July, the 53-year-old chose to take a position as a pathways intern instead, in part because it would give him a better career path after the probationary period, but also because he wanted to pursue an MBA at the same time.\n\nHis probationary period reset, but he couldn't have known at the time what that would mean.\n\nBerry said his termination letter was emailed to him close to 5 p.m. Thursday and was effective at the end of that business day, but his office closes at 4:30 p.m. and he was already gone for the day. He showed up Friday morning to discover his job was gone.\n\n\"I got to donate an hour of my time to clean out my desk and hand off what I was working on to my coworkers,\" he said.\n\nAt least five unions representing government workers have filed suit over the administration’s firing of probationary workers, alleging it breaks the formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.\n\n\"These firings are not about poor performance – there is no evidence these employees were anything but dedicated public servants,\" said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents about 800,000 federal workers.\n\nDOGE aims to slash government spending\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has been tearing through federal agencies, moving to shutter some and drastically cut back others. Nearly the entire federal workforce was offered a buyout. Then the notices began.\n\nThousands of workers have been laid off in recent days, with the terminations focused on newer hires who still have probationary status. The extent of the layoffs is still unclear, but roughly 220,000 federal employees out of 2.3 million had less than one year of experience in their current positions as of March 2024, according to the most recently publicly available data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\n\nTrump showed no signs of yielding despite a deluge of suits.\n\n\"He who saves his country does not violate any law,\" Trump said on Truth Social, his social media app.\n\nBut as Musk’s team scours the federal government, looking to purge scores of employees, the president’s opponents continue to warn about the ramifications, both personal and national.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, a GOP lawmaker who has occasionally opposed Trump in public, said dozens of federal workers from her state were suddenly laid off.\n\n“I share the administration’s goal of reducing the size of the federal government, but this approach is bringing confusion, anxiety, and now trauma to our civil servants – some of whom moved their families and packed up their whole lives to come here,” she said.\n\nThe full ramifications of Trump’s decision, whether in the country’s urban centers or rural enclaves, won’t be fully absorbed for weeks or months. Asked for a total or estimate on how many workers have been let go, for instance, the Office of Personnel Management on Friday declined to provide USA TODAY with answers.\n\nFormer workers worry about the communities they were hired to serve\n\nVictoria Porter, 28, said she found her dream job riding horses into the backcountry to maintain hiking trails for the U.S. Forest Service in Montana. That all went away Friday, when she said eight other people on her 12-person trail team also were fired.\n\nThe terminations will have a big impact the community around the forest where she worked, Porter said. Outdoor outfitters and other local businesses rely on the trails as an economic engine for the region. There’s “no way” the trails can be maintained with a drastically smaller crew, she said.\n\n“They’ll try their best, but it will mean that hikers can’t get through, it will mean that the outfitters can’t get through and their livelihoods depend on taking people out to the backcountry,” Porter said. “So they will suffer. The communities around here will suffer. It’s going to hit the economy really hard because tourism will drop.”\n\nBerry also worried about the impact of the terminations on the low-income, rural communities his work reviewing loans and funding for community projects served.\n\n\"USDA Rural Development helps the towns that voted for Trump every day, and I think there's a disconnect between understanding that these things are necessary in small-town life and realizing that you just voted to get rid of the water project you need,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know where I'm going to end up,\" Berry said, now worried that he would have to disclose being fired for anything else he applies to. \"I've never been terminated for cause in my life, until now.\"\n\nMoseyko joined the VA in June 2024 in a highly skilled position writing machine learning algorithms. She is confident about getting a new job with her skills, but said the sudden pink slip is taking a mental toll and the immediate financial concerns are worrying. She spent Friday figuring out how to file for unemployment.\n\n“Mentally it’s very draining,” she said.\n\nBerry has started the process of fighting the decision. Moseyko believes the termination was illegal.\n\n\"Every one of us who got the exact same form letter without proper process or actual cause have a grievance,\" Berry said.\n\nMeanwhile, Milburn said she now has to find work that will accommodate her medical condition like her federal job did. She is also upset that most Americans who support cutting government jobs aren't really aware of the repercussions of the forceful downsizing that will eventually have a trickle-down effect.\n\n\"When I see people cheering on these broad, sweeping attacks on civil servants as if it’s a good thing, that is incredibly hurtful and infuriating to me,\" Milburn said. \"I feel like I have served my country admirably, and now it has betrayed me.\n\n\"But, I’m not going out without a fight.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/11/27/now-war-christmas-scorecard-naughty-and-nice-retailers/897640001/", "title": "Now for the 'War on Christmas,' a scorecard for 'Naughty' and 'Nice ...", "text": "Just in case you needed a scorecard for the so-called “War on Christmas,” one of the most powerful groups on the American religious right has ranked national retailers as either “naughty” or “nice.”\n\nAimed at helping shoppers “know which companies embrace Christmas and which water it down into a generic holiday,” the American Family Association says it reviewed the websites, media advertising and in-store signage to come up with its “2017 Naughty or Nice List.”\n\nAmong those deemed to make the list of “nice” retailers —meaning those who use the term “Christmas\" on a regular basis — are Menard’s, Michael’s, Walmart and Toys R Us.\n\nAmong those deemed naughty – meaning they use the word “Christmas” sparingly — are Best Buy, Gap, Inc., Nordstrom and Victoria’s Secret. None of those companies responded immediately to requests for comment.\n\nIn the case of Victoria's Secret, the AFA didn't have a problem with the naughty product line. Instead, it was that the naughty products weren't marketed under the banner of \"Christmas.\"\n\nAmong those who were deemed marginal — meaning they refer to “Christmas” infrequently or in select advertising media — were Amazon, Kohl’s, Old Navy and Starbucks.\n\nThe AFA, which has been an ardent opponent of gay rights and supports conservative political causes, says it has seen progress in the 10 years — yes, 10 — that it’s generated its annual list.\n\n“A decade ago, some stores routinely used the word ‘holiday’ to remain politically correct,” AFA president Tim Wildmon said in a statement. “But we know that most Americans want to celebrate Christmas and expect to hear greetings of ‘Merry Christmas’ in their favorite stores.”\n\nThe “War on Christmas,” mostly a subject of chirping on conservative talk radio by hosts and callers, got a boost last year when then-candidate Donald J.

That's followed by Cyber Monday, when 39% of respondents, or 72.3 million people, plan to shop.\n\nThe top reason shoppers are still so dedicated to cashing in on the official shopping holidays is deals that are \"too good to pass up,\" said 57% of people, followed by a love for tradition, according to 28% of respondents.\n\nWith so many millions planning to do the bulk of their shopping over about four days, it begs the question: Is one day better than the other to shop sales? Which shopping holiday comes out on top in the matchup of Black Friday versus Cyber Monday? Here's what to know.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat is Black Friday? When is Black Friday 2024?\n\nBlack Friday happens the day after Thanksgiving, which is Thursday, Nov. 28 this year, meaning the shopping holiday falls on Friday, Nov. 29.\n\nIt is believed to have earned the title \"Black Friday\" in the 1950s when Philadelphia police coined the term to describe the chaos they observed thanks to suburban shoppers flooding the city, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nBy 1961, the name stuck in Philly but didn't go nationwide until the late 1980s, when retailers seized the opportunity to re-frame the day as something more positive, concocting the analogy of stores going from being \"in the red\" (experiencing financial deficit) until the explosion of sales on the day after Thanksgiving, bringing them back into \"the black\" (being profitable).\n\nWhat to know about Black Friday 2024: Where and when to shop sales\n\nWhat is Cyber Monday? When is Cyber Monday 2024?\n\nCyber Monday takes place the first Monday after Thanksgiving. This year, it will fall on Monday, Dec. 2.\n\nIt originated as something of a response or complement to Black Friday, eventually becoming equally lucrative for retailers. The official term was coined by the National Retail Federation in 2005, when the organization noticed an influx in online shopping the Monday after Thanksgiving as people returned to work and used their − at the time − faster internet connections in the office versus at home to start on their holiday lists.\n\nLike with Black Friday, retailers cashed in on this by making it a full-fledged sales event, this time focusing on online shopping and sales.\n\nWhat to know about Cyber Monday 2024: Where and when to shop sales\n\nBlack Friday vs. Cyber Monday: Which is better?\n\nOnce upon a time, Black Friday and Cyber Monday were two distinct events, especially when brick-and-mortar shops and in-store flash sales were more popular.\n\nBetween online shopping becoming the year-round favored method of deal-hunting for many consumers and the now-popular practice among retailers of cashing in by extending the shopping holidays into multi-day events, however, the two have become more or less enmeshed. And, the COVID-19 pandemic likely managed to push some of the last in-store holdouts to the digital space.\n\nThe shopping holidays now often segue straight into each other with no real break, like Amazon's Black Friday Week, which ends Nov. 29 and bleeds directly into its Cyber Monday sale from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2. While the deals are labeled as being part of two different events, they function as one long sale.\n\nIn some cases, the same sales may simply roll over into the \"new\" holiday promotion and be rebranded. In other cases, stores may choose to save certain sale types for one day or the other, so while Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have become more or less the same thing, make sure you pay attention to the official sale dates on those items you really want.\n\nDeals expected to get better through Cyber Monday\n\nThere's a reason Black Friday and Cyber Monday have managed to hold onto their massive sway over consumers: Some deals really are too good to pass up.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Adobe Analytics, for the first 24 days of this season (Nov. 1 to Nov. 24), discounts for electronics peaked at 10.9% (off listed price) but is expected to hit 30% on Cyber Monday.\n\nBlack Friday is set to have the biggest discounts for televisions at 24% vs. a typical sale price of 10.8% off the listed price, whereas Saturday is expected to have the best bargains for computers at 23% (vs. 11.8%).\n\nCyber Monday is also set to have the best deals for apparel at 23% (vs. 10.3%).\n\nAdobe also forecasted that Cyber Week, defined as the 5-day period that includes Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, is expected to drive $40.6 billion in online spending, up 7% from last year. This surge accounts for 16.9% of the overall online holiday shopping.\n\nCyber Monday alone is expected to drive a record $13.2 billion in sales (up 6.1% year-over-year), followed by Black Friday at $10.8 billion (up 9.9%) and Thanksgiving Day itself at $6.1 billion (up 8.7%).\n\nTop Black Friday Deals\n\nWith a rising preference for online shopping, retailers have begun rolling out \"Black Friday\" deals earlier and making them run longer, giving customers more time to cash in. You can already find price cuts at a number of retailers, including Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, Staples, BJ's Wholesale Club and Target. Some of the biggest deals, however, are usually reserved for the day of.\n\nAmazon’s Black Friday Week started on Nov. 21, and will run through Friday, Nov. 29. Deals include up to 55% on select Amazon devices, including Amazon Fire Smart TVs, Kindles, Ring doorbells and Beats headphones. There's also up to 50% on denim for the family from Levi’s and apparel from OROLAY, along with thousands of other deals.\n\nWalmart launched its online early Black Friday deals on Nov. 11, offering up to 70% off everything from cookware and beauty products to toys and clothing.\n\nTop Cyber Monday deals\n\nLike Black Friday, Cyber Monday has expanded its domain past a single day.\n\nThe biggest deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Target and Walmart are often reserved for Cyber Monday itself, but are also often available for at least two days, if not a full \"Cyber Week.\"\n\nAmazon's Cyber Monday event kicks off before the day proper, beginning on Friday, Nov. 29 and running through Monday, Dec. 2. As usual, the sales run the gamut, including up to 50% off on tech including JBL headphones and Eufy security cameras, 55% off Zinus mattresses, 40% on select vacuums Bissell and Tineco and 20% of Stanley drinkware.\n\nTarget's Cyber Monday event usually begins the Sunday after Thanksgiving and extends into Cyber Monday, meaning this year it will likely begin on Sunday, Dec. 1 and last through Monday, Dec. 2. Target's sales include the Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $189.99, the Keurig K-Mini for $59.99, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4k for $24.99 and the Apple Watch SE for as low as $199.99.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links.

In 2021, Joann, still majority-owned by Leonard Green & Partners, went public at an initial $12 a share.\n\nJoann became a private company again in April following its initial bankruptcy filing, so its shares were no longer listed by the Nasdaq or any other national stock exchange.\n\n2024: Joann files for bankruptcy\n\nThe first time Joann filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection was in March 2024.\n\nIn a statement, the Ohio-based retailer said it had secured approximately $132 million in new financing and \"related financial accommodations.\" At the time, it expected to reduce its funded debt by about $500 million, or half of its $1 billion total debt.\n\nAt the time of the filing, the company said no disruptions would be seen to its customers, vendors, landlords and other trade creditors.\n\nScott Sekella, Joann's chief financial officer and co-lead of the interim office of the CEO said at the time that 95% of Joann's stores were cash flow positive.\n\nSekella has since resigned from the company before being announced as the new CFO of Victoria's Secret.\n\nJoann store closures earlier this year\n\nIn early 2025, rumblings of ever-increasing trouble began appearing at Joann as store closures were slated to begin, according to industry and local reports.\n\nIn a statement to Retail Dive in January, Joann’s director of corporate communications Amanda Hayes said the locations were being closed \"as part of routine store location evaluation and optimization\" and were not a major shuttering event. \"We also opened new and remodeled locations in recent months, including new stores in Great Falls, MT and Maplewood, MN,\" she said.\n\nLocal news outlets in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Massachusetts and Delaware reported dates for local store closures ranging from Jan. 12-19. A worker at a Owings Mills, Maryland location said it would close on Jan. 19.\n\nThen, bankruptcy again for Joann\n\nWeeks after the trickle of store closures, Joann announced it would be filing again for bankruptcy.\n\n“The last several years have presented significant and lasting challenges in the retail environment, which, coupled with our current financial position and constrained inventory levels, forced us to take this step,” Prendergast said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, despite the gloomy news for customers and workers, Joann said its stores and website are \"open in the ordinary course and continue to serve customers.\"\n\nJoann closing 500 stores\n\nOn Wednesday, Joann said it would be closing \"approximately 500\" of its about 850 locations in the U.S. In a statement to USA TODAY, the company said it is looking to \"right-size its store footprint.\"\n\n\"This was a very difficult decision to make, given the major impact we know it will have on our Team Members, our customers and all of the communities we serve,\" Joann's statement said. \"A careful analysis of store performance and future strategic fit for the Company determined which stores should remain operating as usual at this time.\"\n\nContributing: Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Emily DeLetter, Jonathan Limehouse\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

She was 73.\n\n“Dame Olivia Newton-John passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends. We ask that everyone please respect the family’s privacy during this very difficult time,” her husband, John Easterling, wrote in a statement on the singer’s verified Instagram account. “Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.”\n\nThe singer revealed in September 2018 that she was treating cancer at the base of her spine. It was her third cancer diagnosis, following bouts with breast cancer in the early ’90s and in 2017.\n\nHer rise to fame\n\nThanks to a string of country and soft-rock hits, Newton-John was already a popular singer by the late 1970s. But her co-starring role opposite John Travolta in 1978’s “Grease,” arguably the most popular movie musical of all time, lifted her to a new level of stardom.\n\nOlivia Newton-John and John Travolta in 1978 in 'Grease.' Paramount Pictures/Fotos International/Getty Images\n\nAlthough she had little acting experience (and turned 29 during filming), Newton-John gave an indelible performance as Sandy, a sweet-natured Australian transfer student who romances Travolta’s alpha greaser Danny at a Southern California high school in the 1950s.\n\nTheir onscreen chemistry as mismatched lovebirds who undergo final-act makeovers to win each others’ hearts – she ditches her frilly dresses for heels, leather, spandex and a cigarette – anchored the movie and inspired repeat viewings by legions of fans.\n\n“I don’t think anyone could have imagined a movie would go on almost 40 years and would still be popular and people would still be talking to me about it all the time and loving it,” Newton-John told CNN in 2017. “It’s just one of those movies. I’m very lucky to have been a part of it. It’s given so many people pleasure.”\n\nNewton-John sang on three of the movie’s biggest hits: the duets “You’re The One That I Want” and “Summer Nights” with Travolta, and her swoony solo ballad, “Hopelessly Devoted To You.”\n\nBorn in Cambridge, England in 1948, Newton-John moved with her family to Melbourne, Australia, when she was five. After winning a talent contest on a TV show, “Sing, Sing, Sing,” as a teen she formed an all-girl group and began appearing on weekly pop music programs in Australia.\n\nNewton-John recorded her first single in England in 1966 and scored a few international hits, but she remained largely unknown to US audiences until 1973, when “Let Me Be There” became a top-10 hit on both the adult contemporary and the country charts.\n\nA series of No. 1 easy-listening hits followed, including “I Honestly Love You,” “Have You Never Been Mellow” and “Please Mr. Please.”\n\nThen came “Grease,” which was 1978’s top-grossing movie and became an enduring cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe movie gave Newton-John an opportunity to change her squeaky-clean image. The cover of her next album, “Totally Hot,” featured the singer in black leather, while its songs had an edgier, more contemporary pop sound.\n\nHer singing success\n\nIn 1981, she took her new, sexier persona a step further with “Physical,” a dance number with such suggestive lyrics as, “There’s nothing left to talk about unless it’s horizontally.” Banned by several radio stations, it became her biggest hit, spending 10 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOlivia Newton-John performing on the BBC TV music show 'Top Of The Pops' in 1974.

The film bombed, but its soundtrack sold well and spawned “Magic,” a No. 1 hit.\n\nIn 1983 she teamed with Travolta again for “Two of a Kind,” a romantic comedy-fantasy, but it failed to recapture their “Grease” spark.\n\nOver a lengthy career Newton-John won four Grammy Awards and sold more than 100 million albums.\n\nOlivia Newton-John waves goodbye in the 1978 movie \"Grease.\" CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images A young Newton-John is seen in front here with her father, Brin; her brother, Hugh; her mother, Irene; and her sister, Rona.

I’ve had country when when I started, then I crossed over into pop,” she told CNN. “I had ‘Xanadu’ and ‘Grease,’ many songs in between. I feel very grateful. I have such a large repertoire to choose from.”\n\nOvercoming tragedy\n\nBut Newton-John also faced her share of troubles and tragedy. Her breast cancer diagnoses forced her to postpone and cancel several tours.\n\nAnd in 2005 Newton-John’s then-boyfriend, Patrick McDermott, disappeared at sea while on a fishing trip off the coast of California. He was never found – an unsolved mystery that haunted the singer for years.\n\n“It’s very hard to live with that,” she told CNN’s Larry King in 2006. “It’s probably the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve been through a lot of things.” Although her career profile dimmed in her later years, Newton-John never stopped recording and performing. Among her highlights were guest appearances on “Glee,” a long-running “Summer Nights” residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas and a dance-club hit, “You Have to Believe,” recorded with daughter Chloe.\n\n“I love to sing, it’s all I know how to do,” she told CNN in 2017. “That’s all I’ve ever done since I was 15, so it’s my life. I feel very grateful that I can still do it and people still come to see me.”", "authors": ["Brandon Griggs"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}]}
